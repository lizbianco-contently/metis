The time until 12:30 p.m. shall be equally \ndivided between the two managers. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very honored to be able to turn to a \nman who has led the fight for the balanced budget amendment ever since \nhe arrived at the Senate, the most senior Senator in the whole U.S. \nSenate, a person all look up to, who has been my mentor on this issue \nand so many others, and one of my dearest friends in this world, the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Strom Thurmond, for \n5 minutes or whatever time he needs.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as we draw to a close the \ndebate on this historic opportunity to adopt Senate Joint Resolution 1, \nthe balanced budget amendment. This debate is about much more than an \namendment to the Constitution, as significant as that is. It is about \ntaking action once and for all that will control the size and scope of \nthe Federal Government.\n  I have been deeply concerned during my years in the Senate over the \ngrowth of the Federal bureaucracy. The first $100 billion budget in the \nhistory of the Nation occurred in 1962. This was almost 180 years after \nthe Nation was founded. Yet, it took only 9 years, from 1962 to 1971, \nfor the Federal budget to reach $200 billion. Then, the Federal budget \ncontinued to skyrocket; $300 billion in 1975, $500 billion in 1979, \n$800 billion in 1983, and the first $1 trillion budget in 1987. The \nbudget for fiscal year 1996 was over $1.5 trillion.\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\n  With this voracious congressional appetite for spending has come \ndeficit spending. In the past three decades, the Federal Government has \nrun deficits in every year except one. During the 1960's, deficits were \naveraging around $6 billion per year. The following decade, the 1970's, \nsaw deficits rise an average $36 billion per year. In the last decade, \nthe 1980's, deficits continued to rise and averaged $156 billion per \nyear. So far, in the 1990's, deficits have averaged $259 billion per \nyear. Compare this to 1957, my third year in the Senate, when the \nentire national debt was less than $275 billion and there was no \ndeficit, but rather a $3 billion surplus.\n  During my service here, there has never been a shortage of \nlegislation creating new Federal programs or of efforts to increase \nspending in existing programs. It has been too easy for the Congress to \npass legislation creating new Federal programs and spending more tax \ndollars whenever there is a call for Federal intervention. This Nation \nhas drifted from its original foundations as a national Government of \nlimited authority. A balanced budget amendment is the single most \nimportant addition we can propose to the Constitution to begin reducing \nthe size and scope of the Federal Government.\n  Mandating balanced Federal budgets is not a new idea. The first \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget was proposed in 1936. \nSince the beginning of the 84th Congress in 1955, constitutional \namendments to require a balanced Federal budget have been proposed \nduring each Congress. Finally, in 1982 while I was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the Senate passed a balanced budget amendment \nwhich I authored. Our victory was short-lived, however, because the \nSpeaker and the majority leader at that time led the movement to kill \nit in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. That was our \nhigh water mark as we fell one vote short in 1986, four votes short in \n1994, and one vote short 2 years ago. Once again, we have a historic \nopportunity to pass the balanced budget amendment and send it to the \nAmerican people for ratification.\n  I would note that today the Congress is working hard to balance the \nFederal budget. However, this is a very recent development brought \nabout by a change in the control of the Congress, and by this body \nfinally listening to the will of the people. We must act to instill \nlegislative accountability that will not waver with the membership of \nthe majority.\n  Our third president, Thomas Jefferson, stated:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, it is time we make that moral obligation to pay our \ndebts a constitutional one. Not only will we restore order to the \nfiscal policy of this Nation, we will be making a giant leap toward \nrestoring the fundamental principle of limited authority to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have been considering this proposed 28th \namendment to the Constitution of the United States since this session \nbegan almost 2 months ago. In fact, we have been engaged in floor \ndebate for nearly 4 weeks. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I \nhave begun to think we live on this floor with this debate.\n  Mr. President, stop and think what we are debating--a proposed 28th \namendment to the Constitution. The Constitution has been amended only \n17 times since the Bill of Rights. During this time, the United States \nhas been through some very, very serious situations--the War of 1812, \nthe Civil War, two world wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Great Depression, \nwestward expansion. One would have to assume during that time, there \nhave been hundreds and hundreds of times that we have seen crises in \nour Nation that, some would say, reached a constitutional magnitude. We \nknow that hundreds, even thousands, of constitutional amendments have \nbeen proposed, but those who have gone before us have seen fit to only \namend the Constitution 17 times--which was very wise--since the Bill of \nRights.\n  I say this because nobody in the Senate owns a seat in the Senate. We \nare only passing through, no matter how long we serve. What we ought to \ndo is remember that we have a responsibility not only to those who went \nbefore us, but those who will come after. So during this debate, some \nof us have tried to look at the substance behind this bumper-sticker \ntitle and even the poll-driven politics that led to this proposal, \nagain occupying the No. 1 position in the majority's legislative \nagenda.\n  We have examined the resolution in our Judiciary Committee hearings, \nmarkup and report and during the Senate debate. We have become, and \ncertainly the American people have become, more and more aware of the \nserious substantial failings in this proposal. I believe this debate \nhas shown any objective observer that this resolution fails to meet the \nstandards set by our founders in article V of the Constitution for its \namendment: It cannot be found necessary by two-thirds of this Senate.\n  Moreover, the proponents have failed to answer the serious questions \nraised about the various provisions over the past several weeks. They \nhave failed the Byrd challenge by being unable to demonstrate what it \nmeans and how it would work. The distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia came on this floor and, in his usual careful manner, his usual \nsense of history, his usual understanding of the Constitution, asked \nthe pertinent questions: How would it work? What does it mean? What \ndoes it do? And no answer was forthcoming. Having now had an \nopportunity to focus on the language of the resolution before us, none \nof us can be confident concerning its meaning or its use.\n  During the course of this debate, we have had the principal \nproponents of the resolution concede that it does not require a \nbalanced budget, but that it is intended to provide incentive to \nbalance the Federal budget and exert pressure on Congress. It is \nintended just to make us do our job. That is not sufficient reason to \namend the Constitution. As the President said in his State of the Union \nMessage, we have but to vote a balanced budget, he has but to sign it \nto have a balanced budget. We do not have to tinker with the \nConstitution in a way that would actually throw the whole matter over \nto the courts, not to the President and the Congress.\n  The President and Congress have shown over the past 4 years that we \ncan make progress undoing the mistakes of the deficit-building decades \nof the 1980's without a proposed amendment to the Constitution. We \nsucceeded in reducing the deficit in each of the last 4 years. We have \ncut the deficit by more than 60 percent. At the same time, we are \npursuing sound economic and fiscal policies doing those things that \nhave made the United States economy the strongest in the world.\n  What we are now asked to do is tinker with obvious success. But more \nthan that, we are asked to give people something they can put on a \nbumper sticker that says, ``I voted to balance the budget,'' when, \nindeed, it does not do that, instead of saying, ``I voted to really \nmess up the Constitution,'' which is what it would do.\n\n  I hope that we will think not only of our political fortunes of this \nday and the political polls of our State of this moment, but think of \nthe United States and think of those who will come after us.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah for the fine job he has done in leading \nthis very important debate, because really this debate is one of the \nmost defining moments of our times. Will Congress deliver a balanced \nbudget? Will we set the future economic stability of our country in \nplace right now? Will we win this fight that we have undertaken on \nbehalf, not of ourselves, but of our future generations?\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n  The American dream has always been that a parent could wish that his \nchildren or her children would have a better quality of life than he or \nshe has had. That is why people came to this country. They wanted to \nwork harder so that they could give their children a little better \nchance in life.\n  What we are fighting for is a change that will assure that we can \nkeep the American dream. We are trying to make lower interest rates, a \nhigher standard of living, more job opportunities, a country liberated \nfrom an ever-increasing debt. Our children will not have a higher \nquality of life if we continue to build on this $5 trillion debt, Mr. \nPresident. This debate is about our children. It is not about political \nexpedience. We know what must be done. Thomas Jefferson told us. Thomas \nJefferson said one of the two things that he was concerned about after \nthe Constitution was written and adopted was that we had not provided \nfor the constraints on Congress that would not allow them to spend more \nthan was in the public Treasury. Jefferson said that. In fact, his \nquotes were:\n\n       Each successive generation ought to be guaranteed against \n     the dissipations and corruptions of those preceding it.\n\n  Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson was the greatest visionary President \nperhaps we have ever had. Even Thomas Jefferson would not have dreamed \nour country, that he worked so hard to put together, would one day have \na $5 trillion debt.\n  Even Jefferson could not have been that visionary, and thank \ngoodness, because so many of his generation fought and died for this \ncountry to be formed. If they had thought that the stewards of our \nfuture would not have the guts, would not have the ability to constrain \ntheir spending to the tune of $5 trillion, I wonder if they would have \nfought so hard.\n  The idea of saddling generation after generation of Americans with a \nsuffocating debt would have been unthinkable to those honorable men.\n  Some say we don't need an amendment. They say we haven't been tuned \nin. I am going to tell you something, I have been tuned in. I have been \nwatching the debate on this floor. I have seen what has happened to \nMedicare reform, to Social Security reform, to welfare reform, to \nMedicaid reform. It has taken a lot to get one of those four--welfare \nreform--and we have failed on the other three. If you think we do not \nneed an amendment to constrain the appetite of Congress to spend other \npeople's money, you have not been tuned in.\n\n  Some say that this is going to tie the hands of Government. \nHallelujah. That is exactly what we want to do. We want to get big \ngovernment out of the hard-working American's pocketbook. Most \nAmericans pay 50 percent of what they earn in taxes of some kind. All \nof us want to pay our fair share. But, Mr. President, 50 percent is too \nmuch. That does not allow the freedom to pursue the American dream. A \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution will cure that appetite \nbecause Congress will be constrained, yes, their hands will be tied, \nfrom getting into the pocketbooks of our children and their children.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the time has come for us to do what is \nright. The greatest issues of our time have taken many years. Americans \ndebated the evil of slavery from the earliest days of the Republic, but \nit was not until 1865 that the 13th amendment to the Constitution was \nratified and slavery was abolished. Women began their fight for \nsuffrage in the early 19th century, but it was 1920 when the 19th \namendment was ratified giving women the right to vote.\n  Like these two epic struggles, the balanced budget amendment has been \nfought for a long time. It is a fight we are waging on behalf of our \nchildren, our grandchildren, and their grandchildren. And we will not \nstop the fight. Each year we lose by a very narrow margin. Last year it \nwas one vote. This year, unless someone looks up and says, ``My gosh, \nwhat am I doing for my children,'' and changes his or her mind, unless \nsomeone does that, we are going to lose again probably by one vote.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will not be dissuaded from \ncontinuing this fight, because it is worthy of the other great issues \nthat have taken so long.\n  It is very important that we look not to the next election, but to \nthe next generation, as we are making our decision today. This \namendment is not the panacea, but what it does is give us the \nopportunity to make sure that there is a stability in our economy for \nevermore, that no Congress of the future will be able to go into a \ndeficit unless there is a war or an emergency, which there is a safety \nvalve of a three-fifths vote that can unbalance the budget. Those are \nthe safety valves, of course, if we are in a war or a dire emergency, \nwe will do the responsible thing.\n  But if we can constrain ourselves in normal times, we will have a \nstable economy. We will have lower mortgage rates, lower car payments \nrates. We will have more jobs, and we will have more expendable money \nby the hard-working people of this country if we will face the fact \nthat we need to tie the hands of a government that is so big, it could \nhave brought together a $5 trillion debt.\n  This vote today, if we win, could be the first step in a very long \njourney, and, by doing this, we would assure that there is a \ndestination to the journey, that there is a shining city on the hill \nthat is America.\n  If we do not have a balanced budget, and the constraints of an \namendment that would assure that we always will, there may not be a \ndestination, there may not be a shining city on the hill that is \nAmerica because future Congresses will be able to add just a little--it \ndoes not seem like so much, but just a little is now $5 trillion, Mr. \nPresident.\n  We do need to tie the hands of future Congresses so there will be \neconomic stability. And, Mr. President, this Congress has the ability \nto take the first step in that long journey to put our country back on \ntrack so that our children will have the same American dream that we \nhave had, which is that they would be able to wish for their children a \nbetter quality of life than they have had because each generation \nexpects to be able to do better. If we have a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution, we will assure that that will happen.\n\n  Mr. President, this debate is defining of our times. And I hope we \nhave the will to do what is right for our children and for theirs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we talk about how many votes there may be \nand we talk about this debate, which, incidentally, has been interfered \nwith in some ways over the weekend, at the same time we talk about evil \nmoney in politics. We have seen some so-called ``independent'' \nexpenditures in running ads on this. They are about as independent as \nabsolutely nothing. I think it is unfortunate that apparently the \nproponents of this constitutional amendment do not feel that they can \nmake their case well enough on the Senate floor. They have to do this.\n  We talk about whether it is one vote or not. Let us talk about votes. \nIn 1993, we started down this road to concerted, consistent deficit \nreduction. We did that without a single Republican vote in either the \nHouse or the Senate for the President's budget. After 12 years of ever-\nlarger deficits, voted for by the Republican Members of Congress, when \nwe finally started cutting the deficit, not a single Republican Member \nvoted to do that.\n  Over the last 4 years, we have succeeded in reducing the deficit by \n63 percent. It went up for 12 years; the national debt went up. We \nstarted bringing the deficit down. When President Clinton took office, \nthe deficit was at its highest point ever--$290 billion. Today, the \ndeficit is at its lowest dollar figure since 1981, $107 billion. In \nfact, it is at the lowest point as a percentage of the economy since \n1974.\n  In his testimony to the committee, Robert Greenstein of the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities notes that over the past 10 years the \ndeficit has actually declined 70 percent as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product--5.1 percent in 1986 to 1.4 percent in 1996. In fact, \nas a percentage of gross domestic product, our deficit is now at the \nlowest level of any major industrialized nation in the world. The \ndeficit is at the lowest level of any industrialized nation in the \nworld. We are the envy of the rest of the world. But it has taken\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\nsome political courage to do that. And the budgets are starting to \nbring that deficit down.\n  I say to my good friends in the Republican Party, it was done without \na single vote from their side of the aisle, notwithstanding those \ndeficits grew up over 12 years of Republican administrations.\n  The record of deficit reduction is an accomplishment of the Clinton \nadministration. It is an accomplishment that the Clinton \nadministration's policies have restored fiscal sanity and have kept the \neconomy strong. The result of the recent election is testimony that the \nAmerican people recognize these facts. In fact, were it not for the \ninterest on the $2.462 trillion debt that was rung up during President \nReagan's term and President Bush's term, our budgets over the last \nseveral years would already have been in balance. Just think of that. \nThey ran up a debt of $2.462 trillion. The rest of the budget, \nincluding entitlements, is already balanced. We didn't need a \nconstitutional amendment to do that. All we needed was courage. If we \nwere not paying the interest on that debt run up, we would be totally \nin balance.\n\n  This deficit progress has been achieved through tough votes over the \nlast 4 years. But we have seen its impact on our growing economy with \nlower interest rates. In 1980, the annual interest on the national debt \naccumulated over our entire history was $75 billion. Think about this. \nIn 1980, when President Reagan came to office, it took a whole national \ndebt to accumulate over 200 years, and the interest was $75 billion. \nYet, when 12 years of Republican administrations ended, that amount had \nskyrocketed. So the interest on the national debt is now $248 billion.\n  We had failed fiscal economic policies of the last decade, and we are \npaying the price. These interest payments on the national debt remain \ntoo high, and they have to be reduced further. But the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, were it to pass, only allows Members of \nCongress who don't want to step up and cast the tough votes to bring \ndown the deficit to say when the Constitution is going to do it. We can \ndelay congressional action. Eventually we will toss it into the courts \nand let them do it.\n  Frankly, I wish Congress and the President would, instead of talking \nabout a debate here that will go nowhere, sit down and do the tough \nthings that are necessary to bring the budget under control.\n  Mr. President, I notice that the other side now has another speaker. \nI reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. THOMAS. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for the time, \nbut more particularly for the effort and the leadership he has given to \nthis issue. Interestingly enough, it is one of the toughest issues. One \nwould think moving to a balanced budget, ensuring a balanced budget, \nensuring financial responsibility would not be such a tough issue. But \nthis has been going on for a very long time. So I appreciate very much \nthe job that has been done. We come to the vote on the issue finally. \nWe have talked quite a little about it this year. We, of course, have \ntalked for a number of years before.\n  We can talk about a balanced budget if you choose, but what we are \nreally talking about is financial responsibility. It is interesting to \nme to hear those who oppose it--and for good reason--who have been here \nfor 20 years and say, ``Let's just do it, take the tough votes.'' But \nthey haven't done it for 20 years. The monument in front of the \nleader's desk represents 28 years of unbalanced budgets. Yet, we hear \nall the time, just do it, take the tough votes and do it. Well, the \nevidence is that isn't what is done.\n  We hear the same words every year: ``I am for a balanced budget, but \n* * *'' and then they go on to say why it can't be done. They go on to \nfind reasons for not voting for the kind of discipline that it clearly \ntakes to balance the budget. That is not a brand new idea. It is \nsomething we do in most of our States. We do it in my State of Wyoming, \nand we are proud of that. The legislature doesn't spend any more, under \nthe constitution, than they take in.\n  I am always interested in how we seek to shift this to some kind of a \npartisan thing and talk about the Presidents. Frankly, the Presidents \ndon't decide the budget. That is specifically, under the Constitution, \nthe prerogative and the role of the Congress. It starts in the House of \nRepresentatives. Spending--the President cannot do any spending without \nthe Congress. So we say, oh, Reagan did this, and Bush did that, and \nBill Clinton did this. I think we ought to get real with ourselves and \nsay, wait a minute, it is the Congress that does the spending. But we \nhear the same thing. Then Senators go home and talk about balancing the \nbudget, but then come and say, ``But, gosh, there is this little thing, \nand I cannot accept it in this present form.'' How many times have we \nheard that?\n  Well, today, we have a chance to vote. I am very proud of the fact \nthat there will be 55 Republicans and 11 Democrats voting aye, voting \nfor fiscal responsibility, voting to say $5.5 trillion debt is more \nthan we want to send off to our kids and grandkids. Other than defense, \ninterest is the largest item in the budget--interest on the debt. We \npay $270 billion in interest on the debt.\n  So the real issues here, it seems to me, are broader than the details \nof the amendment. They are broader than whether we are going to balance \nthe budget. They really have to do with your view of how large and \ninclusive the central Government is going to be. There is a very real \nrelationship between the size of spending, the size of the deficit, and \nthe size of Government.\n\n  When I go home--and I think it is true of every other place--I hear \nthat we have too much Federal Government. Every night on TV, we see all \nthese things that are being spent. Nearly everyone believes that. Yet, \nspending continues to go up. The Senator talked about the great amount \nof courage it took to move, in 1993, to seek to balance the budget. \nHow? The largest tax increase in the history of the world. So you see \nGovernment grow as that tax increase grows. So the real basic issue is \nmore than just the amendment, more than just arithmetic, more than just \nthe budget, it is how much Federal Government do you want in your lives \nand what are the proper roles of State and Federal Government and the \nprivate sector? Those are the real issues. So it divides pretty clearly \nbetween those who want more Government and want to spend more and \nwhether or not people ought to be able to keep their own money. After \nall, the Government has no money except what it takes from us.\n  So we hear constantly, ``Let's just do it.'' But the monument stays \nright in front of us. We haven't done it. Then we hear, ``Well, but we \nare going to do it now.'' But the President's budget has not moved \ntoward balance. The President promised us a balanced budget, and it is \nnot a balanced budget. No one would agree it is a balanced budget by \n2002. On the contrary, there will probably be a $50 billion to $70 \nbillion more deficit then. It will go up from where it is now.\n  Furthermore, we don't have the kinds of things we would like to have \nthat are targeted to needed tax relief for families. We need permanent \ntax relief that is not triggered. We need capital gains to encourage \nthe economy. Instead of that, we have a budget presented--and we are to \naccept that as movement toward a balanced budget, by having a 75-\npercent backload; temporary tax cuts of $98 billion, but tax increases \nof $76 billion? Taxes go up the first year, and the tax cuts are not \nphased in until later. More entitlement spending, more Government--$60 \nbillion in new entitlement spending.\n  Is that called balancing the budget? It is, if you want to continue \nraising taxes. That is the real choice you and I have as voters and \ntaxpayers. If you want more services, you have to pay more. That is the \nway that works. You know the best example of a really good government, \nI suppose, is on the local level when the school board says we need a \nnew science room for the high school and it is going to cost you $50 a \nyear and you get to vote on it and you balance it. You say, is it worth \nit, yes; is it worth it, no. Do we get to do that in the Federal \nGovernment? Oh, no, of course not.\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\n  So what we are talking about here is really direction, whether we \nhave less Government or whether we, on the central level, move more \nGovernment to States and local communities, whether we in fact are able \nto spend more money for our families as we choose or whether we spend \nmore total tax--now the average family in the country spends 39 \npercent--on our income. I saw a poll the other day in which almost \nunanimously they said 25 percent is the maximum that we ought to pay. \nWe are paying nearly 40.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this is our opportunity. This is our chance to put \nour money where our mouth is. If we are going to balance the budget, \nthis is the way to do it. The evidence is that we can't do it any other \nway.\n  So I hope we have our vote this afternoon and it passes. If it \ndoesn't, it is not the end. We will continue to do this. We will have \nto. It is the only way that we can be financially and fiscally \nresponsible for the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I listened to the debate on the floor of \nthe Senate, I heard that the budget deficits begin in Congress and not \nwith the President. Let's look at the facts. During the Reagan years \nPresident Reagan got 99.999 percent of everything he asked for in the \nbudget, including the deficit. In fact, during those years President \nReagan vetoed only one appropriations bill. Only one spending bill did \nPresident Reagan veto. Why? Because it didn't spend as much money as he \nhad requested. Congress actually had come back with less money than he \nrequested. So he vetoed the bill and asked for more money.\n  So let's just fully understand what happened. It was the same way \nwith the Bush administration. The budget was what the President asked \nfor. But let's assume that it begins here in the Congress. Then, I ask \nmy friends in the Republican majority, where is your budget? You can't \nhave it both ways. You can't say that the budget deficits are the fault \nof the Congress and those who lead the Congress. Republicans lead the \nCongress. Where is the budget?\n  Instead of spending weeks and weeks and weeks on the floor debating \nhow we might amend the Constitution--it has been amended only 17 times \nsince the Bill of Rights--instead of debating why we would amend the \nConstitution with an amendment that even its proponents can't explain \nits consequences, trying to amend the Constitution just because \nsomebody is taking a poll and says that is popular without going into \nthe details of what is involved, instead of spending all of the time \ndoing that, why not actually negotiate the details of the historic \nagreement of trying to balance the budget? Why aren't we doing that? \nBecause it is easier to pass a constitutional amendment which is so \nflawed that even its proponents cannot say what it does to Social \nSecurity, what it does to a capital budget, what it does to a court \nchallenge, what it does to the power of purse. It is easier to do that \nthan to sit down and say, let's talk about the tough votes, let's talk \nabout what we do with school lunch, let's talk about what we do with \nthe defense budget, let's talk about what we do with Medicare, let's \ntalk about what we do with Medicaid, let's talk about what we do with a \nfarm program, or a foreign program, and on and on and on.\n  That means that every time you come up to vote, you are going to \nanger somebody; you are going to anger a special interest group on the \nright, or you are going to anger a special interest group on the left.\n  So it is a lot easier to say, let's just toss it over to the courts, \nlet's toss it over to a constitutional amendment, let's toss it to \nsomething that we can't even explain. We can't even say what it does to \nSocial Security or to a capital budget or anything else. But we can go \nhome with a slogan that has been tested by the polls and by focus \ngroups. We can say, ``I voted to balance the budget.'' Boloney. It is \nsort of like me voting to grow hair. It might make me feel good, but \n``it ain't gonna work.'' It is the same thing here.\n  In light of all we have experienced, but also what we have \naccomplished in the last 4 years in bringing the deficit down in each \nof those 4 years, there is no basis today for seriously contending that \na constitutional amendment is needed or that it is a necessary \nsubstitute for political will or even that it is the only way to \nachieve a balanced budget. We have shown in 4 years of bringing down \nthe deficit--and now going into a fifth--that there are other ways.\n  During the course of time that has been reserved for debate on this \nproposed constitutional amendment, there has been a good deal of talk \nabout the President's proposed budget. The President made a State of \nthe Union Address on February 4. He submitted his statement on his \nproposed balanced budget the following day. Then on the next day, \nFebruary 6, the President sent his proposed budget to Congress. My good \nfriends in the Republican Party have been quick to criticize that \nproposed budget, but they left out one thing in their criticism. They \nnever said where their budget is or what their budget does. I ask my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, Where is your budget? If you \nwant to say that the budgets really come from the Congress, you are in \nthe majority. You run the Congress. You turn the lights on in the \nmorning. You turn them off at night. In between, prepare a budget. \nWhere is the alternative? Where are the proposed amendments to the \nPresident's plan?\n\n  I hope that we do not get into partisan harping and carping and, \ninstead, get on to the process of developing a bipartisan consensus. It \nis not going to be easy, Mr. President. Like so many other Members who \nhave voted to bring the deficit down 4 years in a row, I bear the scars \nof saying no to every special interest group from the right to the left \nwhen I voted for cut after cut after cut--the farm bill being one good \nexample of that, the Lugar-Leahy farm bill. Item after item, we have \ndone it not by gimmicks but by solid votes. But it has been a month now \nand we have not seen a proposal for modification of the President's \nbudget nor have we seen an alternative for the majority party. The \nPresident even came to Capitol Hill to meet with congressional leaders, \ngoing the extra mile--going the extra 2 or 3 miles.\n  We are fast approaching our statutorily imposed deadline of April 15 \nfor a budget resolution. So let's see what this budget resolution is \ngoing to be, and let's debate it. Let's proceed to debate the budget \nand, in the words of Secretary Rubin, ``finish the job of balancing the \nbudget by the year 2002.'' It has been 4 years of bringing the deficit \ndown, and we are about go into the fifth year of bringing it down. \nLet's get a budget that does the job.\n  What it means is that the Republicans and the Democrats are going to \nhave to hold hands, and we are going to have to vote in a way that is \ngoing to offend some of our core constituencies. But the American \npeople in the long run will be better off. Certainly the American \npeople would be better off and the world's strongest economy would be \nbetter off without tinkering with the Constitution, which basically \nbecomes a judicial nightmare and does nothing to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted to have the relationship \nwith our cosponsor on this amendment on the Democrat side, Senator \nBryan from Nevada. He has fought a valiant battle here, and I \nappreciate the opportunity of working with him on this. We are still \nhoping that this vote will turn out all right at the end of the day.\n  So I am more than delighted to yield 15 minutes to my distinguished \nfriend and colleague. I thank him for his leadership on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah for his thoughtful comments.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, by way of prefacing my comments, that \nI have enjoyed being a participant in this debate. And I have enjoyed \nthe manner in which my colleague, the distinguished Democratic floor \nleader--who has a very different point of view from that which Senator \nHatch and I share--has conducted himself and the arguments that he has \nmade and the responses by the senior Senator from Utah. It seems to me \nthat that is what this institution is all about--the ability to conduct \nan honest debate on the\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nfloor with different points of view being expressed. Hopefully from \nthat collision of different points of view will emerge a public policy \nwhich will enable this country to move forward on the correct course.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate will soon cast a historic vote to decide \nwhether Senate Joint Resolution 1 should become a part of our \nConstitution. This may very well be the most significant vote the \nSenate will cast in this session of the Congress. If we are successful, \nit could dramatically alter the future of our country in a very \npositive way. I renew my request and urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of a balanced budget amendment for the sake of future \ngenerations.\n  The Senate has been debating Senate Joint Resolution 1 for an entire \nmonth, and just as it should when we are considering an amendment to \nour Constitution, the debate has been thoughtful and thorough. We have \ndebated serious and credible amendments on a wide range of topics \nincluding the treatment of Social Security and capital budgeting. The \nSenate debated these issues and after debate decided to leave Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 intact and rejected each of those proffered \namendments. I supported several of the amendments, but it is now time \nto put the debate on those amendments behind us and pass the amendment. \nWhile some of us may have felt that the amendment could be improved \nwith certain change, all of us must realize that we are better off with \nthis amendment than with the status quo.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the two of my colleagues \nwho have spent more time in the Chamber debating this than any of us, \nand that would be the senior Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], and the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd]. These men have served in \nthis institution with distinction for a combined 60 years. During this \npast month, each of them has treated us to his own brand of eloquence \nin espousing his point of view. It has been a delight for those of us \nwho are privileged to serve in this institution to hear and to share in \nthat debate. No one who has observed the floor proceedings can question \nthe depth of their sincerity about their feelings. It is a tribute to \nthe democratic process to see this kind of debate occur in this \nChamber.\n  Mr. President, amending our Constitution is the most significant \naction the Senate can take, and it should not be undertaken lightly. In \nthis case I believe the future of our country is at stake--the ability \nof our children and our children's children to have the same economic \nchoices in their time that our generation has enjoyed.\n  We are constantly reminded that everyone is for a balanced Federal \nbudget but not everyone is for a constitutional amendment which puts \nthat process in place and helps us to achieve that goal. On its face, \nthis position appears to me to be inconsistent. If you are for a \nbalanced budget, it would seem the more logical course of action would \nbe to support a mechanism that would help to facilitate the outcome. I \nbelieve the amendment accomplishes that purpose. The amendment itself \nis very straightforward. Congress may not let spending exceed revenues \nin a given year unless a 60-percent supermajority of those elected both \nin the House and the Senate vote to permit a specific amount of deficit \nspending. While this does not guarantee balanced budgets, it will, in \nmy judgment, make it more difficult to authorize deficit spending if \nthis process, a constitutional amendment, is in place.\n  My experience as Governor of Nevada convinces me of the merits of \nthis process. With a State constitution that requires a balanced \nbudget, those of us who were privileged to serve as the chief executive \nof our States were forced to make hard choices in spending and on \nrevenues, particularly during the period of economic slowdown during \nthe 1980's. The year that I assumed the Governorship of Nevada, January \n1983, we were concerned that the State payroll would not clear because \nbudget revenues had fallen far short of their original and earlier \nprojections. Yet, with that hammer of a constitutional amendment in \nplace in our own State, it would have been much more difficult, much \nmore difficult to have ignored the constitutional mandate to balance \nthe budget. Therefore, both the Governor and the State legislature were \nable to resist the pressure of those good people in our State urging \nspending for programs that many of us were for.\n  The point I think, Mr. President, is the hard choice. It is the \nnature of those who are advocates for these programs, good people all, \nto urge more spending than they know a Governor at the State level or \nthe legislature at the State level can approve, and it becomes the \nresponsibility of those of us who have served at the State level as \nGovernors to submit a balanced budget and for State legislatures to \nrequire a balanced budget.\n  We did not have the luxury of avoiding the painful cuts by running \ndeficits. That would have been the easy way out and, unfortunately, the \nway the Federal Government has chosen to proceed in 59 of the last 67 \nyears.\n  My experience as a Senator has also taught me how difficult those \nbudget choices can be. The process is essentially the same, with a much \ngreater magnitude, and while we have made impressive progress in \nreducing the deficit over the last 4 years--$107 billion in the last \nfiscal year, projected at one time to be $292 billion--the President \nand Congress can justifiably take pride in what they have accomplished, \nbut balancing the budget by the year 2002 will require sustained \ndiscipline, the kind of discipline that has not characterized our \nactions either from the White House or from the Congress. If we are \nsuccessful, we will have accomplished something that has occurred only \nonce in the last 33 years.\n\n  After 2002, the deficit picture gets worse, and gets dramatically \nworse, when the baby-boom generation, a tidal wave, begins to impact \nthe programs that we have put in place for the elderly in America. \nWithout the balanced budget amendment, the temptation will always be \nthere, the temptation to avoid making the hard choices.\n  History shows us all too well that at the Federal level both the \nWhite House and the Congress, without reference to partisan \naffiliation, has tended to take the easy road. It is true that Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 does not guarantee that we will not take the easy \nroad, but I submit it would make it much harder to do so.\n  Many of my colleagues who have indicated they plan to vote against \nSenate Joint Resolution 1 have stated their concerns over not excluding \nSocial Security from the budget calculations. While I agree that \nexcluding Social Security would be in our long-term best interests, I \nbelieve they are mistaken if they believe that Social Security will be \nbetter off without the balanced budget. I believe our best option would \nbe to exclude Social Security from a balanced budget amendment, and I \nhave so voted. But our next best option is enacting the balanced budget \namendment as it appears in the Chamber today and as we will vote on it \nthis afternoon. Our worst option is to preserve or to retain the status \nquo, and that is to do nothing, to reject this proposed balanced budget \namendment.\n  No one disputes that a balanced budget amendment will help end our \nstring of deficits. Some will argue that we do not need it to achieve \nour goal, but no one says it will not help. And while the amendment \ndoes not mandate a balanced budget, it does, in my opinion, make it \nmore likely. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to conclude that a \nbalanced budget amendment will lead to less deficit spending than if we \nfail to enact the balanced budget amendment.\n  If a balanced budget amendment will help cut deficit spending, what \nwill the effects of less deficit spending be on programs that we all \nsupport, like Social Security? Every dollar of deficit spending that \noccurs now is a dollar that will not be available to pay Social \nSecurity retirees when they need it. And even worse, we lose not only \nthat dollar but we lose the interest that we pay on it, which \nmultiplies rapidly with the magic of compounding.\n  The best example of this can be illustrated by looking at where we \nwere in 1980. If we had adopted a balanced budget amendment in 1980, 17 \nyears ago, and had not increased the national debt from about $1 \ntrillion to more than $5 trillion today, we would not have to cut a \nsingle dollar from this year's budget to achieve balance. In other \nwords, we would be in surplus if we did not have to make the interest \npayments on the deficits that were run up over the last 20 years.\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\n  I do not want Senators years from now to say, ``Gee, if they had only \nadopted a balanced budget amendment in 1997, we would not have added \ntrillions more to our national debt. We would not have added billions \nmore in interest payments in servicing that debt. We would not have to \nbe cutting the worthwhile spending programs because of the larger \nnational debt.''\n  Mr. President, the trend line is both alarming and disturbing. Since \n1980, the percentage of our budget dedicated to servicing the debt has \nrisen from 7 to 15 percent. This year's budget contains a line item of \n$245 billion for interest payment on the national debt. That is the net \ninterest payment. In other words, almost $1 out of every $6 in our \nbudget goes to servicing the $5.3 trillion national debt.\n  Worse than that, if the interest we earn from Social Security and \nother trust funds which is supposed to be saved to be paid out in \nfuture years is excluded, the gross interest we owe is really $350 \nbillion.\n  No one claims running a Federal budget deficit actually helps Social \nSecurity or other Federal program over the long haul. Congressman Joe \nKennedy who is an undisputed champion of social programs to help the \npoor makes this point very eloquently. He maintains that deficit \nspending has not helped, but has hurt, spending for social programs.\n  Every dollar that must go to servicing the national debt is a dollar \nthat cannot go to school lunch programs, paving roads, or repairing our \nneglected national parks. Interest payments are now the second largest \nFederal spending item following Social Security in our budget.\n  I must ask my colleagues who support taking Social Security out of \nthe balanced budget amendment, as I do, whether their interests are not \nbetter served by a constitutional amendment that helps facilitate a \nbalanced budget.\n  This is now my 9th year in the Senate. I do not recall a single \nSenator getting up and offering a budget that excluded Social Security \nfrom the budget calculations. For those who profess to feel so strongly \nabout Social Security that they cannot vote for a balanced budget \namendment, why have they never attempted to exclude Social Security \nfrom past budgets?\n  While it is wrong to use Social Security to mask the true size of the \ndeficit, including Social Security, that is no reason to vote against a \nbalanced budget amendment, in my view.\n  The greatest threat to Social Security is the debt. There are real \nand tangible benefits for every American family if we balance the \nFederal budget.\n  Interest rates are estimated to be 2 percent higher because of the \ndeficit. The average price of a new home is $37,000 more because we \ncan't balance the budget. A student loan is estimated to be almost \n$2,000 more expensive and a new car $1,000 more expensive because we \nhaven't balanced the budget.\n  Under current trends, a child born today will have to pay $180,000 \nover their lifetime to service the national debt. What kind of burden \nare we passing on to future generations?\n  Given the overwhelming benefits of a balanced Federal budget, I \nstrongly believe this country needs a balanced budget amendment to help \nus achieve this goal. Yes, there are some risks that a minority of our \nlegislators will act irresponsibly--but that can happen today if 41 \nSenators choose to filibuster. Therefore, I believe we gain the \nbenefits of greater pressure to achieve a balanced budget without \nincurring additional risks.\n  We have a historic opportunity this afternoon to change the future \ncourse of our country in a very positive way. If we fail, I am afraid \nwe will look back 20 years from now and be even further in debt, with \nfewer economic choices for that generation, and regret that we had not \ntaken this important step today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 1. \nThis vote will be your legacy to your children and to our country's \nfuture economic well-being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, and certainly for his kind remarks regarding me. I take \nthose as a special feeling of friendship and love for the work he has \ndone and the kindness he has shown to me. I want to personally express \nmy appreciation for how hard he has worked on this amendment, how much \nit has meant to me and others on this side--very much--and, I think, to \nhis colleagues who are voting with him on his side. I just want to \npersonally express my gratitude to him for the good work he has done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also have great affection and respect for \nthe Senator from Nevada. I know to err is human and to forgive divine. \nWhile I make no claims of divinity, I forgive him for his position on \nthis.\n  I also point out both the distinguished Senator from Nevada and the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah are two of the hardest working Members \nof this body. In their debate, they have been strong and forthright, as \nhas the distinguished Presiding Officer, who made his first speech on \nthe Senate floor on this issue. I noted at that time, so many times \nwhen one gives his or her first speech on the floor it is on an \ninconsequential item. This time, it was one of the most important items \nthat the distinguished Presiding Officer will have a chance to debate \nduring his tenure in this body.\n  I say this because I think during the past weeks of debate, all of \nus, Republicans and Democrats, have tried to fulfill our responsibility \nas one of the two Houses of Congress to create a full and fair record. \nSometimes it may have seemed tiring, for the distinguished Senator from \nUtah and myself, as floor managers, to be here. But the more we have \nlistened, the more we have realized that this is one of those issues \nwhere a strong and full debate record has been made. Even if those of \nus who have been here may not realize that at this moment, certainly \nhistorians will.\n  I believe most of the men and women in this body, in both parties, \nhave approached this historic debate with a seriousness the \nconsideration of a constitutional amendment requires. Every one of us \nshould pause and think: We vote either to amend the Constitution or not \nto amend the Constitution. With the exception of a vote to declare war \nor with the exception of one or two other areas, I cannot think of \nanything that approaches the seriousness of voting on a constitutional \namendment. No Member of the Senate should take that lightly. All \nMembers of the Senate should think they may only once in their \nlifetimes actually have a vote that will determine whether the long and \nalmost sacred process of amending our Constitution begins. So we should \nthink long and hard how we vote.\n  Those of us who expressed our reluctance to amend the Constitution, \nfor this or many other issues, have at least said, if we are going to \namend the Constitution, let us make sure the amendment is as good as \ncan be written.\n  We have offered serious and substantial amendments to this proposal. \nI believe the amendments that we have offered--all from this side of \nthe aisle--have revealed serious and substantial flaws in this proposed \nchange to our Constitution.\n  What has bothered me in this debate is instead of addressing these \nserious and substantial flaws, instead of acknowledging what writers \noutside the Senate have acknowledged, that the proposed change to the \nConstitution is flawed, but instead of addressing the substantial \nflaws, the sponsors of the resolution have proceeded with a no-\namendment strategy, in which they have failed to consider the merits of \nthe amendments. I think there was an up-or-down vote only one of the \namendments. The others were all tabled. The sponsors of this proposed \nconstitutional amendment have taken the unyielding position that no \nchanges in the language are acceptable.\n  I cannot think of an instance that a major and contentious issue has \nreached the Senate floor where Members have not realized, before its \nconclusion, that there may well have to be some changes. During the \nweeks of debate on Senate Joint Resolution 1, this no-amendment \nstrategy has been a disappointment to many, certainly to the senior \nSenator from Vermont. I do not believe this is the way to debate an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States. Both proponents and \nopponents of this proposed constitutional change should be searching \nfor the best\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nlanguage possible to propose to the States.\n  My own feelings, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, is that if this is \ngoing to pass, let it at least pass in the best possible form. Today, \nit is a long way from that.\n  As the distinguished Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], said, \n``Good is simply not good enough when we are amending the Constitution \nof the United States.''\n  Frankly, Mr. President, constitutional amendments are held to a \nhigher standard. The perfecting and substitute amendments offered \nduring the debate on this amendment showed the serious and substantial \nflaws, and I will recall a few of them.\n  I will continue speaking. I have already talked with my good friend \nfrom Utah about when a Member on the other side comes and seeks \nrecognition, I will, of course, yield for him or her to speak. But \nwhile waiting for that, let me talk about a few of these amendments.\n  We had the Durbin amendment. The distinguished Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Durbin], offered the first amendment during our debate, and it \nhighlighted the fact that Senate Joint Resolution 1 is unsound economic \npolicy. What he did in his amendment would have allowed us to waive \nthis article by majority vote in the event of an economic recession or \na serious economic emergency.\n  His amendment had the underpinning of the statements of more than a \nthousand of the Nation's most respected economists, including at least \n11 Nobel laureates and the former chairman of President Nixon's Council \nof Economic Advisers, the current and former Federal Reserve Board \nChairman, the former Democratic and Republican directors of the \nCongressional Budget Office. All agreed that the underlying resolution, \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, was unsound economic policy. They all agreed \nthat it would hamper the Government's ability to cope with economic \ndownturns.\n  Treasury Secretary Rubin, one of the most respected Treasury \nSecretaries I have served with in my 22 years here, testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee:\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would subject the Nation to \n     unacceptable economic risk in perpetuity. This balanced \n     budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions and \n     recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.\n\n  I think of the history books that tell us that as the United States \nwas going into its greatest depression, President Herbert Hoover, \nwanting to give credibility to the American people and hope to them, \ninstituted a balanced-budget policy. It was like throwing gasoline on \nto the smoldering embers of an embryonic depression, and what might \nhave been only a slight recession became a depression that destroyed \nthe hopes and dreams of many of our parents and grandparents. It was a \ndepression that wreaked the greatest havoc in the lives of American \npeople in this century. It was a depression that caused great migration \nof people from various parts of our country, nearly wreaked our farm \neconomy, our agrarian economy, and destroyed the hopes and dreams of \nfamilies in every part of America.\n\n  What we have done now is say if your State or region is hit by a \nmajor recession or emergency that a minority of Senators or a minority \nof Representatives could stop a Federal response to that major \nrecession or emergency. Although the sponsors of this measure \nrepeatedly outline the dangers of a budget deficit, they fail to \naddress how the proposed constitutional amendment will provide for the \nflexibility needed in economic downturns without holding working \nfamilies in hard-hit regions hostage to a supermajority vote. Senator \nDurbin's amendment would have restored that flexibility by requiring a \nmajority vote to respond to economic recessions and emergencies.\n  But the sponsors and proponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 opposed \nthe Durbin amendment. The sponsors and proponents of the underlying \nresolution did not offer alternative language to address the real \neconomic concerns surrounding Senate Joint Resolution 1. Instead, with \nlockstep voting, they defeated the Durbin amendment by a vote of 64 to \n35. Having forced this effort to be tabled on February 10, and they \nrejected the Torricelli amendment on February 26, the Republican \nleadership hinted this weekend that they are now themselves finally \nconsidering an amendment along these lines but have not brought one \nforward.\n  It is ironic, last Friday, the Senate passed an air ticket tax--they \nreinstated one that had lapsed--imposed a significant tax without a \nrecorded vote by unanimous consent. I wonder whether the proponents of \nthe provisions of the underlying resolution would draft in the \nConstitution a requirement that such measures only be passed by a \nconstitutional majority after a recorded vote. In this body the \nmajority leader called up the matter, and, in moments, it was done. I \nam not suggesting it should not have been done, but it is also reality. \nThis is a significant tax. It is a significant tax from which the \nAmerican people benefit. Hopefully, it will make our airports safer, \nair traffic more efficient and safer, and we benefit by it. But it was \nnot reinstated with a recorded vote.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I had other \namendments I was going to speak to, but I see the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland on the floor who is seeking time. How much time does the \nSenator from Maryland want?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland. And, Mr. President, before doing that, I \nunderstand this, that we are going back and forth. Does the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah have any objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection. This is fine. I am happy to \naccommodate the minority on this.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was going to speak about the Dodd \namendment, but I will withhold on that and will do that at another \ntime. I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that this is an extremely important \nvote that Senators are about to cast this afternoon. An amendment to \nthe Constitution to require a balanced budget ought to give every \nSenator great pause.\n  First of all, amending the Constitution is no light enterprise under \nany circumstances. Second, we ought to be certain that we are not \nfalling into the trap of unintended consequences, that we do not pass \nan amendment that does more harm than good. In this respect, we ought \nto heed the advice which we have been receiving from many quarters with \nrespect to the potential impact of this amendment to the Constitution \non our ability to conduct wise economic policy.\n  In this respect let me make four points in opposition to the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  First, let me discuss the effect of this amendment on our ability to \navert or slow economic downturns.\n  Mr. President, over 1,100 economists have taken out an advertisement \ncondemning the balanced budget amendment as unsound and unnecessary. \nIts signers include 11 Nobel laureates in economics, and they state--\nand I quote:\n\n       We condemn the proposed ``balanced-budget'' amendment to \n     the Federal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary.\n\n  They then go on to say--and I think this is an extremely important \nstatement:\n\n       The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the \n     face of recessions.\n\n  I repeat: ``The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the \nface of recessions.'' The statement continues:\n\n       In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and some outlays, \n     such as unemployment benefits, rise. These so-called built-in \n     stabilizers limit declines of after-tax income and purchasing \n     power. To keep the budget balanced every year would aggravate \n     recessions.\n\n  Secretary Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, testifying before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, echoed these sentiments when he stated that \nthe balanced budget amendment threatens to turn economic downturns into \nrecessions and recessions into depressions.\n  Mr. President, along these lines, I want to draw attention to this \nchart beside me which shows the fluctuations in real economic growth \nfrom 1870 to\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\n1995. This is 1870 here. This is 1995 out here. What this chart shows \nis that since the end of World War II, when we began using automatic \nfiscal stabilizers--what the 1,100 economists call the ``so-called \nbuilt-in stabilizers''--we have been able to greatly ameliorate the \nfluctuations in the business cycle. You still get business cycle \nfluctuations, but you do not get the boom-and-bust pattern which \ncharacterized the pre-World War II period in which a downturn would \nbecome a recession, and a recession would become a depression.\n  We have had fluctuations since 1945. But they have almost always been \nin the positive range in terms of economic growth. Our economy has \nbenefited enormously from this stability. When the economy slows down, \nunemployment rises, tax revenues fall off, and the paying out of \nunemployment benefits increases. We therefore automatically start \nincurring deficits which serve to slow down and head off the economic \ndownturn. These automatic stabilizers have enabled us to significantly \nameliorate the business cycle.\n\n  As the economists' statement says, an amendment to the Constitution \nrequiring a balanced budget would prevent this kind of countercyclical \nfiscal policy and, therefore, would greatly increase the risk of severe \neconomic fluctuations during an economic downturn.\n  Amendment supporters say, well, we will be able to see an economic \ndownturn begin and we will get a supermajority to waive the amendment's \nbalancing requirements. The fact of the matter is, however, that it is \nvery difficult to tell when you are in an economic downturn. The beauty \nof the current system is that it automatically adjusts as the economy \ngoes soft. As the economists said in this full-page ad in the paper, \n``The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face of \nrecessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and some outlays, \nsuch as unemployment benefits, rise.'' No congressional action is \nrequired for this system to go into effect.\n  If, in an economic downturn, you try to balance the budget by cutting \nback on unemployment benefits and raising taxes in order to balance it, \nyou will just drive the economy even deeper.\n  In short, Mr. President, this amendment prevents us from doing the \nvery things that have allowed our economy to stay on an even keel for \nthe last 50-plus years.\n  Second, Mr. President, it is very important to understand that we do \nnot have a capital budget at the Federal level. The argument is being \nused by the proponents of this amendment that because State governments \nhave to balance their budgets, local governments have to balance their \nbudgets, business firms balance their budgets, and private individuals \nbalance their budgets that the Federal Government should have to \nbalance its budget. But none of these entities--not States, local \ngovernments, private companies, or households--would balance their \nbudgets if they kept their budget the way the Federal Government does \nin accounting terms. There is no capital budget at the Federal level.\n  State and local governments have a capital budget, and they borrow in \norder to finance it. I sat on a committee that received testimony from \ntwo State Governors in favor of the balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. One of the arguments they made in favor of the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution was that their State \nbalanced budget amendments gave them a better credit rating for when \nthey went into the bond market to borrow, allowing them to borrow at \nlower interest rates.\n  Of course, my question to these Governors was, if you are required by \nyour Constitution to have a balanced budget, why do you have to borrow? \nTheir response was, ``Well, Senator, you don't understand. We borrow to \nfinance the capital budget. Our constitutional requirement for a \nbalanced budget is for the operating budget, but we can have a capital \nbudget for which we borrow.''\n  Of course, it makes good sense to borrow for capital items. \nBusinesses do it when they invest in new plant equipment and private \nindividuals do it when they buy a home or a car. Very few people can \nafford to buy those items out of cash in the year of purchase. If you \ncalculate prudently in terms of your expected income flow and the \namount you are spending for the capital asset, it makes good sense to \nborrow in order to finance the capital asset, have the use of it over \ntime, and pay it off over that period as you amortize the use of that \ncapital asset. Business does it all the time. Private individuals do it \nall the time.\n\n  So this analogy that amendment proponents draw to State and local \ngovernment, private individuals, and business does not work because \nthere is no capital budget at the Federal level. And amendments that \nwere offered on the floor to introduce capital budgeting into the \nFederal accounting process were rejected.\n  Third, it is argued that if we face an economic or military \nemergency, you will get a supermajority in this body in order to waive \nthe amendment's balancing requirements. Well, Mr. President, we have \nseen the difficulty we have around here extending the debt limit by a \nsimple majority. This legislation requires a three-fifths \nsupermajority, three-fifths of the total membership of the body, in \norder to raise the debt limit. Very few of the efforts to raise the \ndebt limit in recent years have had that kind of support.\n  I have voted for debt-limit increases with Republican Presidents \nbecause I thought it was the responsible thing to do. But in many of \nthose instances, even where there was some bipartisanship involved, the \nvote to increase the debt limit failed to garner 60 votes.\n  The difficulty of gathering a supermajority simply cannot be \noverestimated. Yet amendment supporters assert, well, clearly, Congress \nwill see a crisis and make the proper response. Our history, however, \nsimply does not support that contention.\n  Let me give you just one example, involving national security, \nbecause proponents of this amendment contend that it will not inhibit \nus from addressing our national security needs. In 1940, on the \nrecommendation of President Roosevelt, the United States enacted a 1-\nyear draft. The draft came up for renewal a year later, in the fall of \n1941, not too long before Pearl Harbor.\n  At this point, the House of Representatives had an intense debate \nabout extension of the draft. Speaker Rayburn, in fact, went into the \nwell of the House to appeal for the extension of the draft, saying it \nwas essential for the security of our country. That extension passed in \nthe House on a vote of 203 to 202. That vote would not meet the \nrequirements of this balanced budget amendment, because to meet the \nrequirements of the balanced budget amendment, you have to have a \nmajority of the whole membership to waive the balanced budget amendment \nin time of national security emergency. The majority of the whole \nthen--as now--would have been 218; 203 falls short of the majority of \nthe whole requirement in the balanced budget amendment, let alone the \nsupermajority requirements that are contained in the amendment. So \nthose who place faith in the assumption that the Congress would easily \nwaive the balancing requirements are much too sanguine. I am very \napprehensive as to whether, either in a national security crisis or an \neconomic crisis, we would be able to respond. In both instances, it is \nimperative to be able to respond early. The longer you wait, the more \nserious the problem, the further you fall behind the curve. This \nbalanced budget amendment has the effect, at best, of delaying \nessential action, and at worst, of preventing such action at all.\n  Fourth and finally, let me very quickly make the point that the way \nto balance the budget is to make the budget decisions that we are \nconfronted with, not to amend the Constitution. We have been trying to \ndo that, and we have had some good success over the last 4 years. We \nhave brought the deficit down.\n  How do you actually bring down the deficit? How do you really address \nthis problem? What I have argued here this morning is that amending the \nConstitution carries with it great risks, as the economists in this \narticle have indicated, and that we can do the job--and have been doing \nit--without a balanced budget amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full economists' statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\n   1,100 Economists Condemn Balanced Budget Amendment: ``Unsound and \n                             Unnecessary''\n\n       The statement below has been signed by over 1,100 prominent \n     economists, more than double the number who signed a similar \n     statement in 1992.\n       The signers include 11 Nobel laureates in economics: \n     Kenneth J. Arrow and William Sharpe of Stanford University; \n     Gerard Debreu and John Harsanyi of the University of \n     California-Berkeley; Lawrence R. Klein of the University of \n     Pennsylvania; Wassily Leontieff of New York University; \n     Herbert A. Simon of Carnegie Mellon University; James Tobin \n     of Yale University; and Franco Modigliani, Paul A. Samuelson \n     and Robert Solow of M.I.T. The statement was drafted by \n     Robert Eisner, James Tobin and Robert Solow.\n       ``We condemn the proposed `balanced-budget' amendment to \n     the federal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary.\n       ``The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the \n     face of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall \n     and some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These \n     so-called built-in stabilizers limit declines of after-tax \n     income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced \n     every year would aggravate recessions.\n       ``Unlike many state constitutions, which permit borrowing \n     to finance capital expenditures, the proposed federal \n     amendment makes no distinction between capital investments \n     and current outlays. Private businesses and households borrow \n     all the time to finance capital spending. The amendment would \n     prevent federal borrowing to finance expenditures for \n     infrastructure, education, research and development, \n     environmental protection, and other investment vital to the \n     nation's future well-being.\n       ``The amendment invites Congress to require states and \n     localities and private businesses to do what it cannot \n     finance itself. It also invites more cosmetic accounting, \n     such as increased sales of public lands and other assets \n     counted as deficit-reducing revenues. Disputes on the meaning \n     of budget balance could end up in the courts.\n       ``The amendment does contain escape hatches, but they \n     require super-majorities in peacetime, three-fifths of the \n     `whole number' (including absentees and non-voters) of each \n     House to adopt an unbalanced budget or to raise the debt and \n     a majority of these whole numbers to pass a bill to raise \n     taxes. These provisions are recipes for gridlock and \n     opportunities for irresponsible minorities to insist on their \n     agendas.\n       ``The amendment is not needed to balance the budget. The \n     measured deficit has fallen dramatically in recent years, \n     from $290 billion in 1992 to $107 billion in 1996, to some \n     1.3 percent of gross domestic product, a smaller proportion \n     than that of any other major nation, none of which hobbles \n     its economy with a balanced-budget mandate. Congress and the \n     President can reduce the deficit to zero, that is, balance \n     the budget, or even create budget surpluses, without a \n     constitutional amendment.\n       ``There is no need to put the nation in an economic strait-\n     jacket. Let the President and Congress make fiscal policies \n     in response to national needs and priorities as the authors \n     of our Constitution wisely provided.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. To summarize once again the economists' statement, \nfirst of all, the balanced budget amendment would not enable us to \nrespond automatically to economic downturns, running the risk, \ntherefore, of turning recessions into depressions. Second, and I quote, \n``Unlike many State constitutions, which permit borrowing of financed \ncapital expenditures, the proposed Federal amendment makes no \ndistinction between capital investments and current outlays. Private \nbusinesses and households borrow all the time to finance capital \nspending. The amendment would prevent Federal borrowing to finance \nexpenditures for infrastructure, education, research and development, \nenvironmental protection, and other investment vital to the Nation's \nfuture well-being.''\n  If we had a capital budget right now, we would have a balanced \nbudget, because there is well over $107 billion worth of capital items \nin the Federal budget.\n  Third, I addressed the escape hatches and the difficulty of obtaining \nthese supermajorities. That is really a recipe for gridlock.\n  Fourth, and this leads again to my final point, we have brought the \ndeficit down consecutively now for 4 straight years. How? We made tough \ndecisions on spending and taxing. We voted for the 1993 economic plan. \nMany of those pushing the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nvoted against that economic plan with respect to the budget. That was \nthe plan that enabled us to bring the deficit down from $290 billion in \n1992 to $107 billion in the past fiscal year--a cut of almost two-\nthirds in the deficit. That was done by making tough decisions. The \nchart beside me reveals this progress.\n  An amendment to the Constitution, by itself, does nothing. You still \nhave to make the budget decisions. We have been doing a good job of it. \nIn fact, as this next chart shows, we have brought the deficit down \nfrom 4.9 percent of our gross domestic product down to 1.4 percent. \nThis is the best performance in a quarter of a century, as a percent of \nGDP.\n  So, Mr. President, we have been doing the job. And the way to \ncontinue to do the job is to address the deficit. As I noted, it is now \ndown to 1.4 percent of GDP. This is better than any other major \nindustrial power in the world. Chairman Stiglitz of the Council of \nEconomic Advisors says he now goes to international conferences and \neveryone is talking about how well and how successfully the American \neconomy is working. This figure--deficit as a percent of GDP, 1.4 \npercent--is better than any of the other major industrial countries. \nConsider this chart beside me. This is the U.S. deficit as a share of \nGDP, 1.4 percent. Here is Japan at 3.1 percent; Germany at 3.5 percent; \nCanada, 4.2 percent; France, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 5.1 \npercent; Italy, 7.2 percent. So we have been doing the job, and we have \nbeen doing the job the way it needs to be done.\n  In short, Mr. President, we ought not to meddle with the \nConstitution. We ought not run the risk of provoking economic prices, \nof preventing a timely response to a national security threat, of \nfailing to make capital investments in the future of our country. Mr. \nPresident, I urge the rejection of this amendment to the Constitution.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding me time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have enjoyed listening to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland. He has made these points before.\n  Let me tell you something. It is easy to bring the deficit down when \nyou pass the largest tax increase in history, and when you have just \nended paying for the savings and loan crisis. In all honesty, that is \nwhat happened. But, we still have, for the next 4 years, the deficit \ngoing back up. Only in Washington, DC, when you talk about reducing the \nincrease in the amount of money the deficit goes up, do you call it \ncutting the budget.\n\n  The fact is that, under the best of circumstances, we have at least a \n$107 billion annual deficit. It is going up to $200 billion by the year \n2002, by the budget the President submitted. So it is nice to talk in \nterms of how the deficit seems to be coming down for the last 4 years, \nafter the largest tax increase in history, and the fact that the \ndeficit was artificially high in 1992 because we got through paying for \nthe debacle of the S crisis. I am not sure who to blame there. There \nis more than enough blame to go around for who created the debt, the \nquestion for today is who will vote to fix it?\n  President Reagan's desire to have marginal tax rate reductions to \nspur economic growth proved to be the right policy. The marginal tax \nrate reductions in 1981, actually, according to many observers, \nresulted in an increase in revenues of over 40 percent during the \nadditional years. At the lowest, it was 28 percent. Really, I think it \nwas closer to 40 percent. But the real problem was that our friends of \nthe more liberal persuasion kept spending, and President Reagan himself \nspent more on defense. So there is no question that all of that was \nwhat caused the high deficits, not the tax rate reductions.\n  Having said all of that, we also know that automatic stabilizers are \nnot what they claim to be. There are many reasons why we come out of \nrecessions and why we haven't had deeper ones than we have had. \nAutomatic stabilizers is probably a very minor part of that, according \nto most economists today.\n  Today is the day of decision for Senate Joint Resolution 1, which \nproposes to amend the Constitution and provide for a means of getting \nus to a balanced budget. The sad reality is that if we do not adopt the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, then the bridge to the \n21st century is likely to be washed out with a flood of debt.\n  The amendment we will vote on this afternoon is the bipartisan, \nbicameral consensus. Everybody knows it is the only one that has a \nchance of passing and the only chance we have of getting things under \ncontrol. It is recommended to the American people by\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\nus for their deliberation and their State legislatures by Americans of \ngood will who will have reached across party lines to do what is right \nfor our country's future.\n  Some have suggested that it is somehow inappropriate to suggest that \nwe amend the Constitution to correct the Federal Government's borrowing \nand spending habits. I would like to emphasize. What is the \nConstitution for? It seems to me that it's primary purpose is to limit \nthe Federal Government's power to act in ways destructive of the \nliberties of the people. And the most central power of Government, \nespecially of the Congress, is the power of the purse. That should not \nseem like a new idea. Ever since the nobles of England forced King John \nto sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede, our constitutional history has \nbeen a series of actions to rein in the abuse of power of the purse to \nprotect the freedoms of the people. That is what we want to do here \nbecause it is apparent. If you look at these last 28 years of budgets, \nall unbalanced, none of which has done the job, that have put us where \nwe are, it wasn't just Reagan, Bush, Clinton, or Carter. It is 28 years \nof this. And, if you really want to stop things, yes, we have to have \nbetter Presidential leadership on the budget. But ultimately, the \nfiscal buck stops right here in Congress, and the Congress is the body \nthat can't get its spending habits under control.\n  For the first century and a half of our Nation's history our Nation--\nit literally went without saying--the Government would only borrow in \ntimes of supreme emergency, and then would repay the debt in good \ntimes. That began to be abandoned in the 1930's and was entirely \nabandoned in the 1960's and 1970's. In 58 of the last 66 years, and for \nthe last straight 28 years, the Federal Government has spent more money \nthan it has taken in. Yet, we have these people coming to the floor \nsaying, ``All we have to do is do it, and the President will sign it.'' \nGive me a break.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not have the time to yield, or I would be happy to. \nLet me just finish my remarks.\n  This pile of books illustrate the nearly three decades of unbroken \ndeficits. Think of it. Nearly 30 years in an unbroken line, and 58 of \nthe last 66 years during good times and bad times the Federal \nGovernment has simply spent money that it didn't have. And, frankly, it \nis our fault in Congress for allowing this condition to continue.\n  Some question. ``Who has this hurt? We owe the money to ourselves. It \nhas no effect.'' Right? Wrong. It has hurt average Americans by \nreducing their wealth and by reducing the Nation's economic sovereignty \nas we have relied on foreign creditors, and foreign creditors are \nstarting to control our country. Because the Government is competing \nfor money to borrow, it has driven up the interest rates making home \nmortgages, student loans, and automobile loans even more expensive.\n  The Joint Economic Committee has estimated that the average family \nwill save about $1,500 if we implemented a balanced budget amendment. \nOur debt has made it more difficult for small businesses to grow and to \nexpand, and so has decreased the number of new jobs that we might have \ncreated.\n  In these and many other ways, real wealth has been taken away from \nthe American people and from the American families throughout this \ncountry. Who else does it hurt? Certainly our children and our \ngrandchildren. A child born today enters life with about $20,000 of \ndebt as his or her share of our $5.3 trillion national debt. It has \nbeen estimated that this same child will pay $200,000 in extra taxes \njust to pay the interest on the national debt over the lifetime of that \nchild. In fact, that child will pay over $94,000 in extra taxes just to \npay the interest on the national debt, up until that child's first 18 \nyears are completed. These children did not get to vote on this debt \nand tax burden. They didn't vote on the spending programs that they \nwill be paying for. Mr. President, I have called this ``fiscal child \nabuse,'' and that is exactly what it is. It is also taxation without \nrepresentation in its purest form.\n\n  The clear fact is that the Federal Government's debt habit is hurting \ncurrent and future Americans. But in a way that avoids direct electoral \naccountability. By taking the easy course to borrowing, the Government \ncan hand out Federal money without having to raise Federal money \ndirectly through taxes.\n  Over the period of debt financing the Government has grown and has \nintruded itself into every area of life but has become even less and \nless accountable for the people. Some say, ``Let's just do it,'' \nmeaning that we can balance the budget right now, if we will. We have \ntried all of that. Republicans, Democrats, and the White House have \npromised balanced budgets, and the debt just continued to go up. \nDemocrats and Republicans promised balanced budgets, and the debt went \nup. We had recessions and wars, and the debt went up. We had peace and \nprosperity, and the debt went up. Since 1978, we passed no fewer than \nfive major budgetary regimes to force us to balance the budget, and the \ndebt went up.\n  Just think about it. In the last Congress, we even passed a balanced \nbudget. But the President vetoed it. And the debt went up again. We \nhave tried promises. We have tried statutes. They don't work.\n  Look at this stack of failed attempts of 28 straight years; 58 of the \nlast 66 year of unbalanced budgets. ``Let's just do it'' just doesn't \ndo it. That line may be great for selling sneakers, but it has not \nhelped us to balance the budget. I will tell you that.\n  We have a fundamental problem with the way our Government operates. \nWe need a constitutional solution because that is what the Constitution \nis for--to fix basic problems of Government, and to limit the ability \nof Government to act in ways that are harmful to the people. It seems \nto me quite clear that to remedy this fundamental problem in our \nNational Government that it is entirely appropriate to amend our basic \ncharter to say to the Government, ``Stop spending our national \ninheritance.'' By limiting the Federal Government's ability to borrow \nand spend and spend away our American legacy, we will be protecting the \nliberties of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, there is still time for Senators to reconsider their \nposition. I hope that those who have shown that changing their minds is \nnot out of character will think twice again and decide to vote the \nright way--in the way they promised their constituents, in the way they \nran upon it, and in the way they were elected upon it. The balanced \nbudget is the right thing to do for our children, our grandchildren, \nand for all Americans.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I simply want to make this observation.\n  Well over half of those budgets that the Senator from Utah points to \nin that pile would have been in balance if we had a capital budget. The \nfact of the matter is we didn't--and don't--have capital budgets. State \nand local governments have capital budgets. Businesses and private \nindividuals have capital budgets. But we have a budget accounting \nsystem that requires us to cover the capital items as well as the \noperating items. If we had done budget keeping the way everyone else \ndoes budget keeping, well over half of those budgets would have been in \nbalance.\n  He talks about young people being born with a debt hanging over them. \nThey are also born with a tremendous number of physical assets that \nhave been purchased that are available to them for their use--a \ntransportation network, a communication network, a research and \ndevelopment network, and an educational infrastructure. All have been \npaid for by previous generations for their use out into the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is that why you want a capital budget? I guess it is so \nyou can continue what you have been doing. Sure. So you can continue to \njust spend, and just call it a capital budget. My gosh. It suddenly \ndawned on me. I was starting to think maybe a capital budget was a good \nthing. But there is no bond rating system to restrain the Federal \nGovernment, as is the case in the States. We make the money. We\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\nprint it ourselves. We do whatever we want to. I guess we could just \ncontinue business as it is, and just call it a capital budget. Put all \nof these things that we should have to pay for into a capital budget, \nand say, ``We balanced the budget.'' Just continue the same system. \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on my time, if we are going to go by \nrating, I say to my friend from Maryland, let's see how we would rate. \nI think probably one way of rating is our deficit as a share of GDP. I \nsay this because we do it for ourselves. We talk about having our \nhousehold budgets in line. As a U.S. Senator, I own a home, of course. \nBut my real home is in Vermont. But I have a home to use when I am down \nin the Senate. Now, I do as almost all Vermonters, unless they have a \nlot more money than I do. I buy that with a mortgage. I could not pay \nfor those homes all in 1 year. I am in deficit.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am in deficit on that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Exactly. The year the Senator took out the mortgage, he \nwas in violation of the concept of the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Exactly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Any business that borrowed to expand plant and \nequipment--and virtually all businesses do it--violates the concept of \nthis balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In fact, I might say to my friend from Maryland, we talk \nabout how they might rate us if we had a capital budget. I look at the \nchart that he has been good enough to bring up, and I think that the \nUnited States is rating pretty darned good. We are an awful lot better \nin our deficit than all the rest of the First World--Japan, Germany, \nCanada, France, UK, Italy. I think our bonds would be pretty darned \ngood. I say this to my friend from Maryland. We all know we are in \nabout as much of a global market certainly as at any time in the \nSenator's lifetime or my lifetime, and markets become even more global \nas we go on with everything from the Internet to plants worldwide. I \nask my friend, what is the dominant currency when we talk about that \nglobal market? Is it not the dollar?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, it is certainly the dollar. \nEveryone is anxious to hold U.S. Treasury bonds. Let me say to my \ncolleague, the Maastricht Agreement for the European Union set out \ncertain criteria that countries had to meet in order to qualify for the \nmonetary unit. These were regarded as extremely severe criteria. One \ncriterion set out in the Maastricht Agreement was that they had to \nbring their deficit as a share of GDP down to 3 percent--3 percent. \nThat is the target that those countries are working to achieve. \nEveryone says, well, that is a really tough standard that these \nEuropean countries are trying to meet.\n  The United States is at 1.4 percent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have cut in half what they have set as that tough \ntarget. We have done half again better. Is that what the Senator from \nMaryland is saying?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely correct. Another criterion \nthey had was that your debt, your total debt had to be at 60 percent of \nyour GDP. We are at 50 percent. I do not have a chart on that one. But \nwe are at 50 percent. We easily meet both of the criteria that are \nbeing used by the European countries pursuant to the Maastricht \nConvention guidelines. And everyone is saying, boy, this is a tough \njob. If you get to it, you are showing tremendous fiscal discipline.\n  We are already well within both of those targets. None of the 15 \ncountries that are members of the European Union have done as well as \nthe United States on these two criteria, with the exception of \nLuxembourg.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see now that my distinguished colleague \nfrom Utah has someone to speak on the other side. I am about to yield \nto him. I hope, though, that those who watch this debate around the \nworld will realize that we are making debate on what is the world's \nstrongest economy, the strongest economy recorded history has ever \nshown. I worry sometimes when I hear this denigration of our economy \nand that we need gimmicks to fix it. It is like some of the debate on \nthe military budget during the cold war: Oh, my God, we are falling so \nfar behind, until someone said, well, would we trade our Air Force for \nthe Soviet Air Force or our Navy for the Soviet Navy or our Army for \nthe Soviet Army? And everybody said, Oh, of course not. I ask just one \nquestion. Would we trade the U.S. economy for any economy in the world?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The only gimmicks I have seen are the gimmicks of these \namendments that are really filed for one purpose and that is to cover \nwhat really is a very difficult vote, voting against the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nI especially want to commend my good friend, Senator Hatch, for his \ntireless dedication to passing this amendment.\n  Mr. President, our Nation faces a critical choice about our economic \nfuture: Are we going to continue to shackle our children and \ngrandchildren with debt or are we going to curtail the excessive \nspending habits of Washington? Passing the balanced budget amendment \nsignals a choice for fiscal discipline, economic prosperity, and a \nbetter future for our children.\n  Federal spending cannot continue indefinitely on its current course. \nIf we continue on our current path, entitlements and interest on the \ndebt will consume all Federal revenues by 2012--leaving not a single \ntax dollar for defense, education, medical research, national parks, \nand other important government functions. For 28 years, we have \ncontinued on this path. We cannot continue on it for the next 28.\n  Today, the Federal debt stands at $5.3 trillion. Grasping the concept \nof a trillion dollars is difficult, but let me try. If you started a \nbusiness in the year 1 and that business lost $1 million every day \nsince then, you still would not have lost your first trillion dollars. \nPaying interest alone on America's debt costs taxpayers about $300 \nmillion a year. Thus, a child born today will pay more than $180,000 on \nthe debt over his or her lifetime--just in interest.\n  The balanced budget amendment will take a bold step toward reversing \nthis trend by adding a simple rule to the Constitution, a rule followed \nby families when they draw up their own budgets and by businesses when \nthey forecast their finances. This rule says, ``total outlays in a \nparticular year will not exceed total receipts in that year.'' That is \nlegalese for forcing Congress to live within its means.\n  Some people have asked me why Congress and the President need to \nenshrine this rule in a document as important as the Constitution. \nEspecially given today's new commitment to bipartisanship, some wonder \nwhy their lawmakers cannot agree to make the tough choices necessary to \nbalance the budget. The simple answer is that Congress and the \nPresident need the amendment to guarantee fiscal discipline whether or \nnot that political commitment to a balanced budget exists. We need the \namendment to ensure the budget is balanced in 2002 and 2012 and 2022.\n  Opponents of the amendment cite four objections. First, they claim we \nshould exempt Social Security from budget calculations to protect \nseniors and preserve the program. However, exempting Social Security \nfrom the balanced budget amendment will not strengthen Social Security \nin any way, will not add a single year to the Social Security trust \nfund, and will make balancing the budget even more difficult. Simply \nmoving Social Security off budget does not address the structural \nchallenges the program will face when the baby boomers begin to retire. \nThe President knows this. He cites Social Security as one of his \nreasons for opposing the amendment but does not exempt it in his own \nbudget. The greatest threat to Social Security is not the\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\nbalanced budget amendment; it is the unrestrained growth of debt that \njeopardizes every single Federal program, especially Social Security \nbecause it is the largest.\n  The second objection is that the amendment restricts our ability to \nrun deficits in times of emergency or recession. Running deficits is, \nat times, unavoidable. But recent budget history shows that deficit \nspending has become the rule rather than the exception in Washington, a \ntrend that is unacceptable to the American taxpayer. The first sentence \nof the amendment provides appropriate flexibility to permit deficits \nwhen a three-fifths majority of Congress deems it necessary.\n  Third, opponents claim that the amendment risks judicial interference \nin budget decisions. In his State of the Union Address, the President \nhimself cited his concern of ``unwanted results such as judges halting \nSocial Security checks.'' The balanced budget amendment does not \nallocate power to the courts to decide budget and economic matters. \nRather, it establishes a procedure to restrict Congress' budget \nauthority--a supermajority vote to run deficits.\n  Fourth, opponents say we should include an exemption for capital \nbudgets. Capital investments are very important. Everyone knows that. \nHowever, as I discussed earlier, we will have no money for capital \ninvestments in just 15 years if we continue on our current budget \ncourse. As with Social Security, the debt is the greatest threat to \nthese investments.\n  Furthermore, if we created a separate capital budget, the process of \ndefining ``capital spending'' could be abused--opening a huge loophole \nfor deficit spending. We have seen this happen in the States. In New \nYork City, for example, they declared the useful life of a school \ntextbook to be 30 years, stretching out spending far beyond the book's \nactual existence.\n  All of these arguments are a smoke screen that obscures the real \nissue at stake: constitutionally mandated fiscal discipline.\n  If we can enact and sustain this discipline, the economic rewards are \nconsiderable. Looking back, if we had not run deficits the past two \ndecades, the average American family's annual income would be $15,500 \nhigher. Looking ahead, if we balance our budget now, we can increase \nper capita income by 26 percent over the next 20 years.\n  Passing the balanced budget amendment represents the first step down \nthis road to economic prosperity. With a fiscal discipline embedded in \nthe Constitution, Congress will be forced to confront tough problems \nsooner--rather than pushing mountains of debt on to future generations \nto endure.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his excellent statement, Mr. \nPresident. I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia. And I want to personally thank him and express my gratitude \nfor the good leadership and hard work he has shown in trying to pass \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I must confess that I am not particularly \ncomfortable as a proponent of adding a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, and I never have been.\n  Many of those with whom I am frequently aligned on issues that don't \nenjoy much popular political support yet represent sound public policy \nare very much opposed to this amendment--and cannot understand why I am \nsupporting it.\n  But I am not persuaded by the impassioned arguments against it, and, \nregrettably, that leaves me at odds with the President, the leadership \nof my party, most editorial writers, and virtually all of the \nprogressive organizations with which I often find common cause.\n  It was out of frustration that I first came to support the amendment \nwell over a decade ago during the time the Federal Government began to \nrun huge annual deficits year after year, with no evidence of the \ndiscipline necessary to rein them in and I have been a reluctant backer \never since.\n  As most of our colleagues know, however, I've always been far more \ncommitted to a balanced budget than to a balanced budget amendment and \nI would not be supporting an amendment now, if I held out any hope that \nwe would actually reach that goal without it.\n  In truth, actually achieving a balanced budget will be extremely \ndifficult and there is no guarantee that we'll reach it, with or \nwithout the amendment, because we will have to make some politically \npainful decisions to get there--either way.\n  And that is really the point.\n  Why fear the amendment if it will only put more pressure on us to \nmake the same tough decisions we're going to have to make anyway if \nwe're serious about balancing the budget.\n  We owe it to the American people, and to future generations in \nparticular to be a whole lot more candid about the choices we face, and \nthe decisions we are going to have to make.\n  We cannot keep promising that we will not touch Social Security or \nMedicare or Medicaid or veteran's pensions or any other entitlement \nprogram, because we are going to have to make some adjustments to all \nof these programs, or we will put them all at risk.\n  I am particularly concerned about arguments that suggest we threaten \nSocial Security if we pass a balanced budget amendment. That is just \nnot true.\n  The greatest risk for Social Security is not taking the need to \nbalance the budget seriously.\n  The real threat to our security, to our Social Security, to our \neconomic security, and to our national security is the national debt.\n  Each year we pay more interest, on more debt, and that leaves fewer \ndollars to spend on everything else we look to Government to provide.\n  And if we don't make some changes soon, in just 15 years every cent \nthe Government takes in will be required just to pay for entitlement \nprograms and interest on the national debt--every cent.\n  Now that is really something to worry about.\n  The other argument heard so often is that the balanced budget \namendment, will not permit us to respond to national emergencies.\n  That is nonsense.\n  To be sure it is designed to increase the pressure on us to make the \npolitically difficult choices we keep avoiding.\n  But for any real emergency we can override it with 60 votes, as we \nhave in the past.\n  Just look at how many votes we get on our routine emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bills.\n  In times of true national emergencies, we will have virtually \nunanimous support to waive the limitation and in the interim, we will \nhave an added incentive, to be more fiscally responsible.\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding good intentions and despite the \nrhetoric to the contrary, I just do not believe either the executive \nbranch of the Federal Government or the legislative branch of the \nFederal Government have the collective will to make the really tough \nbut necessary decisions without the added pressure the balanced budget \namendment will help guarantee.\n  So, the die may well be cast. It may be it will fall one vote short. \nBut I hope all of those who profess to support a balanced budget, \nwhether with or without an amendment, will keep those commitments in \nmind as we approach the very difficult choices that we inevitably face \nif we are ever to get to that particular goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield any time I have remaining, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico need? We are running out of time on this side, but I think the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee deserves to take \nwhatever he wants to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 7 or 8 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. All right, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just listened to my good friend from \nVirginia talk about whether we have the will or not without a \nconstitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget. Let me say to \neveryone, the\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\nPresident of the United States has been saying he has the will; the \nwill to get a balanced budget by 2002 has been a cornerstone to what he \nhas been saying during his campaign and during the last couple of \nmonths.\n  The truth of the matter is, I say to my friend from Virginia, he did \nnot present a balanced budget. Last night, the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us that the President's budget, in the last year, the year \nit is supposed to be in balance, is $70 billion in the red. You know, \nwe are only starting this exercise at $106 billion. Mr. President, $106 \nbillion is where we are, and after all the Presidential hoopla, sending \nus this great budget, those who estimate say it is still $70 billion in \nthe red in 2002.\n  If that is not enough, let me tell you, the will seems to be to \ndelay, delay, delay. A constitutional amendment would put a finality to \nthat and you would reach the time when you could delay no more, which I \nbelieve is the reason that my good friend has decided that he must go \nfor this amendment, even though we would all prefer to balance the \nbudget on our own. Is delay part of the President's budget, while he \nadmonishes us not to adopt a constitutional amendment? You bet. The \nCongressional Budget Office just told us that next year, the first year \nwe are supposed to be moving toward balance, the deficit goes up $25 \nbillion. Can you imagine a deficit increase, from a President telling \nus not to adopt a constitutional amendment because it is too rigid and \nhe would like the flexibility, and stating he just sent Congress a \nbalanced budget?\n  My friend, Congressman John Kasich, tried to explain this, and I must \nborrow his analogy. He talked about somebody going on a diet and \ndeciding that the first 4 years of the diet, you will increase your \nweight preposterously--$25 billion worth, in the first year--and then \nwhen you finally get to the year you are supposed to actually lose \nweight, you all of a sudden, in that last year, you are going to lose \n100 pounds.\n  This budget is before us now, brought to us by a President who is \ntelling us, I will balance the budget myself--right? That is what he is \nsaying. Do you know how much of this deficit reduction, according to \nthe experts that we must listen to, occurs in the last 2 years of this \nbudget? I assume you were appalled, I say to Senator Robb, when you \nheard 75 percent as the estimate 2 weeks ago. That is wrong. Mr. \nPresident, 98.5 percent of the President's deficit reduction occurs in \nthe fourth and fifth year of this budget. Do you believe it? Do you \nbelieve that will happen? Of course not. You will have another budget \nstacked up here, saying, ``Well, we thought we were getting there, but \nwe are not.''\n  As a matter of fact, the response of the administration today is, we \nare not changing a thing because, come that final year, we have a \ntrigger. Did you ever hear of a trigger in budgeting? You pull a \ntrigger and you cut spending. Why don't you pull the trigger next year \nand start cutting spending? You wait until the end and you ``trigger'' \nout--neat word--trigger out the tax cuts that you put in place. So you \nraise taxes, because you were wrong and you could not get to balance, \nso you say, we will cut your taxes for 3 years but in the fourth and \nfifth years, when we are out of balance, we will put the taxes right \nback on. That is a neat trigger, isn't it? It is a trigger, so clearly \nwe ought to be down here saying, ``We do not need a constitutional \namendment\" --this is a new one--``we have a trigger. Forget the \namendment. We will balance the budget with a trigger.''\n\n  And then the President says, ``Of course, we cannot do it all by \ntaxes.'' So, what we are going to do is we are going to trigger an \nacross-the-board cut, 4 percent across-the-board on almost everything. \nDo you believe it? Of course not. It will not happen. It is an absolute \nphony device.\n  For those who think we do not need a constitutional amendment because \nwe will balance the budget ourselves, I submit, with great regret, that \nthe President's budget is not an example of doing it ourselves, for it \nwill not achieve the goal. As a matter of fact, it obfuscates, it \nhides, it delays, it terminates a bunch of programs.\n  One big program is terminated in the fifth year, even though it is an \nentitlement. And guess the rhetoric? The rhetoric is, ``Well, the \nPresident promised to do it for only 5 years in his campaign, so it is \nin the budget for 5 years.'' A new entitlement, but at the end of 5 \nyears, it is out. That won't happen. You already have hundreds of \nthousands of Americans on this entitlement to help pay for health care \nof one type or another. But because we had a campaign that said we are \ngoing to do this for 5 years, we will stop it.\n  You see, the President has just given us, in his budget, I regret to \nsay, the best example of why we need a constitutional amendment. We \njust absolutely cannot put ourselves to making tough decisions. I say \nto those negotiating for the President, I remain hopeful that there are \ntwo things at play that may still get us to the Holy Land, and the two \nthings are that this President cannot live with 4 years of a sustained \nfight with a Republican Congress--he cannot--because what kind of a \nlegacy is that? ``I did battle with the Republicans for 4 years, and \nthat is my legacy.'' Of course that is no legacy. Nor can the \nRepublicans who control this place--and thanks to Senator Robb for \nhelping us on these matters. We don't draw lines. He is one of the most \ncommitted Senators to getting a balanced budget, and I compliment him \nfor it. But we can't live fighting the President for 2 years or 4 \nyears. So I think maybe the pot may be able to get stewed up moving in \nthe right direction of getting a balanced budget.\n  Let me say, for those who claim we will do it ourselves, they better \ndo a lot better than the President, because he is not doing it himself. \nHis budget needs a constitutional amendment almost as bad as any of \nthose budgets we have up here. How many years is that, I ask the \nSenator from Utah? Twenty-nine? Twenty-eight? We probably need it as \nbad on the President's budget as any of those budgets out here which \ncaused us to go into this 5 trillion dollars worth of debt.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be delighted to.\n  Mr. HATCH. The President himself, in his budget, says by the fourth \nand fifth year, 75 percent of the savings or cuts, whatever, have to be \nobtained in the 2 years after he leaves office.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Actually, it is 98 now. I gave you a new number.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was going to ask you, you said 98. He was off by that \nmuch?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That's correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. He himself admitted to 75 percent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The number in his budget was 75. Now we have another \nparty, a neutral party saying----\n  Mr. HATCH. Am I correct in my understanding? I was led to believe \nthere was only a $49 billion deficit in the fifth year of the \nPresident's budget; in other words, it wasn't balanced by $49 billion. \nIf I heard the distinguished Senator correctly, that is now up to $70 \nbillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That's correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 8 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't know when I have heard a better speech on the \nbalanced budget amendment than the Senator from New Mexico has just \ngiven, or a better set of arguments for it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know I don't have any time left, but I would like to \nrepeat something. Can I just have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the best thing the President can offer \nin his budget, in lieu of a constitutional amendment to do the job, is \na trigger. This trigger is not going to get us where we have to be, but \nit is the only answer the President has to saying he will get us there. \nThere is a newfangled procedure in budgeting that says when the time \ncomes to do what we should have already done, we will use a gun and we \nwill call it a trigger, and we will automatically cut things that we \ndidn't have the courage to do anything about for the 4 preceding years.\n\n  Now, that is not doing it yourself and it is not anything that would \njustify our throwing away this constitutional amendment. However, I do \nbelieve we are not going to pass it because I think those opposed to it \nare still convinced we need bigger Government, and the constitutional \namendment is an instrument for less Government rather than more, and \nthat is the reason we are going to lose. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not take long. I hear these debates, \nand I still say the same thing: All we need is the courage to vote. We \nall give great speeches about the need for a balanced budget, but I \nremember the Senate and the Senate leadership during the time of \nPresident Reagan endorsing huge deficits. In fact, we are still paying \nthe interest on the deficits run up during the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, as contrasted to the Clinton administration where the \ndeficit has come down 4 years in a row and is about to come down for \nthe fifth year, something that has not happened in the lifetime of most \nof us in this body.\n  But to bring it down, you don't pass a bumper-sticker slogan and \nstick it on the Constitution of the United States of America. To bring \nit down, you cast difficult votes, unpopular votes, votes that make you \nstand up to special interests and single-issue groups from the right to \nthe left.\n  What we are trying to do is to pass some kind of a feel-good \namendment that would send most of this to the courts, that would \ncripple the strongest economy in the world. Let us remember that, with \nall those who come and talk about the dangers of our economy, I ask \nthem, what country in the world would they trade economies with? We \nhave the strongest economy in the world. It is like the days of the \nSoviet Union when everybody said, ``Well, our military is falling \napart,'' and we say, ``Do you want to trade our Air Force for theirs, \nour Army for theirs, our Navy for theirs?'' We have to say no.\n  When we have the strongest economy in the world, when we have a \ndeficit that is the smallest as percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct of any in the industrialized world, let's not start talking \nabout trading what is working for countries that do not work anywhere \nnear as well as what we have. Let us back off from the political siren \ncall of saying, ``We'll do this on a bumper-sticker slogan slapped on \nto the Constitution,'' the greatest Constitution in the world, because \nthen some day somebody else, probably a Federal court, will do what we \ncan do today.\n  I know that we cannot legislate political courage and responsibility, \nbut that is what we are trying to say we are going to do. No amendment \nto the Constitution can supply the representatives of the people of \nthis great country with political courage and responsibility. Indeed, \nthe majority report on this amendment concludes that the ultimate \nenforcement mechanism that can lead to balancing the budget is the \nelectorate's power to vote. How true, but that power to vote doesn't \ncome in 10 years from now in a constitutional amendment. That power to \nvote has been there throughout the history of this great country. The \nunderlying resolution would actually cut, rather than enhance, our \ndemocratic principles of majority rule and separation of powers but \nultimately lead to less accountability to the electorate. Why would it \ndo that? Because it would destroy majority rule, and it would turn all \ncontested issues of the budget over to the courts, not to the elected \npeople of this country.\n  Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us \nachieve remarkable deficit reduction over the past 4 years. That is a \nhistory that those who support this flimflam on the Constitution choose \nto ignore. We have succeeded in reducing the deficit every year of the \npast 4, we have cut the deficit by more than 60 percent in that time, \nand we have had a strong economy and sound fiscal policy. We did not do \nthat through a flimflam amendment. We did that through political \ncourage. It meant that some Members of this body and some Members of \nthe other body actually lost their seats in the Congress by voting for \nwhat was right--but they did it--and reminds all of us that nobody owns \na seat in the U.S. Senate. Nobody should have their decisions guided \nsolely by polls, but rather by what is right.\n\n  So why do we not stay the course of what we have been doing, bringing \nthe deficit down and use bipartisan work for further progress? It is an \nillusionary quick fix by constitutional amendment, and it makes the job \nmore difficult.\n  The questions raised during this debate will not go away and cannot \nbe ignored. They point to a series of fatal flaws in proposing and \nconducting our economic and budgetary functions this way.\n  A recent editorial in Vermont by the Burlington Free Press said it:\n\n       Amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget \n     amendment would be like using a sledgehammer to nail a picket \n     in a fence. The picket might stand, but at great risk to the \n     fence.\n\n  I think of what Senator Hatfield said when he stood up and opposed \nthis. Senator Hatfield, then the chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, said:\n\n       The debate on the balanced budget amendment is not about \n     reducing the budget deficit. It is about amending the \n     Constitution of the United States with a procedural gimmick.\n\n  What I say is, it is amending the Constitution with a bumper-sticker \nflimflam. That is what it is doing.\n  Senator Hatfield said:\n\n       As I stated during the debate on the balanced budget \n     amendment last year, a vote for this balanced budget \n     amendment is not a vote for a balanced budget, it is a vote \n     for a figleaf.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a pretty small figleaf. We ought to be \nembarrassed to put that figleaf on anything, especially on the greatest \nConstitution democracy has ever known.\n  Senator Hatfield said:\n\n       Congress should not promise to the people to balance the \n     Federal budget through a procedural gimmick. If the Congress \n     has a political will to balance the budget, it should simply \n     use the power that it already has to do so. There is no \n     substitute for political will. And there never will be.\n\n  Our Senate oath of office has in it a promise to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. We owe to our constituents our \nbest judgment on this. We owe to our children and our children's \nchildren our best judgment.\n  My children will live most of their lives in the next century. I want \nthem to live in that century with the best Constitution democracy has \never known. We demean the Constitution with this amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, \nSenator Hatch, for his outstanding leadership on this very important \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, as well as Senator \nCraig and others who have worked very hard to put us in a position to \nbe able to pass this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have been here now for 17 years. I cannot think of a \nmore important vote that I have ever cast than the vote we will be \ncasting today. If we cast a vote in favor of passing a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, we will change the way we do business \nin Washington, DC.\n  When we are sworn into office, we stand right here on the floor of \nthe Senate, most of us with a hand on the Bible, saying we swear to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States. It will change the way we \ndo business. It will mean we are going to start being responsible; we \nare going to quit spending more than we take in. It will not be easy. \nIt will be a challenge, but we can do it. Almost all States do it. It \ndoes not mean it is easy, but they do it. And we should do it as well.\n  I will read something from Thomas Jefferson.\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of administration of our Government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution; I mean an additional \n     article, taking from the Federal Government the power of \n     borrowing.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson was right. He also said:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  He was exactly right.\n  Mr. President, there is an article where countless Presidents, almost \nevery President when they made a State of the Union Address, said they\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\nwere going to lead us toward a balanced budget, including Bill Clinton, \nincluding Ronald Reagan, including George Bush, including almost all \nPresidents. But, unfortunately, we have not done it. And I say we. It \nis not just the administration. It is Congress. I think we need the \nconstitutional constraint to get us there.\n\n  In the last election, President Clinton and Bob Dole said, hey, we \nneed a balanced budget. Some people said, well, that means that it is a \ndone deal. That is not really the case. I heard my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Leahy, say, well, the last 4 years we have brought the \ndeficit down. The deficit has come down. What he did not say is the \ndeficit last year was $107 billion. What he did not say is the next 4 \nyears it goes up. According to CBO, the deficit goes up from $107 \nbillion to, in 1997, $116 billion, and under President Clinton's budget \nto $142 billion in 1999, and $135 billion in the year 2000.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No; I have only a couple minutes. I will be quick.\n  The point is, even under the President's budget, the deficit goes up. \nWe have made some progress--and I think we can argue on who should take \ncredit for that--but we are not making progress when the deficit is \ngoing up and it is higher in the year 2000 than it is in the year 1996. \nThat is not balancing the budget. That is like somebody saying they are \ngoing to go on a diet, but first they want to gain 10 pounds for each \nof the next 3 years and, oh, yes, in the last year we are going to lose \n40 pounds. That is what we have before us under the President's \ndocument.\n  I think we need a constitutional amendment to make the President and \nto make Congress be responsible, to make the tough decisions.\n  I am pleased that we are going to have 55 Republicans vote for this. \nI am disappointed that we do not have 12 Democrats to vote for it to \nmake it happen. I wish we did. I think we are going to come up with 11. \nOne of my jobs is to count votes. A couple of people basically are \ngoing to vote different than what they said they were going to do. That \ndisappoints me. But regardless, we still have to roll up our sleeves, \nand I think we still have to balance the budget. I do not know there is \nthe collective will to do it unless we have the constitutional \nrestraint to make us do it.\n  When an administration campaigns on a balanced budget and says, ``Oh, \nyes, we brought the deficit down every year,'' and then have the \ndeficit go up in the next 4 years, I find a lot of shell games going on \nin budgeteering. That bothers me. I hope we will be responsible. I hope \nwe will work together as Democrats and Republicans, not have a \nRepublican budget, not have a Democratic budget, but work together to \nactually balance the budget and provide some tax relief. We can do it. \nBut it is a lot easier said than done.\n  I think we need a constitutional amendment to make us do it, to tell \nus to do it. One of the reasons I think we continually have a deficit \nis you are a lot more popular spending money for people than taking it \naway from people.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is one of the most important issues we \nwill have confronting us this Congress, maybe in our lifetimes. If we \nreally do want to have Government act responsibly and quit saddling our \nchildren with additional debt --right now, per capita, that debt is \nover $19,000 per child, per person, per American. I do not think it is \nresponsible for us to continue to add more debt on future generations. \nSo I urge my colleagues to support a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget later this afternoon. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry the Republican whip was unable \nto yield to me for an observation, but I will make this observation. He \ncondemns President Clinton, who is the only President since he has been \nhere in the Senate who has brought the deficit down 4 years in a row. \nHe says it may go up in future years. I remind the Republican whip, my \ngood friend from Oklahoma, that the Republicans have the majority of \nSenators and the Republicans have the majority of House Members. If \nthey do not like the budget of the President, all they have to do is \npass their own. But to this day they have not brought forward one page, \none paragraph, one sentence or one word of a budget that would do \nbetter than what Bill Clinton has done.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are now running out of time. I am going to have to do \nthe same thing that the Republican whip did to me in not being willing \nto yield. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator. No. 1, Mr. President, as much \nrespect as I have for a number of Members of the Senate--and we have \nsome very bright people in the Senate--there isn't anybody here, \nreally, that I want tinkering with what James Madison, John Adams, \nAlexander Hamilton, and all of the rest of those brilliant people, the \nmost important assemblage of brilliant minds under one roof in the \nhistory of the world, did. Not only do I not want anybody tinkering \nwith it, I do not want to adopt something as sloppily crafted as this \namendment is.\n  As Senator Byrd has said time and time again, it is not even \nconstitution-like language. It doesn't provide for a simple majority \nvote to unbalance the budget in case of depression. It doesn't provide \nfor a simple majority vote in case we know we are going to war, as we \ndid in Desert Storm. You would not have spent an extra dollar, under \nthis amendment, to prepare for Desert Storm. You could not spend an \nextra dollar to have prepared for World War II, which everybody knew \nwas coming, if it unbalanced the budget.\n  You talk about a minority, listen to this, Mr. President. With 435 \nHouse Members, 100 Senators, if we want to unbalance the budget, it is \ngoing to require 60 percent of both Houses. Let's assume that every \nsingle House Member, all 435, vote aye to unbalance the budget, bring \nit over to the Senate, and let us assume that 59 Senators vote aye to \nunbalance the budget, 41 obstreperous Senators--494 people favoring \nunbalancing the budget and 41 Senators oppose it. It will not be \nunbalanced.\n  What else? If we can't resolve the thousands of questions that this \namendment leaves to be answered, then nobody has an answer and you go \nto court. Yes, coffee shop bantering is, ``I'm so tired of the courts \nmaking laws. I just want them to interpret the laws.'' Well, they are \ngoing to have to make a lot of laws if we are foolish enough to adopt \nthis one.\n  In 1993, the Republicans in this body had an opportunity to do \nsomething courageous. The people back home always say, ``Why don't you \npeople screw up your nerve and do something courageous?'' You know what \nthat means? It sometimes means unpopular votes. ``Why don't you screw \nup your courage and vote for something that is worthwhile, even though \nit is unpopular?'' Well, happily, 50 Democrats did just that. Al Gore, \nthe Vice President, broke the tie and the debt went down because of \ntheir courage. Everybody on that side prospered because they said, \n``I'm tired of taxes.'' Do you know what they are proposing now? With a \nsanctimonious look on their faces, they are saying, ``We want a \nbalanced budget amendment.'' What else? We want to cut taxes $238 \nbillion over the next 5 years. We tried that snake oil in 1981, and we \ngot a $3 trillion addition to the national debt.\n  What is the deficit going to be if we adopt a capital gains tax, \nwhich costs $33 billion the first 5 years, $133 billion the second 5 \nyears--and who does it go to? The wealthiest people in America; 67 \npercent of it goes to the richest 1 percent of the people in America. \nHow are we going to pay for it? Cut Medicare. Think of it. Cutting \nMedicare $100 billion to $200 billion in order to pass a tax, 67 \npercent of which goes to the richest 1 percent of the people in \nAmerica. I will say one thing for the people on that side of the aisle. \nThey are not covert about it; they are overt. Make no mistake about it, \nI have just told you precisely how it will work.\n  So, Mr. President, I am hoping that everybody holds fast. If we can \nbeat this amendment today, which I think we can do, the American people \nare going to begin to hone in on it, and by this time next year, you \nwon't even have it brought up. It will be just like term limits. It is \ngoing to go the same\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nway term limits went. That never was a good idea, and it is dead now.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will stand fast. I understand \nthe politics of this. The majority leader was willing to tinker with \nthis amendment. ``I will fix it. Will anybody vote for it if I change \nthis?'' ``Will somebody else vote for it if we change that?'' That is \nhow political it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Arkansas, if our Founding Fathers were \nhere today, they would suggest that Thomas Jefferson was right. They \nwould also have suggested that tinkering with the Constitution gave us \nthe 13th amendment, which abolished slavery. I know the Senator from \nArkansas would agree with me that it was a good amendment. He would \nprobably also agree that the 19th amendment, when Congress tinkered \nwith the idea that women should have a right to vote, was the right \nthing to do. Tinkering, generationally, has produced 27 amendments to \nour Constitution that, my guess is, the Senator from Arkansas and the \nSenator from Idaho would agree were generally the right things to do at \nthose times in our Nation's history.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support today of what could become the 28th \namendment to our Constitution. Let me thank the leadership that has \nworked so hard on this. Of course, there is Senator Orrin Hatch, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee; our majority leader, Trent Lott; \nmajority whip, Don Nickles; the President pro tempore; certainly, the \nSenator from Nevada, Senator Bryan; Senator Graham from Florida; the \nSenator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun. They deserve recognition \nfor bringing this critical issue to the floor. It is not a sunshine \namendment. I first helped introduce this in 1982. It will not go away \ntomorrow. If we fail today, we will be back next year and the next and \nthe next, until the American people gain their wish, which is to \nconvince this Congress, with the power of the Constitution, that we \nshould become fiscally responsible.\n  Let me also recognize the national, grass roots coalition that was \nformed under the leadership of Al Cors of the National Taxpayers Union \nin support of this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom that coalition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               The Balanced Budget\n\n\n                                          Amendment Coalition,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA., February 26, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations strongly urge \n     you to vote for and support the Balanced Budget Amendment, \n     S.J. Res. 1. This bipartisan proposal (with over 60 total \n     Senate cosponsors) has already passed the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on a 13 to 5 vote, and a Senate vote on S.J. Res. 1 \n     is expected later this week.\n       The framers of the U.S. Constitution assumed each \n     generation of Americans would pay its own bills--and that the \n     federal budget would, over time, remain roughly in balance. \n     According to Thomas Jefferson, ``we should consider ourselves \n     unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally \n     bound to pay them ourselves.''\n       In today's era of mass media, special interest politics, \n     and expensive and sophisticated election campaigns, the \n     checks and balances established 200 years ago are not up to \n     the job of controlling the federal deficit. Recent Congresses \n     and presidents have proven themselves incapable of acting in \n     the broader national interest on fiscal matters. Whenever \n     Congress considers spending cuts that could help balance the \n     budget, only a few Americans are aware of it, and fewer still \n     express their views about it. By contrast, those who stand to \n     lost from budget restraint--typically the beneficiaries and \n     administrators of spending programs--are well aware of what \n     they stand to lose. They mount intensive lobbying campaigns \n     to stop fiscal restraint.\n       This pro-spending and pro-debt bias has led to 27 straight \n     unbalanced budgets. It took our nation 205 years--from 1776 \n     to 1981--to reach a $1 trillion debt. Now, just 16 years \n     later, the debt is $5.3 trillion. Each year, interest \n     payments rise as the overall debt grows. These payments have \n     been one of the fastest-rising items in the federal budget--\n     they now account for more than the entire deficit, all by \n     themselves. A succession of statutory remedies has failed to \n     stem this historic and highly dangerous turn of events.\n       S.J. Res. 1 is a sound amendment that has evolved through \n     years of work by the principal sponsors. It provides the \n     constitutional discipline needed to make balanced federal \n     budgets the norm, rather than the rare exception (once in the \n     past 36 years), and it offers the proper flexibility to deal \n     with national emergencies.\n       In addition to requiring a three-fifths majority vote to \n     deficit spend or increase the federal debt limit, S.J. Res. 1 \n     is designed to make raising federal taxes more difficult. It \n     would require the approval of a majority of the whole number \n     of members in both the House and Senate--by roll call votes--\n     in order to pass any tax increase. This adds much-needed \n     accountability.\n       Unless action is taken now, higher federal spending and \n     debt will continue to cripple our economy and mortgage our \n     children's future. We urge you to support S.J. Res. 1, the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Taxpayers Union.\n       American Bakers Association.\n       American Legislative Exchange Council.\n       American Subcontractors Association.\n       Americans for Financial Security.\n       Amway Corporation.\n       Associated Equipment Distributors.\n       Christian Coalition.\n       Council for Citizens Against Government Waste.\n       Family Research Council.\n       Food Distributors International.\n       Independent Bakers Association.\n       International Mass Retail Association.\n       National Association for the Self-Employed.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n       National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.\n       National Federation of Independent Business.\n       National Restaurant Association.\n       Printing Industries of America.\n       Sixty Plus Association.\n       Textile Rental Services Association.\n       United Seniors Association.\n       U.S. Business and Industrial Council.\n       U.S. Federation of Small Business.\n       Alliance for Affordable Health Care.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Small Business Association.\n       Americans for a Balanced Budget.\n       Americans for Tax Reform.\n       Associated Builders and Contractors.\n       The Business Roundtable.\n       The Concord Coalition.\n       Electronic Industries Association.\n       Financial Executives Institute.\n       FMC Corporation.\n       International Dairy Foods Association.\n       Motorcycle Industry Council.\n       National Association of Home Builders.\n       National Association of Realtors.\n       National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n       National Ready Mixed Concrete Association.\n       National Truck Equipment Association.\n       Reform Party.\n       Small Business Survival Committee.\n       Traditional Values Coalition.\n       United We Stand America.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. The question of whether Congress should pass a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution is one of the few truly momentous \nvotes facing this country and the Congress today. The decision we face \nis in a class of votes like that of a declaration of war. The vote this \nafternoon will be a vote to end a war.\n  For more than 28 years, the national debt and the special interest \ngroups that feed off the taxpayers have waged a war against our economy \nand, most importantly, a brutal war against the integrity of the \ninvestment of the senior citizens and the opportunity of our children \nand our Nation's future. The spoils of that war is a $5.3 trillion \ndebt. That debt fuels inflation and squeezes the senior community that \nlives on fixed incomes. That debt already depresses wages and living \nstandards of the working families.\n  More than one-half of all personal income taxes paid--let me repeat \nthat, Mr. President--more than one-half of all personal income taxes \nthat are paid today go to pay interest on debt alone.\n  The costs of unbalanced budgets will be the most oppressive to our \nchildren. A child born today will pay nearly $200,000 in additional \ntaxes, not to pay down the debt, but to pay interest on that debt.\n  Under today's trends, when a child born today is fully grown and \nreaches his or her most productive years, not just the Government, but \nthe entire economy could well be in bankruptcy.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office puts it this way: The \nFederal ``debt would exceed levels the economy could reasonably \nsupport.'' In other words, somehow, a generation from now, we could \nactually see that generation having to jettison a debt under a \ndeclaration of bankruptcy as a nation. That should not be allowed to \nhappen, and this Congress and this Senate this afternoon have an \nopportunity to make the kind of change that is needed. We can offer to \nthe American people an opportunity for them to debate this issue and, \nin every State's capital around\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nthe Nation, reclaim their authority over their central Government, by \nplacing into the Constitution the restriction and the positive \nguidelines that this and every Congress must balance its budget.\n  Some who vote ``no'' today may claim that they want a balanced \nbudget, or even a balanced budget amendment. They may use some other \namendment as an excuse. But it should be said, and it should be said \noften, until the vote occurs this afternoon, a ``no'' vote today is a \nvote for the status quo, which means a growing Federal debt and a \nborrow-and-spend policy that has dominated this Government and this \nCongress for well over 30 years.\n  No wonder our former colleague Paul Simon calls it ``fiscal child \nabuse'' to continue this binge of borrow-and-spend.\n  This is a moral issue.\n  The money being borrowed and spent today belongs to our children. \nThey will pay the bill for years of profligate spending.\n  Thomas Jefferson said it well:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n\n                INTEREST IS DOMINATING OTHER PRIORITIES\n\n  When a family takes out a mortgage on a house, or a business builds \nan addition to its shop, it borrows. But that family or business then \nspends the next few years balancing their budgets to pay off that debt.\n  The Federal Government, unfortunately, does not operate like that.\n  Every family and every farm or small business knows what happens when \nyou borrow: You pay interest.\n  Gross interest, at $360 billion, is already the second largest item \nof spending in the Federal budget, almost exactly equal to the largest \nprogram--Social Security.\n  And what do we get for those interest payments? Nothing--except \nanother year older and deeper in debt.\n  Not one more school, not one more meal for a hungry child, and no \nrelief for overtaxed, overworked, families of modest and middle-class \nmeans.\n  Interest payments act like a giant sponge, soaking up money that we \nall want to go to other priorities.\n  They have already forced cuts in many Federal programs. They will \ncontinue to crowd out other public priorities, including, eventually, \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  In 1996, we sent $67.7 billion overseas in interest payments to \nforeign bondholders, because of the debt.\n  How can any Senator stand on this floor, say we should use our wealth \nat home to solve our problems, and then vote against this balanced \nbudget amendment?\n  By default, it is the national debt--not Congress--that more and more \ndecides how we spend the taxpayers dollars.\n\n\n                  THE BBA IS THE ANSWER TO THE THREAT\n\n  The debt is the threat--to our children, our parents, and the way of \nlife we cherish in this country.\n  The U.S. Senate has a chance today to begin putting an end to that \nthreat--by passing the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Balancing the budget means real benefits to real people.\n  If we balance the budget by the year 2002 and keep it balanced, that \nwill create 2.5 million new jobs. It will save the typical family \n$1,500 a year in interest costs on mortgages, student loans, and car \nloans. It will raise wages and incomes for working Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  Yes, the President has promised a balanced budget. Yes, Congress has \ntried to pass a balanced budget.\n  But we have had standing on the Senate floor during this debate an 8-\nfoot-tall stack of books.\n  This is the leaning tower of budgets--the last 28 budgets submitted \nby President Clinton and his predecessors.\n  In half of those budgets, the President who submitted them promised \nbalanced budgets. Between them, those Presidents and past Congresses \nbroke every promise.\n  Yes, deficits have declined. Congress has made some progress in \ncontrolling the year-to-year growth of spending. But deficits are \nalready projected to go back up and--in a few years--off the charts. \nMaybe the President and this Congress can bind a future President and a \nfuture Congress to finish balancing the budget in 2002. Maybe. But \nthen, what about 2003? And 2004?\n\n  Only one thing will impose a rule that Presidents can't ignore with \nimpunity, that Congresses can't repeal or delay; only one thing will \nmake Presidents and Congresses keep their promises; only one thing will \nmake fiscal responsibility and tough choices the norm instead of the \nexception; the bridge to the 21st century may be paved with good \nintentions, but it will be a rickety, dangerous bridge unless it is \nconstructed with the steel of the balanced budget amendment.\n\n\n          WILL THE SENATE SAY ``YES'' OR ``NO'' TO THE PEOPLE?\n\n  Unfortunately, this President--and a host of special interest groups \ncomfortably feeding at the public trough--have put incredible pressure \non the Senate to defeat this amendment. They want to say ``no'' to the \npeople. But the people say, by a 70-to-30 percent margin in the latest \npoll, that they want us to pass the amendment; they want to say ``no'' \nto the people, who deserve the right to examine, debate, and decide on \nthis amendment through their State legislatures.\n  Congressional passage would only be the start. The people deserve the \nfinal word on what goes in their Constitution. After passing Congress, \nthe amendment would go to all 50 State legislatures for ratification. \nAnd that would begin one of the greatest public debates, one of the \ngreatest civics lessons, in the history of our Nation.\n\n\n                 FINAL PASSAGE IS THE VOTE THAT COUNTS\n\n  Some who vote ``no'' today may try to claim they want a balanced \nbudget, or even a balanced budget amendment. They may use some other \namendment as an excuse. But a ``no'' vote today is a vote for the \nstatus quo of borrow-and-spend. A ``no'' vote today is a vote in favor \nof the $3 trillion scheduled to be added to the debt over the next 10 \nyears. How will another $3 trillion in debt help seniors on Social \nSecurity? No matter what you think is the best way to save Social \nSecurity, passing this balanced budget amendment is the certain way to \nsave it.\n  Opponents have not made a case against this amendment--they have only \nshown they are afraid of balancing the budget. That's what it means \nwhen they say, ``If we can't run deficits, we may not be able to spend \non this or that.'' Take so-called capital budgeting, for example: If we \nexempt narrowest category of investment spending in the President's \nbudget, major physical capital, we could have run a larger deficit last \nyear than we did. These pleas to exempt this or that item are not sound \nbudgeting; they are a plea to continue the status quo.\n  It defies common sense: Opponents believe Congress will only do the \nright thing if we are allowed infinite borrowing and unlimited \nspending.\n  But we who support the amendment believe Congress will begin to do \nthe right thing if it is required to live within its means and set \npriorities.\n  Our balanced budget amendment is a bipartisan amendment, written with \npainstaking care over several years by Democrats and Republicans, \nliberals and conservatives. It is the bipartisan, bicameral, consensus \namendment. If we do not pass it today, we will be back until we do.\n  Why are we working so hard to pass it? Because we want economic \nsecurity for our senior citizens. We want to preserve the American \ndream of growth and opportunity. We want a better world for our \nchildren.\n  The balanced budget amendment deserves to pass the Congress, and go \nto the people for their final, wise judgment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have printed in the \nRecord several fact sheets that my office, working with others, have \nprepared during this debate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 CLUBB\n\n           Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget\n\n\n    Top Ten Reasons to Support the Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n                  Constitution (H.J.Res. 1/S.J.Res. 1)\n\n       No. 1 Kids: The future for our children depends on the \n     future of the economy.

Res. 1/S.J. Res. 1) is critically needed \n     to ensure that the federal government will continue to have \n     the means to honor our obligations to our senior citizens. \n     The best guarantee of the economic security of our seniors, \n     today and in the future, would be the ironclad commitment of \n     the Constitution to restore and maintain fiscal \n     responsibility.\n       Balancing the budget and keeping it balanced means less \n     debt, lower interest costs, rising living standards--and more \n     money made available for seniors' priorities. If today's debt \n     had been paid off in years past, the government would have \n     run a $134 billion surplus last year.\n       Escalating interest payments crowd out ALL other \n     priorities.\n       In 1976, 7.2 percent of the federal budget went to make \n     interest payments on the federal debt. In 1996, net interest \n     consumed 15.5 percent of the budget. As a result, other \n     programs have already felt the budget knife. Social Security \n     and Medicare are the first and third largest federal \n     programs; these two programs alone made up more than 33 \n     percent of last year's spending. All seniors and retirement \n     programs make up about 40 percent of the budget, not counting \n     seniors' participation in non-seniors programs.\n       We are all familiar with what happens to households and \n     businesses that run up too much debt--the burden of interest \n     payments on the debt becomes so great that they eventually \n     have to go without necessities or face total bankruptcy. \n     Unbalanced federal budgets mean growing interest payments \n     (which are mandatory, to prevent default) that will \n     increasingly crowd out all other public priorities--including \n     those vitally important to seniors.\n       The debt is the threat to Social Security. Decades of \n     borrow-and-spend government have produced a $5.3 trillion \n     gross federal debt. About $600 billion of that is owed to the \n     Social Security trust funds. (The law creating Social \n     Security requires that any accumulated surpluses be invested \n     in U.S. Treasury securities (i.e., loaned to the ``general \n     fund'').) Under current trends, the total debt will double \n     over the next dozen years and seniors will wonder--rightly--\n     about the Treasury's ability to repay those debts. In the \n     long run, a bankrupt federal government will not be able to \n     send out ANY checks--to Social Security beneficiaries or any \n     other debtor.\n       Balanced Budget Prosperity is a Senior's Best Friend.\n       Past promises regarding Social Security have been fulfilled \n     because of a growing economy, enabling workers to pay into \n     the system. Higher wages mean greater retirement benefits. \n     Unfortunately, seniors are already paying for today's debt \n     burden. A Federal Reserve Bank of New York study found that \n     the federal debt accumulated in the 1980s already pinched our \n     standard of living by 5 percent. The Concord Coalition \n     estimates that the debt has taken $15,000 off the typical \n     family's income. Continued deficit spending weakens the \n     economy, deteriorates living standards for younger workers \n     and seniors, and fuels resistance to the taxes that fund the \n     growing requirements of Social Security and other seniors' \n     programs.\n       The BBA would ensure TIMELY action to protect Social \n     Security in the future.\n       The Social Security Trustees predict that benefits will \n     exceed Social Security tax revenues by the year 2012--based \n     on optimistic assumptions. Passing the BBA now promises to \n     stem the tide of red ink spent on all other programs, in time \n     to prevent a double-whammy when Social Security's financing \n     needs escalate in a few years because of the retirement of \n     baby boomers.\n\n\n                               Quotable:\n\n       ``[T]he most serious threat to Social Security is the \n     federal government's fiscal irresponsibility. If we continue \n     to run federal deficits year after year, and if interest \n     payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, . . . [e]ither \n     we will raid the trust funds to pay for our current \n     profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly inflating our \n     way out of indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the real \n     value of the Social Security trust funds.\n       ``Regaining control of our fiscal affairs is the most \n     important step that we can take to protect the soundness of \n     the Social Security trust funds. I urge the Congress to make \n     that goal a reality--and to pass the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment without delay.''--Robert J. Myers, former Chief \n     Actuary and Deputy Commissioner for the Social Security \n     Administration, former Executive Director of the National \n     Commission on Social Security Reform\n\n       ``Dorcas Hardy, the former commissioner of Social Security, \n     emphasized this point in her book, Social Insecurity. Her \n     number one recommendation for protecting the Social Security \n     Trust Fund: Balance the federal budget.\n       ``The fact that I have spent my legislative career fighting \n     for seniors, for health care, and for other needed social \n     programs would, I hope, at least cause some to pause in their \n     passionate rhetoric to listen, and examine. . . . Only with \n     this Amendment can we be confident that all of us will have a \n     secure economic future.''--Former U.S. Senator Paul Simon (D-\n     Illinois).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n A Capital Spending Exemption--Not a Capital Idea for the Constitution\n\n       A special exemption for ``capital'' or ``investment'' \n     spending does not belong in the Balanced Budget Amendment to \n     the Constitution. A constitution deals with the most \n     fundamental responsibilities of the government and the \n     broadest, timeless principles of governance. It should not \n     set budget priorities or contain narrow policy decisions such \n     as defining a capital budget.\n       Whatever the merits are of making such spending a higher or \n     lower priority than it has been, this question is best \n     addressed in the annual budget process.\n       The debt is the threat to capital investment. Escalating \n     interest payments on the huge federal debt are crowding out \n     all other priorities. According to the National Entitlement \n     Commission's 1995 report: ``By 2012, unless appropriate \n     policy changes are made in\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\n     the interim, projected outlays for entitlements and interest \n     on the national debt will consume all tax revenues collected \n     by the federal government.'' That means no money left for \n     capital investment--or defense, education, the environment, \n     law enforcement, science, or other domestic discretionary \n     programs.\n       If states, businesses, and families can borrow, why \n     shouldn't the federal government? Everyone else repays the \n     principal they have borrowed. Families take out a mortgage \n     and then spend years paying it down. The same is true of \n     capital investments by businesses and state and local \n     governments. But the federal government just keeps borrowing \n     more. And more.\n       Unlike state budgets or family finances, the federal budget \n     is large enough to accommodate virtually all capital \n     expenditures on a regular, ongoing basis. The justification \n     that most businesses and state and local governments have for \n     capital budgeting is that they occasionally need to make one-\n     time, extraordinary expenditures that are amortized over a \n     long period of time.\n       The federal budget is so huge--now more than $1.6 \n     trillion--that almost no conceivable, one-shot project would \n     make even a small dent in it.\n       Even the federal Interstate Highway System, which has been \n     called the largest peacetime undertaking in all of human \n     history, was financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. President \n     Eisenhower initially proposed that the Interstate System be \n     financed through borrowing by selling special bonds. However, \n     Congress kept it on-budget and financed it through a gas tax \n     at the urging of then-Senator Albert Gore, Sr.\n       There are protections against the abuse of capital budgets \n     in state budgeting that do not constrain federal borrowing. \n     State and local governments have a check on their use of \n     capital budgets through bond ratings. If a state government \n     were to abuse its capital budget, then its bond rating would \n     drop and it would become difficult or impossible to continue \n     borrowing to finance additional expenditures. In addition, \n     many states require that bond issues be approved by the \n     voters.\n       While state capital spending is often placed off-budget, so \n     are state trust fund surpluses. According to a Price-\n     Waterhouse study, in recent years, state budgets would have \n     been roughly in balance if both capital expenditures and \n     trust funds (such as retirement funds) were included on-\n     budget.\n       The process of defining ``capital spending'' could be \n     abused. Even a category of ``capital'' or ``investment'' \n     spending that appeared to be tightly defined at first could \n     become a tempting loophole to future Congresses and \n     Presidents. For example, New York City, prior to its \n     financial crisis in the 1970s, amortized spending for school \n     textbooks by declaring their ``useful life'' to be 30 years.\n       Virtually any form of ``capital spending'' exemption would \n     perpetuate the crisis of deficit spending. Even an exemption \n     from the Balanced Budget Amendment for a narrow category in \n     the President's budget, major public physical capital \n     investment, would have allowed a deficit larger than the one \n     that actually occurred in FY 1996 ($116 billion vs. $107 \n     billion). It would result in an FY 1997 deficit that would \n     be, at most, 9 percent lower than current CBO projections \n     ($113 billion vs. $124 billion). Allowing deficit spending \n     for total federal investment outlays would have allowed \n     deficits larger than those that actually occurred in 28 of \n     the last 35 years. These estimates, of course, assume no \n     manipulation of definitions or accounting that would allow \n     still larger deficits.\n       The concept of a ``capital budget'' is too poorly defined \n     to put in the Constitution. Estimates of ``capital spending'' \n     could vary widely. There is wide disagreement among \n     policymakers about what should be included in a federal \n     capital budget. There is no commonly accepted federal budget \n     concept of this term. Therefore, any capital spending \n     exemption included in the Constitution would be left open to \n     a wide range of interpretations. In fact, the President's \n     budget includes several different categories of ``capital'' \n     and ``investment'' spending. For fiscal years 1996 and 1997, \n     these include:\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Fiscal year--\n                                                         ---------------\n                                                           1996    1997 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMajor physical capital investment.......................   115.9   113.0\nNet miscellaneous physical investment...................     3.1     3.1\nResearch and development................................    68.4    70.3\nEducation and training..................................    43.6    42.5\n                                                         ---------------\n    Total federal investment outlays....................   230.9   228.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment already allows for the \n     establishment of a capital budget--within the context of \n     regularly balanced budgets. The amendment does not prevent \n     the creation of separate operating and capital accounts. But \n     extraordinary expenditures which are large enough and unusual \n     enough to require significant new borrowing should be subject \n     to a higher threshold of approval, such as a three-fifth \n     majority vote. This is consistent with the recommendations of \n     General Accounting Office, which stated in its 1992 report, \n     Prompt Action Necessary to Avert Long-Term Damage to the \n     Economy:\n       . . . [t]he creation of explicit categories for government \n     capital and investment expenditures should not be viewed as a \n     license to run deficits to finance those categories . . . . \n     The choice between spending for investment and spending for \n     consumption should be seen as setting priorities within an \n     overall fiscal constraint, not as a reason for relaxing that \n     constraint and permitting a larger deficit.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from Utah for \nthe tremendous leadership he has displayed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. Kyl assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a right way and a wrong way to \nbalance the budget. And a constitutional amendment is the wrong way.\n  The choice is not whether to balance the Federal budget, but how to \ndo it. I believe we will adopt a budget this year that is balanced by \nthe year 2002. President Clinton has already submitted a budget to \naccomplish this goal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress are \nprepared to work together to enact a balanced budget.\n  We can balance the budget by statute, while setting appropriate \nspending priorities for the future. We can protect Social Security for \nsenior citizens. We can give priority to education and assure that \nfunds for schools will not be cut in the middle of the year. We can \ndeal with vital issues of national defense. We can deal with the need \nfor capital investments in highways, public transportation, and the \nenvironment.\n  Balancing the budget the right way is of special concern to the \npeople of Massachusetts. A new study by the Twentieth Century Fund \nconcludes that enactment of the balanced budget constitutional \namendment would have dire consequences for the State of Massachusetts \nand its residents. The study finds that Massachusetts health and human \nservices programs and educational programs receive more than three-\nquarters of their funds from the Federal Government. Three hundred \nthousand Massachusetts residents are employed in my State's health care \nsector alone.\n  This includes the work and the investment that the United States has \nin terms of the National Institutes of Health, since the nature of \nquality research really is unsurpassed in our part of the country. That \nwhole effort would be threatened, as would many other areas of research \nand technology which help to move our whole economy, our national \nsecurity defense, and the quality of health care forward.\n  That is 10.5 percent of our work force. Balancing the budget the \nwrong way by failing to give priority to these key programs would place \nat risk hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents and tens of \nthousands of jobs.\n  Republicans had the opportunity to address all of these concerns \nduring the Senate's debate on the balanced budget constitutional \namendment. But they refused to do so.\n  When the Judiciary Committee considered the proposed constitutional \namendment in January, I offered an amendment to protect Social \nSecurity. My amendment separated Social Security from the rest of the \nFederal budget, just as Congress has done by law for most of the past \n15 years. Senator Reid offered the same amendment here on the Senate \nfloor last week. But the Republican majority opposed this important \nprotection for the Nation's senior citizens.\n  Senator Torricelli offered an amendment to permit a capital budget, \njust as most States and most families do, as a way of investing for the \nlong run. Yet Republicans opposed this provision that is so important \nto the future of the economy.\n  If families were subjected to this rigid constitutional amendment, \nthey could never make long-term purchases. They couldn't buy a home \nthrough a mortgage, borrow money to send their children to college, or \nbuy a new car on credit.\n  This amendment flunks the kitchen table test. Families don't balance \ntheir budgets this way. Why should Uncle Sam?\n  Senator Durbin offered an amendment to allow greater spending \nflexibility during recessions to protect jobs and assist laid off \nworkers. More than 1,000 of the Nation's leading economists, including \n11 Nobel Prize winners, warned that the constitutional amendment \nproposed by the Republicans would put a straightjacket on the economy \nthat would make recessions worse. But Republicans ignored\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\nthe economic evidence and opposed our pro-family, pro-worker amendment.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment would also empower unelected \njudges to stop payments on Social Security checks or Medicare, or cut \nthe defense budget. It would have allowed the President to impound \nfunds appropriated by Congress, even though impoundment was outlawed in \n1974. But Republicans opposed our amendment to eliminate this problem.\n  All our efforts to change the proposed constitutional amendment--to \nprotect senior citizens, protect the national defense, protect workers \nin recessions--were summarily rejected by supporters of the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  In my view, the most serious defect in the proposed constitutional \namendment is its threat to Social Security.\n  Social Security is a contract with the Nation's senior citizens to \nguarantee at least a minimum level of security in their retirement \nyears.\n  In recognition of its special status, the Greenspan Commission \nrecommended in 1983 that Congress should place Social Security outside \nthe Federal budget. The Commission said we need to build up a \nsufficient surplus in the trust funds now, in order to have enough \nfunds to provide benefits to the current generation when they begin to \nretire.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans supported that result. In 1983, the \nCommission's recommendations were enacted in a law sponsored by Senator \nDole and Senator Moynihan. Their bill required Social Security to be \nplaced off-budget within 10 years. A bipartisan 58 to 14 vote, \nincluding 32 Republicans and 26 Democrats approved this important \nlegislation.\n  In 1985, Congress accelerated the process of placing Social Security \noutside the rest of the Federal budget. The Deficit Control Act of \n1985--the so-called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law--exempted Social Security \nfrom across-the-board cuts or sequestration.\n  That said, if they were not going to meet the budget titles, we were \ngoing to eliminate the cuts in Social Security from being sequestered \nlike other programs would be. The reason for that is, unlike other \nkinds of spending programs, people have paid in over their working \nlives into this fund and should be entitled to receive it at the time \nof their retirement. That is different from all of the other kinds of \nprograms. It was recognized by the Greenspan commission for that very \nreason--the contract with the American people, the contract with our \nsenior citizens--that they had paid in, and we should not undermine \ntheir sacred trust into which they paid in; unique in terms of all of \nthe Federal budget; recognized in a bipartisan way by the Greenspan \nCommission; recognized in the Gramm-Rudman proposal to be excluded and \nnot be subject to sequestration; recognized again in 1990 during the \nbudget debate.\n  When there was any question about it, a vote of 98 to 2 said they \nwill put Social Security outside of the consideration. There was a \nbipartisan commitment to do so. And, nonetheless, at the time we had \nthe markup in the Judiciary Committee--and here on the Senate floor--\nthose individuals that talk about Social Security state that Social \nSecurity recipients will have to fight it out with the rest of the \ninclusions in the budget.\n  That is not what this Congress said and the American people wanted--\nover 15 years, and a bipartisan effort. But that is what has been \nexcluded. And the answer that our friends give to that question is, \n``Oh, well, Social Security recipients will be further threatened if we \nhave a demise or a threat to our economy.''\n  Mr. President, we can deal with the economy of the United States, \nwhich is the strongest in the world. We should not be using the Social \nSecurity trust fund as a piggy bank either for tax cuts, as was \nthreatened in the course of last year, or other kinds of cuts. We had \nthe opportunity to support the Reid amendment, and that was rejected \nand turned down.\n  The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law also said that Social Security could no \nlonger be included in the unified budget of the U.S. Government.\n  From that point on, when Congress has adopted the annual Federal \nbudget resolutions, Social Security is not included. The last time the \nCongress of the United States voted on a budget that included Social \nSecurity was 1985.\n  Congress supported this change by wide bipartisan majorities. The \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings law was approved by a 61 to 31 vote in the Senate \nand a 271 to 154 vote in the House of Representatives.\n  In 1990, some Members of Congress proposed to put Social Security \nback into the Federal budget. But Senator Hollings and Senator Heinz \nrejected this unwise suggestion. They insisted that Social Security \nremain off budget, and the Senate approved an amendment to protect \nSocial Security by a 98 to 2 vote.\n  Again in 1995, section 22 of the congressional budget resolution \namended the Budget Act to strengthen even further the firewall \nprotecting the Social Security Program.\n  The proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would change \nall that. It would reverse 15 years of steady progress in protecting \nSocial Security. It would turn its back on all this recent history, and \nexpose Social Security to unwise and unacceptable cuts in the years \nahead\n  Employees may have worked hard all their lives. Social Security has \nbeen withheld from their paychecks month after month. They are \nexpecting the money to be available when they retire. But this \nconstitutional amendment places the entire program at risk.\n  This constitutional amendment is a back-door raid on Social Security, \nand all of us who have worked hard to protect Social Security in recent \nyears should reject it.\n  Another serious defect in the proposed constitutional amendment is \nits enforcement.\n  Thirteen of our Nation's most distinguished constitutional scholars \nwrote to me only yesterday expressing their deep concern about the \nproposed balanced budget constitutional amendment. The scholars include \nHarvard professor, Archibald Cox; former Attorney General, Nicholas \nKatzenbach; Yale professor, Burke Marshall; Stanford professor, \nKathleen Sullivan; Harvard professor, Larry Tribe; and others. They \nstated:\n\n       Whatever our differences about budget policy, we share the \n     conviction that enacting the proposed balanced budget \n     amendment would be a serious mistake. We believe that the \n     amendment would depart unwisely and unnecessarily from our \n     constitutional scheme.\n\n  These eminent constitutional experts further concluded that it \n``would transfer power over government spending from the Congress, \nwhere the Framers deliberately reposed it, to the President and the \ncourts.''\n  What happens when we find in the middle of the year that revenues are \nlower or expenses are higher than we thought and the budget for that \nyear will be unbalanced?\n  This constitutional amendment allows unelected judges to step in and \ndraw up a Federal budget of their own.\n  That was an issue that was debated in the last two Congresses. It was \nthe decision and the determination in the last two Congresses when we \ndebated this to limit the authority of the judges under the old \nDanforth amendment to permit courts only to make declaratory judgments. \nDo you think that has been included in this balanced budget amendment? \nAbsolutely not.\n  We saw in the last Congress the amendment that was prepared by \nSenator Nunn and others which was virtually unanimously accepted to \nalso exclude and limit further the power of the courts. Was that \nincluded? No. And all we can conclude is what was testified during the \ncourse of the Judiciary Committee hearings, and that is that the \nopportunity for the courts to interject themselves in making these \nbudgetary decisions will be available to them unless we pass other \nkinds of laws, and the other laws that we might pass may very well be \nunconstitutional. Why leave that up in the air? These were attempts to \naddress that issue, and they were rejected.\n  Judges are appointed to interpret the Constitution and the laws. They \nare respected legal experts. But they do not know what priority to give \nto Social Security or education, or defense, or the public health. They \ndon't know whether it is better in a particular year to reduce highway \nfunding or medical research. Congress is elected to set those \npriorities and make those changes, and we should not surrender\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nthat power to the judicial branch of government.\n  Proponents of the amendment say that they oppose judicial activism. \nYet this proposed constitutional amendment would be an invitation to \njudicial activism of the worst sort.\n  President Clinton wrote to Senator Daschle on January 28, reaffirming \nhis commitment to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002. The \nPresident also emphasized his view that a constitutional amendment was \nunacceptable. he stated,\n\n       We should not lock into the Constitution a form of \n     budgeting that simply may not be appropriate at another time. \n     . . . We must give future generations the freedom to \n     formulate the federal budget in ways they deem most \n     appropriate.\n\n  I urge the Senate to defeat this proposal. We are very close to \nbalancing the budget the right way. It makes no sense to do it the \nwrong way, by locking the country into a constitutional straightjacket.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter addressed to me dated March 3, \n1997 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 3, 1997.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The undersigned join in urging \n     Congress to reject the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment. \n     Whatever our disagreements about budget policy, we share the \n     conviction that enacting the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment would be a serious mistake. We believe that the \n     Amendment would depart unwisely and unnecessarily from our \n     constitutional scheme in the following ways:\n       It would transfer power over government spending from the \n     Congress, where the Framers deliberately reposed it, to the \n     President and the courts. Under the Amendment as drafted, the \n     President could assert the power or the obligation to impound \n     funds that Congress had authorized and appropriated. And \n     under the Amendment as drafted, the courts could be drawn \n     into extensive litigation over fiscal forecasts and policy \n     for which they are surely ill-equipped.\n       It would substitute minority rule for majority rule in \n     fiscal legislation, by way of the proposed three-fifths \n     voting requirements for deficit spending or increased \n     borrowing. As James Madison warned in The Federalist No. 58, \n     such supermajority requirements would allow a few to extract \n     ``unreasonable indulgences'' from the many.\n       It would invite Congress to shift the burden of national \n     policy objectives ``off-budget'' either to the States or to \n     the private sector through unfunded mandates or regulatory \n     burdens.\n       It would deprive Congress and the President of needed \n     flexibility to deal with economic circumstances that are \n     likely to change over time.\n       It would enact controversial socioeconomic policy into our \n     fundamental charter, which has maintained its authority since \n     the Founding by standing outside and above politics. The only \n     amendment to enact such a controversial policy in the past \n     was a failure: the 18th Amendment imposed Prohibition and the \n     21st repealed it.\n       It would use the Constitution needlessly to promote \n     objectives that are already fully capable of being achieved \n     through ordinary legislation. To the extent it proved \n     unenforceable, it would undermine respect for other \n     constitutional guarantees.\n           Sincerely,\n         Boris I.

Mr. President, I rise today to the pending \nconstitutional amendment. The authors of the amendment have called it \nthe balanced budget amendment. However, our vote today is not about \nbalancing the budget, but rather about jeopardizing the future economic \nstability of the United States and eliminating the carefully crafted \nconstitutional balance of powers. The amendment simply requires the \nPresident to submit a balanced budget; it does not mandate that \nCongress enact a balanced budget and it establishes no guidelines on \nenacting a balanced budget. This is not only the most dangerous budget \ngimmick put before this body, but it sets a dangerous precedent for \naddressing important issues facing us today and in the future.\n  What the supporters of this amendment fail to point out is that we do \nnot need to amend the U.S. Constitution to balance the budget. The \nPresident recently submitted to Congress a budget plan that does \nbalance by the year 2002 and still protects our most vulnerable \ncitizens; children, the disabled, and senior citizens. The President's \nproposal also continues our investment in education, environmental \nprotection, biomedical research, and criminal justice. Instead of \nworking on this proposal and enacting a budget for fiscal year 1998, we \nhave spent almost a month debating an empty promise. Congress has a \nstatutory requirement to pass a budget resolution by April 15, yet \nneither body has begun this process. We have spent valuable time \ndebating an amendment that will not get us any closer to a balanced \nbudget. I support a balanced budget; I have supported a balanced \nbudget. What I cannot support is the misuse of the Constitution. The \nConstitution should only be used to expand rights and protections for \ncitizens excluded from the original document. Our Constitution should \nnot be used to limit the rights of our citizens or the obligations of \nthe Federal Government.\n  When I first came to Congress in 1993, the deficit was close to $300 \nbillion. I made a decision to try and secure a position on the Senate \nBudget Committee because I realized the most important thing I could do \nfor the families in Washington State was to reduce the deficit. I \nworked with my colleagues in 1993 and passed a successful deficit \nreduction package. The deficit reduction proposal enacted in 1993, \nwithout one Republican vote, has cut the deficit in half. For 4 \nstraight years in a row the deficit has declined. We reversed the \ntrends of the 1980's and restored fiscal restraint to the Federal \nbudget process. Enacting this landmark deficit reduction package, \nrequired tough and difficult choices. But, that is why my constituents \nsent me to the U.S. Senate. I am willing to make those difficult \nchoices as long as they are fair and balanced. A constitutional \namendment to balance the budget does not force us to make those tough \nchoices. Keep in mind that this amendment does not go into effect until \nthe States adopt it. The States will have 7 years to ratify. Seven \nyears is a long time when you are trying to balance the budget. I \nsupported a revision to the amendment that would have shortened from 7 \nto 3 years that time allowed for the States to ratify. Unfortunately, \nthis change was rejected. We should not wait even 3 years; we should \nstart now.\n  There is no one in this Chamber who will deny that our Constitution \nhas served us well. It established the longest continuous democratic \ngovernment in the world. This document and the Bill of Rights are the \nenvy of the world. Within this document our Founding Fathers \nspelled out the role of each branch of government. The responsibilities \nof the legislative, judicial, and executive branches were all clearly \nspelled out and a system of checks and balances was added so as to \nensure that no one branch unduly influenced the other. One of the most \nimportant responsibilities entrusted to the legislative branch was the \npower to tax and spend. Our Founding Fathers felt very strongly that \nelected representatives of the people must be responsible for deciding \non spending and taxes. As a member of both the Senate Budget Committee \nand Appropriations Committee, I do not take this responsibility \nlightly. But, a vote in support of this amendment will forever alter \nthe role of Congress and the courts in deciding on spending priorities \nfor the Federal Government. For the first time in history, the courts \ncould decide how we spend tax dollars and how we raise tax dollars. A \ngroup of nine unelected officials could establish budget policy that \nconflicts with the wishes of the people solely because they believe \nthat receipts will not cover outlays. Every time the Federal Government \nwishes to spend for Social Security or for a natural disaster, the \ncourts could simply\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\nsay that this obligation would push spending beyond receipts.\n\n  One need only look at the current difference between the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget. \nOMB has estimated that the President's budget gets to balance by the \nyear 2002. However, CBO disputes the estimates on revenues and economic \ngrowth used by OMB. Who decides? The courts? Who decides what will be \ncut or what taxes raised to bring the budget into balance if Congress \nand the White House fail to agree? Judicial oversight of the Federal \nbudget process violates the clear role of Congress and puts greater \npowers into the hands of unelected, life-time appointed Justices on the \nSupreme Court.\n  In an effort to clarify any questions about the role of the courts, \nSenator Kennedy offered an amendment that would prohibit judicial \ncontrol of the budget process. This amendment was defeated and rejected \nby the supporters of the constitutional amendment who claimed it was \nnot necessary. Yet many legal and constitutional scholars have made it \nclear that the way the current amendment is written will allow for \ncourt challenges to Federal budget policy and decisions.\n  In 1983, Congress enacted several measures aimed at protecting the \nlong term financial stability of the Social Security trust fund. The \nintent of these measures was to build a large surplus and reserve in \nthe trust fund that could be drawn down when the baby boomers started \nto retire. The 1983 legislation included tax increases, benefit \nreductions, and other structural reforms, all with the goal of \nprotecting the system. Those who supported the 1983 legislation did so \nto protect the greater good, namely Social Security benefits for \nmillions of current and future retirees. As a result, it is estimated \nthat Social Security will not need to draw on these reserves until the \nyear 2019. But, at that point, total spending will outpace receipts \ninto the system. Under the current language in the amendment, we could \nnot pay benefits using the surplus that we have intentionally allowed \nto accumulate. Regardless of any effort to maintain a surplus over the \nyears, benefits would be in jeopardy, unless we raise payroll taxes or \ndrastically cut spending in other areas, like Medicare, Medicaid, or \neducation.\n  This is not just my opinion. Recently a report from the nonpartisan \nAmerican Law Division of the Congressional Research Service determined \nthat we would be prohibited from drawing down the surplus in the trust \nfund in order to pay benefits unless there was a surplus in the \nremaining portion of the budget. Maintaining a large enough surplus in \nthe remaining portion of the Federal budget would require significant \nreductions in many other important programs like Medicare, defense, \neducation, environmental protection, and law enforcement. Passage of \nthis amendment violates the current contract with today's workers that \nif you pay into the system now, Social Security will be there when you \nretire. There were several attempts to correct this flaw and exclude \nSocial Security from the balanced budget amendment, but all attempts \nfailed as the supporters of the amendment claimed that we did not need \nto protect Social Security.\n  I have heard that voting for this amendment is the courageous vote. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The courageous vote is the \nvote in support of a plan that actually reduces the deficit and puts us \non a real path to balancing the budget by the year 2002. Today's vote \nis about political rhetoric, not reality. I hope that the political \nrhetoric is over and that we can begin the real task of balancing the \nbudget.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to make \nclear my feelings on one particular aspect of the debate over the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  My opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 1 is strongly felt and \nclearly stated. I simply do not believe that it is appropriate to \nenshrine a restrictive fiscal policy in our Nation's most sacred text. \nThe balanced budget amendment would seriously inhibit our ability to \nset prudent fiscal policy and respond to cyclical patterns in economic \ngrowth. Moreover, the amendment has serious implications for our \nforeign policy.\n  I am also concerned about the balanced budget amendment's effect on \nSocial Security. The Social Security Program is one of the longest \nrunning and most successful programs this country has ever undertaken. \nIt has succeeded in virtually eliminating poverty among our Nation's \nsenior citizens. I yield to no one in my commitment to preserving and \nprotecting it.\n  In 1983, when Social Security was faced with changing demographics \nthat threatened its very existence, I supported the reforms that \nensured that this vital program would survive to meet the needs of \nfuture generations. Today, I am very concerned that the program is \nthreatened by the restrictive provisions of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. If Congress is allowed to count Social \nSecurity surpluses when determining if the budget is in balance, this \ncritical safety net for our Nation's seniors could be placed in \njeopardy.\n  For these reasons, I support efforts to protect the Social Security \ntrust funds. If a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is to \nbe enacted, certainly, it should not be one that endangers the \nretirement security of American families. This is why I supported the \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Reid, which modified the \nunderlying resolution to state that the Social Security trust funds \ncould not be used to achieve balance.\n  But I am afraid I could not support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague Senator Dorgan. This amendment would have also protected \nSocial Security, but, unlike Senator Reid's amendment, it was a \nsubstitute amendment, a fully crafted, alternative balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I have grave concerns about any attempt to amend the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget. These concerns cannot be \nsatisfied simply by changing one or two components of the legislation, \nas sincere and as sensible as those changes might be. I find any \nbalanced budget amendment highly problematic, and this is why I have \nvoted against the alternative balanced budget amendment offered by my \ngood friend from North Dakota.\n  I am a stalwart defender of Social Security, and I am committed to \nseeing that it protects future generations as well as it has protected \nprevious ones. But I remain opposed to any amendment that would taint \nthe language of the Constitution and weaken our ability to make prudent \npolicy.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Let me be very clear, I \nwant a balanced budget, and I am committed to do everything I can to \nachieve this goal. However, I do not believe we must amend the \nConstitution in order to balance the budget.\n  I will oppose this amendment because it is unnecessary; because I am \nconvinced that it threatens the viability of Social Security, and \nbecause it makes no provisions for investing in our infrastructure.\n  This amendment does nothing to balance the budget. We already have \nthe tools to do that. Since President Clinton's first term in the White \nHouse and my second term in the Senate, the deficit has fallen \ndramatically from $290 billion in 1992 to $107 billion in 1996. This \namount represents just 1.4 percent of our gross domestic product, the \nsmallest percentage of any industrialized nation. Clearly, as the past \nfew years have shown us, we can continue to reduce the deficit--until \nit is balanced--without amending the Constitution.\n  Many supporters of the balanced budget amendment believe that if you \ncan balance the family budget, you can balance the Federal budget. But \nif each family lived by a balanced budget amendment, then mortgages, \ncar loans, and student loans would be prohibited. In effect, a balanced \nbudget amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from making the \nkind of investments for our future that our families make every day.\n  Investments in our infrastructure would be threatened because the \nbalanced budget amendment makes no provisions for a capital budget.\n  Even State governments that require a balanced budget have a separate \nbudget for capital projects, such as\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\nhighways, schools, et cetera. The balanced budget amendment would \nrestrict our ability to improve our infrastructure.\n  To address this issue, Senator Feinstein and Senator Torricelli each \noffered an amendment to provide for a capital budget for infrastructure \ninvestments. I voted for both the Feinstein and Torricelli amendments. \nUnfortunately, both amendments were defeated.\n  Recently, 11 Nobel prize-winning economists announced their \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment because they felt it would \nput the country in an economic straitjacket. They make a very \ncompelling case. I have no doubt that the balanced budget amendment \nwould tie the Federal Government in knots, restricting our ability to \nrespond to emergencies and economic downturns. Even the Wall Street \nJournal referred to the balanced budget amendment as politically empty \nsymbolism. I agree with them.\n  Finally, I believe the balanced budget amendment threatens the Social \nSecurity system. Under the balanced budget amendment, there is no \nprotection for Social Security benefits. If the Government finds that \nthe budget is not balanced, the Social Security trust fund could be \nused to make up the difference. I voted for the Reid amendment which \nwould have exempted the Social Security trust fund from the balanced \nbudget amendment. I regret that this amendment was defeated.\n  Mr. President, I will not allow the Social Security trust fund to be \nused to balance the budget. We have a contract with our senior citizens \nand I plan to honor that contract. A promise made must be a promise \nkept. Without protections for Social Security, I will have to vote \nagainst the balanced budget amendment.\n  I fully support the goal of balancing the budget but a constitutional \namendment is not the way to do it. We need to continue to reduce \nspending to reach a balanced budget in an orderly manner that \nrecognizes national priorities such as Social Security and the \nimportance of making investments in our future.\n  Mr. President, I stand ready to continue working toward a balanced \nbudget but tampering with the Constitution is not the way to do it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate will vote for \nthe third time in 2 years on a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Two years ago, during our first debate on this amendment, \nI argued that\n\n       [T]here is nothing inherent in American democracy that \n     suggests we amend our basic and abiding law to deal with the \n     fugitive tendencies of a given moment.\n\n  My point was that a series of one-time events in the 1980s had given \nrise to our recent fiscal disorders, and that a constitutional \namendment was an inappropriate and indeed unnecessary response.\n  Enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 had, after \na decade of reckless deficit spending, returned us to a path of fiscal \nresponsibility. At the time of its enactment, OBRA 93 was estimated to \nbring about $500 billion in deficit reduction over 5 years. Three and \none-half years later, estimates are that the total deficit reduction \nunder the 1993 legislation will be more like $924 billion. So we are on \nthe right track.\n  In fact, we are even closer to a balanced budget than one might \nimagine--and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution has \nnothing to do with how to achieve it.\n  A balanced budget is easily within reach, if only we have the courage \nto seize the opportunity soon. In January 1996 and again in January \n1997, I proposed a simple plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. \nIn addition to recommendations that were generally in both the \nPresident's budget proposal and the budget proposals offered by the \nRepublicans, my plan requires only two actions:\n  First, correct by 1.1 percentage points the overindexation of \nGovernment programs and tax laws; and\n  Second, postpone tax cuts.\n  That is all that needs to be done. It is all that ought to be done. \nIt is not the time for tax cuts. Nor it is the time for crippling cuts \nin domestic discretionary spending. A correction of 1.1 percentage \npoints, as recommended in December by the Advisory Commission to Study \nthe Consumer Price Index appointed by the Finance Committee, or the \nBoskin Commission as it has come to be known, would save $1 trillion in \n12 years --and it would put Social Security into actuarial balance \nuntil the year 2052.\n  The economics profession is behind this proposal, as is the Chairman \nof the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Dr. Alan \nGreenspan, who testified before the Finance Committee on January 30 of \nthis year. Dr. Greenspan's own estimate of the overstatement of the \ncost of living by the Consumer Price Index is 0.5 to 1.5 percentage \npoints per year, which is quite close to the estimate of the Boskin \nCommission. Notably, referring to the familiar argument that the \ndecision to correct cost of living adjustment factors should not be \npoliticized, Dr. Greenspan had the definitive response: not to act, \ngiven the overwhelming evidence that the CPI is an upwardly biased \nmeasure of inflation, is the political fix.\n  Let us be absolutely clear about the direction of this bias. BLS \nCommissioner Katharine Abraham acknowledged at a February 11 Finance \nCommittee hearing that the CPI is ``an upper bound measure on change in \nthe cost of living.''\n  So there is broad agreement in the economics community. And \nencouragingly, it appears we are close to agreement in Congress and the \nExecutive Branch. Last week, Majority Leader Lott suggested that the \nappointment of a panel of graybeards on the issue was in order. The \nPresident immediately said he would take the Leader's suggestion under \nadvisement. Then on Friday, in a meeting with editors and reporters at \nthe Washington Post, OMB Director Franklin Raines expressed support for \nSenator Lott's proposal. Director Raines noted that the ``CPI is a very \naccurate price index, while only being an okay cost of living index.'' \nAnd now in this morning's New York Times, there is an article by \nRichard W. Stevenson headlined ``Clinton Wants Deal With Congress on \nCost-of-Living Adjustments.'' It begins:\n\n       President Clinton gave his aides the go-ahead today to try \n     to forge a deal with Congress to reduce cost-of-living \n     adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs, \n     White House officials said.\n\n  This is an important step forward by the Administration. Getting an \naccurate measure of the cost of living is the right thing to do, and it \nis the only way to put our fiscal affairs in order.\n\n  I should add that although this issue has reemerged only recently, \nthe fact that the CPI overstates the cost of living is not a new \nunderstanding. I came to Washington with the Kennedy Administration 35 \nyears ago. Upon our arrival in 1961, we had waiting for us a report by \na National Bureau of Economic Research committee on ``The Price Indexes \nof the Federal Government.'' The committee was headed by George J. \nStigler, who went on to win a Nobel Prize in economics. The report \nnoted that:\n\n       If a poll were taken of professional economists and \n     statisticians, in all probability they would designate (and \n     by a wide majority) the failure of the price indexes to take \n     full account of quality changes as the most important defect \n     in these indexes. And by almost as large a majority, they \n     would believe that this failure introduces a systematic \n     upward bias in the price indexes--that quality changes have \n     on average been quality improvements.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope we don't allow this moment to pass us by. It is \nthe right thing to do, and we ought to do it soon. We could have a \nbalanced budget plan in place and forget this foolishness about \namending the Constitution.\n  If you don't think it is foolish, ask any economist. Last month, as \nthe Senate began this debate, more than 1,000 economists, including 11 \nNobel Prize winners, signed a statement imploring Congress to reject \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. The economists wrote:\n\n  We condemn the proposed ``balanced budget'' amendment to the federal \nConstitution. It is unsound and unnecessary.\n       The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the \n     face of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall \n     and some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These \n     so-called ``built-in stabilizers'' limit declines of after-\n     tax income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced \n     every year would aggravate recessions.\n\n  May I say, to paraphrase Santayana, that we may be condemned to \nrepeat\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\nan awful period in our history if this amendment is adopted. The \nhistorical precedent is chilling: in 1930, 1,028 economists implored \nPresident Hoover to veto the Smoot-Hawley tariff legislation. He \nignored their pleas, with disastrous consequences. A 60 percent drop in \ntrade; worldwide depression; the rise of totalitarian regimes; and in \nthe wake of such events, the Second World War.\n  Now, with the list of signatories growing, the economics profession \nis again pleading with us to reject this constitutional amendment. If \nwe defeat the amendment, we will preserve the sanctity of our \nConstitution and promote economic stability. If we adopt it and it is \nratified by the states, we will return to the dark ages of economic \npolicy, having disregarded 60 years of social learning.\n  As I indicated earlier, a great part of the rationale for the \nbalanced budget amendment has been the problem of deficits and the \nrising national debt. Yet our problems with deficits are quite recent, \nhaving been generated in the relatively brief period of the 1980's. \nThese deficits marked a sharp departure from the fiscal problems of \nearlier administrations, which were directed primarily to the problem \nof a persistent full employment surplus, with its accompanying downward \npressure on consumer demand.\n  The full-employment budget concept was explained by then-OMB Director \nGeorge P. Shultz in his fiscal year 1973 budget:\n\n       . . . expenditures should not exceed the level at which the \n     budget would be balanced under conditions of full employment.\n\n  Which is to say that in the absence of full employment, as was the \ncase in fiscal year 1973, the Federal Government should deliberately \ncontrive to incur a deficit equal to the difference between the \nrevenues that would actually come in at levels of underemployment, and \nthose that would come in at full employment. Far from being inevitable \nand unavoidable, there were points in the business cycle where a \ndeficit had to be created. Otherwise surpluses would choke off \nrecovery.\n  The term ``full employment surplus'' had originated earlier. The \nJanuary 1962 report of the Council of Economic Advisers explained that \nas the recovery from the recession of 1958 got underway, economic \nactivity grew and so did the revenues of the Federal Government. But \nCongress would not spend the additional revenue. As a result, the \nrecovery stalled. This untoward event was ascribed to ``fiscal drag.''\n  Beginning in 1980, the Reagan White House and Office of Management \nand Budget set about creating a crisis by creating deficits intended to \nforce Congress to cut certain programs. In a television address 16 days \nafter his inauguration, President Reagan said:\n\n       There were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be \n     cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know we can lecture \n     our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and \n     breath. Or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing \n     their allowance.\n\n  Haynes Johnson wrote of this in ``Sleepwalking Through History: \nAmerica Through the Reagan Years'' (1991). I will simply quote a \nfootnote on page 111:\n\n       [Stockman's] former mentor Moynihan was the first to charge \n     that the Reagan Administration ``consciously and deliberately \n     brought about'' higher deficits to force congressional \n     domestic cuts. Moynihan was denounced and then proven \n     correct, except that the cuts to achieve balanced budgets \n     were never made and the deficits ballooned even higher.\n\n  The point is that the huge deficits and debt of the 1980's were \nintentional and anomalous, and therefore the balanced budget amendment \nis an inappropriate response. A balanced budget amendment would undo \nall that we have learned about economic policy over the past six \ndecades--a lesson that can be easily seen in the fluctuations of the \nbusiness cycle over the last 125 years. We had enormous volatility in \neconomic activity prior to 1945--volatility that would be unacceptable \ntoday. For example, in 1905, output increased by 9.2 percent, to be \nfollowed 2 years later by declines of 1.6 and 5.5 percent in 1907 and \n1908 respectively, and an increase of 11.7 percent in 1909. Output \nincreased by 16.2 percent in 1916 and by 7.7 percent in 1918, to be \nfollowed by 3 consecutive years of negative growth. And then, of course \nthere was the Great Depression. After increasing by 6.4 percent in \n1929, output fell by 8.9 percent in 1930, another 7.8 percent in 1931, \nand then a further decline of an incredible 13.3 percent in 1932. After \nWorld War II all this changed, following a brief adjustment period, as \nthe country converted from a wartime to peacetime economy. Since then \nthe largest reduction in output was 2.3 percent in 1982.\n  In the 1970's, I asked Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Charles \nL. Schultze to analyze what would have happened if a balanced budget \namendment had been in force in the middle of the 1975 recession. He \nreported back that the computers at the Council ``blew up.'' GDP--then \ncalled GNP--would have dropped another 12 percent in an economy in \nwhich output was already 5 percent below capacity. During the debate in \nthe last Congress, this simulation was repeated by the Treasury \nDepartment and by our minority Finance Committee staff, with the same \nresults. With a balanced budget amendment, a moderate recession in \nwhich the unemployment rate increases by 2-3 percent becomes a major \ncontraction--may I say depression--in which unemployment soars over 10 \npercent and output falls by 15 percent or more. In the entire post-\nWorld War II era the unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent only for a \nbrief 10 months during the 1981-82 recession.\n  Just as importantly, a balanced budget amendment would undo the \nprogress we have already made, which I referred to earlier. Two years \nago, in arguing against House Joint Resolution 1, I noted:\n\n       As a result of the deficit reduction policies [put in place \n     by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993] we have had \n     three straight years of deficit reduction--the first such \n     string of declines since the administration of Harry S. \n     Truman. Here are the numbers: FY 1992 $290.4 billion; FY 1993 \n     $255.1 billion; FY 1994 $203.2 billion; OMB 1995 est., $192.5 \n     billion; and CBO 1995 est. $176 billion.\n\n  As I have said, our progress has been even better than expected. \nRemarkably, the deficit for fiscal year 1995 was lower than projected: \n$163.8 billion compared to projections of $176-$192 billion. The fiscal \n1996 deficit is even lower--$107.3 billion, just 1.4 percent of GDP, \nresulting in 4 consecutive years of deficit reduction. And, for the \nfirst time since the 1960's, we have a primary surplus--that is, \nexcluding interest payments, revenues exceed outlays.\n  Adoption of a balanced budget amendment--which as I said last year \nwould be tantamount to ``writing algebra into the Constitution''--can \nonly jeopardize the progress we have made. We can and will complete the \njob of balancing the budget without this amendment. It would be \ndisastrous for our economy, and I hope it will once again be defeated.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few minutes of \nthe Senate's time to comment about the balanced budget amendment on \nwhich we will be voting today.\n  I came to the Senate in January 1983, at a point in time when the \nFederal Government was making terribly unwise choices about spending \nand revenues. Our budget deficits were off the charts during these \nReagan years, and I felt that the very foundation of sound fiscal \npolicy was being undermined. These were the years when we needed to \nhave more serious debate about bringing spending under control--and \nwhen we needed to at least consider a more serious response such as \namending the Constitution to require balanced budgets.\n  We have a very different situation today. During the last 4 years, \nthe budget deficit has declined remarkably. Tough choices are being \nmade about spending and revenue which are bringing the deficit down to \nlevels thought unimaginable only a few years ago. And today we nearly \nhave unanimous bipartisan support to bring the budget into balance by \n2002. The Nation's budget deficit, as a percentage of gross national \nproduct, is the smallest it has been in decades and the least of all \nthe great industrial powers.\n  The difference between today and 14 years ago is that we are clearly \nmoving strongly in the right direction, not through amendments to our \nNation's most important legal document, but by debating our national \npriorities and making our spending better reflect those priorities.\n  I believe in balancing the budget, but sound fiscal management \ndemands that such balance be achieved by responsible choices that \nreflect our values--\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\nhelping those in need, promoting long-term infrastructure investment, \nand promoting high-wage job growth in our Nation. Those who have \ndoggedly pursued this amendment to the Constitution did not do so when \nthe budget imbalances were growing by great leaps during the Reagan \nadministration; a balanced budget was not their concern. But cutting \ntaxes on those who are best off is one of their primary concerns--and \nit was in part the spending profligacy of the early Reagan years \ncombined with the ill-considered and regressive Kemp-Roth tax cut that \ncreated the enormous deficits we are financing today. We are actually \nspending less today than the Treasury is taking in--but because of \nenormous interest payments which take up nearly 20 percent of our \nentire annual spending, our budget is still in the red.\n  We must be careful about confusing serious budget balancing efforts \nwith partisan exercises that could disrupt the fiscal foundation of the \ncountry.\n  One of my major concerns about this amendment 2 years ago which \nremains today is that the House still has in place a rule requiring \nthree-fifths supermajority vote to raise income tax rates and income \ntax rates alone. Under the House rule, other taxes--such as the gas \ntax, Social Security tax, or other excise taxes--can still be raised by \na simple majority, taxes that impact far more many of the working \nfamilies from New Mexico whom I represent. This House rule stands as an \nobstacle to efforts to use the income tax, our most progressive tax, to \nraise revenues for deficit reduction.\n  The balanced budget amendment that has been proposed does not help us \nresolve many of the problems that challenge our future economic health. \nPassing this resolution does not help us solve the challenge to Social \nSecurity that looms in our future. It is clear that we must address the \nproblem of solvency of the Social Security trust fund, but as written \nthis amendment could cause a train wreck at the point when Social \nSecurity disbursements become greater than Social Security receipts. At \nleast under one interpretation of the proposed amendment, countless \nseniors could experience disruption in receiving their checks.\n\n  During a time of severe economic hardship and recession, the \nGovernment has traditionally helped by using fiscal policy to prime the \neconomy and jolt it toward growth. Such a strategy would not be \npossible given the requirements outlined in the balanced budget \namendment. In addition, national security demands, the need to increase \nspending to thwart aggressive moves by some future enemy, or to respond \nto some military crisis might also be improperly constrained by the \nbalanced budget amendment as written. There is also no provision in the \nbalanced budget amendment permitting Congress to develop a capital \nbudget, a budget capable of distinguishing between spending to meet \ncurrent operating expenses and spending over a series of years for \nmajor capital improvements, such as highways, buildings, or a Federal \nagency's computer systems. I voted for amendments that would have made \nimprovements in the balanced budget amendment and which would have made \nthis a more workable piece of legislation, but all of these improving \namendments were defeated.\n  The authors of this amendment are pursuing too rigid a course--and \nare bent more on a theology of balanced budgets without taxes than they \nare on the economic health of the Nation.\n  Also left unaddressed in this proposed amendment is the enforcing \nmechanism. When the Congress fails to govern responsibly and does not \nproduce a balanced budget as called for by the Constitution, does the \nSupreme Court, as the chief interpreter of the Nation's Constitution, \ndecide what accounts will be advanced and what accounts cut in order to \nachieve balance? These matters are unresolved and threaten to create \nconfusion and harm our Nation's fiscal solvency--rather than create the \norder and balance that the Nation needs and wants.\n  I will oppose the balanced budget amendment today because I believe \nthat we should leave the question of how to achieve sound fiscal policy \nto a vote of a majority here in Congress. We should not try, by rule or \nother provision, to determine how future Congresses choose to reduce \nthe deficit or keep the budget in balance. We should not dictate \nwhether they cut spending or raise taxes. We should not try to \npredetermine for future Congresses, as this amendment would, which \ngroup of taxpayers will pay the taxes and which group will suffer the \nspending cuts. Because of the way that the balanced budget amendment is \nconstructed, our decisions would be locked in permanently if this \namendment were to become part of the Constitution. This is not wise, \nand I cannot support such an effort.\n  The framers of the Constitution chose to leave neutral the way in \nwhich sound fiscal policy is achieved. We are well advised to defer to \ntheir good judgment on that subject, to cease our efforts to solve this \nproblem by changing the Constitution, and instead, to solve it as we \nshould--by continuing to make tough choices that reflect the priorities \nof our Nation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, during this year's debate on the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment the Senate Republican Policy Committee \nprepared more than 20 papers to assist Republican Senators with our \ndeliberations. Some of these papers have particular importance for the \nconstitutional and political debate which has been going on for decades \nand which is going to continue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several of these papers be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the U.S. Republican Policy Committee, Feb. 25, 1997]\n\n       Overlooked Effects of Excluding Social Security From BBCA\n\n       For years, leading opponents of the bipartisan balanced \n     budget constitutional amendment (BBCA) have been hiding \n     behind the gimmick of excluding Social Security from the \n     calculation of a balanced budget. While it is difficult to \n     take their proposal (S.J. Res. 12) seriously, it is \n     imperative to realize its very serious effects.\n\n\n                       what s.j. res. 12 would do\n\n       The actual consequences of S.J. Res. 12 would be the direct \n     opposite of the positive economic effects provided by a real \n     balanced budget requirement.\n       S.J. Res. 12, over 30 years, would start with decreasing \n     deficits--achieve a moment of surplus (requiring enormous new \n     taxes or spending cuts)--enter a phase of declining surpluses \n     (to perhaps one-year's balance)--and then revert to \n     skyrocketing deficits.\n       It would create $2.3 trillion in ``gimmick deficits'' \n     between 1998 and 2018.\n       It would result in tax hikes and/or spending cuts of $1.935 \n     trillion from 2002 to 2018.\n       That $1.935 trillion is more than eight times Clinton's \n     largest-ever 1993 tax hike of $240 billion and almost five \n     times the amount of CBO's estimated savings ($423 billion) of \n     what it will take to reach balance between today and 2002. \n     While surpluses are not bad per se, this enormous level over \n     such short duration would produce massive fiscal strain.\n       It would result in less than two decades of nondeficit \n     spending, and just one year in which the federal budget might \n     actually balance.\n       It would provide no possibility for tax cut or spending \n     increase unless a recession occurs.\n       It would require absolute spending cuts in five of the \n     first six years after the amendment, and a return to huge \n     federal deficits in little more than two decades--$700 \n     billion from 2019-2024 and $2.474 trillion from 2019-2028, \n     all perfectly off-budget and constitutionally legal.\n       S.J. Res. 12 could be worse than doing nothing because of \n     the high probability of massive tax increases that would \n     destroy economic growth.\n\n\n                     what s.j. res. 12 would not do\n\n       S.J. Res. 12 would not provide any additional support for \n     Social Security.\n       It would not protect the trust fund--it will begin running \n     deficits just seven years after its outlays begin exceeding \n     revenues in 2012--exactly the current estimation. The trust \n     fund would be bankrupt just 10 years after that (2029)--also \n     the current estimation.\n       The trust fund balance sheet would not change by a single \n     dime and its solvency calendar would not be altered by a \n     single day.\n       S.J. Res. 12 would not alter the fact that Social Security \n     is a pay-as-you-go system and always has been.\n       It would not provide a long-term solution. By pretending \n     there exists some hidden balance, it would forestall a real \n     solution to Social Security's long-term imbalance.\n       Simultaneously, S.J. Res. 12 would damage Social Security \n     because Social Security's existence depends on a growing \n     economy to meet its growing commitments--something S.J. Res. \n     12's likely tax hikes would seriously jeopardize.\n\n\n            how implausible are s.j. res. 12's requirements?\n\n       Every dime of the $1.935 trillion that would be \n     artificially added to the deficit between\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\n     2002 and 2018 would have to be payed for with tax hikes and/\n     or spending cuts.\n       In the 2002-2007 period, spending literally would have to \n     be cut in five of the six years under S.J. Res. 12, even \n     under CBO's most recent baseline spending estimates for a \n     balanced budget. By contrast, Congress's failed 1995 effort \n     to balance the budget was vetoed by Clinton, and it merely \n     slowed the rate of spending's growth.\n       Spending would decline in absolute terms--not just \n     reductions in the rate of growth.\n       How rare are absolute spending cuts? Only nine times since \n     1933 have they occurred. Eight were due to severe economic \n     contraction or postwar economies: 1935, 1937, and 1938 during \n     the Depression, the first three years following World War II, \n     and the first two years after the Korean War.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   [From the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, Jan. 29, 1997]\n\nA Gimmick Even the President Won't Embrace--Clinton's Remarks Undercut \n                             BBCA Opponents\n\n       ``We couldn't right now, neither the Republicans nor I and \n     the Congress, could produce a balanced budget tomorrow that \n     could pass with, if you said the Social Security funds cannot \n     be counted, if you will, as part of the budget.'' --President \n     Clinton at his January 28th press conference.\n       President Clinton does not support a balanced budget \n     constitutional amendment (BBCA), but yesterday, on the \n     record, he refused to accept the flimsy, implausible cover \n     being used by some of its congressional opponents who are \n     going to vote against the amendment unless Social Security is \n     taken out of it.\n       The sentence from the transcript of the President's press \n     conference that is quoted above is not the clearest example \n     of oral expression that we have ever seen, but, clearly what \n     the President was saying was: A balanced budget is not \n     possible if Social Security is taken off budget and not taken \n     into account in calculating the deficit.\n       Simply, Social Security is currently running a surplus and \n     is expected to do so for the near term. Thus, if Social \n     Security is removed from the budget calculations, the deficit \n     will be falsely inflated by hundreds of billions of dollars. \n     For example, if Social Security were to be omitted, the \n     deficit would grow by an additional $465 billion during \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2002 and by another $602 billion \n     during fiscal years 2003-2007, for a total of $1.067 trillion \n     over the 10-year period. This is on top of the very real \n     deficits with which Congress has been struggling for years.\n       Last year, the President and the Congress each made \n     proposals that would have cut the deficit by about $500 \n     billion for fiscal years 1997 through 2002. $500 billion is a \n     lot of money, but it is less than one-half of the amount that \n     the opponents' proposal would falsely add to the deficit if \n     Social Security is taken out of the balanced budget \n     calculations.\n       It's interesting when the President, no stranger to \n     gimmicks, is willing to expose the ruse of his friends. \n     Recall that this president offered a budget that used \n     ``triggers'' to precipitously cut off spending programs in \n     its final two years in order to be able to claim to teach \n     ``balance.'' And, he offered a budget which shifts the \n     fastest growing portion of Medicare--Home Health Care--from \n     Medicare to the general taxpayer in order to claim he is \n     ``saving'' Medicare.\n       If the opponents of a Balanced Budget Constitutional \n     Amendment are fiscally responsible, they will show us the tax \n     increases and spending cuts that they propose to enact to \n     make up for the $1.067 trillion that would artificially be \n     added to the deficit under their proposal by taking Social \n     Security out of the calculation. After all, those hiding \n     behind Social Security's exclusion to cover their opposition \n     are proposing to add to the deficit twice the amount that \n     Congress and Clinton proposed to cut! If they do not really \n     support an additional $1.067 trillion in new taxes and \n     spending cuts--and we doubt that they do--what do they really \n     support? The answer is evident: More of the same tired, \n     liberal approach to governing--more taxes, more spending, \n     more debt.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   [From the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, Feb. 24, 1997]\n\n   BBCA, Super-Majorities, and The Federalist--Madison and Hamilton \n                       Supported Super-Majorities\n\n       The writers of the Federalist said some hard words about \n     super-majorities which are trotted out whenever Congress \n     debates the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment (BBCA). \n     Unfortunately, those hard words are almost always misused.\n\n\n                   the federalist on super-majorities\n\n       James Madison said that super-majorities transfer power \n     from the majority to the minority and thereby ``reverse'' the \n     ``fundamental principle of free government.'' A minority can \n     then frustrate the purposes of the majority even when \n     ``justice or the general good might require new laws to be \n     passed or active measures to be pursued.'' The Federalist No. \n     58, at 397 (J.E. Cooke ed. 1961). Alexander Hamilton said \n     that super-majorities may look like a remedy but are ``in \n     reality a poison.'' They operate ``to embarrass the \n     administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and \n     to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of an \n     insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto for the regular \n     deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.'' The \n     Federalist No. 22, at 140.\n       This is strong stuff from two of America's giants. However, \n     both Madison and Hamilton were strong supporters of super-\n     majority requirements, and only by using The Federalist out \n     of context can they be made to appear otherwise.\n\n\n the constitution itself, which the federalist was written to promote, \n                       contains super-majorities\n\n       The Federalist was written to explain and promote a \n     Constitution which, in its original version, contained super-\n     majority requirements in seven places: Article I requires \n     votes of two-thirds to convict on impeachment (Sec. 3, cl. \n     6), to expel a Senator or Representative (Sec. 5, cl. 2), and \n     to override a presidential veto (Sec. 7, cls. 2 & 3). Article \n     II requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to consent to \n     treaties (Sec. 2, cl. 2) and called for special majorities if \n     the election of the President should be referred to the House \n     of Representatives (Sec. 1, cl. 3). Article V requires two-\n     thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the States to amend \n     the Constitution. Article VII required ratifications from 9 \n     of the original 13 States before the Constitution could go \n     into effect.\n       Madison (always) and Hamilton (sometimes) were in \n     attendance at the convention when these super-majority \n     requirements were adopted, and Madison himself was \n     responsible for some of them. They signed the Constitution. \n     They became its most able advocates. Snippets from Federalist \n     No. 58 and No. 22 cannot obviate the fact that Madison and \n     Hamilton strongly supported the Constitution with all of its \n     super-majority requirements.\n\n\nthe federalist, which itself supports super-majorities, must be read in \n                        context to be understood\n\n       But how do we account for The Federalist's hard words on \n     super-majorities? Quite easily, actually. The words merely \n     need to be read in context:\n       What Madison was opposing in No. 58 was the suggestion that \n     the House of Representatives should require a super-majority \n     for a quorum and more than a majority of a quorum for a \n     decision. Madison did not, of course, oppose all super-\n     majority requirements for the House, but he did oppose \n     suggestions put forward by opponents of the Constitution that \n     additional super-majorities were desirable.\n       What Hamilton was opposing in No. 22 was the gridlock \n     occasioned by the Articles of Confederation with its super-\n     majority requirements and unit voting (each State had one \n     vote).\n       Hamilton also said (in Federalist No. 75), ``All provisions \n     which require more than the majority of any body to its \n     resolutions have a direct tendency to embarrass the \n     operations of the government and an indirect one to subject \n     the sense of the majority to that of the minority.'' Id., at \n     507. This sounds hard enough, but it appears in a paper about \n     the making of treaties, and Hamilton strongly supported the \n     two-thirds vote of the Senate as ``one of the best digested \n     and most unexceptionable parts of the plan.'' Id., at 503. \n     What Hamilton was opposing in No. 75 was the suggestion that \n     two-thirds of all members should be required on a vote rather \n     than two-thirds of those members present.\n       Keep in mind, too, that complaints about super-majorities \n     (especially for quorums) were a product of the times--a \n     horse-and-buggy era when interstate travel was long, \n     difficult, and dangerous, and many legislators shunned \n     regular travel to the seat of a weak central government.\n\n\n     Madison and Hamilton Supported Super-Majorities Independently\n\n       Finally, we know that both Madison and Hamilton thought \n     super-majorities were sometimes necessary because they \n     advocated them separately. In convention, Madison moved that \n     a vote of two-thirds be required to expel a Senator or \n     Representative. His motion carried 10 States to none. 2 \n     Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 at 254 \n     (1937 rev. ed.). It was also Madison who moved that if the \n     choice of a President should fall to Congress, a quorum must \n     consist of two-thirds. Id., at 526. Hamilton outlined his own \n     plan for a government, but did not present it to the \n     convention. He did, however, draw upon its principles in \n     debate. That plan contained at least five requirements for \n     super-majorities. 3 Farrand at 620, 623, 625, 627, 630.\n       Far from being opponents of super-majorities, Madison and \n     Hamilton supported them. They supported them in the \n     Constitution, in The Federalist, and in the convention. They \n     supported them because some rights are ``too important to be \n     exercised by a bare majority of a quorum.'' 2 Farrand at 254 \n     (Madison speaking on expulsion). Spending our children's \n     inheritance is one of these rights--a right too important to \n     be exercised by a bare majority.\n\n     [Some of the quotations from The Federalist have been edited \n     slightly.]\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   [From the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, Feb. 20, 1997]\n\n              The Constitution and BBCA's Super-Majorities\n\n       Some opponents of the super-majority requirements in the \n     Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment (BBCA) must suffer \n     from an irony deficiency.

It requires \n     ``a majority of the whole number of each House'' to increase \n     revenues (section 4) and to permit a waiver because of a \n     threat to national security (section 5).\n\n\n                  Super-majorities in the Constitution\n\n       Framers of the original Constitution and framers of its \n     amendments regularly called for super-majorities. Congress \n     has used super-majority votes hundreds and hundreds of times \n     for seven purposes in three general areas:\n     Area One: To Change the Laws\n       Super-majority votes are required sometimes to enact laws. \n     These laws become the ``supreme law of the land.'' See Art. \n     VI.\n       A two-thirds vote is required to override a presidential \n     veto. Art. I, Sec. 7, cls, 2 & 3. Congress has overridden a \n     veto 105 times (averaging once every Congress).\n       Treaties require a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Art. II, \n     Sec. 2, cl. 2. The Senate has voted on an estimated 2,000 \n     treaties (averaging about ten every year).\n       Constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote in \n     Congress (and ratification by three-fourths of States). Art. \n     V. The Constitution has been amended 27 times; there were 17 \n     votes on those successful amendments. There were another five \n     votes on proposed amendments that cleared the Congress but \n     were never ratified by the States.\n       Certain persons who ``engaged in insurrection or \n     rebellion'' against the United States are prohibited from \n     holding public office, but that disability may be removed by \n     a two-thirds vote of Congress. Amend. XIV, Sec. 3. By our \n     count, Congress legislated under this provision 191 times \n     from 1868 through 1898 (averaging about six per year).\n     Area Two: To Remove from Office\n       There is a second category of constitutional provisions \n     requiring a super-majority, namely those that allow Congress \n     to remove a person from office.\n       Conviction on impeachment requires a two-thirds vote of the \n     Senate. Art. I, Sec. 3, cl. 6. Seven persons (all district \n     court judges) have been convicted by the Senate after \n     impeachment. Seven others (including an associate justice of \n     the Supreme Court, a Secretary of War, and President Andrew \n     Johnson) were tried and acquitted.\n       Expulsion from the Senate or House requires a two-thirds \n     vote of the body. Art. I, Sec. 5, cl. 2. Fifteen Senators and \n     four Representatives have been expelled from Congress (the \n     great majority for disloyalty to the Union).\n       (A President may be removed by a two-thirds vote of \n     Congress for inability to discharge his duties. Amend. XXV, \n     Sec. 4. This particular provision has never been used, \n     however.)\n     Area Three: To Elect to Office\n       If election of the President should fall to the House or \n     election of the Vice President should fall to the Senate, the \n     12th Amendment has special super-majority rules with respect \n     to quorums and voting. (These requirements supersede Art. II, \n     Sec. 1, cl. 3 which also contained super-majority \n     requirements.)\n       After adoption of the 12th Amendment in 1804, the House has \n     had to act once (in 1825, electing John Quincy Adams) and the \n     Senate has had to act once (in 1837, electing Richard M. \n     Johnson to serve with Martin Van Buren).\n     An Additional, Unique Super-Majority\n       The Constitution itself provided that it would not go into \n     effect unless ratified by nine of the original 13 States. \n     Art. VII.\n\n\n        bbca is consistent with constitutional text and practice\n\n       The Framers put super-majority votes within the four walls \n     of the Constitution, and throughout the years Congress has \n     regularly and unremarkably operated under those super-\n     majority requirements. In fact, the Senate acts by super-\n     majority vote about once every month. Super-majority votes \n     are reserved for matters of special importance; they are not \n     daily events, but they are not rarities either. They are \n     about as rare as a new moon.\n       Like the constitutional policies described above, spending \n     our children's inheritance is a matter of special \n     significance that should require an occasional super-majority \n     vote.\n\n     Note on Estimate of Treaties. Counts of Senate action on \n     treaties vary widely because of differing methods and \n     judgments. In the original version of this paper we used an \n     estimate of 2,500. That number was based on data in Lyn \n     Ragsdale, Vital Statistics on the Presidency: Washington to \n     Clinton, Tables 7-1 & 7-2 (1996) (showing 1,955 treaties, \n     protocols, and conventions issued from 1789 through 1984 [all \n     of which appeared to require Senate action] and 1,542 total \n     international agreements from 1985 through 1993). After our \n     first version of this paper was released, CRS provided us \n     with an estimate of 1,704 treaties approved by the Senate \n     through 1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                         OVERALL EFFECTS OF S.J.

Remember: the Social Security         \n  amendment only addresses the receipts and outlays of Social Security. Once trust fund receipts are no longer  \n  sufficient to cover Social Security's obligations, the shortfall must come from somewhere. Such a scenario    \n  would require commensurate deficit reduction on-budget to cover the transfer to the off-budget trust fund. (2)\n  An off-budget entity borrows for Social Security. The result would be substantially higher borrowing costs for\n  the off-budget entity than if the money were borrowed by the federal government. However since this borrowing \n  would be off-budget, the additional cost would not be constitutionally prohibited--this despite the fact that \n  it would exacerbate the already very adverse true budget effect. (3) The federal government borrows for Social\n  Security and that money is put off-budget. But this obvious liability of the government could be completely   \n  ignored for constitutional purposes. Again, it would accommodate substantial deficits in the true budget.     \n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I do not intend to support this \nconstitutional amendment. During previous debates on this issue, I have \nsaid that I believe that an amendment dictating a balanced budget does \nnot belong in our Constitution but that the path to balance belongs in \nour laws. I continue to believe that. And, I hope I am not being too \noptimistic when I say that I honestly believe we have an opportunity to \nset our budget on the path to balance this year through legislation and \nwe have the chance to do so in a reasoned and bipartisan way.\n  I believe it is important to balance the budget as a way to promote \neconomic growth. And any effort to achieve a balanced budget must be \ndone fairly and equitably. But I'm not convinced that the \nconstitutional amendment before us will ensure a budget balanced fairly \nor a budget that will ensure economic growth.\n  In particular, I do not think it is wise to require a three-fifths \nvote to waive this amendment in times of economic emergency. This gives \nentirely too much power to larger population States in the House and \nwould hurt smaller States like my home State of Nebraska. In addition, \nthe national security waiver provision in this amendment is too \nrestrictive. And, I do not think it is a good idea to allow Congress to \nrely on estimates to determine whether or not the budget is in balance. \nAs previous experience has shown us, when you lead with estimates, \ngimmicks are soon to follow.\n  Still, even if we were voting on some other variation of this \namendment, I'm not persuaded a constitutional amendment is the best way \nto mend our budget woes. I still believe that if we can succeed through \na statute rather than through a constitututional amendment, we should \nleave the Constitution alone.\n  All of this being said, I do not question the intentions of the \nauthors of this amendment. Given our track record on living within our \nmeans, there are good arguments to be made for this amendment. I have \nlong said that as 1 of the 535 Members of Congress we can, and should, \nget down to the work of crafting a reasoned, bipartisan balanced budget \nplan. But we have not managed to do so. We have not managed to muster \nthe political will to tackle some of the tougher issues that stand in \nthe way of a credible path to balance. We have not managed to talk in a \nmeaningful way about how to control our entitlement spending and how to \nprevent that spending from consuming an ever-larger share of our\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\nFederal budget as time goes by. Absent change, a full 70 percent of the \nFederal budget will be consumed by mandatory spending and interest on \nthe debt by the year 2000 and that percentage will continue to climb. \nThat is a scary statistic.\n  But I think, or at least I very much hope, that we are getting closer \nto having those conversations. Last year, I was part of the centrist \ncoalition, a bipartisan group that included 11 Democrats and 11 \nRepublicans. The coalition spent approximately 5 months putting \ntogether a balanced budget package which contained significant \nentitlement reform, a reasonable discretionary spending number and \nmodest tax relief. The centrist package was offered as a substitute \nbudget in May 1996 and received 46 votes in the Senate. As far as I am \nconcerned, those 46 votes represent the start of a meaningful effort to \nbalance the budget in a bipartisan, credible way.\n  Regardless of how today's vote turns out, I hope we will not lose the \nwill to move forward to balance the budget. If this amendment were to \npass both Houses, I would hope that we would not use that passage as an \nexcuse to delay balancing the budget while we wait to see if the \namendment is ratified. And if this amendment fails, I hope that we--\nparticularly people like me who maintain that we can balance the budget \nwithout this amendment--will redouble our efforts to get the budget on \nthe path to balance in this Congress.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in this debate on the balanced budget \namendment, I believe the Senate has lived up to its reputation as the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world, bar none. We have spent nearly \na month debating this measure and I want to especially commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for \nhis stamina and intellect in managing this measure.\n  Now as the time for debate draws to a close, I hope all of my \ncolleagues will reflect on the simple principle that we are attempting \nto incorporate into our Constitution. It is simply that one generation \nof Americans has no right to mortgage future generations to finance our \ndaily spending habits. Think about it.\n  There is one thing for certain, Mr. President. When the clock strikes \nmidnight on December 31, 1999, and we enter the new century, America \nwill have run deficits for 31 consecutive years and we will have a \nnational debt of more than $6 trillion.\n  If we are ever going to reverse that endless tide of red ink, if we \nare going to ease the economic burdens on our children and \ngrandchildren, then as a matter of moral responsibility, we will adopt \nthis constitutional amendment. If we don't pass the amendment this will \ntruly be an American tragedy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering a \nconstitutional amendment which some claim will lead to a balanced \nFederal budget. The Senate debated and defeated this amendment in the \nlast Congress. It has been reported once again by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and has received the careful and thorough deliberation by \nthe Senate which it deserves.\n  Except in unusual circumstances, balancing the budget is the \nresponsible thing to do. That is why I have repeatedly supported \nbalanced budgets. And, we have made significant progress in the past 4 \nyears. We have reduced the Federal deficit for 4 years in a row, \ncutting the deficit by more than half from $290 billion in fiscal year \n1992 to $107 billion in fiscal year 1996, from 4.7 percent of the GDP \nin 1992 to 1.4 percent in fiscal year 1996, the lowest in more than 20 \nyears. In fact, for the first time in years, the real possibility of \nagreement to balance the budget in the next 5 years looms before us.\n  At the outset, let's be clear about one thing. The proposed \nconstitutional amendment doesn't balance the budget. It tells a future \nCongress to pass legislation to balance the budget. Unless that future \nCongress agrees on legislation, the amendment will not be implemented. \nWhy not try to pass the implementation language now before the vote on \nthe constitutional amendment so everybody could see how it would work \nand if it would work? Again, without that implementation legislation, \nwe're left with a feel good gimmick which would allow Members of \nCongress to claim that the deficit will be cured without actually \ntaking the tough steps necessary to do the job. It takes Congress off \nthe hook for 5 years or more. And then, Mr. President, there is no \nhook. As the distinguished past president of the American Economic \nAssociation, Professor Robert Eisner, put it in his excellent article \nJanuary 22 in the Wall Street Journal, the amendment ``might as well \nassert that the waves of the Atlantic Ocean shall not cross a certain \nline''. In other words, the language kicks in in 2002, or later, and \nthen there might be no kick.\n  As we have seen in the most recent Congress, the debate arises not \nover whether to balance the budget, but rather how to reach that \nbalance. The issues which make agreement difficult grow out of \ndifferences in priorities. The President, in his budget last year and \nagain this year, has shown a path to a balanced budget which also \nprovides for adequate funding for education, environmental protection, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and other essential Government functions. Many of \nthe proponents of this constitutional amendment support a large tax \nbreak, paid for by larger reductions in Medicare than the President \nproposes. It is in hammering out these priorities that the difficult \ndecisions arise. The constitutional amendment before us does nothing to \nadvance that process. In fact, since implementing legislation will not \nbe required for 5 years at the earliest, it may indeed provide the \nexcuse to delay those tough decisions.\n  We are told that if Congress is required by the Constitution to pass \na law to implement a balanced budget, surely Congress will pass such a \nlaw. Well in 1979, 18 years ago, we passed a law that said, ``Congress \nshall balance the Federal budget.'' That law, Public Law 96-5, was the \nlaw of the land. Although the Senate passed that provision by a 96 to 2 \nvote and the President signed it into law, it did not happen. Saying we \nmust balance the budget will not make it happen; unless and until we do \nthe hard work of budgeting, it's all just a dodge, and worse, because \nit encourages people to say we are cured before we've taken the \nmedicine.\n  Mr. President, the plain truth is whether we pass a balanced budget \namendment or not, it will still take a majority of the votes of the \nMembers of each House to make the tough choices needed to cut spending \nor raise taxes. Unless and until we make those choices or adopt some \nprocess to implement the constitutional amendment, in the absence of a \ncongressional majority agreement on how to balance the budget, we will \nnot have a balanced budget.\n  Every Member of this body knows that we will not get to a balanced \nbudget without tough decisions. Adopting a constitutional amendment \nsaying some future Congress must make the tough decisions and balance \nthe budget not only isn't a substitute for our acting or adopting an \nenforcement mechanism, it will delay those actions because people might \nthink we have acted.\n  If we are going to get to a balanced budget by 2002, there is a real, \npractical need to adopt the enforcement mechanism now. We all remember \nthat, back in 1985, we passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, requiring \na balanced budget by 1991. Two years later, we modified that \nrequirement to call for a balanced budget by 1993. Well, 1991 and 1993 \nhave come and gone, and we still don't have a balanced budget. The \nreason is simple: the Congress never laid out an enforceable mechanism \nof how we were going to get there. Like the balanced budget amendment, \nGramm-Rudman laid out the targets without enough provisions for how \nthey were to be achieved.\n  Without any enforceable blueprint, we found ourselves pushed up \nagainst deadlines we could not meet. We got to the deadline and found \nourselves confronted with a dropping stock market and the prospect of \nsudden budget cuts that could throw the country into a deep recession. \nWe made the only choice we could, protecting the Nation and the economy \nat the cost of not meeting the budget targets.\n  The current congressional majority appears committed to marching down \nthis same road again. The constitutional amendment before us, like the \nGramm-Rudman law, would require us to achieve a balanced budget in a \nfixed period of time. It doesn't say how we are supposed to get there \nand stay there.\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\n  If this Congress fails to face up to the obligation of laying out a \ndetailed enforceable plan to reach and maintain a balanced budget as \nrequired by the amendment, why should we expect future Congresses to be \nany more responsible? If we duck the task of outlining the enforceable \nmechanism and/or the cuts that will get us to a balanced budget by \n2002, and keep us at balance thereafter, we can only expect that the \nnext Congress, and the next one after that, will follow the same \ncourse. If we don't do the hard work this year, we can't expect \nsomebody else to do it for us next year.\n  If we pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget \namendment without an enforcement mechanism, we are going to face the \nsame kind of choices we faced with the Gramm-Rudman law. If we don't \nhave the will now to plot our course to reach and maintain a balanced \nbudget, we will get to 2002 and find that we have to either abandon the \ngoal with the increase in cynicism which would accompany it, or risk \nundermining the national defense or pushing the economy into a deep \nrecession.\n  There is a way to avoid that fate. We can lay out an honest plan and \nan enforceable mechanism, telling the American people how we intend to \nachieve and keep a balanced budget. That would be the honest approach, \nthe approach that the American public would respect.\n  Even the Wall Street Journal editorial on February 4 stated,\n\n       The notion of amending the Constitution to outlaw budget \n     deficits is silly on any number of counts. Politically it's \n     empty symbolism. Legally it clutters the Constitution with \n     dubious prose * * * The concept embodied in the proposed \n     amendment measures nothing useful; it is at best a \n     distraction, and at worst spreads confusion that will make \n     the right things harder to do, not easier.\n\n  The proposed amendment is full of loopholes and ambiguities, all \nusable when 2002 arrives. For example: First, the implementation of the \namendment depends on economic estimates that can be made overly \noptimistic if that is what is necessary to project a balanced budget. \nWe have seen enough rosy scenarios in the budgets of both Republican \nand Democratic administrations to know how this game is likely to be \nplayed. For example, in 1981, our estimates were off by $58 billion. In \n1982, our estimates were off by $73 billion. In 1983, our estimates \nwere off by $91 billion, and on and on. In 1991, they were off by $119 \nbillion--$119 billion in one year. You talk about a loophole. This one \nis big enough to drive a $119 billion deficit through. That's bigger \nthan our current deficit.\n  Second, the amendment requires a balanced budget in each fiscal year. \nThroughout the 1980's Congress and the President artificially lowered \nthe reported deficit and met Gramm-Rudman targets by delaying spending \na few days thereby pushing it from one fiscal year to another. Under \nthe proposed amendment, we can expect similar budgetary shell games.\n  Third, States with balanced budget requirements have frequently \navoided them by creating independent or quasi-public agencies and \nplacing their expenditures off-budget. We did much the same thing in \nthe 1980's with the costs of the savings and loan bail-out. Because the \namendment does not define key terms such as receipts and outlays, it is \ncertain to lead to similar manipulations.\n  Fourth, the deficit could be artificially reduced by selling off \nvaluable public assets, such as public lands. This approach might \nenable the Federal Government to report a smaller deficit for a few \nyears, but would have no impact at all on the structural gap between \nrevenues and outlays.\n  There are numerous technical problems with the amendment. It does not \ntell us what an outlay is, what a receipt is, or how the Congress will \nmonitor and regulate the precise levels of outlays and receipts. But, \nperhaps most importantly, it does not tell us what will happen if \noutlays in fact exceed receipts.\n  What would happen if the amendment were ratified, and, by the end of \na fiscal year, outlays were to exceed revenues, a clear violation of \nthe amendment. What would happen? Could the courts step in and enforce \nthe amendment?\n  According to the authors of the resolution, there would be no remedy, \nunless provided by future legislation. As Senator Hatch explained on \nMarch 7, 1986, ``[T]here is no question that Congress would have to \npass implementing legislation to make it effective. In that sense, it \nis not self-executing. . . . It would be the obligation of Cong-ress . \n. . [to] enact legislation that would cause this to come about.''\n\n  The unenforceability of the amendment should not be a problem, the \nauthors tell us, because future Congresses would be bound to respect \nthe provisions of the amendment and the will of the voters and to \ncomply with it in good faith by enacting suitable implementing \nlegislation.\n  But this argument has two flaws. First, the amendment, if ratified, \nwouldn't take effect until 2002 at the earliest. This Congress wouldn't \nbe bound by the provisions of the amendment. The next Congress wouldn't \nbe bound. The Congress after that wouldn't be bound. In fact, no \nCongress would be bound by the terms of the amendment to enact \nimplementing legislation until 2002 at the earliest, and by then it \nwould be too late to take the actions necessary to comply.\n  Second, the legislation required to implement this amendment will be \nextremely complex, and, even if everyone acted in good faith, there \nstill might be no agreement. Over the last decade, we have enacted into \nlaw some 50 single-spaced pages of procedures, governing the \ncongressional budget process and attempting to rein in uncontrolled \nbudget deficits. These provisions set timetables for the congressional \nbudget process. They provide the rules for debate for budget matters. \nThey spell out points of order that may be raised to keep the budget \nunder control. They establish the role of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. They provide controls on legislation providing spending \nauthority and rules for legislation providing entitlement authority. \nThey limit the use of off-budget agencies, programs and activities. \nThey establish regulations for the sequestrations and procedures for \nthe rescission of appropriated funds.\n  Similarly detailed legislation would be required to implement and \nenforce the balanced budget amendment. To give just one example of the \ncomplex issues that would have to be addressed by such legislation, the \nresolution before us would require that outlays may not exceed \nreceipts. However, Congress does not legislate either outlays or \nreceipts. The appropriations and revenue measures that we enact lead to \noutlays and receipts, but do not dictate the exact levels of outlays or \nreceipts in any given year.\n  So Congress would have to establish new mechanisms to control outlays \nand receipts. This raises many difficult questions, on which reasonable \npeople could disagree. Let me read from a colloquy between myself and \nSenator Simon about some of these questions:\n\n       Senator LEVIN. How would the monitoring of the flow of \n     receipts and outlays be done to determine whether the budget \n     for any fiscal year is on the track of being balanced? Would \n     this require implementing legislation?\n       Senator SIMON. There would have to be monitoring and future \n     legislation would have to take care of the implementation of \n     that monitoring.\n       Senator LEVIN. What exactly is the definition of receipts \n     and outlays? Specifically, would the receipts and outlays of \n     Bonneville Power Administration be receipts and outlays of \n     the United States pursuant to this constitutional amendment? \n     Would the answer to these questions require implementing \n     legislation?\n       Senator SIMON. Implementing legislation will be needed on \n     some of these peripheral questions, but the intent is clear.\n       Senator LEVIN. In an instance in which the OMB and the CBO \n     disagree with each other on what a level of outlays is, how \n     will the dispute be resolved so that it can be determined \n     whether or not outlays exceed receipts?\n       Senator SIMON. Future legislation will have to take care of \n     this.\n       Senator LEVIN. Who will determine the level of receipts and \n     whether a revenue bill is ``a bill to increase revenues?'' . \n     . . . My question is, what happens if the revenue estimators \n     in the Treasury Department say the bill is revenue neutral, \n     and the Joint Committee on Taxation say the bill will result \n     in a net increase in revenues? Whose estimate will prevail? \n     How will the dispute be resolved?\n       Senator SIMON. Future legislation will have to take care of \n     this.\n       Senator LEVIN. At what point will it be determined that \n     outlays will in fact exceed revenues and that actions such as \n     a tax increase, spending cuts, or tapping into a rainy\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\n     day fund will be required? August 1? September 15? Who will \n     make that determination?\n       Senator SIMON. There will have to be regular monitoring and \n     future legislation will work out the details.\n\n  Mr. President, these are difficult questions, on which reasonable \npeople could disagree. The assumption of the authors that future \nMembers of Congress will try, in good faith, to comply with the \namendment does not mean that a majority of Members of each House of \nCongress will agree on the many issues involved or on whether to \nrequire sequestration of funds if outlays are determined to exceed \nrevenues, or that they will agree on whether to exempt the national \ndefense or Social Security payments from such sequestration.\n  And what if the future Congress to which we leave these questions \ncan't agree? Would dozens of unelected judges assert jurisdiction and \norder spending cuts or tax increases? When the Senate during the 104th \nCongress considered this constitutional amendment, we adopted by a 92 \nto 8 vote an amendment offered by Senator Nunn which added language to \nsection 6 making it clear that ``the judicial power of the United \nStates shall not extend to any case or controversy arising under this \narticle except as may be specifically authorized by legislation. . .'' \nThis safeguard has been omitted from the version of the constitutional \namendment which is before us today.\n  Since implementation legislation is the essential need, why not pass \nit now? In the 104th Congress, I offered an amendment, defeated on a 62 \nto 38 vote, which would have required us to pass the legislation, not \npass the buck. It provided that the constitutional amendment would be \nsubmitted to the States for ratification only upon enactment of \nlegislation specifying the means for implementing and enforcing the \nprovisions of the constitutional amendment. There are two advantages to \nthis approach. First, it places the responsibility on this Congress \ninstead of leaving it to a future Congress, by delaying the sending of \nthe amendment to the States until we act. Second, the States would be \ninformed how the enforcement mechanism would work so they could \nconsider that in their ratification deliberations. Since it has become \nclear that the majority is unwilling to amend its language in any way \nand is defeating all efforts to improve it, I have decided not to offer \nmy amendment again this year.\n\n  I am also concerned that the proposed amendment would permit future \nCongresses to use Social Security funds for balancing the budget. I \nbelieve that we have a special obligation to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund, and that we should not rob that fund to balance \nthe budget. The Social Security system is a contract which we have made \nwith our senior citizens. We should not allow a circumstance in which \neven unintended effects of a constitutional amendment like the one \nbefore us could lead to the failure or inability to meet our \nobligations under Social Security. The proponents will claim that this \nwould never happen because the constituencies supporting that program \nare politically strong. But, the Constitution is permanent. Political \ncircumstance is subject to change. We should not enshrine in the \nConstitution the use of Social Security funds for any purpose other \nthan Social Security.\n  As the President stated in his letter of January 28, 1997:\n\n       * * * [T]he constitutional amendment to balance the budget \n     could pose grave risks to the Social Security system. In the \n     event of an impasse in which the budget requirements can \n     neither be waived nor met, disbursement of Social Security \n     checks could cease or unelected judges could reduce benefits \n     to comply with this constitutional mandate.\n\n  I am also deeply concerned about the supermajority requirement in \nsection 2 of the amendment. This would require 60 percent of the whole \nnumber of each House in order to raise the debt ceiling. As we learned \nin the last Congress, this represents a grave risk to the ability of \nthe Federal Government to meet its obligations. In 1995 and 1996, we \nsaw a determined minority, especially in the House of Representatives \nplan and carry out an effort to hold the President hostage by refusing \nto agree to lift the debt ceiling unless he accepted all of the details \nof their budget proposal. The strategy was rejected by the American \npeople, in part because a vote to increase the debt ceiling is simply a \nvote to pay the bills we owe: it is simply a vote to honor the \nobligations that the Federal Government has already incurred. \nReasonable people may differ on whether we should limit future \nobligations and by how much, but I hope nobody in this body believes \nthat we should not honor the obligations we have already incurred.\n  As Secretary of the Treasury Rubin put it in his testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee:\n\n       The possibility of default should never be on the table. \n     Our creditworthiness is an invaluable national asset that \n     should not be subject to question. Default on payment of our \n     debt would undermine our credibility with respect to meeting \n     financial commitments, and that in turn would have adverse \n     effects for decades to come, especially when our reputation \n     is most important, that is, when the national economy is not \n     healthy. Moreover, a failure to pay interest on our debt \n     could raise the cost of borrowing not only for Government, \n     but for private borrowers from companies to homeowners making \n     payments on an adjustable mortgage.\n\n  Just a year ago we witnessed Secretary Rubin forced to use every \ninnovative move within his authority to avoid just such a default while \nincredibly the Chairman of the House Rules Committee was calling for \nhis impeachment for doing so.\n  The one road we should never take to a balanced budget is the failure \nto pay our lawful debts. But, this amendment would make permanent in \nthe Constitution a shift of power to a minority in either House of \nCongress over the issue of whether we pay our bills for our lawful \ndebts.\n  Some opponents who have addressed this amendment have emphasized the \ndanger of putting a rigid straightjacket in the Constitution which \ncould deepen an economic emergency. Indeed, more than a thousand \ndistinguished economists, including eleven Nobel laureates have \nexpressed their opposition to such a constitutional amendment for this \nreason. Some opponents have emphasized the danger of the inclusion of \nSocial Security and the unwise requirement of a supermajority in order \nto permit the United States to pay its debts. Others have argued, as \nThe Wall Street Journal has, that this amendment is an empty gimmick. \nWhile it is true that not all of these flaws can be true at the same \ntime, it is also true that whether it is a dangerous straight jacket, \nor a dodge which won't work, it's a mistake either way.\n  Mr. President, if we want to achieve a balanced budget, there is one \nway to do it. Don't push the problem off onto future Congresses with a \nbalanced budget amendment that doesn't even become effective until 2002 \nat the earliest. Keep doing the hard work as we have started. Set out a \nplan with real spending targets, real budget cuts laid out on a \nprogram-by-program and year-by-year basis, and real enforcement \nmechanisms. I believe we are on verge of a plan to reach a balanced \nbudget in 5 years in this Congress. We have lowered the deficit for 4 \nconsecutive years, cutting it by more than half. Let's not be delayed \nor diverted. Let's do the hard work. At best, this amendment is merely \nirrelevant to balancing the budget. At worst, it threatens damage to \nthe economy, the Social Security system, and the confidence of the \nAmerican people in their Government. Either way it's a mistake.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. Passage of this constitutional \namendment to balance the budget is the only way to provide the needed \ndiscipline to guarantee our Government's fiscal restraint.\n  This constitutional amendment simply requires the Federal \nGovernment's total outlays not exceed total receipts for any fiscal \nyear. It is important to note that Congress may waive this requirement \nif 60 percent of each body votes to do so. The amendment can also be \nwaived in times of war. In order to become part of the Constitution, \ntwo-thirds of the House and Senate must vote in favor of the amendment, \nand then it must be ratified by three-fourths of the States.\n  The facts are clear. History has proven that Washington is incapable \nof making the tough spending decisions necessary to put our fiscal \nhouse in order. Despite endless debate and support for a balanced \nbudget, our Federal budget has not been in balance since Neil Armstrong \nlanded on the moon 28 years ago.\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\n  For years, politicians--in Congress and in the White House--have \ntalked incessantly about the need and their desire to balance the \nbudget. Listen to the following quotes:\n\n       We must balance the federal budget . . . I shall recommend \n     a balanced budget . . .\n\n\n                            --Richard Nixon\n\n                            January 22, 1970\n\n       With careful planning, efficient management and proper \n     restraint on spending we can move rapidly toward a balanced \n     budget--and we will.\n\n\n                             --Jimmy Carter\n\n                            January 19, 1978\n\n       The path I've outlined is fair, balanced and realistic . . \n     . aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade.''\n\n\n                            --Ronald Reagan\n\n                            January 25, 1983\n\n  If only talk meant action.\n  Neither the current rhetoric about balancing the budget nor the \nmomentary good news that our annual deficits have been coming down more \nthan was expected should trick us into believing that we are on the \nright path.\n  According to a January 1997 report by the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office [CBO], the deficit will climb from the current $107 \nbillion to $124 billion this year. And it will not stop there. It will \nincrease to $188 billion in 2002 and reach $278 billion in 2007. In 10 \nyears, without fundamental changes in our spending habits, the deficit \nwill be over 2\\1/2\\ times what it was in 1996. CBO's assessment of \nthese skyrocketing deficits is very disturbing:\n\n       The budget deficits projected for the future years are so \n     large that they could put an end to the upward trend in \n     living standards that the Nation has long enjoyed. Thus \n     current U.S. budget policies cannot be sustained without \n     risking substantial economic damage.\n\n  Talk about a risky scheme. ``Substantial economic damage''--the CBO \nreport went further, stating that if we fail to bring our deficits to a \nhalt, our economy will enter a period of ``accelerating decline.''\n  How many warnings will it take to spur us to action? Are there any \nwords strong enough to force us to act?\n  The number crunchers show us that if we do not act, our children will \nface tax rates of 82 percent. Talk about taxation without \nrepresentation. Staggering statistics show that a child born today will \nhave to pay nearly $200,000 in taxes over his or her lifetime just to \npay interest on the debt.\n  Have we completely forgotten Thomas Jefferson's stern warning?\n\n       We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \n     posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, it is clear we have dismissed the moral implications \nof deficit spending. We only need look at the buildup of our national \ndebt as proof. Although it took us over 200 years to reach the $1 \ntrillion debt mark, in less than 20 years the debt has grown more than \nfive times. It now stands at a staggering $5.3 trillion. Do you realize \nto pay off this debt, every family of four would have to pay $1,156 a \nmonth for the next 5 years? That is $38 per day.\n\n  As more than 200 economists told the Congress in an open letter, in \nwhich they urged support to the balanced budget constitutional \namendment:\n\n       We have lost the moral sense of fiscal responsibility that \n     served to make formal constitutional restraints unnecessary. \n     We cannot legislate a change in political morality; we can \n     put formal constitutional constraints in place.\n\n  We have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and \ngrandchildren and their grandchildren are not burdened with \nbackbreaking debt. We are snatching away their prospects of ever \nachieving the American dream. I was struck by a recent report on \ngenerational accounting that showed a child born today will keep just \n16 percent of their lifetime wages if we do not change the course of \nour Government spending. How can we believe that we are preserving \nliberty and freedom if we are asking our children to surrender 84 \npercent of their lifetime earnings to feed the Federal trough? I have \nseven children and three grandchildren. It is simply not fair to my \nchildren or anyone's children to pass down this legacy of debt.\n  Even in this time of some optimism about balancing the budget by the \nyear 2002, there are no assurances that we will actually achieve that \ngoal or that we will keep the budget in balance beyond 2002. One year \nin balance is not enough. Let us not forget that Congress and the \nPresident have been trying with little success to balance the budget \nfor almost three decades.\n  Time and time again, Congress has passed statutes that were supposed \nto restore fiscal discipline--the 1990 budget agreement, Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings I, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings II, just to name a few. \nUnfortunately, good intentions have not produced the desired results. \nSpending targets were adjusted and readjusted. Deadlines came and went. \nPromises of spending restraint were broken again and again. We cannot \nafford any more empty promises.\n  Opponents of this amendment will tell you we do not need this \namendment to balance the budget because both the President and the \nCongress have agreed to work together to balance the budget by the year \n2002. Our well-intentioned colleagues should not be lured into this \nfalse sense of security that ignores history.\n\n  Since 1960, we have had a balanced Federal budget only one time. Why? \nPeople in public office like to do popular things. One need only look \nat the budget fiasco of 1995 to realize that balancing the budget is \nneither popular nor easily achievable in today's political climate.\n  The late Senator Paul Tsongas put it best:\n\n       If you ask yourself why are these deficits always voted \n     for, the answer is very simple * * * There are a lot of votes \n     in deficit spending. There are no votes in fiscal discipline. \n     What you have here is a sad case of pursuit of self as \n     opposed to pursuit of what is in the national interest. The \n     balanced budget amendment is simply a recognition of that \n     human behavior.\n\n  Now, I want to talk for a moment about Social Security. I had hoped \nthat Social Security would have been exempted from the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, and I voted twice to remove Social Security \nfrom the effects of this amendment. I believe that exempting Social \nSecurity--with the caveat that it is administered honestly and we do \nnot turn the trust fund into a slush fund for other Federal spending--\nwould have protected the Social Security trust funds and ensured the \nviability of the system for our current and future retirees.\n  At the same time, I fully recognize that exempting Social Security \nfrom this amendment would force us to address the need for real \nspending reductions in other Federal programs. I believe my record on \ncutting Government spending is pretty clear--I have proven time and \ntime again I am willing to make the tough votes to cut popular \nprograms. However, I am not sure that some of my colleagues who \nsupported the Reid and Dorgan amendments to exempt Social Security \nwould actually be willing to rein in spending by the additional $700 \nbillion necessary to balance the budget without including the Social \nSecurity trust funds in the calculations.\n  Our efforts to exempt Social Security did not prevail. Nonetheless, I \nwill be vigilant in my fight to protect the Social Security trust fund \nand end this charade of using trust fund moneys to mask the deficit. I \nknow Arizonans do not want their hard-earned dollars invested in the \nSocial Security system to be used for studying cow flatulence, shrimp \naquaculture centers, wood utilization research programs, or potato \nresearch programs, just to name a few.\n\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that the most serious threat to \nSocial Security at this time is deficit spending and our ever-growing \nnational debt. As Robert Myers, the Chief Actuary of the Social \nSecurity Administration from 1947-1970, stated recently:\n\n       [T]he most serious threat to Social Security is the federal \n     government's fiscal irresponsibility. If we continue to run \n     federal deficits year after year, we will face two dangerous \n     possibilities. Either we will raid the trust funds to pay for \n     our current profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly \n     inflating our way out of indebtedness. Both cases would \n     devastate the real value of the Social Security Trust Funds. \n     Regaining control of our fiscal affairs is the most important \n     step that we can take to protect the soundness of the Social \n     Security Trust Funds.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what the balanced budget amendment \nwould do--it would force us to control our fiscal affairs. Passage of \nthis amendment in the Senate is only one small step toward fiscal \nresponsibility. This amendment still has a way to go before becoming \npart of our Constitution--the\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\nmost sacred and important document underpinning our Nation's history \nand Government. A tough vote awaits in the House, and then three-\nfourths of the States must ratify the amendment.\n  But we must move this process forward. The mere fact that this \namendment has been trapped in Washington for so many years proves just \nhow out of touch we are with those we supposedly represent. Poll after \npoll of the American people shows the balanced budget amendment winning \napproval ratings of nearly 80 percent. Yet, Washington politicians want \nto keep this debate inside the beltway, probably because they fear what \nmight happen if we let the people decide.\n  What are the opponents of this amendment afraid of? Quite simply, \nthey are afraid that it will pass. I can understand why they are \nscared. You see, many are spending addicts who have built their entire \npolitical careers spending other people's money on their own \npriorities. They do not want to part with their Federal credit card \nthat has no limits and never comes due. They hide behind excuses about \nwhy a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget will \nnot work. They say they support a balanced budget amendment, just not \nthis one. Or they talk about balancing the budget, but refuse to \nactually do it.\n\n  In short, they want to protect themselves from making tough spending \ndecisions. They prefer the status quo.\n  Opponents of this amendment probably understand best the real effect \nof this amendment. They understand that it will be a straitjacket on \nspending.\n  However, let me be perfectly clear that nothing in the balanced \nbudget amendment precludes Congress from continuing on our current \npath. We could still deficit-spend even with this amendment in effect, \nso long as 60 percent of each House votes in favor of doing so. \nGranted, this would be a tougher hurdle to clear. But why not force \nCongress to live up to a higher standard, to be more accountable, when \nthe future prosperity of our country is at stake.\n  Finally, the games that politicians in Washington have long played \nwill be exposed for what they really are--to use a favorite phrase of \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore from the election--a ``risky \nscheme'' that threatens to devastate Social Security, Medicare, \neducation, and the environment.\n  Passage of this amendment would finally force Washington to do what \nneeds to be done, namely, determine our long-term spending priorities; \naddress projected deficits in important programs; shift power back to \nthe States, local communities, and families; and provide incentives for \nsavings and investment. Perhaps the real fear of this amendment's \nopponents is that President Clinton's own words would finally come to \nfruition--the era of big government would be over.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow career politicians seeking to preserve \ntheir own interests to hold this amendment hostage any longer. In State \nHouses across the country, we must begin the debate about whether the \nFederal Government should be forced to live within its means.\n  I call on every American to read carefully this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. Do not be fooled by the scare tactics of \nthose who cannot control their hunger for Federal spending. Decide for \nyourself whether it will help or hurt our current state of fiscal \naffairs.\n  It is time for real Americans to closely examine all the what ifs and \nthe excuses about why we should pass this disciplinary tool, and see if \nthey hold water. Unfortunately, we know all too well that all of the \nwhat ifs and excuses cannot erase the facts.\n  In January 1995, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax \nReform, chaired by Senators Bob Kerrey and John Danforth, warned us \nthat in the year 2012, projected spending for entitlements and interest \non the national debt will consume all tax revenues collected by the \nFederal Government. By 2030, projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, and Federal employee retirement programs alone will \nconsume all our tax revenues, leaving us nothing to educate our kids, \nkeep our streets safe or protect our environment.\n  The warnings are clear. Time is wasting. Since we last voted on the \nbalanced budget amendment in June 1996, our national debt has increased \nnearly $200 billion. We would be wise to remember the words of one of \nour great founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson:\n\n       I place economy among the first and most important of \n     republican virtues, and public debt as the greatest of \n     dangers to be feared.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will pay heed to Jefferson's sage advice and \nsupport the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this has been an unusually enlightening--if \na bit protracted--debate. We have had this discussion before on a \nnumber of occasions and I assume we will have it again during this \nCongress. It is my fervent hope that emerging from all this discussion \nwill be a general understanding on the part of the American people that \nthere is a discernable difference between a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution and a balanced budget itself.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is as fundamentally flawed this year as \nit was last year. As it is currently drafted, I cannot support it.\n  I have come to the floor previously to discuss the detrimental \neffects of this proposed amendment to the Constitution.\n  I have discussed at length the particularly odious issue of the \namendment's supermajority requirement. As I have illustrated in the \npast, Mr. President, the most compelling arguments against this \namendment as drafted come from the real experts, the Framers of the \nConstitution. I would contend that were they here on the floor of the \nSenate today, they would to a person vote against this amendment \nbecause it violates the Constitution's most basic tenet--majority rule.\n  I have researched this issue, Mr. President; allow me to review it \nbriefly. In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton called a requirement for \na quorum of more than a majority poison for a deliberative body. \nPoison, Mr. President, is Hamilton's word, chosen by a Founding Father \nof our democracy, not this Senator from Massachusetts in 1997.\n  Let me explore Hamilton's thought further. He elaborates pointedly \nthat:\n\n       The necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or something \n     approaching toward it, has been founded upon a supposition \n     that it would contribute to security. But its real operation \n     is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of \n     the Government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or \n     artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to \n     the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable \n     majority.\n  Hamilton, Mr. President, was concerned that the requirement of more \nthan a majority would allow the minority to rule simply by not showing \nup. ``This situation,'' he said, ``must always savor of weakness--\nsometimes border on anarchy.''\n  Harsh words, Mr. President, but again, not mine. They were written \ntwo centuries ago but could not be more prescient and more appropriate \nfor this debate.\n  Knowing his thoughts on the issue of a supermajority quorum, how do \nyou think Hamilton would vote if he stood among us today?\n  And how do you think Hamilton and the rest of our Founding Fathers \nwould feel if they knew that a collection of Members of Congress could \npass a constitutional amendment which contains a provision allowing it \nto be waived? Mr. President, the notion that a part of our most \nfundamental document of law can be set aside for a time is ludicrous \nand anathema to the very reasons for having such a governing document \nat all. That's not to say that, given the wording of this \nconstitutional amendment proposal, the capability to waive is not \nneeded; emphatically, it is. But that necessity does not remove the \nstrong undesirability of permitting a waiver of a provision of our \nfundamental governing document.\n  Mr. President, if that is not enough to dissuade Senators from \nsupporting such a poorly drafted amendment to our Constitution, let me \nexplore further what is wrong with the proposal before us. I have come \nto the floor previously and discussed the inherent and \nunprecedented problems with a process which would lead to the Congress \nceding to the judiciary the power vested in it by the citizenry of this \nNation to formulate a budget.\n\n  Last year when we considered this amendment, Walter Dellinger, an \nassistant attorney general, testified before the Judiciary Committee. \nLet me remind my colleagues of his analysis. He testified that:\n\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\n\n       should the measure be enforced by the Judiciary, it would \n     produce an unprecendented restructuring of the balance of \n     power between the branches of government. If it proves \n     unenforceable, it would create a quite different but equally \n     troubling hazard; by writing an empty promise into the \n     fundamental charter of our government, it would breed \n     cynicism about our government and diminish respect for the \n     Constitution of the United States and for the rule of law.\n\n  The distinguished professor of law Archibald Cox concurred with this \nview. He states that this amendment:\n\n       would spawn disputes and charges of violation without \n     providing either the means of resolving the disputes or \n     remedies for the actual threatened violations, except to \n     bring the courts * * * into a field for which they are \n     totally unequipped by experience.\n\n  Indeed, the courts are totally unequipped by experience, Mr. \nPresident, to contend with this amendment should it be made part of our \nConstitution. Unelected judges would be forced to order the Government \nto reduce or stop paying benefits--like Social Security or Medicare--or \nto cut Federal spending. Perhaps the current majority in the Senate has \nno dispute with that. But think of it, Mr. President, unelected judges \nalso could order Congress to increase taxes to enforce the \nconstitutional requirement to balance the budget. And this has happened \nin our country, I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, in \nthe case of Missouri versus Jenkins.\n  But Mr. President, what I believe most renders this amendment as \ndrafted unacceptable is that it would achieve the exact opposition of \nits ostensible intention.\n  I suppose the proponents believe that this amendment to the \nConstitution would restore and demand fiscal discipline of the Congress \nand the Government. But, Mr. President, deficit reduction, in and of \nitself, is not an economic policy. The jagged, complex, and sometimes \nunpredictable nexus between fiscal and monetary policy forces us to \nmaintain comprehensive economic foresight and vision--be vigilant of \nbudget constraints, mindful of the markets, cooperative with our chief \ntrading partners, careful with inflation and unemployment, responsive \nto the needy, and watchful of the business cycle.\n  Those are the ingredients of the plan the Democrats enacted in 1993. \nThat's why we reduced the deficit by two-thirds in 4 years. By 1996, \nthe Federal deficit had shrunk to 1.4 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct from 4.7 percent in 1993. That's why inflation and interest \nrates and unemployment are at an all-time low. That's why the market is \nbreaking records. That's why the current economic expansion is one of \nthe most prolonged positive business cycles in this century. And, \nthat's what makes the current debate on this amendment all the more \nironic.\n  Economist after economist including Nobel laureates and Alan \nGreenspan will tell you that this amendment, as drafted, will wreak \nhavoc on the Nation's economy. The amendment before us requires the \nbudget to operate at balance or surplus, whether economic growth is \nstrong or weak. It requires a balanced budget even if economic growth \nis negative. Let me take a moment and explore the consequences of that, \nMr. President.\n  One of the greatest economic achievements of the 20th century has \nbeen the unglamorous but vital responsive economic system installed by \nthe U.S. Government in the aftermath of the Second World War. It is \nobvious in periods of stagnant economic growth that revenues rise more \nslowly. Higher unemployment, fewer people working, fewer people \npaying taxes; slower growth, economic and business contraction, fewer \ncompanies paying taxes. Mr. President, this is not difficult to \nunderstand. When these unfortunate economic slowdowns occur now, we \nhave a system which alleviates some of the pain felt by individuals and \ncompanies, and eases us back into economic growth. Federal spending \nincreases--especially on programs like unemployment insurance--and \noutlays necessarily exceed revenues. That is economic sense, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  This amendment, as it is drafted, works against economic reality and \nrisks making recessions more frequent and turning recessions into \ndepressions. And I make this statement not based on economic theory \ncooked up in an ivory tower or a think-tank downtown. I make it based \non the real-life experience of this country during the dark days of the \n1930's. After the stock market crashed in 1929, revenues dropped and \nCongress pursued an economic program which consisted of spending cuts \nand tax increases: the exact course which this amendment would dictate. \nWhat was the result then, Mr. President? This country experienced its \nmost destructive depression. The spending cuts and tax increases \ndrained purchasing power from the country and helped make the downturn \ndeeper. This amendment will exacerbate the natural business cycle of \nexpansion and recession.\n  Since the Great Depression and World War II, we have made enormous \nprogress in reducing the rollercoaster of the boom and bust cycles and \nthis amendment would strip us of that progress and its protections. It \nwould remove the fiscal buffer the Federal Government has in place and \nleave the States and individual Americans and American companies to \nbear the brunt of economic downturns.\n  The former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert \nReischauer, agrees. He argues:\n\n       A balanced budget rule could make it even harder to conduct \n     discussions of policies on their own merits, and could lead \n     to distortions of policies simply to meet budget goals. * * * \n     Burdens might be shifted to State and local governments or to \n     the private sector even when the public good would be \n     enhanced by keeping the programs at the Federal level.\n  Well, Mr. President, my State can't handle this. For the last two \ndecades, Massachusetts has been a recession-prone State. In the late \n1980's, the economy of New England collapsed. While we have crept out \nof the ruins of unemployment and business loss, we must be vigilant not \nto return. Back in the 1980's and early 1990's, I fought hard to \nalleviate the recession in Massachusetts by continuing the flow of \nFederal dollars into the Commonwealth and easing its credit crunch. Mr. \nPresident, Federal funds were instrumental in jump-starting economic \ngrowth in Massachusetts: My home State receives more Federal funding \nthan 43 other States on a per capita basis and 17 percent more than the \naverage State. Massachusetts State secretariats are highly dependent on \nFederal expenditures to help residents of the State overcome the \nnegative effects of recessions: In the last fiscal year, Federal \ndollars provided nearly 80 percent of the funding for Massachusetts' \nHealth and Human Services secretariat, 77 percent of the education \nsecretariat budget, more than half of the housing and community \ndevelopment budget and 43 percent of the transportation and \nconstruction spending.\n  If an amendment to the Constitution mandates a balanced budget and my \nState experiences an economic downturn, it will be at the mercy of the \nsupermajority of 65 Senators who would have to join me and Senator \nKennedy in releasing more funds, if necessary, to combat that recession \nand prevent it from wreaking greater havoc.\n  Again, Mr. President, this is not pie-in-the-sky speculation. The \nCommonwealth Center for Fiscal Policy predicts that ``a fiscal crisis \nlooms for Massachusetts.'' Our fragile State economy will be tested at \na time when the Federal Government continues to threaten cuts to \nvital transfer payments to States.\n\n  Mr. President, I oppose this amendment as it is drafted for all the \nconstitutional and economic reasons I have outlined. Before I conclude, \nI must note to my colleagues that I find it enormously ironic that over \nthe next few weeks, we will all line up to vote for one budget or \nanother that balances by the year 2002. In fact, the President has \nalready submitted his plan and it is, as far as I know, the first one \non the table to reach balance by that date. I have not yet seen any \nplan from my Republican colleagues, but I am confident that when they \nassemble one, it, too, will balance by 2002. So, you see, Mr. \nPresident, we all agree on that. Isn't it ironic that now, of all \ntimes, the drumbeat for a constitutional amendment grows louder? Mr. \nPresident, where was that drumbeat in the 1980's, when President Reagan \nwas running unprecedented deficits? When no balanced budget was in \nsight?\n  Let us call this exercise what it is and get back to work to restore \nfiscal responsibility the old-fashioned way--through hard work, not by \nheadline grabbing. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Amending our Constitution is not an action that anyone in this body \nshould take lightly. I did not reach my conclusion without a great deal \nof thought and consideration.\n  It is time for Congress to pass this amendment and open it up to the \nscrutiny of the State legislatures, the Governors, and the citizens.\n\n\n                            a brief history\n\n  ``Max, Congress needs to get its act in gear. We need to balance the \nbudget.'' Four years ago I heard that everywhere I went in Montana. It \ndidn't matter if I was out on one of my workdays or at the county \nfairs; spending time on a dusty ranch, or in the growing cities.\n  The deficit had ballooned to $290 billion and it showed no signs of \nshrinking. The deficit was not only running up our national debt, it \nwas eating away at the public's confidence in their Government.\n  Then, 4 years ago, an interesting thing happened. Congress passed, \nand President Clinton signed, a budget that actually cut our deficit. \nAnd now for the past 4 years we have shrunk the deficit. Last year the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated that the deficit was down to $107 \nbillion.\n  We can all agree that these are steps in the right direction. But not \nis not the time to start patting ourselves on the back.\n  These steps toward solvency are not enough. Montanans still tell me \nthat balancing the budget is one of their highest priorities. And it \nshould be our top priority.\n  I have worked toward a balanced budget for a long time. I believe \nthat we need to cut spending, eliminate Government waste, and to create \na Tax Code which is fair to Montana families.\n  I have often been in pretty small company as I have worked for the \nfirst of those priorities--cutting spending. In 1984, I was joined by \nformer Senator Kassebaum, and Senators Grassley and Biden in sponsoring \nan across-the-board freeze on all Government spending. This 1-year \nfreeze got just 33 votes. While it would have caused pain in Montana, \nit spread the cuts out to many programs and shared the pain. That's how \nthis process must work if we are to get to a balanced budget.\n\n  In 1986, I was the only member of Montana's congressional \ndelegation--and the delegation was 33 percent larger then--to vote for \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act. That bill required Congress to meet a \nset of progressively lower budget targets each year. But that bill \nincluded no plan to get us to our targets.\n  I was just one of 31 Senators to join Senator Kerrey in 1994 on a \nbill to cut $9 billion from a number of programs. This package included \ncuts to programs which benefit Montana, like the food aid programs \nwhich help our wheat farmers and the honey program. And the means \ntesting for Medicare part B would have increased medical expenses for \nsome Montanans. But it was fair and it represents the task before us. \nThere are no simple cuts.\n  I have fought Government waste for years. I have long opposed the \nstar wars defense system and the space station. In the 103d Congress, \nas chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works, I cut \n$120 million from the Federal courthouse construction budget. Prior to \nthat I worked with then-Senator DeConcini to cut $50 million from the \nCIA's National Reconnaissance Office after we caught them wasting money \non a building with a fountain and a sauna. I am not a newcomer to this \nfight.\n\n\n                               rationale\n\n  On this floor there has been a lively, principled debate about if, \nwhen, and how easily this country should run a deficit.\n  I do believe that in times of crisis, such as an act of war, we \nshould be allowed to run a deficit--temporarily. The last time there \nwas a balanced budget or a budget surplus was fiscal year 1969. We have \nbeen running at a deficit for 28 years now--through three expansions \nand two recessions. To run a deficit for that long--without a clear and \npressing need--is wrong.\n  The time to balance the budget is now.\n\n\n                     reservations: social security\n\n  I also recognize that we have a commitment to Social Security that we \ncannot ignore. Many Montanans and Americans depend on these benefits \nwhen they retire.\n  We are all aware of the far-reaching budget consequences that will \nresult when my generation, the baby boomers, reaches retirement age. \nThe strain on the system will be unprecedented, but not insurmountable. \nThrough careful planning we can preserve Social Security for all.\n  However, I fear that it would only be a matter of time before a mid-\nyear scramble to meet budget requirements would lead some legislators \nto consider cutting benefits. We cannot let that happen. We must \nprotect the Social Security system for our Nation's seniors. I will \nwork very hard to do just that.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  So I urge you all to speak to your constituents. Look deep within \nyourselves and examine your values. Amending our Constitution is--by \ndesign--a difficult task. Something that cannot be done on a whim.\n  I have thought long and hard. And I've concluded that we need to make \na clean break with the past. We need to establish a new ethic of \nresponsibility.\n  As I said earlier, there has been a lively and principled debate here \non the Senate floor. It is now time to expand the debate. Let the \npeople decide. I am confident that they will be as cautious and \nthoughtful as we have been.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know that we are supposed to break at \n12:30 unless with consent the managers get more time.\n  What is the time situation for the distinguished Senator from Utah \nand the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nVermont has 2 minutes and 50 seconds remaining. The Senator from Utah \nhas 5 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from \nTexas would like to speak. I think he is on his way. As soon as he \narrives, I would be happy to yield whatever time I have to him.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 2\\1/2\\ minutes, \nthe Senator from Utah has 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Vermont be granted an additional 5 minutes each prior to \nbreaking for the caucus lunches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note that in 6 minutes the \nhour of 12:30 will have arrived and the Senate will then stand in \nrecess.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. Mr. President, the unanimous consent was that we go \nbeyond that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If that is the understanding, if there is no \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding.\n  Mr. President, several days ago, in an unfortunate and I believe in \nan intemperate moment that does not characterize the distinguished \nmajority leader, he made some regrettable comments with regard to \nMembers of this institution who as a matter of conscience have decided \nthey either needed to change or oppose the resolution offered by the \nSenator from Utah.\n  I will not respond in kind to Senator Lott's comments, but I do find \nit necessary today to rise to address once again the question of the \nbalanced budget amendment. The issue was raised whether those of us who \nhave\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\nsupported a balanced budget amendment were keeping faith with our \ncommitments to our constituents by opposing this resolution today.\n  I would remind Senator Lott that not only have I supported a balanced \nbudget amendment but last week I voted for a balanced budget amendment. \nIt is simply not the version he preferred.\n  I rise also, Mr. President, because I do believe as well there is a \nburden that has not been met in this institution to those of us who \nsupport a balanced budget amendment. And that is the concern raised by \nthe Treasury Department. The amendment as currently drafted would \nforever preclude the development of a capital budget by the U.S. \nGovernment. We have asked the majority to address how in voting for a \nbalanced budget amendment this concern could be accommodated. We have \nbeen met by silence. We have asked to have addressed the concerns of \nthe CRS and the Treasury Department of how we could ensure the \nintegrity and the continuance of our obligations to those on Social \nSecurity, and it has been met by silence.\n  But most interestingly, last week during his otherwise unfortunate \ncomments, we were assured by the majority leader that efforts were now \nbeing taken to reach an accommodation on Senator Feinstein's concerns \nabout the development of a capital budget, Senator Johnson's concerns \nabout the protection of Social Security, and my concerns with each, \nincluding the ability of the United States to defend itself militarily \nand to deal with serious economic recessions. Each of us waited since \nMr. Lott's comments of last Friday for this attempt at reconciliation. \nI was certain, based on Senator Lott's comments repeated again in the \nnews on Sunday, that there was a decision to seek some accommodation \nthat would allow all of us who believe in a balanced budget amendment \nto vote affirmatively today.\n  I regret to inform my colleagues that I have received no such \ncommunication. I know of no other Member of the Senate who has received \nsuch communication. I assume, therefore, that either Senator Lott \nmisspoke or, somehow, there was something disingenuous about his offer. \nBecause my concerns remain. I have voted for a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution last week. I would vote for this, but, \nlike Senator Johnson, like Senator Feinstein, I have real and lasting \nconcerns.\n  I want to know that if there is military aggression against the \nUnited States, we are able to respond with other than a declaration of \nwar. I offered an amendment to accommodate those security interests. It \nwas defeated. I remain interested, and I believed I was going to \nreceive from Senator Lott some communication to accommodate it.\n  I remain concerned that, in a serious economic recession or \ndepression, the U.S. Government is able to respond, to provide for \neconomic needs. I believed, in Senator Lott's communication, he was \ninterested in accommodating that concern. It has not happened.\n  And I remain concerned, like other Members of the Senate, how we can \nensure the integrity of Social Security and maintain that commitment to \nour constituents, and how, indeed, we could provide in the future for \nat least the possibility of a capital budget.\n  Mr. President, now, only hours before the vote, I am left with this \nquestion. It seems to be relatively simple to reach some accommodation, \nto engage in some compromise, to reach the concerns of at least one \nSenator on at least one of these issues. The question, therefore, \nbefore the body is this: Did Senator Lott really ever seek to win this \nfight, or is this an attempt to amend the Constitution that was never \nreally designed to succeed? We have waited these several days to hear \nwhat compromises or new communications the majority leader wanted to \nshare with Members of the Senate. Since none have been received, I \nassume none were ever intended.\n  I have said previously that I believe the Senator from Utah has a \ngood amendment. I also concluded that good was not good enough in \ndealing with an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The \nSenate can do better. National security, severe economic recessions, \nand the integrity of Social Security are real and lasting concerns.\n  My commitment to my constituents is to use my best judgment. My best \njudgment is that there should and can be an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to provide for a balanced budget. But \nwe accomplish nothing, indeed, do a disservice to the United States, if \nwe cannot accommodate the real possibility of dealing with military and \neconomic emergencies, and the genuine concern of our constituents in \ndealing with the problems, potentially, of interrupting Social Security \nchecks.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, with regret, I rise to inform my colleagues \nthat what I supposed was an effort at accommodation was never tried \nand, therefore, inevitably failed.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, who has played a significant role in \nthis and who is one of the brightest people to ever sit in Congress \nwith regard to budgetary matters.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it my understanding, Mr. President, at that time, then, \nall time would be expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nVermont has 1 second remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time is there remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first let me thank our dear colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, who has been a great and effective leader on this \nissue. We would not be where we are--that is, as close to the goal line \nas we are--without him.\n  Our Senate Democratic colleagues are concerned. We hear it \neverywhere. They are really concerned. I went back this morning and \nlooked at every amendment they have offered to the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution of the United States and found that they \nare so concerned that they have offered amendments on the floor of the \nSenate to exempt 95 percent of the domestic budget from the balanced \nbudget requirement. They are so concerned about balancing the budget \nthat they think 95 percent of the things we spend money on domestically \nought to be exempt. They are so concerned about Social Security that \nthey believe we ought to continue to pile up debts.\n  We balanced the budget last in 1969. Since 1969, we have piled on \nsome $4.8 trillion worth of debt. In fact, just on the debt we have \nincurred since 1969, the last year we balanced the budget, we paid a \ngross interest payment of $320 billion last year. And the Democrats are \nvery concerned. They are concerned that if we do not keep piling up \ndebt, we may not pay for Social Security. But, since 1969, in piling up \n$4.8 trillion worth of debt, we are paying more interest on that debt \nthan we are paying for Social Security retirees today.\n  Our Democratic colleagues are so concerned, they remind me of someone \nwho would be advising young parents, who have very small children, who \nwant to be able to afford for them to go to college--who might advise \nthose parents, saying: Don't get in the habit of balancing your budget \nbecause then you may not send your children to college.\n  How in the world can anybody with a straight face--and I understand \npolitics--but how can anybody with a straight face stand on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate and say we are in a better position to protect \nSocial Security today, paying $320 billion of interest payments per \nyear on the debt piled up since 1969, than we would have been if we had \nnever incurred that debt, when the interest payment is bigger than what \nwe are paying into Social Security for retirees? Does logic have no \nmeaning?\n  Finally, there is the argument about, well, this is not perfect. This \njust is not quite perfect. Let me say to my colleagues--and this is an \nexperience I have had in working with Senator Hatch--we have been \ntrying to find perfection here. You know, the Founding Fathers didn't \nfind it. If those who remember the story of the miracle at Philadelphia \nwill remember back, when Franklin stood to speak he said that he\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\ndidn't believe what they had done was perfect, but he doubted that they \nwould do better.\n  I have found that every time we try to find perfection, every time we \ntry to offer to accept this concern that our Democratic colleagues \nhave, they end up backing away from it. There is no one so \nunconvincible as a person who will not be convinced.\n  So, I think it is important that the American people understand some \nbasic facts about all we are going to do today, since the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution is going to fail by one vote. Two \nMembers, who voted for this very amendment in the House and who \ncampaigned for it, are going to cast votes to kill it today. What are \nwe getting out of all this? Let me tell you what the lesson is to the \nNation. There are 55 Republicans in the Senate, and every one of them--\nand I am proud to say every one of them--is going to vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Our \nDemocratic colleagues, in their concern for everything but deficit \nreduction, have offered amendments to exempt 95 percent of all domestic \nspending from the balanced budget. How can you balance the Federal \nbudget when you don't count 95 percent of the domestic items that the \nGovernment spends money on?\n  The plain lesson here is this: Despite all we say in our campaigns, \ndespite the fact that there are so many who want the public to listen \nto what they say at home and not look at what they do in Washington, \nthe bottom line is, over and over and over again, what our Democratic \ncolleagues have shown is that they are not for a balanced budget \namendment. How can you vote to exempt 95 percent of the budget from the \nbalanced budget amendment and be for it? You can always find an excuse \nto not balance the Federal budget. You can always be for it in the \nabstract and not in reality.\n  What I want America to get out of this 3-week debate that we have had \nis, there is a clear difference. There is a clear difference. \nRepublicans, I am proud to say, are absolutely united, 55 out of 55, in \nfavor of requiring, constitutionally, a balanced budget.\n  This is not our idea. Thomas Jefferson had come back from France \nwhere he had been Minister to France during the Constitutional \nConvention, and when he first saw the Constitution, he said if he could \nchange one thing, he would limit the ability of Government to borrow \nmoney to incur debt. And we are here today, over 200 years later, \ntrying to fix this problem in the Constitution.\n  Some say this is not perfect. Some say, ``Shouldn't we exempt all \nthese programs?'' What is more important than the future of our \nchildren? A baby born in America today, if this current trend of \nspending continues--and it will without this amendment--will pay \n$187,000 of income tax during their working lifetime just to pay \ninterest on the public debt.\n  When does it end? Obviously, in the minds of our Democratic \ncolleagues, not today. We are going to pass a balanced budget \namendment, but I am very concerned that we are not going to pass it \nuntil we have a financial crisis, until we are all brought to our \nsenses that this debt binge that we are on, mortgaging the future of \nour children, taxing people yet unborn to pay benefits to people today, \nhas to end. I wish it were ending today. It is a profound \ndisappointment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, has all time expired on the pending \nissue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \norder, the Senate is set to go into recess.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak in morning \nbusiness for 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Not on this subject.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, if--\nI want to accommodate my friend from Alaska--after that, we then recess \nfor the party conferences.

Mr. President, I rise to inform the Senate of recent \nevents which relate to the nomination of Federico Pena to be Secretary \nof the Department of Energy. I would like to state up front, the issue \nis not Mr. Pena's qualifications, the issue is whether or not Secretary \nPena will have the ability to work with Congress to solve the nuclear \nwaste problem. As you know, I have been working for the past 2 years to \nfind a solution to the Nation's nuclear waste storage problem. \nCurrently, civilian nuclear waste is piling up in 41 States at 80 \nreactor sites and defense facilities around the country.\n  We have waited many years for a solution--we cannot wait any longer. \nThere is a critical need right now to find a safe central storage \nfacility to eliminate the current threat to the environment and to the \nAmerican people posed by existing storage.\n  The administration's position has been that it would not support any \nnuclear waste legislation until Yucca Mountain has been found viable as \na permanent repository. An event which was not scheduled to occur until \nlate in 1998. This position completely ignored the fact that a Federal \ncourt had ruled that the Department of Energy was required to take \ntitle to the waste in January 1998.\n  This administration's attitude toward nuclear waste storage is \nimproper, irresponsible, and unacceptable. The American people deserve \nbetter.\n  I looked forward to working with the new Energy Secretary in the \npost-election spirit of bipartisanship. Indeed, when Mr. Pena testified \nduring his confirmation hearing on January 30 that he would work with \nCongress to find a solution for nuclear waste storage, I was \nencouraged.\n  I was hoping to open a real dialog with the administration to explore \npossible compromise.\n  However, before the committee voted on Mr. Pena, the summit between \nthe President and congressional leaders took place on February 11. \nBecause I was encouraged by Mr. Pena's statements at his confirmation \nhearing, I asked Senator Lott to raise the nuclear waste issue at that \nmeeting. It was already an issue which had broad bipartisan support in \nCongress.\n  I was extremely disappointed when I received a report of what \nhappened when Senator Lott attempted to raise the issue. The Vice \nPresident said words to the effect: ``That waste is going to stay right \nwhere it is until we have a permanent place to put it.'' He went on to \nsay that he thought the meeting was to discuss items on which \ncompromise was possible and nuclear waste was not such an item.\n  I found that to be a totally irresponsible position on the part of \nthe Vice President. It also demonstrated a complete insensitivity to \none of our most urgent environmental problems and ignored the \ncontractual commitment. The Vice President had categorically ruled out \nsafe, centralized interim storage. He said ``leave it where it is.''\n  I had planned to go ahead with a markup of the reintroduced nuclear \nwaste bill and the Pena nomination the very next day, February 12, but \nI canceled that business meeting in an attempt to see if the new \nSecretary would have authority to work with Congress on the impending \nnuclear waste crisis.\n  Again the issue was not Mr. Pena's credentials, it was a question of \nwould he have the power and authority as Secretary to work with \nCongress on the nuclear waste problem.\n  During the following week, I requested a meeting with White House \nChief of Staff, Erskine Bowles, to discuss this matter. That meeting \noccurred last Tuesday.\n\n  I asked Mr. Bowles if there was any way the administration could \nstart a dialog to find a responsible solution to our disagreement on \nthe waste issue. Mr. Bowles said he would look into it and get back to \nme. The meeting was cordial and I had hoped productive.\n  Mr. Bowles got back to me last Wednesday morning by telephone. It\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nwas a short conversation. I was told that there would be no discussions \nat all on nuclear waste until after Mr. Pena was confirmed. Let me \nrepeat that--no discussions at all on nuclear waste until after \nconfirmation.\n  This is the message from an administration which has had its head in \nthe sand on this issue for 4 years. They have refused to discuss or \ntake any kind of responsible position on this issue, yet they want me \nand the rest of the Senate to move forward on the nominee which will \nhave responsibility over nuclear waste policy.\n  A nominee, who when Secretary, would have absolutely no authority to \neven discuss areas of compromise.\n  It's no wonder Secretary O'Leary waited until she was free from the \nadministration to articulate her support for centralized interim \nstorage. A CQ Monitor story last week reported ``O'Leary blamed * * * \nopposition [to interim storage] on White House officials connected with \nVice President Al Gore. She said they see the issue more in political \nthan technical terms.'' ``You'll get more clarity from someone like me \noutside the system,'' O'Leary said. Unfortunately, we cannot wait until \nthe next Secretary leaves office before we hear his views on this \nsubject.\n  Safe nuclear waste storage should not be a political issue. It is a \nscientific issue and an environmental issue--and we need a solution \nnow. Sadly, the administration has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear.\n  In addition to threats to the environment and safety, 20 percent of \nour electric generating capacity is at risk--20 percent. Starting in \nJanuary 1998, there is a substantial likelihood that American taxpayers \nwill either be paying for or be deprived of billions of dollars a year \nas a result of this administration's inaction. That's right, Mr. \nPresident, estimates of the Federal Government's liability under a \nrecent lawsuit brought by the States run between $40-$80 billion.\n  Inaction is not an option. Inaction is irresponsible.\n  Mr. President, I have not asked the administration to change its \nposition prior to Mr. Pena's confirmation. I would like that, but I'm \ntrying to be reasonable. I have identified areas where S. 104 can be \nmodified to alleviate concerns. I am working with Democratic colleagues \non the committee to address some of their concerns. I would like to \nhave the same opportunity for dialog with the administration.\n  Contrary to some White House leaks, that dialog has not been linked \nto any specific Alaska issue and it has not been about Mr. Pena's \nqualifications. It has been largely about the administration's lack of \na plan to accept the waste by 1998. Americans have paid $12 billion \ninto the fund.\n  I look forward to working with a Secretary of Energy who can work \nwith me and other Members of Congress on the nuclear waste problem. It \nis very hard to explore compromise if one side won't talk.\n  It is also hard if one of the sides ducks the issue for years, and \nwon't take a position until it is forced to.\n  The Vice President says no talk and no interim storage. Period. He \nsays ``Leave it where it is''--in 41 States. Other elements of the \nadministration seem to want to be more cooperative.\n  It took a meeting with Mr. Bowles, a lot of other conversations, and \na couple delays in the confirmation vote to get them to focus on this \nimportant safety and environmental issue. The national news attention \nhas also raised visibility.\n  Now, they seem willing to face the issue. And they are beginning to \nsort out their real position. The current policy squabble inside the \nadministration suggests it is finally facing up to this pressing issue.\n  I received a letter from Mr. Bowles. It signals that the \nadministration is willing to engage in constructive dialog; it comes \nclose to finally articulating a policy; and it contradicts the Vice \nPresident's non-policy policy of leaving the waste where it is until \nthe final repository is built.\n  I am pleased to receive the letter. After 2 years, I think we finally \nmay have a real dialog. The letter says Mr. Pena will have the \nportfolio to talk and work with Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Bowles' letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Chief of Staff to the President,\n\n                               The White House, February 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         US Senate.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: The Administration is committed to \n     resolving the complex and important issue of nuclear waste \n     storage in a timely and sensible manner, consistent with \n     sound science and the protection of public health, safety, \n     and the environment. The Federal government's long-standing \n     commitment to permanent, geologic disposal should remain the \n     basic goal of high-level radioactive waste management policy.\n       The Administration believes that a decision on the siting \n     of an interim storage facility should be based on objective, \n     science-based criteria and should be informed by the \n     viability assessment of Yucca Mountain, expected in 1998. \n     Therefore, as the President has stated, he would veto any \n     legislation that would designate an interim storage facility \n     at a specific site before the viability determination of a \n     permanent geological repository at Yucca Mountain has been \n     determined.\n       Following confirmation, Secretary Pena has the portfolio in \n     the Administration to work cooperatively with the Committee \n     and others in Congress on nuclear waste disposal issues \n     within the confines of the President's policy as stated \n     above. Secretary Pena will also be meeting with \n     representatives of the nuclear industry and other \n     stakeholders to discuss DOE's response to a recent court \n     decision on the Department's contractual obligations \n     regarding nuclear waste.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Erskine B. Bowles.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, based on Mr. Bowles involvement and the \ngood faith commitment by the administration to treat this as a policy \nand not a political issue, I am announcing the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources will vote on the nomination Thursday at 9:30 a.m.\n  We look forward to resolving our differences with the administration \nand moving forward with legislation addressing the nuclear waste crisis \nby the end of this month.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Pena to stop the irresponsible \npolicy of piling high-level radioactive waste at 80 locations in 41 \nStates, near our homes and schools.\n  Taxpayers are being exposed to billions of dollars in liability and \nAmerican ratepayers are being cheated out of the $12 billion they have \npaid into the nuclear waste fund.\n  Let's get on with it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1883-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Presiding Officer give me what \nthe parliamentary situation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, 1 hour of time is reserved at this point under the control \nof the manager on the Democratic side with 20 minutes allocated to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the Senator from \nWest Virginia to arrive--and my understanding is there is not someone \non the other side now asking to speak--I will, within the time on this \nside, continue some comments I made earlier this morning.\n  I talked about the fact that the amendments were, in almost lockstep \nfashion, knocked down by the proponents of the constitutional \namendment. I was concerned about that because even many of the \nsupporters of a constitutional amendment spoke in their testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee of the basic flaws in this amendment as \nworded.\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\n  When we go to amend the Constitution of the United States, the \nconstitution of the greatest democracy in history, we have at least an \nobligation to our Nation, and certainly to the Constitution, the \nbedrock of our democracy, to do it in an understanding way, not as some \nkind of a slapdash, bumper-sticker, sloganeering fashion that raises \nmore questions than it answers.\n  The amendment before us leaves wide open questions of Social Security \nand how that is going to be handled. It leaves wide open the questions \nof a capital budget.\n  Just before we recessed for the caucuses, a proponent of the balanced \nbudget amendment spoke about Thomas Jefferson and how Thomas Jefferson \nsaid that he would have liked to have had a balanced budget amendment. \nWell, now, let us stop to think about this. Thomas Jefferson borrowed \nan amount that was equal to twice the budget of the United States for \nthe Louisiana purchase. I mean, this would be like borrowing trillions \nof dollars today.\n  Had President Jefferson had a balanced budget amendment, certainly \none like this, he would not have been able to do that. North Dakota \nwould have had the chance to speak Spanish, not English. Our European-\nsponsored wars probably would have taken place on our continent. \nCertainly the United States would not be a country described as ``from \nsea to shining sea.''\n  These are some of the historical, as opposed to hysterical, facts in \nthis debate.\n  Senator Dodd offered an amendment that pointed out another serious \nflaw in the language of the proposed constitutional amendment. Section \n5 of the proposed amendment requires the United States to be engaged in \nmilitary conflict before a waiver may be obtained. Moreover, the Senate \nreport compounded the problem by indicating that only certain kinds of \nmilitary conflict may qualify. Only military conflict that involved the \nactual use of military force may serve as the basis for this waiver.\n  Senator Dodd's amendment exposes the folly of this language. It would \ncreate constitutional circumstances making military spending and \npreparations easier only when military force is actually used and \nmilitary conflict ensues. If you want to arm to deter aggression, that \nis suddenly no longer the preferred course. If you want to aid allies \nin a conflict rather than dispatching U.S. military forces, that would \nno longer be as viable an alternative. If you wanted to rebuild our \nmilitary capabilities after conflict, you could not do it without \nthree-fifths.\n\n  Has nobody read a history book about World War II? Does nobody know \nwhat preparations we had to undertake and the possibility that we might \ngo into war? Has nobody read what we did to help other countries? \nInstead of addressing the serious and substantial concerns raised by \nSenator Dodd's amendment, the sponsors and proponents of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 simply opposed the Dodd amendment as creating a loophole \nin the balanced budget amendment. The proponents did not offer \nalternative language to address the real military and foreign policy \nconcerns surrounding Senate Joint Resolution 1. Instead, lockstep \nvoting, they defeated the Dodd amendment by a vote of 64-36. And then \nthey rejected those provisions again when they rejected the Torricelli \namendment.\n  We have probably reached a point, Mr. President, where Senators know \nhow they are going to vote. But I hope that they will go back and read \nwhat is in this debate. We have said over and over again that if you \nreally want a balanced budget, just balance it. Vote to do it. This \nmorning, I asked the distinguished Republican whip, ``Where is the \nRepublican budget?'' You know, we have had this debated on the floor of \nthe Senate, Mr. President, when I have raised the fact that we are now \npaying the interest on the huge debt brought up in the last two \nadministrations--President Reagan's and President Bush's--and the fact \nthat if we weren't paying the interest on the debt and deficits created \njust in those two administrations, we would actually have a surplus in \nour budget today, not a deficit.\n  Having said that, the response was, well, now it is not the President \nwho proposes that, it is the Congress that does that. If you want to go \ninto facts, President Reagan got 99.99 percent of everything he ever \nasked for. Even though he had the veto pen, he only vetoed one spending \nbill--only one--as each year unprecedented deficits went up, as each \nyear his budget showed greater deficits than had ever been seen in the \nhistory of this country, and he vetoed one spending bill. Why? Was it \nbecause it spent too much money? No. He vetoed that one bill because it \nspent less money than he thought it should. The only spending bill \nPresident Reagan ever vetoed was one that spent less than what he \nwanted.\n  Let us assume that it is not the President's prerogative to propose a \nbudget. Let us assume it is not the President's plan, and let us assume \nit is the Congress'. Then I ask, again, my friend, the Republican whip, \nand others, where is the budget? ``Where's the beef?'' On April 15, we \nare supposed to have a budget. Republicans control the Senate and the \nHouse. They have a majority in each House. If, indeed, they really want \na balanced budget--not a balanced budget gimmick, but a balanced \nbudget--then vote one, pass one. There are 55 Republicans in the \nSenate. That is a majority. There is a majority of Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives. Just bring up the budget and pass it. Pass \nit. Pass the actual spending bills and tax bills.\n  Last year, even with a majority, they didn't even pass 13 \nappropriations bills on time. Mr. President, the public should not hold \ntheir breath waiting for this to happen. The reason is very simple. It \nis one thing to pass on to the States a constitutional amendment, no \nmatter how poorly drafted, and say, there, I voted for a balanced \nbudget. You can put that on the bumper sticker on your car, you can put \nit on the tag line in your campaign, and you can use it in focus \ngroups. Of course, it doesn't balance the budget. It doesn't do one \nthing. It doesn't change 1 cent of our national debt or the deficit, or \n1 cent of the budget. But it sure makes you feel good, and it is a nice \npolitical gimmick. But if you cast the hard votes to actually bring the \ndeficit down and actually balance the budget, then you are going to \nupset special interests from the right to the left. I know. I have \nvoted for an awful lot of cuts to our budget. I voted for programs that \nbrought down the deficit. I voted for programs that cut thousands and \ntens of thousands of Federal employees off of the rolls. I have voted \nto cut programs in my own State that closed offices in my State and in \nthe State of the Presiding Officer, and every other place.\n  I think I have heard from everybody whose toes I stepped on in those \ncuts. It is a heck of a lot easier to vote for the constitutional \namendment and say everybody is going to agree with you. It is more \ndifficult to make the actual cuts.\n  My challenge is this, to all those who say you want a balanced \nbudget. Fine, you have until April 15 to bring one up, and then start \nmaking the tough cuts. Mr. President, I guarantee you, we won't see the \ntough cuts being made, the real efforts to balance the budget. But you \nare going to hear, once this cockamamy flimflam of a bumper sticker \nconstitutional amendment goes down to defeat this afternoon, you are \ngoing to hear everybody saying, ``Oh, we lost our chance to have a \nbalanced budget.'' My response to that is: You guys are in charge, go \nahead and do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the ranking \nmember, who has done a stalwart job in managing this joint resolution \nin the last week or 10 days.\n  Mr. President, if there were ever an example of a ``David versus \nGoliath,'' it is apparent in what happened this last week. All over \nAmerica, ads are being run on television, radio, and in newspapers. \nMillions of dollars are being spent to talk about the merits of the \nunderlying constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. These ads \nare full-page ads in some of the most expensive publications in the \nworld--the Wall Street Journal, et cetera.\n  The people who need Social Security can't afford these ads. These \npeople are certainly those that represent the ``David versus the \nGoliaths.'' Let me\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\nread to you a couple of letters I have received in my office:\n\n       Dear Sir: I would like to join your fight to stop Congress \n     from turning Social Security trust funds into a slush fund to \n     offset Government spending. I support a balanced budget, but \n     not one to loot the Social Security that we have paid into, \n     and our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, \n     and cousins have also supported. I want to help you in your \n     fight to protect America's trust.\n                                                  Mildred Johnson.\n\n  This is not a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, or an ad on \nnetwork television or radio stations all over America, but just the \nsending of a letter. This is the best she could do. It was probably \nhard for her to pay for the stamp on the mail.\n  In the State of Nevada we have a Social Security recipient who \nreceives $725 a month. These are the people who are supporting what we \nare trying to do. George Fry from Reno, NV:\n\n       Thank you for your concern, Senator Reid, for Social \n     Security. I am 74. After working my whole life, I really need \n     Social Security. I have a difficult time. My income is in the \n     $6,000 range per year. Social Security plus SSI are $490.89 \n     month. You are very good about helping poor old people.\n\n  He is good to send his letter with a 32-cent stamp.\n  Francis Salden, from Las Vegas:\n\n       Please do not let anyone take Social Security from us. We \n     work very hard for this and sure would be lost if we wouldn't \n     have this. My husband and I work from 7 in the morning until \n     11:30 at night so we would not be without this . . . Social \n     Security.\n\n  They are not just old people who are concerned about Social Security. \nYoung people are concerned also.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is an important program, one that we \nhave to do everything we can to support and maintain. It is the most \nimportant social program in the history of the world. It is the most \nsuccessful social program in the history of the world. If Senate Joint \nResolution 1 passes, Social Security will be devastated.\n  We have heard very little talk about how Social Security wouldn't be \nprotected. Everyone has said we want to protect Social Security. The \neasiest way to protect Social Security is to secure it from the \nconfines of the underlying amendment, as we tried to do, and we got 45 \nvotes. All we need is five other people to come and say, ``We support \nthe amendment,'' and follow the leadership of the courageous Senator \nfrom Arizona, the senior Senator, Senator McCain, and the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, who said, ``In spite of \nparty affiliation, we are going to vote for the amendment because it \nwill protect Social Security.''\n  Mr. President, the polls in America support us. When I started this \ndebate 4 years ago, I was a lone wolf crying in the wilderness. Now, 75 \npercent of the American public say we want to balance the budget but we \nwant to exclude Social Security from doing so. That will make it hard \nto do. The easy way to balance the budget is to use Social Security. We \nwant to exclude Social Security.\n  We have the Congressional Research Service supporting us. The Center \nfor Budget Policy supports our position, Mr. President. We want to \nbalance the budget, and we have voted for a balanced budget. It would \nbe very difficult and hard to balance it if we excluded Social \nSecurity, but it will be the right way to do it.\n  I ask my friends from the other side of the aisle to recognize that \nunless we exclude Social Security, we are dooming the most successful \nprogram in the history of the world to failure.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I have previously emphasized, the \nconstitutional amendment is not like a statute that we can revisit, \nfine tune, revise, or repeal. We have repealed only one constitutional \namendment in more than 200 years of our country's history. The only \nconstitutional amendment we have repealed was that of prohibition.\n  We ought to remember in this debate that we are being asked to \nconsider an amendment to our Constitution. Before we propose to alter \nour fundamental charter of freedom--I might say also the blueprint for \nour representative democracy--we ought to step back from the political \npassions of the moment. We are debating a proposed constitutional \namendment, not just a political slogan, a plank of a campaign platform, \nor partisan win or lose.\n  The Constitution of the United States is a good document. It is not a \nsacred text, but it is the best law of any that has ever been written. \nThat is why it has survived as the supreme law of this country with \nvery few alterations over 200 years. It has contributed to our success \nas a nation by binding us together rather than tearing us apart. It \ncontains a great compromise that allowed small States and large States \nto join together in the spirit of mutual accommodation and respect. It \nembodies the protections to make real the pronouncements in our \nhistoric Declaration of Independence. It gives meaning to our \ninalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  The Constitution requires due process and guarantees equal protection \nof the law. It protects our freedom of thought and protects our freedom \nto worship or not as we each choose, and our political freedoms as \nwell. It is the basis of our fundamental rights of privacy and for \nlimiting Government's intrusions--and burdens--into our lives.\n  So I oppose what I perceive to be this growing fascination in this \ncountry--and, unfortunately, the growing fascination with so many in \nCongress--to lay waste to our Constitution and the protections that \nhave served us well for over 20 years. The separation of powers \namendment is the power of the purse and should be supported and \ndefended.\n  The most recent Republican platform endorsed six or seven \nconstitutional amendments, of which this is only the first. In the last \nCongress, the Senate debated and rejected three proposed amendments. \nThis year that number could well double, or even triple, unless we \nbegin to exercise some discipline and restraint.\n  We have only amended the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of \nRights. We have only amended it 17 times since the Bill of Rights \nbecause those who walked these Halls ahead of us had enough sense that \nthe Constitution came before their political purposes, their polls, \ntheir momentary needs. They thought, ``How do we protect this \nConstitution, one of the shortest in the world? How do we protect it \nand keep it the living, breathing Constitution that it is?''\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  And of those 17 times, two of those amendments washed each other out.\n  Mr. LEAHY. They did indeed. As I referred to just before the Senator \ncame on the floor, one of those amendments was, of course, to repeal an \nearlier amendment.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from North Dakota and my friend from \nWest Virginia on the floor. I will yield the floor with this.\n  When we started off in this Congress, each one of us swore an oath to \nsupport and defend the Constitution. That is our duty--all of us--to \nthose who forged this great document. It is our responsibility to those \nwho sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution. It is our \ncommitment to our constituents. It is the legacy to those who will \nsucceed us just as it is showing our responsibility to those who stood \nup before us.\n\n  Mr. President, we talk about our children. My children will live most \nof their lives in this next century. I want them to have a constitution \nthey can be proud of, not a constitution that fell, injured by \nmomentary political passions.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I \nespecially thank my colleague from West Virginia for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, we are going to vote in just a very few hours on one \nof the most critical issues facing this country. Mr. President, I \nbelieve deeply that we must balance the Federal budget. I believe we \nmust do it because we are faced with a demographic time bomb that puts \nthis Nation's future in jeopardy if we fail to act. Just as deeply as I \nfeel about balancing the budget, I feel opposition to the balanced \nbudget amendment that is before this body. I call it the so-called \nbalanced budget amendment, because the most important question that we \nneed to ask and answer today is, What budget is being balanced by this \namendment?\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\n  When you pierce the veil, what you find is this isn't a balanced \nbudget amendment at all. It does not balance the budget. It loots and \nraids every trust fund that this Government has in order to claim \nbalance. That is what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, as I have pointed out before on the floor of this \nbody, if any private company sought to take the retirement funds of \ntheir employees and throw those into the pot to claim they had balanced \nthe budget, they would be in violation of Federal law. Yet we are about \nto enshrine that principle in the Constitution of the United States? \nThe greatest document in human history is our Constitution. It has made \nthis country the greatest country in human history.\n  Mr. President, this amendment that is before us would take the Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses--just over the next 5 years, $465 \nbillion--and raid and loot every penny in order to claim balance. The \nAmerican people are for this amendment by about 80 percent until they \nfind out how it works. When they find out it only balances by raiding \nand looting trust funds, then 80 percent of them are opposed to it.\n  Part of our responsibility is to make certain that people know how \nthis so-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution works. \nThis is what it does. It raids and loots every penny of Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses in order to claim balance.\n  This chart I think discloses just how fraudulent the proposal we are \nabout to vote on is. It shows the deficits and debt in the year 2002. \nIf this is a balanced budget amendment, then in the year 2002, in which \nit is fully effected, one would expect the debt would not be \nincreasing, that it would stop deficit spending.\n  That is not what it does. On a unified basis, they claim balance. \nThat is by using every penny of every trust fund of the Federal \nGovernment. But if you look at excluding the Social Security trust \nfunds and Postal Service funds, you will find that in the year 2002 we \nwould have a $103 billion deficit. If you look more broadly at all of \nthe funds, all of the trust funds, you find out that the debt would \nincrease $110 billion in the year it is effected.\n  Mr. President, this is not a balanced budget amendment at all.\n  Second, there is no provision for a national economic emergency. We \nknow that right now the right policy is to cut spending and balance the \nbudget. That was exactly the wrong policy in the midst of the Great \nDepression. We ought to have provision for a national economic \nemergency.\n  Third and finally, we ought not to have a circumstance that would \npermit unelected judges to write the budget for the United States. That \nwould be a profound mistake. The judges know nothing about the defense \nneeds of America. They know nothing about the budget considerations for \nthis country. The last thing we ought to have happen is to have \nunelected Federal judges sitting around the table writing the budget \nfor the United States.\n  For those reasons, I am opposed to the balanced budget amendment that \nwe will vote on in just a few hours. It would be a mistake for the \ncountry. It would not stand the test of time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia is here, and I will yield to him. How much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont, on his time, has 12 \nminutes and 42 seconds, but the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nhas 20 minutes reserved time under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If that is the conclusion of the Chair, it certainly is \none I am very much in favor of. So that the Senator from West Virginia \nwill have 20 minutes of his own time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont. May I say \nthat if he has any problem with speakers whom he may have promised some \ntime, if I can be of any help with my time, I would like him to let me \nknow and I will yield some of it.\n  Mr. President, when the delegates gathered in Philadelphia in May of \n1787, much was riding on their deliberations. No one can read the \nspeeches and notes from the Constitutional Convention and miss the \ntenseness in the air as the men who gathered in May contemplated the \nsheer magnitude of their task. The situation in the states was \ncritical. These men were charged with nothing less than breathing life \ninto the promise of the beautiful prose crafted by Thomas Jefferson in \nthe Declaration of Independence. They would be held accountable if they \nfailed.\n  What happened in that room in Philadelphia was extraordinary. What \nemerged was a near perfect balance of order and liberty, and a careful \nequanimity between individual freedom and the need for the security of \nall. George Washington described the result as, ``little short of a \nmiracle.'' Indeed, one cannot read the Constitution without marveling \nat the genius of its sparsely worded Articles. I have often felt that \nsurely the spirit of the Creator himself was present in the sultry air \nduring that season in Philadelphia.\n  But, the amendment which the Senate has been considering for the last \n11 session days would rudely disrupt the carefully balanced powers of \nthe three branches so assiduously planned by the Framers. It would, for \nthe first time in our history, write a specific fiscal policy into a \nConstitution intended to accommodate the ages. It would subjugate every \nendeavor, every need, every aspiration of the people of this nation to \none goal--the goal of perpetually maintaining budget balance. It would \nturn a system which has operated well for over 200 years because of its \nunderlying faith in the judgment of a majority of reasonable men and \nwomen into a system that shackles that judgment to the whims and \npolitics of a minority. And because of its unworkable rigidity, the \namendment would, before long, be deliberately circumvented, thus laying \nthe groundwork for the slow undoing of the people's reverence for their \norganic law.\n  This idea, which seems so simple on its face, has been born of mass \nfrustration and political expediency. Ours is an age transfixed by \nefficiency, and the sometimes inefficient, often untidy machinations of \nrepresentative democracy can seem cumbersome. Ours is an age, too, \nwhich deifies certainty--an age which has great faith in our ability to \nquantify everything, to predict all contingencies, to deal with all \neventualities in advance. In fact, much of the law which we write today \nseems to reflect an almost compulsive urge to anticipate, regulate, and \ncontrol every human activity.\n  It is ironic that many who support this amendment also rail against \nthe large hand of government control in the private sector. What is \nthis amendment but a strange hyperextension of that same urge to try to \npredict and control every budget eventuality with some sort of legal \nrestriction which will keep us in budget balance in perpetuity? \nEspecially in the case of the budget process, our laws have already \nbecome so complicated that few in Washington truly understand them. Why \nwould we want to compound that complexity by the addition of a \nconstitutional amendment and all of the rigidity and danger that it \nposes? The answer is simply that the people are frustrated, and this \namendment can serve as political cover for a time. So we all decry debt \nand bemoan deficits and claim that we need the amendment for \ndiscipline. It is the magic formula. It is the ultimate fix for our \nbudget problems.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has, since the \nstart of this debate, kept the budget documents for the past 28 years \nupon his desk. It is true that we have run large deficits during many \nof those years. But, let us not forget that the heavy spending that \nthis nation undertook during the cold war certainly contributed to \nthose unbalanced budgets.\n  Yes, we ran deficits, but I was here, and I can tell you that there \nwas no significant feeling in this chamber that that money was not well \nspent. This body reflected a strong consensus in the nation as a whole \nthat we needed to spend whatever it took to assure our survival as a \nnation, and to prevail over the Soviet Empire in the cold war. Starting \nin 1962 and continuing until 1982, the annual average percentage for \ndefense spending of the entire discretionary spending pie was 60.6 \npercent. From FY 1983 to FY 1992, defense spending exceeded domestic \nspending by an annual average of 68 percent for the whole period. The \nrationale provided by then President Reagan was\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nthat we would spend the Russians into the ground. Their economy was no \nmatch for ours and the Evil Empire would implode.\n\n  It was a successful strategy. The Soviets were unable to match our \ndefense investments and beggared their economy to such an extent that \nit was a major contributing factor to the shattering of the Soviet \nempire.\n  Was that money well spent? Did we invest wisely? You bet we did! It \nwas one of the best investments ever made by the United States over \ntime. Yet, it could never have been done under this amendment.\n  We got something invaluable for that budgetary debt. We protected our \nway of life and our freedoms against a foreign menace. And not only did \nwe protect our way of life, we performed a service for millions of \npeople around the globe by breaking the backs of the Soviets. Those \nannual budgets were based on an assessment of the best interests of our \nnational needs at the time by a majority in the Congress working with \nthe Executive. And that is exactly as the Framers envisioned.\n  Throughout this debate, I have heard debt and deficits portrayed as \n``immoral''. What folly that is! While most would say that gambling \ndebts are bad, or immoral, would anyone claim that borrowing to send a \nchild to college or to provide a home for one's family is an evil or \nimmoral thing? Indeed it can be immoral not to borrow. And by denying \nfuture leaders the budgetary freedom to borrow for investments for \nfuture generations, are we not depriving those future citizens of the \nbirthright of realizing their full potential? By subjugating every \nother objective and every national endeavor, everything, from \nprotecting an ally, to building up to fight a war, to conquering an \nepidemic, to feeding the starving, to investing in public \ninfrastructure, to educating our children, to challenging foreign \ncompetition in the international playing field, to protecting our \neconomy in the event of a recession, everything will be held hostage to \nthe all supreme god, the golden calf, of balancing the budget each and \nevery year. Is that what the American people want?\n  Has anyone been noticing the recent economic surge of China? Its \ngrowth rate is now around 10 percent a year. Its economy now ranks \nthird in the world. And China has increased its military budget by 50 \npercent in real terms between 1988 and 1993. Surely China is fast \nbecoming an economic power to be reckoned with. Are my colleagues \ncompletely sure that, even in the military arena, future challenges \nwill not arise that may require us to again mount a long, steady \nbuildup of fresh dollars for defense? We need the tools to react. We \ncannot anticipate every future contingency.\n  Yes, it is true that presently, our debt is too high. In part, we are \nstill grappling with the residue of debt from the cold war buildup and \nthe savings and loan crisis. In cooperation with President Clinton, \nover the past several years the deficit has been coming down. We have \nheard the concern of the people. Our system is working in exactly the \nway the Framers intended. We have had the latitude to meet our \nchallenges. We have all the constitutional power we need right now to \nbalance the budget. We need nothing more. Adoption of this amendment \nwill only close down our future options and invite the ingenuity of \ncircumvention. Let no one be confused. If this amendment were ever to \nbecome part of our sacred Constitution, all of our collective energies, \nhenceforth, would be devoted to overcoming each of the obstacles it \nwill have erected. A thousand flowers would bloom--all of them sowing \nthe poisonous seeds of disrespect for our law and further mistrust of \nGovernment.\n  Balancing the budget is, indeed, a very difficult task. It is \ndifficult because it means inflicting pain. It means making decisions \nthat are not popular, and it means hurting some people because of cuts \nto programs that matter in their lives. But we were sent here to use \nour judgment and to make the hard decisions. All that we have to do now \nis don the ``velvet cloak of responsibility.'' We need to begin by \ntelling the people the truth about what it will take to achieve yearly \nbudget balance. If this is to be our goal, taxes will have to be raised \nand popular programs will have to be cut, because there is no other \nway.\n  Already, our lack of courage and candor has resulted in mistrust by \nour constituents. But, surely the answer to our political dilemma is \nnot to make our Constitution a scapegoat. Let us not make this \nConstitution a scapegoat. Let us never go down the ridiculous road of \nsaying to the people, ``it's not my fault, the Constitution made me do \nit.'' That is the ultimate cop-out. The easiest thing in the world for \npoliticians and for bureaucrats to do is to hide behind the regulations \nor, in this case, behind a constitutional amendment. One of the few \nthings that continues to unite us and to command our collective \nreverence is our Constitution. I would hope that we would always be \nunwilling to risk that precious commodity, just so politicians can more \nconveniently duck the accountability for difficult decisions.\n  Public policy is often controversial, but it can only be crafted by \nhuman judgment. No process--no amendment to the Constitution, no law \nthat can ever be devised can ever substitute for it. The dream of a \nsomehow automatic government, completely objective and insulated from \nthe perils of flawed human judgement, may be in vogue today because it \nfits neatly with our traditional fear of government, especially big \ngovernment. But, automatic, mechanistic, formula approaches to \ngoverning are really the antithesis of what the Framers had in mind.\n\n  Theirs was a vision of well-motivated men, kept in check by carefully \nbalanced powers and accountability to the public, but left unfettered \nenough to deal with the changes and challenges of the ages. The \nproponents of this amendment claim that we must have this amendment or \nthere will be no discipline to force budget balance. Consider the \npaucity of that argument! Remember that word, accountability. The \npeople have all the tools they need to discipline us, simply by \nexercising their rights at the ballot box come election day. I believe \nthat we can meet our responsibilities to bring this budget to balance \nwithout resorting to this ruinous encumbrance of our Constitution. But, \nwe must all step up to our responsibilities, be accountable to our \npeople, and put aside partisanship if we are to succeed. If we do that, \nthen this amendment will at last be relegated to the ash heap of bad \nideas where it most assuredly belongs.\n  I have fought this fight a half dozen times in the Senate since 1986. \nFrankly, I am weary. There is so much at stake. But, each time that I \nfight this amendment anew, I thank God that there are those members who \nare willing to risk political popularity for the dictates of their own \nconsciences.\n  And they have no one to answer to but their constituents. When they \ntake the oath of office to be United States Senator, they do not \nsurrender their independence. They do not surrender their independence. \nThey do not surrender their consciences to anybody in this Chamber or \nin this Government. And they are accountable only to the people of \ntheir States.\n  They have not taken the easiest course. They have chosen, rather, to \ngo against the prevailing political winds in order to do the right \nthing. There can be no other motivation for such courage, but a deep \nand abiding love for this magnificent country of ours.\n  The 5th century Athenian statesman, Pericles, delivered a funeral \noration to commemorate the soldiers who gave their lives at the battle \nof Salamis. Upon that occasion he said, ``It was for such a country, \nthen, that these men, nobly resolving not to have it taken from them, \nfell fighting and every one of their survivors may well be willing to \nsuffer in its behalf.'' I thank God for a continuing supply of these \nnoble men and women in our own time, ``willing to suffer'' on behalf of \nour country and its Constitution. Because of their courage, the \n``miracle at Philadelphia'' may be preserved for yet a while longer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Vermont has \n12 minutes, 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has yielded \nback 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has stood \nstalwartly like the giant rock maple trees of Vermont, those trees, \nwhich have such great strength but are also the source of Vermont's \nsweetest product, maple syrup. I say this because we know of the \nkindness and gentleness toward his colleagues of the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, but we know that like the rock maple trees \nof Vermont, he does not bend to the attacks on the Constitution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend from Vermont whose heart is as stout as \nthe Irish oak and as pure as the Lakes of Killarney.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I didn't think in 22 years I would be at a loss for words \non the floor of the Senate, but that came as close, let me tell you.\n  Mr. President, we will come very soon to a vote. The distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia does deserve enormous credit for standing up \neach time for the Constitution. Really, that is what I am urging \nSenators to do. There is no question in my mind that if we took a \npublic opinion poll, the popular thing, the easy thing would be to vote \nfor this constitutional amendment, and we can say, then, as soon as the \nStates ratify it, it is somebody else's problem.\n  If we don't stand up and do the things we need to do to protect the \nConstitution, if we don't stand up and do the things we need to do to \nbring down the deficit, if we don't stand up and cast the tough and \nunpopular votes, well, then, somebody can go to court and let the \ncourts straighten it out.\n  Mr. President, when I first announced for the U.S. Senate in this \nweek--this very week--in 1974, I was a 33-year-old prosecutor in the \nonly State in the Union that had never elected a member of my party. I \ntold the people of Vermont, ``You may not always agree with me on every \nsingle thing I will do, but I will make you one pledge: I will hold \nyour interests and the interests of the country foremost. I will follow \nmy best judgment. I will follow my conscience. I will not allow myself \nto be swayed by passing polls and fancies, and I will always try to do \nright.''\n  I have cast more votes in the U.S. Senate than any Senator in \nVermont's history. I have cast more votes in the U.S. Senate, by far, \nthan any Senator in Vermont's history. If I went back through those \nthousands of votes, I bet I could find a vote or two or three or four \nthat might come as close. Some come to mind, because some of these \nvotes were votes, if I could have cast it on a balance, I would have \ncast 51 percent one way, 49 percent the other, they were that close.\n  I remember the wise advice of the majority leader when I first came \nhere, Senator Mansfield of Montana, who said, ``Don't worry if maybe \nyou have some difficulty on a very close vote. Do what you think is \nright, and if later you determine maybe you made a mistake, the issue \nwill come up again.'' It usually does.\n  So if I go back to the thousands of votes, I could find one of those \n51 to 49 votes, but this is not one of those 51 to 49 votes. On this \nvote, I have no question in my mind what is the right vote. It is not \nthe popular vote, but it is the right vote, and that is the vote I will \ncast against this amendment, because we have amended the Constitution \nonly 17 times since the Bill of Rights, and two of those amendments \ncrossed each other out: One was for prohibition; one was to end \nprohibition. All the other amendments have stayed there, because the \nmen and women who came before us carefully considered what was best for \nthe country, what was best for our Constitution, and even though during \nthis time the temptation, the siren song of constitutional amendments \nhas been heard through the Halls of the House and the Senate hundreds \nand hundreds of times, the siren song has been heard by those \ncampaigning, by those elected and by those defeated, but the siren song \nwas resisted. We are a better country for it.\n  This is not a time to try to manipulate the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America. This is not a time to put into the \nConstitution an amendment so flawed, an amendment that leaves more \nquestions unanswered than questions answered, an amendment that may \nlook good on a bumper sticker but stinks like a dead mackerel on the \nshores of the Constitution. This is not an amendment this Senate should \nsend to the States.\n  Rather, what we should do, Republicans and Democrats alike, is join \ntogether and pass real budgets, pass those budgets that allow the \nUnited States to continue to have the world's strongest economy, an \neconomy that is the envy of every other country, and an economy, \nincidentally, which has a smaller deficit as part of its gross domestic \nproduct than any of the rest of the industrialized world, an economy \nwhich is unmatched in recorded history, and realize that there are \nthings that we should spend for.\n  Thomas Jefferson borrowed an amount, I think, equal to about twice \nwhat the whole budget of the United States was to make the Louisiana \npurchase. Is there anybody here who would like to see what this country \nwould be like had we not made that Louisiana purchase, had we not had \nthat westward expansion? If we had not been able to go out to our \nWestern States, why, there are some Senators even currently in this \nChamber today who might not have States to represent had we not had the \nLouisiana purchase.\n  I ask Senators to think back to when the Constitution was put \ntogether. Small States and large States were given an equal voice in \nthis body so that they could maintain their identity. What a great \ncompromise that was, what that did to allow this country to hold \ntogether--an advantage, obviously, to my own State of Vermont. But \nunder this constitutional amendment, on matters of spending, on matters \nof crises, on matters of natural disasters, we would no longer have \nthat parity. We would be left at the whim of the minority, not of the \nmajority.\n  So, Mr. President, on this vote, I am sure in my heart and soul I am \nvoting the right way, the right way for the State of Vermont. But I \nmust say to my fellow Vermonters, even more important, it is the right \nway for our country and our Constitution.\n  I was raised in a household brought to revere the Constitution. I \nhave taken an oath to support it in each of my terms in the U.S. \nSenate, in each of my terms as a prosecuting attorney. I remember each \nand every time I took that oath because I stopped and thought of what I \nwas swearing allegiance to. It is what sets us apart from all other \ncountries on Earth. It is why we have a Constitution that every one of \nus should stop and read and reread periodically. It is why, if we have \na matter where we want to bring down the deficits, then do it the \nhonest, old-fashioned way, vote to bring it down, vote the hard \nchoices, vote against the special interest groups on the right or left, \nvote for what is best for the country, but do not pass the \nresponsibility off to our Constitution, to future generations, to the \ncourts to do what we are elected to do, what we are paid to do, and, \nmore important, what we are sworn to do for this country.\n  This is something that should unite Democrats and Republicans. When \nthis debate is over and after this vote has gone by, I hope that before \nwe go to more bumper-sticker kinds of debates, that we go to the issues \nwhere we can join. Certainly the financial status of this country is \none.\n  Mr. President, earlier today, I was summarizing the debate that the \nSenate has had on this proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States. I would like to continue that discussion to complete \nthe Record on this historic debate.\n\n\n                 REID, FEINSTEIN AND DORGAN AMENDMENTS\n\n  Senator Reid offered a perfecting amendment to exclude the Social \nSecurity trust fund from Senate Joint Resolution 1. Senators Feinstein \nand Dorgan also offered substitute constitutional amendments that would \nhave excluded the Social Security trust fund from the balanced budget \nmandates. The Reid, Feinstein and Dorgan amendments all focused on \nremoving any threat to Social Security by this proposed constitutional \namendment.\n  The Social Security Program is America's contract with its senior \ncitizens. Were the underlying resolution to become the basis for a \nconstitutionally-mandated budget balancing act, Social Security would \nbe rendered just another Government program and have its place on the \nchopping block with everything else.\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\n  Since 1983, Congress has acted to protect Social Security from \noverall budget cuts. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 required \nSocial Security to be placed off budget within 10 years. That \nprotective legislation passed the Senate 58 to 14 with a strong \nbipartisan majority. In fact, Congress accelerated this process. Rather \nthan wait 10 years, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct of 1985, commonly known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, placed Social \nSecurity off budget beginning in 1986. This means that the \ncongressional budget resolution in 1985 was the last time that Social \nSecurity was included in the Federal budgets that Congress approves \neach year.\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings permitted across-the-board spending cuts--\nsequestration--when budgetary goals are not achieved. By its actions \nplacing Social Security off budget, Congress explicitly and \nintentionally exempted Social Security from the sequestration process. \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings--with its protections for Social Security--passed \nthe Senate 61 to 31 with a strong bipartisan majority.\n  The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 reinforced earlier protections by \nplacing Social Security even more clearly off budget. This bill, too, \npassed the Senate 54 to 45 with the bipartisan support of 35 Democrats \nand 19 Republicans.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment turns its back on these many \nyears of bipartisan progress in protecting Social Security from the ebb \nand flow of efforts to eliminate the deficit. I believe that our senior \ncitizens deserve better.\n  When the Government overestimates revenues for an upcoming year, or \nunderestimates expenses, or something changes in the course of the year \nto influence either, the budget goes out of balance and, under Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, the Government is out of money. The amendment's \nmandates would make continued expenditures into constitutional \nviolations of law. If this proposed constitutional amendment were \nenshrined in the Constitution, it could force the Federal Government to \nstop making payments for any number of obligations, possibly including \npayment of Social Security checks, until the budget imbalance could be \ncorrected.\n  Treasury Secretary Rubin warned the Judiciary Committee of this great \nrisk, when he testified:\n\n       [T]he amendment poses immense enforcement problems that \n     might well lead to the involvement of the courts in budget \n     decisions, unprecedented impoundment powers for the President \n     or the temporary cessation of all federal payments. Any of \n     these options could disrupt Social Security and Medicare \n     payments.\n\n  Further, if the President and Congress reached a budget impasse under \nthe proposed constitutional amendment, Secretary Rubin cautioned:\n\n       Some proponents have suggested that under these \n     circumstances, the President would stop issuing checks, \n     including those for Social Security benefits. Alternatively, \n     judges might become deeply involved in determining whether \n     Social Security or Medicare checks would be stopped.\n\n  This would be a disaster for senior citizens on fixed incomes who \nlive on Social Security and Medicare from check to check. When they \nmiss a check, they will not have the funds to pay the rent or meet the \nmortgage, buy groceries, pay their utility bills, heat their homes, pay \nfor medical care or needed pharmaceutical drugs, or meet other \nexpenses.\n  That is the dilemma that the Social Security system would face if \nSocial Security is not protected under this proposed constitutional \namendment. In his recent letter to Senator Daschle, the President \nstated:\n\n       I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \n     constitutional amendment to balance the budget, could pose \n     grave risks to the Social Security System. In the event of an \n     impasse in which the budget requirements can neither be \n     waived nor met, disbursements or unelected judges could \n     reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. \n     No subsequent implementing legislation could protect Social \n     Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment \n     overrides statutory law.\n\n  The 1983 bipartisan Social Security Commission headed by Alan \nGreenspan recommended converting the Social Security system from a pure \npay-as-you-go program to one that builds up surpluses to pay for the \nfuture retirement of the baby boom generation. The Greenspan Commission \nrecommended taking Social Security off budget in order to meet this \ngoal without subjecting the program to the vicissitudes of Federal \nbudgeting for other programs. Congress concurred with the Greenspan \nCommission's recommendations in passing the Social Security Amendments \nof 1983.\n  Just as families save for their retirements, the Social Security \nProgram currently is building up surpluses while baby boomers are still \nworking in order to be able to afford their retirements in the next \ncentury. This proposed constitutional amendment would encourage, even \nnecessitate, Congress, the President, and the courts using Social \nSecurity as a way to comply with the amendment. When the trust fund \nbegins to shrink after the year 2020, this proposed constitutional \namendment would add pressure on the Government to cut Social Security \nrather than risk constitutional violation. Instead, we ought to be \nworking on ways to honor our commitments and ensure the long-term \nsolvency of Social Security.\n  A recent analysis from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities is \ntelling. It says:\n\n       The Leadership version [of S.J. Res. 1] would be virtually \n     certain to precipitate a massive crisis in Social Security \n     about 20 years from now, even if legislation has been passed \n     in the meantime putting Social Security in long-term \n     actuarial balance. To help pay the benefits of the baby boom \n     generation, the nation would face an excruciating choice at \n     that time between much deeper cuts in Social Security \n     benefits than were needed to make Social Security solvent and \n     a much larger increase in payroll taxes than would otherwise \n     be required. There would be only one other alternative--to \n     finance Social Security deficits in those years not by \n     drawing down the Social Security surplus but by raising other \n     taxes substantially or slashing the rest of government \n     severely. As a result, the government might fail to provide \n     adequately for other basic services, potentially including \n     the national defense.\n\n  Congress can balance the budget while protecting Social Security, but \nthe sponsors of the underlying resolution tabled the Reid, Feinstein \nand Dorgan amendments. I do want to acknowledge Senator McCain and \nSenator Specter for voting their conscience on the Reid and Dorgan \namendments to protect Social Security. I respect their decisions to \nbuck their party's no-amendments strategy on this point. Their votes \nnot to table these amendments were, I believe, the only times \nRepublicans voted to do anything other than march lock-step with their \nleadership in support of the original language of Senate Joint \nResolution 1.\n\n\n                  TORRICELLI AND FEINSTEIN AMENDMENTS\n\n  Before he announced his determination how he would vote on the \nunderlying resolution Senator Torricelli offered an amendment that \nhighlighted another serious flaw in Senate Joint Resolution 1. The \nunderling resolution prohibits capital budgeting.\n  As Senator Torricelli so forcefully pointed out during the Judiciary \nCommittee deliberations on Senate Joint Resolution 1, we as a nation \nare suffering from a capital investment crisis. In 1965, more than 6 \npercent of our Federal expenditures were invested in infrastructure \nsuch as roads, bridges, ports, and mass transit systems. By 1992, that \nshare of capital investment had fallen by more than half to about 3 \npercent of our Federal budget and this year it will approach barely 2 \npercent.\n  At the same time as our infrastructure funding has been shrinking, \nour Nation's needs have continued to grow. The result is that we are \nbecoming a nation in disrepair. For instance, more than a quarter of a \nmillion miles of roads need repair and more than 25 percent of our \nbridges have exceeded their lifespan.\n  This failure to maintain adequate infrastructure is hurting our \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. We are competing against other \ncountries with the foresight to repair their roads and bridges, \nmodernize their transit systems, maintain their ports, build new \nschools, and make the investments in telecommunications infrastructure \nthat are the keys to success in today's global competition. The United \nStates is dead last among the G-7 nations in public infrastructure \ninvestment as a percentage of gross domestic product.\n  We must reverse this trend and make the long-term investments needed \nto support a strong economy. We must be able to invest in education if \nwe are to\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\ngive our children their best chance to compete and win in the coming \ncentury.\n  Sections 1 and 7 of the underlying resolution prohibit capital \nbudgeting. All expenditures, whether the equivalent of operating \nexpenses or capital investments, are tallied the same for purposes of \nthis proposed constitutional amendment. The sponsors and proponents of \nthis measure refuse to permit any exception and future Congresses will \nbe forever barred from solving our infrastructure crisis by creating a \ncapital budget for long-term investments.\n  Senate committee hearings in 1995 established an extensive record in \nsupport of maintaining a separate capital budget. Herbert Stein, of the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute and former economic adviser to President \nNixon; Edward V. Regan, of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute and \nformer New York State controller; and Dr. Fred Bergsten, on behalf of \nthe bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council and former Assistant \nSecretary of the Treasury during the Carter administration; differed on \nthe wisdom of enacting a constitutional amendment on the budget but all \nagreed on one thing: If such an amendment were to be considered it \nshould separate capital investments for any annual balance requirement.\n  Nonetheless, when the majority had the opportunity to consider \namendments that would have allowed for a separate budget for capital \ninvestments, it rejected them. This was a principal thrust of the \nTorricelli substitute and an important aspect of the Feinstein \nsubstitute. They were flatly rejected by the majority and their no \namendments approach to consideration of the underlying resolution. Both \nof these amendments were tabled with all Republican members who voted, \nvoting against capital budgeting.\n  This inflexibility is one of the principal objections of the more \nthan 1,000 economists who oppose Senate Joint Resolution 1. It is also \none of the reasons President Clinton opposes this constitutional \namendment on budgeting. As the President so clearly stated:\n\n       We must give future generations the freedom to formulate \n     the federal budget in ways they deem most appropriate. For \n     example, some believe that the federal government should do \n     what many state governments do: adopt a balanced operating \n     budget and a separate capital budget. Under this \n     constitutional balanced budget proposal, the government would \n     be precluded from doing so.\n\n  During the Judiciary Committee's January 17 hearing, Robert \nGreenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained:\n\n       What families do when they balance their budget is families \n     say that all of their income, including money they borrow, \n     equals all the cash they pay out. Families borrow money when \n     they purchase a house through a mortgage, when they buy a \n     car, and especially when they send a child to college. If \n     families had to operate on the basis that this amendment \n     does, they would have to pay for all of college education out \n     of the current year's income, all of the entire cost of a \n     home, not the down payment, the whole thing, out of the \n     current year's income. Nobody operates that way.\n\n  The actions of Thomas Jefferson as President, as opposed to his oft-\nquoted ruminations about the evils of public debt, are also instructive \nbut ignored by the majority. In 1804, President Jefferson had the \nUnited States borrow $15 million, in 1804 dollars, by selling bonds to \nfinance the Louisiana Purchase. That amount approximates more than $225 \nbillion in 1993 dollars and exceeds every Federal budget deficit except \nfor the final 2 years of the Bush administration.\n  Was President Jefferson wrong to invest in the Louisiana Territory \nthat provided this country with 15 States? Of course not. But had the \nprovisions of Senate Joint Resolution 1 been included in the \nConstitution, our Nation's westward expansion might well have ended at \nthe Mississippi River.\n  Under the underlying resolution, the failure to permit a capital \nbudget would have severe consequences by discouraging long-term \ninvestment and ignoring our infrastructure crisis. Just as a budget \ndeficit unfairly harms future generations so, too, does the failure to \ndifferentiate capital investments from operating and consumption \nexpenditures. The inevitable result will be less investment in our \ncountry's future, pressure to operate through inefficient leasing \npractices and gimmickry.\n  The majority ignores the fact that 42 States, most cities, and \nbusinesses exclude from their balanced budget requirements capital, \nenterprise, or trust funds that are financed primarily by borrowing \nrather than by current revenue. Moreover, most States with balanced \nbudget requirements use capital funds that finance major capitol \nprojects by issuing long-term debt.\n  The Nation's leading economists agree that a capital budget is an \nessential part of the State experience with balanced budget \nrequirements and that the omission of a capital budget in this proposed \nconstitutional amendment is a major flaw. These economists note:\n\n       Unlike many state constitutions, which permit borrowing to \n     finance capital expenditures, the proposed federal amendment \n     makes no distinction between capital investments and current \n     outlays. . . . The amendment would prevent federal borrowing \n     to finance expenditures for infrastructure, education, \n     research and development, environmental protection, and other \n     investments vital to the nation's future well-being.\n\n  Having defeated all attempts to allow for capital budgeting within \nthe underlying resolution over the last several weeks, the weekend \npapers are again hinting that the Republican leadership is rethinking \nits strategy and may be willing to reconsider whether capital budgeting \ncan be incorporated into the underlying resolution. These vacillations \nby the majority illustrate why this matter is not appropriate for a \nconstitutional amendment. The Constitution cannot be made to say and \nrequire one fiscal policy one week and the opposite the next. That is \nnot the stuff of the Constitution. These are matters of public interest \nthat can be addressed by policy and statutes that serve the times and \nthe needs of the American people.\n\n\n                            BOXER AMENDMENT\n\n  Senator Boxer offered an amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 1 that \nagain pointed out a serious and substantial flaw with this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. The Boxer amendment would have permitted \nCongress to response to emergencies and natural disasters by a majority \nvote.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment can no more prevent a recession \nthan it can an earthquake, but it will restrict our ability to deal \nwith the effects of both. A natural disaster, such as a large-scale \nflood, earthquake, or fire, could require the Federal Government to \nexpend large sums to assist the victims and begin to rebuild the \nravaged area. We need only look to the devastation suffered in Arkansas \nand Mississippi over the last few days to be reminded of nature's \npower.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment would make these kinds of \nsudden emergency expenditures impossible because they would cause an \nunauthorized increase in the deficit. Humanitarian efforts could and \nwould be held hostage while the requisite supermajorities were rounded \nup in each House of Congress. A minority in either House could block \nsuch efforts altogether or extort other paybacks.\n  In recent years, the Federal Government has been called on to give \ncritical aid to supplement State and local efforts to protect the \npublic health and safety in response to major disasters and \nemergencies. Much of this aid has been paid for by supplemental \nappropriations because of the unexpected nature of major disasters and \nemergencies.\n  From fiscal years 1989 to 1996 Congress had to appropriate \nsupplemental major disaster and emergency relief in every year but one. \nFor example, in 1992, Congress passed an emergency supplemental \nappropriation over $4 billion to help victims of the Los Angeles riots, \nthe Chicago floods, and Hurricane Andrew. In 1993, Congress passed an \nemergency supplemental appropriation of $2 billion to help victims of \nthe Midwest floods. In 1994, Congress passed an emergency supplemental \nappropriation of more than $4 billion to help victims of the Los \nAngeles earthquake.\n  Relief for major disasters and emergencies must be flexible. Usually, \na swift response from the Federal Government is needed to aid local \nrelief efforts. Disaster and emergency relief by constitutional mandate \nis a prescription for gridlock, not swift action. When your State is \nhit by a major disaster or emergency, do you want critical Federal \nassistance to hang on the whims of 41 Senators or 175 Representatives?\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\n  Our Founders rejected requirements of supermajorities. We should look \nto their sound reasons for rejecting supermajority requirements before \nwe impose on our most vulnerable and neediest citizens a three-fifths \nsupermajority requirement to provide them Federal relief from major \ndisasters and emergencies.\n  Alexander Hamilton painted an alarming picture in ``Federalist Paper \nNo. 22'' of the consequences of the poison of supermajority \nrequirements. Hamilton said that supermajority requirements serve ``to \ndestroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, \ncaprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto \nto the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.''\n  These supermajority requirements are a recipe for increased gridlock, \nnot more efficient action. As Hamilton noted long ago: ``Hence, tedious \ndelays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of \nthe public good.'' Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic \ndistrust not just of Congress, but of the electorate itself. I reject \nthat notion.\n  I fear that a supermajority requirement will lead to some in Congress \nplaying politics with critical relief from disasters and emergencies. \nEven with today's simple majority requirement for supplemental \nappropriations for disaster and emergency relief, we see the potential \nfor partisan politics.\n  In the last Congress a multibillion-dollar disaster aid package for \nCalifornia was caught in the budget wars between President Clinton and \nHouse Republicans. The House Republican leadership delayed action on a \nrequest from the President for supplemental appropriations for \nemergency relief for victims of the California floods and Los Angeles \nearthquake. Fortunately, public outcry forced the House Republicans to \nrelent. That political gamesmanship happened with only a simple \nmajority requirement for supplemental appropriations for disaster and \nemergency relief. Think what would happen if Congress had to clear a \nsupermajority hurdle to pass disaster and emergency relief.\n  Again, instead of addressing the serious and substantial concerns \nraised by the Boxer amendment, the sponsors and proponents of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 simply opposed its consideration as creating a \nloophole in the underlying resolution. They did not offer alternative \nlanguage to address the emergency and natural disaster concerns \nsurrounding Senate Joint Resolution 1. Instead, with lock-step voting, \nthey tabled the Boxer amendment by a vote of 60 to 40.\n\n\n                           FEINGOLD AMENDMENT\n\n  Senator Feingold offered several amendments to Senate Joint \nResolution 1, including one that would have permitted the use of a \n``rainy day'' fund. Simply put, the Feingold amendment would have \nallowed the use of an accumulated surplus for necessary expenditures \nduring any fiscal year.\n  Section 6 of the underlying resolution states: ``The Congress shall \nenforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which \nmay rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.'' [Emphasis added].\n  What happens when these estimates of outlays and receipts fail to \ncome true during the fiscal year? As is ususally the case each year, \nCongress is wrong on its economic forecasts. For example, in June 1995 \nthe Congress adopted a budget resolution that anticipated a deficit of \n$170 billion in the 1996 fiscal year. In August 1995, the Congressional \nBudget Office anticipated a deficit of $189 billion for the 1996 fiscal \nyear. But the deficit for the 1996 fiscal year was actually $107 \nbillion.\n  To respond to the usual budget forecast corrections, several of the \nmajority's witinesses during Judiciary Committee hearings recommended \nthat Senate Joint Resolution 1 be amended to allow the Federal \nGovernment to establish a rainy day fund or stabilization fund. This \nfund would adjust to budget shortfalls or overruns during the fiscal \nyear.\n  For example, James C. Miller III, former Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget during the Reagan administration, testified:\n\n       I would urge you to consider incorporating a ``rainy day \n     fund.'' Thus, if one year revenues fell short (or outlays ran \n     over), you could dip into this fund without violating the \n     balanced budget requirement.\n\n  If the experience in the States is instructive, then a rainy day fund \nis a necessity for any balanced budget requirement. According to the \nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council, 45 States have budget \nstabilization funds or rainy day funds to respond to unanticipated \nshortfalls in revenue or over-runs in outlays.\n  The majority, however, ignores the advice of its own witnesses and \nthe experience in the States, and prohibits the use of a rainy day fund \nunder this proposed constitutional amendment. Instead of adopting the \nFeingold amendment, the majority simply marched forward lock-step in \ntheir no-amendments strategy and tabled the Feingold amendment by a \nvote of 60 to 40.\n\n\n                           KENNEDY AMENDMENT\n\n  Finally, Senator Kennedy offered an amendment to Senate Joint \nResolution 1 that revealed perhaps its most serious flaw. The Kennedy \namendment was a sincere effort to confront the matters of enforcement \nof the underlying resolution, which would have limited the enforcement \nof the proposed constitutional amendment to Congress.\n  As James Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 48, ``the legislative \ndepartment alone has access to the pockets of the people.'' Our \nConstitution now gives Congress the primary authority, and \nresponsibility, with regard to the raising and expenditure of outlays. \nThe proposed amendment would dramatically alter the allocation of \npowers set forth in article I, sections 7, 8, and 9.\n  It risks casting the Federal and State courts in the role of Federal \nbudget czars deciding in myriad cases whether the Federal budget is \nimpermissibly out of balance, and where it is, forbidding spending and \nordering what remedies it deems appropriate for the constitutional \nviolations occasioned by circumstances in which outlays exceeding \nrevenues in any year without supermajority approval of the Congress.\n  Although the proponents of the proposed constitutional amendment have \nleft it silent with regard to the role of the courts in its \ninterpretation, implementation, and enforcement, that silence is \ndeafening.\n  Section 1 of the amendment contains a flat prohibition on total \noutlays exceeding total receipts in any fiscal year, except as \nexpressly authorized by a supermajority in each House of Congress. \nHaving embedded this mandate in the Constitution, this proposed \nconstitutional amendment invites the courts to become actively involved \nin determining when this constitutional command is being violated and \nhow such violations are to be remedied.\n  In the memorable words of Chief Justice Marshall: ``It is, \nemphatically, the province and duty of the judicial department, to say \nwhat the law is.'' Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S., 1 Cranch, 137, 176 \n(1803). Since that historic decision, the Supreme Court has had the \npreeminent role in articulating the scope and meaning of our \nConstitution. The majority report concedes the fundamental obligation \nof the courts to say what the law is.\n  If the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting were ratified, \nthe fulfillment of this role by the Supreme Court, and other courts, \ncould require them to address complex budgetary issues that courts are \nill-suited to resolve. As de Tocqueville wrote more than 148 years ago: \n``Scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is \nnot resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question.'' If the \nproposed constitutional amendment were ratified, several of its \nprovisions would give rise to cases and controversies that the courts \nwould be called upon to resolve.\n  Supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment, in fact, desire \njudicial involvement and enforcement of its terms. The representative \nfrom the U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee:\n\n       [T]here is a legitimate and necessary role for the courts \n     in ensuring compliance with the amendment. Congress could \n     potentially circumvent balanced budget amendment requirements \n     through unrealistic revenue estimates, emergency \n     designations, off-budget accounts, unfunded mandates, and \n     other gimmickry. It is our view that the need to proscribe \n     judicial policy making can be reconciled with a constructive \n     role for the courts in maintaining the integrity of the \n     balanced budget requirement.\n\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\n\n  In response to questions, the representative of the National \nTaxpayers Union, another advocate for the proposed constitutional \namendment on budgeting in spite of its potential to lead to tax \nincreases in order to achieve balance, observed:\n\n       We oppose denying judicial review authority, and believe \n     that it would be more difficult to enforce the provisions of \n     S.J. Res. 1 if Congress were to add such language to the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n\n  The representative of the Family Research Council opposed adding \nexpress language on the role of the courts, noting that they ``would \nnot object to language that would prevent judges from raising taxes'' \nand observed:\n\n       Under our system of government, each branch has certain \n     limited means to require legal compliance by one of the other \n     branches. The use of this legal authority is somewhat \n     dependent on the political will of each branch to exercise \n     their proper authority. Each branch of government will have \n     its prerogatives to enforce the amendment, subject to \n     appropriate checks and balances.\n\n  Similarly, in 1995, in response to questions from me, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce noted: ``The BBA would be policed by the same \nbalance of powers that the Framers so carefully crafted in the \nConstitution. Thus, excesses by the Congress would be controlled by \nboth the executive and judicial branches.''\n  The former Government attorneys who support the proposed \nconstitutional amendment and have been called to testify before the \nJudiciary Committee over the last several years on the problem of \ndefining the judicial role have been unanimous about only one thing: \nCourt involvement is not prohibited by the amendment.\n  Stuart M. Gerson, a former Acting Attorney General, and William Barr, \nthe official he replaced at the end of the Bush administration, \ndiffered in what they regarded as the principal dangers posed by \njudicial intervention and in how they would seek to reduce the risks of \ncourts involvement, but they did not say and could not say that the \ncourts would not be involved in interpreting, implementing, and \nenforcing the proposed constitutional amendment were it to be ratified.\n  Mr. Gerson testified he thought judicial intervention would be \n``limited in scope'' but conceded that our constitutional law ``does \nnot remove the courts from the picture entirely where there is manifest \nabuse or disregard of unequivocal legal pronouncements.'' He noted, in \nhis written statement, that ``there is a category of case--that \ninvolving whether objective statutory terms have been satisfied--which \nalways has been cognizable and will remain so under the Balanced Budget \nAmendment,'' and, in his oral presentation, that ``in those few cases \nwhere a cognizable departure from the specific terms of the amendment \ncan be shown, courts, indeed must intervene.''\n  He went on, in response to questioning from Senator Torricelli, to \nconcede that standing for certain individuals and Members of Congress \nis possible under this amendment:\n\n       So, the answer to your question is that I think that the \n     standing of individuals and members of Congress is very \n     limited. I do concede--that there is a category of cases as \n     to which I would not deny jurisdiction to the courts to make \n     certain that the Constitution was being enforced.\n\n  When asked by Senator Torricelli, as an example, whether the Senate \nsponsors of the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting would \nhave standing before a Federal court to bring a suit to compel \ncompliance with its terms, Mr. Gerson said:\n\n       In fact, I think that situation is the most likely \n     situation in which Congressional standing, which has never \n     before been recognized, might be recognized and I say so in \n     my prepared testimony. . . . That is the one situation that \n     even Judge Bork in the D.C. Circuit recognized might allow \n     Congressional standing.\n\n  The other witness who testified before the Judiciary Committee on \nquestions of law and judicial review was Alan B. Morrison of the Public \nCitizen Litigation Group. He observed:\n\n       [I]n the absence of a clear statement of the contrary in \n     the Amendment itself, it is likely that parties who claimed \n     that, for example, the requirements for revenue increases in \n     Section 4 had not been satisfied, could show sufficient \n     injury to meet the case or controversy requirement in Article \n     III of the Constitution. The same is true for those objecting \n     to a Presidential impoundment.\n\n  Mr. Morrison thus concluded his testimony:\n\n       Senator, you will note that Section 1 of S.J. Res. 1 is not \n     put in terms of the Congress shall enact and the President \n     shall sign into law. It's put in absolute terms--total \n     outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed.\n       It seems to me that is a very unusual kind of \n     constitutional command and that despite what the courts have \n     done in other cases, no person sitting at this table or any \n     place else in this country can accurately predict what the \n     courts will do, which is the reason why I say it is so \n     important that the Congress, in the first instance, assume \n     responsibility, take it on, of saying what they want about \n     judicial review and that would be enforced in the courts.\n\n  Written testimony was received by the Judiciary Committee from Dawn \nE. Johnsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General at the Department of \nJustice. In that statement, the current head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel indicated that ``primary concern of the Department of Justice \nis how a balanced budget amendment would be enforced--an issue that \nnone of the proposed amendments thus far has adequately addressed.'' \nThe statement continues:\n\n       If a balanced budget amendment were to be enforced by the \n     courts, it could restructure the balance of power between the \n     branches of government and could empower unelected judges to \n     raise taxes or cut spending--fundamental policy decisions \n     that judges are ill-equipped to make.\n\n  The Department of Justice testimony also referred to prior statements \nby a former Solicitor General for President Nixon and Federal judge, \nRobert H. Bork, and another former Solicitor General for President \nReagan and Harvard law professor, Charles Fried. Both men have observed \nthat judicial self-restraint, based on doctrines of standing and \npolitical questions, did not overcome the possibilities of significant \nlitigation over interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of the \nproposed constitutional amendment on budgeting.\n  The Department of Justice has not varied much from that of Robert H. \nBork, 10 years ago:\n\n       In the end, there is a range of views about the extent to \n     which courts would involve themselves in issues arising under \n     the balanced budget amendment. Former Solicitor General Bork \n     believes that there ``would likely be hundreds, if not \n     thousands, of lawsuits around the country'' challenging \n     various aspects of the amendment. Similarly, Professor \n     Archibald Cox of Harvard Law School believes that ``there is \n     a substantial chance, even a strong probability, that * * * \n     federal courts all over the country would be drawn into its \n     interpretation and enforcement,'' and former Solicitor \n     General Charles Fried has testified that ``the amendment \n     would surely precipitate us into subtle and intricate legal \n     questions, and the litigation that would ensue would be \n     gruesome, intrusive, and not at all edifying.'' Other \n     commentators, such as former Attorney General William Barr, \n     believe that the political question and standing doctrines \n     likely would persuade courts to intervene in relatively few \n     situations, but that ``w]here the judicial power can properly \n     be invoked, it will most likely be reserved to address \n     serious and clear cut violations''.\n       Former Attorney General Barr may well be right that courts \n     would be reluctant to get involved in most balanced budget \n     cases. However, none of the commentators, included General \n     Barr himself, believes that the amendment would bar courts \n     from at least occasional intrusion into the budget process. \n     Accordingly, whether we would face an ``avalanche'' of \n     litigation or fewer cases alleging ``serious and clear cut \n     violations,'' a broad consensus exists that the amendment \n     creates the potential for the involvement of courts in \n     questions that are inappropriate for judicial resolution.\n\n  The proponents and sponsors do nothing to resolve this problem. They \nconcede that the text of the proposed constitutional amendment on \nbudgeting is silent with respect to judicial review, contending that \nsilence ``strikes the right balance.''\n  Mr. Morrison is correct to challenged the Congress to say what it \nintends and what it means in the text of the proposed constitutional \namendment itself. Instead, the majority is leaving to the courts \nthemselves the determination of the challenges arising under the \nproposed amendment and its implementation and what they will hear and \ndetermine. They are to be guided by the vagaries of general, \njudicially-created doctrines of justiciability.\n  The sponsors and proponents also suggest that Congress may revisit \nthis issue later through implementing legislation. Not only would such \nsubsequent implementing legislation require agreement in both Houses \nand signature by the President or a supermajority override of a \npresidential veto, but even if ultimately enacted, it may not be able \nto restrict constitutionally-derived judicial power and responsibility\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nand may itself be overridden by the commands of article III and this \nproposed 28th amendment. Former Solicitor General Charles Fried has \ntestified that a subsequent legislative effort to limit judicial power, \n``itself might very well be unconstitutional.''\n  Further, as Mr. Barr pointed out in 1995, the State courts are not \nlimited by the Federal requirement of ``case or controversy'' and its \nattendant justiciability doctrines:\n\n       Before moving on, I should point out for the Committee one \n     area that I believe does hold some potential for mischief and \n     that Congress may wish to address. That is the area of state \n     court review. The constraints of Article III do not, of \n     course, apply to state courts, which are courts of general \n     jurisdiction. State courts are not bound by the ``case or \n     controversy'' requirement or the other justiciability \n     principles, even when deciding issues of federal law, \n     including the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. \n     Asarco, Inc., 490 U.S. at 617. Accordingly, it is possible \n     that a state court could entertain a challenge to a federal \n     statute under the Balanced Budget Amendment despite the fact \n     that the plaintiff would not satisfy the requirements for \n     standing in federal court.\n\n  Although Mr. Gerson's written statement included the same point, \nalmost verbatim, the proposed constitutional amendment and majority \nreport are conveniently silent on this significant dimension of the \njudicial review problem. Nowhere do the proponents of this \nconstitutional amendment confront the problem of uncontrolled judicial \nreview by State court that has been articulated by their own witnesses \non judicial review, who conclude that ``the State court in such a \ncircumstance would have the authority to render a binding legal \njudgment.''\n  The proponents' dilemma may mirror that admitted by Mr. Barr at the \n1995 hearings: Having acknowledged the concern that courts might order \ntaxes raised as in Missouri v. Jenkins, Mr. Barr was asked by Senator \nBiden whether the proposed constitutional amendment ought not be \nrevised to include an express limitation on court power and their \nauthority to order certain types of remedies, Mr. Barr responded:\n\n       If I were a Senator, I would put it in the amendment. But \n     if I felt that would mean the amendment would not pass \n     because it would generate these arguments, oh, gee, this is \n     sort of like Eastern Europe, then I would without hesitation \n     support the amendment as written * * *\n\n  The proponents are refusing to confront the possibility of State \ncourt involvement and the possibility that courts in different States \nmight reach inconsistent determinations or order contradictory remedies \nbecause it is difficult, its discussion might offend, and its solution \nmight cost them a vote or two.\n  This is no way to amend the Constitution. Such ambiguity and \nconscious disregard of potential problems disserves the process, the \nproposed amendment, the American people and, possibly, the generations \nto come who will suffer under its unintended consequences.\n  In court challenges in which a constitutional violation were found by \nthe court to exist, the question of appropriate remedy will loom large. \nIndeed, it is the possibility of judicially-imposed remedies to ensure \ncompliance with the proposed constitutional amendment's command for \nbalance each fiscal year that has raised the most concern historically \nas Congress considers this matter.\n  In 1994, Senator Danforth of Missouri successfully modified the \nproposed constitutional amendment on budgeting. He sought to restrict \njudicial involvement to issuing declaratory judgments unless Congress \nspecifically authorized another form of relief through implementing \nlegislation and his amendment was accepted by the floor manager.\n  In 1995, the Senate likewise modified the proposed constitutional \namendment when the floor manager adopted an amendment proffered by \nSenator Nunn of Georgia on judicial review. The Nunn amendment called \nfor restricting the judicial power of the United States to matters \nspecifically authorized by implementing legislation.\n  Neither the Danforth nor the Nunn language nor anything like them was \nincluded in Senate Joint Resolution 1. Indeed, in spite of these past \nattempts to limit judicial remedial authority in the proposed \nconstitutional amendment and the only successful floor modifications to \nits text since 1993, the proponents now reject all such efforts. \nInstead, the proponents choose to remain silent on the many important \nissues surrounding judicial involvement in the interpretation, \nimplementation and enforcement of the proposed constitutional \namendment.\n  They try to dismiss Missouri v. Jenkins, 496 U.S. 33 (1990), and the \ndangers it portends for this proposed constitutional amendment. In that \ncase, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the power of a Federal District \nCourt Judge in Kansas City, MO, to order tax increases in order to \nimprove the public schools. The Supreme Court upheld a district court \norder that a local school district levy taxes to raise funds to comply \nwith the Court's order to remedy unconstitutional school segregation.\n  This case has spawned concern about what is sometimes referred to as \njudicial taxation and the Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the \nissue and on suggested legislation in the area in the last several \nyears. Senator Danforth cited this case in the course of offering his \namendment in 1994:\n\n       So after the case of Missouri versus Jenkins, decided by \n     the Supreme Court, it is clear that under certain \n     circumstances, the Federal courts have assumed the power to \n     impose taxes. And my concern was that Missouri versus Jenkins \n     could be the model for some future action by the Federal \n     courts.\n\n  The authority of the Federal courts to remedy constitutional \nviolations is broad, as was demonstrated in Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 \nU.S. 33 (1990). In suits where a constitutional violation of the \nproposed budgeting amendment were found, courts would be left to make \nsimilar remedial decisions.\n  In light of the deliberate omission of limiting language like that \npreviously included by Senator Danforth and Senator Nunn, the \nunderlying proposal is more likely to be construed to authorize courts \nto enjoin spending, order taxes or issue a negative injunction \nmaintaining the status. That will appear to be the intention of \nCongress. The absence of any limitations on the power of the judiciary \nto review and remedy violations supports the interpretation that Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 is intended to authorize the courts to engage in \njudicial review without the limitations those amendment included.\n  In the Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton described the judiciary \nas ``the least dangerous branch'' because it ``has no influence over \neither the sword or the purse, no direction either of the strength or \nthe wealth of the society.'' He then qualified his description, quoting \nMontesquieu as warning ``that `there is no liberty, if the power of \njudging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers. ''\n  Adopting this proposed constitutional amendment would create \nprecisely the peril warned against by Hamilton, because it would invite \nunelected judges to decide funding policy questions and exercise powers \nheretofore largely reserved to the legislative and executive branches. \nIt would be a mistake of historic proportions.\n  This is a constitutional amendment that is being proposed. In other \nsettings in which constitutional rights are being vindicated, when \nlegislation enacted by Congress did not provide an effective remedy, \nthe courts have created judicial ones. See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown \nNamed Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971); Davis \nv. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980). \nThus, if Congress were to adopt enforcement legislation that failed to \nprovide an effective remedy for violations, the courts might proceed on \ntheir own authority as required to fulfil their constitutional duties.\n  In addition, the underlying resolution would allow the President vast \nauthority to deal with implementation, and possibly even to impound, \nfunds obligated by Congress. The circumstances that would prevail after \nratification of the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting will \nnot have previously existed. The President will have a lot to do with \ndetermining how the President's constitutional duties under article II, \nsection 3, to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'' and \narticle II, section 7, to ``preserve, protect and defend the \nConstitution'' will be fulfilled.\n\n  Section 1 of the proposed constitutional amendment commands that \n``[t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts \nfor that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nwhole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a \nspecific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.'' In any \nfiscal year in which it becomes apparent that in the absence of \ncongressional action, ``total outlays'' will exceed ``total receipts,'' \nthe President would determine how best to proceed and might well \nproceed as if required by the Constitution and the oath of office it \nprescribes to act to prevent the unauthorized deficit.\n  This common sense reading of the proposed constitutional amendment is \nshared by a broad range of highly regarded legal scholars. Then \nAssistant Attorney General (now Solicitor General) Walter Dellinger \ntestified in 1995 before the Judiciary Committee that the proposed \nconstitutional amendment would authorize the President to impound funds \nto insure that outlays do not exceed receipts.\n  Similarly, Harvard University Law School Professor Charles Fried, who \nserved as Solicitor General during the Reagan administration, testified \nthat in a year when actual revenues fell below projections and a \nbigger-then-authorized deficit occurred, section 1 ``would offer a \nPresident ample warrant to impound appropriated funds.''\n  Others who share this view include former Attorney General Nicholas \ndeB. Katzenbach, Stanford University Law School Professor Kathleen \nSullivan, Yale University Law School Professor Burke Marshall, and \nHarvard University Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe.\n  This year the Secretary of the Treasury reinforced this prospect when \nhe noted in his testimony before the Committee:\n\n       Some proponents have suggested that under these \n     circumstances, the President would stop issuing checks, \n     including those for Social Security benefits. . . . The \n     President might also impound funds of his choosing. . . . All \n     of these potential outcomes are extremely undesirable.\n\n  The impoundment power that would be conferred on the President by the \nproposed constitutional amendment is far broader than any the \npresidential line-item veto authority temporarily granted the President \nlast year. As Assistant Attorney General Dellinger testified in 1995, \nthe impoundment authority implied within the proposed constitutional \namendment might allow a President to order across-the-board cuts in all \nFederal programs, target specific programs for abolition, or target \nexpenditures intended for particular States or regions for impoundment. \nHe testified that he would advise the President that he not only had \nthe right but the constitutional obligation to prevent the violation of \na constitutional mandate against budgetary imbalance.\n  The text of the proposed constitutional amendment does not address \nthese matters. The majority report says that is not the intent of the \nCommittee to grant the President any impoundment authority and suggests \nthat ``up to the end of the fiscal year, the President has nothing to \nimpound because Congress in the amendment has the power to ratify or to \nspecify the amount of deficit spending that may occur in that fiscal \nyear.'' The majority report, thus, assumes there can never be an \nunauthorized deficit, because Congress always has a theoretical \npossibility of stepping in before the last minute ending the fiscal \nyear and ratify whatever deficit has occurred. Under this construction, \nthe proposed constitutional amendment is a cruel joke.\n  Moreover nothing in the proposed constitutional amendment prevents \nthe Executive from acting to implement its terms. A President may not \nbe willing to withhold based on a theoretical possibility of what the \nPresident knows or has reason to believe will not occur. Moreover a \nPresident may choose not to risk having all of the expenditures \nundertaken by the Federal Government for a portion of a fiscal year \ndeclared to have been expended in violation of the Constitution. It is \nmore likely that a President, sworn to preserve, protect, and defend \nthe Constitution, would not view the Executive as powerless to prevent \nsuch a result.\n  Key House sponsors of the proposed constitutional amendment \ncirculated materials on the role of the Executive that add context to \nthe majority report's isolated declaration of intent and are consistent \nwith this view of continuing involvement by the Executive in the \nimplementation of the proscriptions contained within the proposed \nconstitutional amendment. Representatives Schaefer and Stenholm \nacknowledge that the proposed constitutional amendment is intended to \ncreate ``an ongoing obligation to monitor outlays and receipts'' and to \nrequire the President ``at the point at which the Government `runs out \nof money,' to stop issuing checks.''\n  We also have experience to instruct us. This Administration's senior \nadvisers have testified both in 1995 and in 1997 that their advice, \nagainst the backdrop of the proposed constitutional amendment on \nbudgeting having been ratified and an emerging deficit, would be to \nterminate or delay expenditures.\n  James C. Miller III, former OMB Director under President Reagan, \nechoed that advice. He revealed legal advice from the Office of Legal \nCounsel of the Department of Justice that without congressional \nmandated spending priorities, the President could apply across-the-\nboard reductions in outlays. Finally, he furnished a legal memorandum \non presidential authority to forestall default on the public debt that \nwas coauthored by a former Assistant Attorney General and head of the \nOffice of Legal Counsel during the Reagan administration that asserts \n``the President has inherent constitutional authority to choose which \nnondeferrable obligations to pay in the absence of a statute specifying \na priority.''\n  A memorandum to the Attorney General dated October 21, 1995, that is \nnow publicly available, reinforces these lines of reasoning:\n\n       Although this Office has consistently taken the position \n     that as a general matter the President does not possess \n     inherent authority to impound funds, we have carved out an \n     exception to the general rule for the situation in which the \n     President faces a debt ceiling and does not have any other \n     feasible method of raising funds. We have said that in such a \n     situation, because the President would be faced with \n     conflicting statutory demands, to comply with the direction \n     to spend yet not exceed the debt limit, he would be justified \n     in refusing to spend obligated funds. See Memorandum from \n     William H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, Re: \n     Presidential Authority to Impound Funds Appropriated for \n     Assistance to Federally Impacted Schools (December 1, 1969). \n     We believe that the President's power to reconcile \n     conflicting laws according to his best judgment could be \n     derived from his ultimate power as Chief Executive ``to take \n     care that the Laws be faithfully executed.''\n\n  The OLC Memorandum concludes:\n\n       Finally, at some point, after all other options have been \n     considered, consideration should be given to a program of \n     deferral of obligations and expenditures by the President. \n     Such a program would provoke considerable public controversy, \n     perhaps a constitutional confrontation with Congress, and \n     most certainly would be subjected to legal challenge. On the \n     last point, although we have not had an opportunity to arrive \n     at a definitive conclusion, we believe a strong argument can \n     be made both on statutory grounds and on the basis of his \n     inherent authority, that the President would have the power \n     to engage in such a program.\n\n  Similar analysis and reliance on inherent Executive authority could \nbe expected to arise should the proposed constitutional amendment be \nratified and the President faced with circumstances in which the \nlegislative and executive branches are in gridlock over budgetary or \nspending matters or it appears to the President that the prediction for \na balance between expenditures and revenues in any fiscal year is \ntilting toward deficit.\n  The proponents alternatively comment that Congress could specify in \nimplementing legislation how it wanted the President to proceed in a \nbudgetary or debt limit crisis. Reliance of subsequent implementing \nlegislation is risky, at best. Such legislation would be subject to \nPresidential veto and the need for a supermajority override in both \nHouses. Moreover, such legislation would have to be comprehensive \nenough to foresee and control all possible future contingencies to be \neffective.\n  Further, the President's obligation to faithfully execute the laws is \nindependent of Congress's. That duty is not ``limited to the \nenforcement of acts of Congress  * * * according to their express \nterms,  * * * it include[s] the rights, duties and obligations growing \nout of the Constitution itself,  * * * and all the protection implied \nby the nature of the government under the\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\nConstitution[.]'' In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 64 (1890). If an \nunconstitutional deficit were occurring, Congress could not \nconstitutionally stop the President from seeking to prevent it.\n  Finally, any reliance on the 159-year old case of Kendall v. United \nStates ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 542 (1838), would be \nmisplaced. That case can as easily be read to support presidential \nimpoundment authority under the proposed constitutional amendment on \nbudgeting. In that case, Congress had ordered the Postmaster General to \npay the claimant whatever sum an outside arbitrator determined was the \nappropriate settlement. When the Postmaster General paid a smaller \namount, the Supreme Court held that the Postmaster General could be \nordered to comply with the congressional directive. The Court ruled \nthat the President, and those under his supervision, did not possess \ninherent authority to impound funds that Congress had ordered to be \nspent: ``To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see \nthe laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their \nexecution, is a novel construction of the Constitution and entirely \ninadmissible.'' Id. at 611.\n  If the proposed constitutional amendment were ratified and became a \npart of the Constitution, the President's obligation to execute the \nlaws would arguably have a constitutional fulcrum from which to \nleverage. The President could argue that when the constitutional duty \nto ensure fiscal year balance came into conflict with a statutory \nobligation to expend authorized, appropriated, or obligated funds, the \nconstitutional responsibility had to be given priority as predicated on \nsuperior authority.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment's mandate to ensure budget \nbalance for each fiscal year specifies no role or limitation on the \npower of the President. The majority report concedes that \nimplementation and enforcement will necessarily involve the Executive \nBranch beyond the President's obligation pursuant to section 3 to have \ntransmitted to the Congress a proposed budget prior to each fiscal year \nin which total outlays do not exceed total revenues.\n  The majority report noted:\n\n       Both the President and Members of Congress swear an oath to \n     uphold the Constitution, including any amendments thereto. \n     Honoring this pledge requires respecting the provisions of \n     the proposed amendment. Flagrant disregard of the proposed \n     amendment's clear and simple provisions would constitute \n     nothing less than a betrayal of public trust. In their \n     campaigns for reelection, elected officials who flout their \n     responsibilities under this amendment will find that the \n     political process will provide the ultimate enforcement \n     mechanism.\n\n  If this proposed constitutional amendment were to become the supreme \nlaw of the land, some future President may well choose to enforce its \nterms, in the absence of binding limitations in implementing authority, \nto make greater use of Executive Branch discretion and authority than \nthis Congress has taken the time to consider.\n  This fundamental shift in the allocation of power and authority among \nthe Federal branches is neither wise nor necessary. It risks despotism \nat the very times when despots are most likely to arise and in which \nour fundamental guarantees of liberty and individual freedoms has been \nthe checks and balances that the branches of our Federal Government \nexert over each other.\n  In spite of these acknowledged problems with the underlying \nresolution, the sponsors and proponents voted lock-step to table the \nKennedy amendment without any effort to cure any of the serious \nconstitutional flaws that it highlighted.\n  We cannot legislate political courage and responsibility. No \namendment to the Constitution can supply the people's representatives \nwith these essential attributes. Indeed, the majority report concludes \nthat the ultimate enforcement mechanism that can lead to balancing the \nbudget is the electorate's power to vote. That power already exists. \nMoreover, the underlying resolution would undercut rather than enhance \nour democratic principles of majority rule and separation of powers and \nwould ultimately lead to a loss of political accountability to the \nelectorate.\n  Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us \nachieve remarkable deficit reduction over the past 4 years--recent \nhistory that the majority report seeks to ignore. We have succeeded in \nreducing the deficit every year of the past four. We have cut the \ndeficit by more than 60 percent in that time while pursuing sound \neconomic and strong fiscal policies.\n  Now we need to stay the course and work in a bipartisan way to make \nfurther progress. We should now be focusing our attention and energies \non the strenuous tasks of building a working consensus on budget \npriorities and achieving agreement on how to balance the budget.\n  This crusade for an illusionary quick-fix by constitutional amendment \nonly makes that job more difficult. The time and resources devoted to \nreconsidering a constitutional amendment on the budget merely serve as \na distraction from the real task at hand.\n  Let us not be distracted from the true means to deficit reduction: \nLet us proceed to consider and adopt a budget and deficit reduction \npackage consistent with the progress made since 1993. As Treasury \nSecretary Robert Rubin testified before the Committee on January 17, \n``politically, historically, and economically, the forces are in place \nto balance the budget. We are not far apart. Now we need to get the job \ndone.''\n  Let us not sacrifice the Constitution or our Nation's fiscal policies \nto a siren song but turn to the work needed to continue reducing the \ndeficit without sacrificing our Nation's commitments to seniors, \nveterans, education, the environment, public infrastructure and our \nfundamental constitutional principles. There is no need for a \nconstitutional amendment to achieve our goals.\n  The questions raised during the debate on Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nwill not go away and cannot be ignored. They point to a series of fatal \nflaws in proposing to conduct our Nation's economic and budgetary \nfunctions by means of a simply-sounding constitutional declaration. A \nrecent editorial in the Burlington Free Press said it more succinctly: \n``amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget would be like \nusing a sledgehammer to nail a picket in a fence.''\n  Two years ago Senator Mark Hatfield's decisive vote against a \nconstitutional amendment on budgeting was a contemporary profile in \ncourage. Senator Hatfield had wisdom gained from his years as a public \nservant and personal fortitude and integrity that sustained him through \nvery difficult times before and after that vote. Here was a man and a \nrepresentative who was put to the test and not only survived but \nemerged as a powerful example for us all.\n  On February 8, 1995, Senator Hatfield came to this Senate floor to \nexplain how he would vote. He said:\n\n       As I explain my thoughts on the balanced budget amendment, \n     I want to make it very clear that I believe the deficit must \n     be reduced and that a balanced budget is worth achieving. It \n     is possible that I will be the lone Republican to vote \n     against the balanced budget amendment, but I say now to my \n     colleagues that I share my party's goals, but happen to \n     disagree on the means.\n       The debate on the balanced budget amendment is not about \n     reducing the budget deficit, it is about amending the \n     Constitution of the United States with a procedural gimmick. \n     This amendment that is before Members now puts new Senate and \n     House rules regarding voting procedures into the \n     Constitution. It does not balance the budget and gives no \n     indication of how this might be done. Furthermore, it will \n     not force Congress to budget responsibility. If indeed this \n     is an amendment requiring a balanced budget, then how can we \n     allow Congress to essentially suspend the Constitution with a \n     three-fifths vote? This was a dangerous idea last year, and \n     it is a dangerous idea this year as well. What other \n     constitutional requirements would we like to waive with a \n     three-fifths vote? Freedom of religion? Free speech? What \n     other civil liberties shall we waive? A balanced budget \n     amendment would allow the Congress to ignore the requirement \n     for a balanced budget and to ignore the Constitution. This \n     idea of Congress suspending a constitutional requirement cuts \n     against the separation of powers principle so crucial to the \n     foundation of the Constitution.\n       A balanced budget can come only through leadership and \n     compromise. This compromise must come from each one of us. \n     But, most importantly, it must come from those we represent--\n     those who do not want their taxes raised any more than we \n     want to raise them--those who do not want their benefits cut \n     any more than we want to cut them. In the end there is no \n     easy answer, and there never will be. Regardless of the \n     procedural restraint in place, where there is political\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\n     will to create a balanced budget we will create one, where \n     there is will to avoid one, we will avoid it* * * .\n\n  As I stated during the debate on a balanced budget amendment last \nyear, a vote for this balanced budget amendment is not a vote for a \nbalanced budget, it is a vote for a fig leaf.\n\n       If I am skeptical about the ability of a gimmick to fix our \n     budget, I am not skeptical about the ability of the people to \n     demand and keep demanding that we respond to the budget \n     challenge with real action. Real action is not a vote for an \n     amendment to the Constitution which calls for a balanced \n     budget by the year 2002. Real action is rolling up our \n     sleeves and getting our fiscal house in order. Real action is \n     working together, in a bipartisan fashion, to create a \n     balanced budget, not to simply promise one. Real action means \n     ending some programs--programs with popular appeal and vocal \n     constituencies. Balancing the budget will result in an impact \n     on each and every one of us--do we have the will to do that?\n       Bipartisan negotiation, leadership, and compromise have \n     been the cornerstones upon which we have built all effective \n     decisions on tough issues since the formation of our \n     Government. Compromises are difficult to reach, but they are \n     not impossible to reach. We have just received the \n     President's budget. The ensuing debate on the budget will \n     provide the chance for the Congress to work together to \n     balance the Federal programs of this budget. I hope the \n     Congress does not miss this opportunity to debate the real \n     issue of balancing the budget. Voting for a balanced budget \n     amendment is easy, working to balance the budget will not be.\n       The Congress should not promise to the people that it will \n     balance the Federal budget through a procedural gimmick. If \n     the Congress has the political will to balance the budget, it \n     should simply use the power that it already has to do so. \n     There is no substitute for political will and there never \n     will be.\n\n  In May 1995, not long after his historic vote and after he had \nretained his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee after being \nattacked by fellow Republicans for his vote of conscience and in \ndefense of the Constitution, Senator Hatfield had occasion to repeat \nthe following observations about balancing the Federal budget:\n\n       I believe that a balanced budget can come only through \n     leadership and compromise. This compromise must come from \n     each one of us. More importantly, it must come from those we \n     represent. In the end, there is no easy answer. If there is a \n     political will to create a balanced budget, we will create \n     one, and if there is will to avoid one, we will avoid it.\n\n  I am deeply disappointed to learn that the Republican National \nCommittee has been running attack advertisements in newspapers and on \nthe radio over the past few days regarding the final vote on this \nproposed constitutional amendment. These attack ads are aimed at \nblackmailing specific Members of Congress to ignore their consciences \nand vote for this flawed constitutional amendment. It is wrong to play \npolitics with the Constitution of the United States. It is wrong to try \nto punish any Member in this body who may choose to vote his or her \nconscience on this matter of constitutional proportion with its serious \nconsequences to our system of checks and balances. I am disgusted by \nit.\n  We should all remember the courageous example of Senator Mark \nHatfield, and vote our own conscience and use our own best judgment on \nthis matter of constitutional amendment. I commend the Senators who are \nnot blindly voting for a poll-tested bumper sticker, but who instead \nare exercising their best judgment and voting to defeat a seriously \nflawed proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \nThese Senators are those acting with courage.\n  By our Senate oath of office we each commit to ``support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States.'' We owe to our constituents our \nbest judgment on matters of this importance. We owe to our children and \nfuture generations the protections of separation of powers and checks \nand balances from our Constitution that have served us so well without \ndiminution for political expediency.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has approximately 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then what is the situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah will control 1 hour of debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have stated my disagreement with those \nwho will vote for this. But I also know that many on both sides of the \naisle are moved by their conscience in the way they will vote. I hope \nno one will seek to punish them. I hope they do not seek to punish \nMembers of this body who vote his or her conscience on this matter--I \nwas concerned to see some of the so-called independent expenditure ads \nover the weekend that seek to do just that--whether they have been \nSenators on either side of the aisle who express different views today \nthan they might have expressed another time. I assume they have reasons \nfor doing it.\n  I have tried throughout this debate for several weeks now to state my \nreasons. My reasons are based, as my reasons are for all votes, on what \nis best for the country, what is best for Vermont, what is best for the \nConstitution.\n  None of us owns a seat in this body. Each of us just passes through. \nSomeday I will be gone, just as every other Member now serving in the \nU.S. Senate will be gone. But when I leave I want to be able to say to \nmy children and my children's children, I did the best I could, and I \ndid those things that prepared you for the future. My children will \nlive most of their lives in the next century.\n  As I have said many, many times on this floor, I worry just not for \nthose of us who are here at the twilight of this century, but those who \nlive in the next century and the centuries after, because I expect that \nthis Nation, having gone through all the terrible things that it has in \nits 200 years, and coming back stronger every single time, will be here \nlong after each of us is a dusty memory. I yield the floor and turn \nback to my good friend from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate under the control of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, contrary to Senators Reid, Dorgan and \nConrad's contention, exempting Social Security would severely impair \nthe program. Let me say once again, an exemption would open up a \nloophole in the amendment and siphon-off revenues from the trust funds. \nPlacing the trust funds off-budget will harm the Social Security \nProgram.\n  In essence, we would have two budgets, one based on sound principles \nof solvency, and the other, the Social Security budget, which is not. \nOne budget will be required to be in balance unless a supermajority \nvotes to allow a deficit, the other--the Social Security budget--would \nbe raided and bloated with unrelated pork projects. This will mean the \nend of Social Security as we know it, turning it into the least secure \nof all Government accounts.\n  Congress could pass legislation to fund any number of programs off-\nbudget, through the Social Security trust funds. The budget could be \nbalanced simply by shifting programs into the Social Security trust \nfunds.\n  The immediate effect of the loophole is that the trust funds would \ngrow--as projected--but only until 2002, the date the BBA requires that \nthe budget be balanced. Thereafter, however, the trust funds would stop \ngrowing as all annual surplus funds would be reallocated to pay for \nprograms that have been redesignated as Social Security. So instead of \ngrowing, from 2002 to 2019, the year the trust funds are estimated to \nstop growing, the system will become stagnant in 2002. The result of \nthe loophole will be the depletion of the trust fund years early. \nExemption of the trust funds from the BBA, ironically, will hasten the \nsystem's difficulties.\n  Congress has generally been increasing the web of services provided \nby Social Security. Consider what will happen when politicians are \nfaced with the choice between the pressures of budget integrity and the \nprocrastinating appeal of a Social Security loophole.\n  The only other possible use for Social Security surpluses would be \nfor the Government to pay down our staggering national debt. If \nprojects aren't redesignated, Social Security as discussed earlier, \nthereby consuming accumulated Social Security surpluses, surplus \nproceeds would be used in the only possible manner that would avoid \nsection 1's prohibition on outlays exceeding receipts: to make debt \nrepayments. This sounds wonderful, but in fact creates a dangerous \nmechanism for\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nthe Congress to continue deficit spending. By paying down the debt, the \nCongress would provide itself a debt cushion--that is, a gap between \nthe statutorily limited debt ceiling and the actual paid down debt. \nCongress could therefore use this gap to deficit spend, from Social \nSecurity, while avoiding the three-fifths vote required in section 2 of \nthe BBA to raise the debt ceiling. This is because the accumulated \nSocial Security surpluses would maintain the gap between the actual \ndebt and the debt ceiling. Such a spending device completely frustrates \nthe purposes for which I have introduced the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  Also, let us not forget about the troubling future for Social \nSecurity. The Social Security Board of Trustees estimates that by the \nyear 2070, Social Security is expected to run an annual $7 trillion \ndeficit. If we include Social Security in our balanced budget \ncalculations, we will be able to prepare for and budget these massive \nshortfalls. Under the Feinstein proposal, we will not be including this \ndeficit in our budgetary planning. As a result, under any proposal to \nexempt Social Security from Senate Joint Resolution 1, in order to \nraise revenue and increase the debt ceiling sufficient to cover the \nexpected Social Security shortfalls in the next century, we will have \nto dramatically increase taxes or cut spending in other important \nprograms, or face an annual three-fifths vote fiscal crisis to avoid \nfinancial default by raising the already staggering $5.5 trillion debt \nceiling.\n  FICA taxes have grown significantly over time. There is no reason why \nthis increase would not be accelerated under this loophole. Nor is \nthere any reason why new Social Security taxes could not be added, such \nas a Social Security income tax or a Social Security value added tax. \nAs this process continues, the loophole created by this exemption could \neasily swallow both the spending and the taxing protections of the BBA.\n  By allowing Congress to redesignate other spending as Social \nSecurity, this loophole would make it easy to balance the budget on \npaper without changing anything except accounting methods.\n  According to Wall Street analyst David Malpass, who recently \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee,\n\n       Financial markets would react negatively to a budget \n     concept that ignores Social Security.\n\n  By passing a balanced budget amendment that excludes Social Security, \nCongress would game the system, saying, in effect, that it does not \nintend to balance the consolidated unitary Federal budget. For Malpass \nand other market analysts, this would be a decidedly negative signal \nfor financial markets, leading to higher interest rates.\n  This probable gamesmanship is exactly what must be avoided. The way \nto avoid it is to reject this risky exemption gimmick. The best way to \nprotect retirees and future generations is to adopt a clean strong \nbalanced budget amendment, free of loopholes. It is the best way to \nsave our financial situation and protect Social Security.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I want to congratulate my colleague from Utah on all the great work \nhe has done during this very, very important debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Mr. President, if recent history is any indication, we know that \npromises are never going to balance the budget, good intentions are \nnever going to balance the budget, renewed commitments are never going \nto balance the budget, and pledges of cooperation are never going to \nbalance the budget. Left on its own, we know that Congress itself will \nnever balance the Federal budget.\n  In the 1 minute that I spend delivering this statement, the national \ndebt will increase by more than $500,000. In the past 24 hours, it has \ngrown by over $721 million. Over the last three decades, the national \ndebt has mushroomed to more than $5.3 trillion. The question you have \nto ask is, where will it stop? At what point do we say enough?\n  What will it take to convince Washington that we are strangling the \nfinancial future of our children and our grandchildren with the noose \nthat is being knotted by our very own hands? Mr. President, after all \nthe promises, intentions, commitments, and pledges have failed, our \nlast best hope rests with passage of the balanced budget amendment. In \nthe name of America's children, I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague and yield 1 minute to the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his fine \nwork and debate here on the floor on the balanced budget amendment. I \nam going to vote for the balanced budget amendment because I am going \nto keep my campaign promise that I made during the election. It is not \na campaign promise that I made lightly.\n  I have voted for this very same proposal as a Member of the 105th \nCongress as a Member of the House of Representatives. I have served in \na State that has a balanced budget requirement. I have been the owner \nof a business that has had to balance its budget. I have been a part of \na family that has had to balance its budget.\n  I think it is important for the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren that we balance the budget. The only way I see us ever \neliminating deficit spending is to pass a requirement in the \nConstitution that says that we have to balance the budget. For 28 \nyears, we have heard from both Republicans and Democrats on the \nimportance of balancing the budget. That is why I am casting my vote \nfor a balanced budget amendment today.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague and yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, want to urge all my colleagues to \nvote for the balanced budget constitutional amendment. As the only \naccountant in the U.S. Senate, I have been interested in the various \naccounting issues that have been brought up as part of this discussion. \nI am very disappointed that while accounting techniques are needed to \nknow exactly where we stand and what to do, there have been a lot of \nsham techniques that have been brought up so that some of the people \nwould have a hook on which to add a no vote--and that is all that they \nare.\n  We need to have good accounting. We need to protect Social Security. \nThere is no one in this body who does not want us to take care of \nSocial Security. The way to do that is through a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. We owe it to our kids and to our grandkids. \nWe owe it to our parents and our grandparents. We have to make sure \nthat we have a balanced budget to keep this country going forward, with \nor without that amendment. I have heard promises here, but I am not so \nsure about promises anymore that we would balance the budget, and it is \ncritical that we balance the budget. I will be counting on everyone to \nhelp on that. I ask for support of the balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is necessary \nto limit the Federal Government's power to mortgage America's future. \nIt can protect the liberties of the American people for six primary \nreasons:\n  No. 1, our families: Passing the balanced budget amendment will \nimprove the economic health and stability of all American families.\n  No. 2, our children's future: Passing the balanced budget amendment \nis a very clear-cut vote for our children's economic freedom, instead \nof their enslavement, which is what we have been doing to them.\n  No. 3, retirement security: It will protect Social Security, and it \nwill stabilize the economy, which will benefit both current and future \nretirees.\n  No. 4, economic strength: The stabilizing effect the balanced budget \namendment will have on the economy is clear.\n  No. 5, integrity: It will bring immediate credibility to our current \nbudget negotiations, and it will restore a measure of integrity to our \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\n  No. 6, the last reason is this stack of 28 unbalanced budgets. The \nlast 28 years of our country's life have had unbalanced budgets. We \nneed a constitutional amendment to stop this pile from growing.\n  Some have stated that all we need is the will to balance the budget. \nWell, these 28 budgets are a testament to the fact that our will just \nwon't do it. It is that simple and that clear.\n  I have to tell you, one of my favorite quotes is this: ``A democracy \ncannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until \nthe voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the \nPublic Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the \ncandidates promising the most benefits to the Public Treasury, with the \nresult that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, \nalways followed by a dictatorship.''\n  The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 \nyears. Ours is just a little bit over 200 years, and we are following \nthat pattern of mortgaging our future, of voting largess for ourselves \nand the Public Treasury, and of not being able to put fiscal sanity \ninto our house to make it a house of order. All we have is, it seems to \nme, the same old timeworn, wornout approaches toward the budget that we \nhave heard for all of these 28 years. It is time to do something about \nit.\n  I yield a minute to the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my complete and unreserved \nsupport for Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I think it is notable that the balanced budget constitutional \namendment has been designated Senate Joint Resolution 1 for the second \nconsecutive Congress. Bringing the budget into balance should be one of \nthe Nation's highest priorities, and this designation demonstrates the \nSenate leadership's recognition of that fact. It also demonstrates the \nknowledge that, no matter what we do to balance the budget now, we \nsimply cannot guarantee a balanced budget to future generations unless \nthe Constitution requires one. A requirement to balance the budget, not \njust in statute but in the very document which defines our Nation, will \ntruly make the Federal Government accountable--accountable to the \nAmerican taxpayer of today and to the generations who will inherit this \nNation tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, future generations are what this debate is all about. \nAn entire generation of Americans has grown up without ever having seen \na balanced budget. My children are nearly the age I was the last time \nthe U.S. budget did not run a deficit. In the interim, we have seen \ndeficit spending become the norm, and, as a result, the debt has \nballooned to $5.3 trillion or roughly $20,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in this Nation. If we take the time to look beyond the immediate \nfuture, to a time when our children--and for some of my colleagues, \ntheir grandchildren--stand where we stand today, as parents and \ntaxpayers, we will see a vision which should frighten us. Unless \nsomething is done, and done soon, interest on the debt will consume a \nlarger portion of the budget than all the domestic discretionary \nprograms combined.\n  Some opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment have \nsaid all we need to do is stop deficit spending. This is true, and in a \nperfect world it would also be an easy goal to achieve. But we all \nrealize we do not live in a perfect world. We live in a nation \npopulated by more than 260 million people, many with dramatically \ndifferent expectations of what, if anything, their Federal Government \nshould do for them. And they elect us to represent those interests. \nUnfortunately, for the last 28 fiscal years too many have tried to \nplease all of those interests at the same time, all too rarely asking, \n``What will be the result down the road?''\n  Mr. President, as I have mentioned, we are now living that result. \nThe debt has spiraled out of control and a balanced budget has become a \nhighly desired goal rather than a regular, expected occurrence. While \nwe are slowly getting closer to achieving that goal, we must not stop \nthere. Even if we balance the budget by 2002, a timeframe to which even \nPresident Clinton has now agreed, what happens next? What happens when \nthe names of the 105th Congress become mere memories in our \nNation's history? Who will ensure that balanced budgets will continue \n5, 10, 20, even 50 years down the road?\n\n  While I would like to believe that balancing the budget in 2002 will \nresult in all future budgets being balanced, I simply cannot. Balancing \na budget is hard, as many of us who must balance our own personal \nbudgets well know. Future leaders will be sorely tempted to deficit \nspend in order to meet the desires of the people. And much like a \ngeneration ago, they will find it easy to appease everyone. They will \nfind it easy to say, ``We'll balance it next year.'' The result may \nwell be another 28 years of unbalanced budgets and increasing debt. To \nquote the Spanish philosopher George Santayana, ``Those who cannot \nremember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Without a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment, we leave future generations to the \nmercy of whether or not their leaders will remember the past.\n  Mr. President, over the Presidents' Day work period, I had the \nopportunity to speak with numerous Idahoans. They are good people who \nare very concerned about the future of the United States. During my \nweek in the State, they overwhelmingly expressed to me that passage of \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment was one of their biggest \nconcerns.\n  The people of Idaho know how serious the issue of balancing the \nbudget is, because, like most Americans, they have lived under a State \nbalanced budget requirement for years. It has forced tough decisions \nand, in some cases, prevented Idaho from doing some things the people \nwanted to do. But, it has worked. More importantly, for all the \ndifficult decisions it has required, Idaho has kept it. They have shown \nthey are willing to make tough decisions in order to keep the budget \nbalanced. In the process, Idaho has also made sure that its more \nimportant resource, its children, are protected. A recent report \nreleased by the Children's Defense Fund notes that Idaho is below the \nnational average for the percentage of children living in poverty, \nbelow the national average for the number of uninsured children, and \nabove the national average in child support enforcement. You see it is \npossible to balance the budget and have the government do those things \nwhich the people expect it to do. As a nation, we would be wise to heed \nIdaho's example.\n  As I mentioned before, the people of my home State have shown they \ncan and will live within a limited budget--on both a personal and \ngovernmental level. The members of the Idaho State Legislature stand \nfor election every 2 years and must reflect the attitudes of the \ncitizens of their communities. As in the past, they have passed a \nmemorial asking Congress to approve the balanced budget constitutional \namendment and send it to them for ratification. Their words bear \nrepeating as we consider action on this significant step to restore the \nconfidence of our people:\n\n       Whereas, the annual federal budget has not been balanced \n     since 1969, and the federal public debt is now more than five \n     trillion dollars, or twenty thousand dollars for every man, \n     woman, and child in America; and\n       Whereas, continued deficit spending demonstrates an \n     unwillingness or inability of both the federal executive and \n     legislative branches to spend no more than available \n     revenues; and\n       Whereas, fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level is \n     lowering our standard of living, destroying jobs, and \n     endangering economic opportunity now and for the next \n     generation; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's unlimited ability to \n     borrow raises questions about the fundamental principles and \n     responsibilities of government, with potentially profound \n     consequences for the nation and its people, making it an \n     appropriate subject for limitation by the Constitution of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States vests the \n     ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove \n     constitutional amendments with the people, as represented by \n     their elected state legislatures; and the opposition by a \n     small minority repeatedly has thwarted the will of the people \n     that a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution should \n     be submitted to the states for ratification.\n       Now, therefore be it resolved, by the members of the First \n     Regular Session of the Fifty-fourth Idaho Legislature, the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, \n     that the Congress of the United States expeditiously pass, \n     and propose to the\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\n     legislatures of the several states for ratification, an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States requiring, \n     in the absence of a national emergency, that the total of all \n     federal appropriations made by the Congress for any fiscal \n     year may not exceed the total of all estimated federal \n     revenues for that fiscal year.\n\n  The call for fiscal responsibility is nothing new, it has been \nsounded for years. President Andrew Jackson said, ``Once the budget is \nbalanced and the debts paid off, our population will be relieved from a \nconsiderable portion of its present burdens and will find not only new \nmotives to patriotic affection, but additional means for the display of \nindividual enterprise.''\n  More recently, the American people heard the following words: ``We \nmust act now to protect future generations from government's desire to \nspend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills \ncome due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to \nspend more money than the Federal Government takes in.''\n  This sound advice came from President Reagan on the event of his \nsecond inauguration. His words were true then, and they are even more \nso now. For since he made that call for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution, we have had a dozen more years of unbalanced budgets, \na dozen more years of deficits, a dozen more years of telling our \nchildren and grandchildren that they will have to discover a way to do \nwhat we did not have the courage to do.\n\n  Mr. President, when I was mayor of Boise, I not only had to balance \nmy own personal budget, but I also had to ensure that the city's budget \nremained balanced as well. It was a responsibility that required tough \ndecisions, both on my part and on the part of the good people of Boise. \nTogether, we had great expectations for our city. We wanted to build \nnew parks, hire more police officers, build a new fire station, and do \nnumerous other things to make the city an even better place to live. At \nthe same time, however, we had to face the fact that we could not have \nall our wants, we would have to focus on our needs.\n  So what did we do? We prioritized and lived within our means. And in \nthe process we built some wonderful parks, we modernized our \nfirefighting equipment, and we lowered the crime rate. I would add, Mr. \nPresident, that we did all this and either held the line or decreased \nthe property tax levy the final 2 years I was in office. As a result of \nour efforts, we were voted one of the most livable cities in the Nation \nby a national magazine, which called Boise, ``A great place to raise a \nfamily.''\n  Mr. President, we did all this, and balanced our budget, because we \nhad to do so. It forced us to be frugal, but more importantly, it \nrequired us to find better and more efficient ways to meet our goals. \nAnd we still met our goals. We managed to do more with less. You see, a \nbalanced budget does not mean we deny ourselves the ability to do those \nthings which need to be done. It simply means we must do those things \nas efficiently as possible, and not waste time and resources trying to \ndo things which are not truly important.\n  Mr. President, before concluding my remarks today, I would like to \naddress the concerns which have been raised about Social Security. \nDuring my tenure in the Senate, I have supported several efforts to \nassist Social Security recipients. It is based on my support for the \nSocial Security system, and those who depend on the system now and in \nthe future, that I opposed the maneuvers to add ``specific exemption'' \nlanguage to the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Doing so, I \nbelieve would have proven to be detrimental to the long-term security \nof the Social Security Program.\n  First, because Social Security is defined in statute, its definition \nmay be changed by statute. A Social Security exemption to the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment would then create an inviting target, \nfar too inviting in my view, to those who do not want to truly balance \nthe budget. The Congress, potentially, would be able to change the \ndefinition of Social Security so as to include economic stimulus \nprograms, health care programs, or any other program which caught the \nfancy of the majority of the Congress. These areas could then be funded \nby draining the Social Security trust fund while the budget, \ntechnically, remained balanced. The net result would be a rapid \ndepletion of the trust fund which would endanger benefits for future \nretirees.\n\n  Second, I think we must look at what a Social Security exemption \nwould not do. Contrary to what some have claimed, it would not provide \nany more protection for the trust fund than now exists. It would not \nprevent the trust fund from running a deficit beginning in 2019, just \nas it is currently on pace to do. In fact, it would not extend the \nsolvency of the trust fund by a single day--Social Security would still \nbe bankrupt by 2029. The Social Security exemption would not do one \nthing to save the Social Security trust fund. Only balancing the \nbudget--and I believe only a constitutional amendment will guarantee a \nbalanced budget--and reducing the debt, will ensure that we are able to \npay off the Government securities in which the law requires the Social \nSecurity surplus to be placed.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget constitutional amendment is \ndesigned to make the Federal Government do something it has not done in \nnearly 30 years--take responsibility for its actions now, rather than \npassing the buck to our children and grandchildren. In the end, it is \nthat simple. Are we going to continue to mortgage our children's and \ngrandchildren's future for the sake of political expediency, or are we \ngoing to accept our responsibility to make the difficult decisions \nwhich come with balancing the budget?\n  I believe there is only one way to answer that question. We must act \nnow. It is time for the Federal Government to cut up its credit cards, \nprioritize the real needs, ignore the ``wants'' list, learn to do more \nwith less, and balance its budget. It will not be easy and it will not \nbe pretty, but it must happen--and we cannot guarantee it will happen \nwithout a constitutional amendment. After 28 years of unbalanced \nbudgets, we owe future generations the promise that they will not be \nforced to live with the results of our mistakes. Passing the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment is our downpayment on that promise.\n  Mr. President, in the 1,697 votes I have cast as a U.S. Senator, the \nvote today at 5:15 is the most critical. How critical? The last time \nthis Nation had a balanced budget, I was 17 years old. Today, I have a \nson who is 16. He will be 17 this year. It has been a generation since \nwe have had a balanced budget. I wish that when I was a 17-year-old, \nthere had been a law that said you are going to have a balanced budget.\n  In the State of Idaho, we have a balanced budget requirement in the \nConstitution, and what's the upshot of that? After a century, our books \nare balanced in Idaho. We have 28 years of unbalanced books here in the \nUnited States. It is time for a balanced budget amendment. I cast my \nvote today not only as a Senator, but as a father trying to do the \nright thing for my kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  (Mr. KEMPTHORNE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, our generation inherited the freest, \nstrongest, most prosperous country in the history of civilization. \nWithin one generation, we are changing that. When historians look back \nand ask the question, ``When did the decline of the United States \nbegin,'' they will point to our generation, because we are the first \ngeneration to spend the fortune of our grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren.\n  But we are told that we don't need to worry about it because we are \nin the process of balancing the budget, as evidenced by the President's \nlatest so-called ``balanced budget.'' But when the analysis comes out, \nwe see that we are looking at another $69 billion in deficit, and this \nso-called ``balanced budget'' is supposed to make all the cuts. But 98 \npercent of the cuts are in the last 2 years--after the President leaves \noffice. We know that this is a sham. We know that even if, for a \nnanosecond, we did balance the budget in the year 2002, it would not \naccount for the baby boomers who are going to be retiring in 2010. \nCan't we look forward for our Nation's future?\n  I support the balanced budget amendment and urge immediate passage.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nUtah. I rise in strong support today of the balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution. I have three sons. My twin boys, today, are \ncelebrating a birthday. They are 23 years old. I have an 18-year-old.\n  In 1984, when I first ran for political office--the Arkansas State \nLegislature--I was asked, ``Why would you get into politics?'' I had \nthree reasons: Jeremy, Tim, and Josh. I didn't know whether I could \nmake a difference, but I was gravely concerned about the direction our \nNation was going in and, particularly, the way our Nation was growing \nin deficits, chronic deficits, and a massive national debt. I wanted to \nbe able to look them in the eyes and say, ``I did what I could to give \nyou a nation as good and as prosperous and with as much opportunity as \nI have had.''\n  Well, in less than 2 hours from this moment, I will have an \nopportunity to cast a vote. We may not succeed in this balanced budget \namendment, but I will have a clear conscience, and I will be able to \nlook my sons in the eyes and say that I did what I could to bring a \nfiscal sanity to our Nation again.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their words here \ntoday. We are talking about trying to save our country. Frankly, after \n58 of the last 66 years of unbalanced budgets, I think it is time we do \nsomething about it.\n  I yield 1 minute to our distinguished friend, the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise in support of \nthe amendment. As I have said on the floor numerous times during the \ndebate, families of this country are hurt to the extent that we don't \nbalance the budget. Interest rates are higher. That means that loans, \nwhether it is for a new car or house, a student, or anyone else, are \naffected directly by this failure in Washington to balance the budget.\n\n  Most importantly, children are hurt. We have a newborn baby in our \nfamily. He was born 5 months ago. The day he was born, he inherited a \nresponsibility to pay $187,000 in Federal taxes just to pay his share \nof the interest on this national debt. That isn't just unfair for my \nson, it is unfair for all the children in this country.\n  Passage of this amendment has to happen. It has to happen now in \norder to end the red ink and set us on the right course for fiscal \nintegrity in the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Utah. I appreciate the \nleadership he has given to this effort. I think that this issue is \nvery, very important to our Nation. I think, fundamentally, it is one \nof integrity. It is integrity in spending. We have to deal with those \nissues day after day. How do we get an unbalanced budget? What happens? \nSenators and Congressmen get together and each have their own \npriorities. Each believes deeply that some project ought to be funded, \nand they cannot agree on which ones should be funded and which ones \nshould not. So, they get together, they fund them all, and they pass on \nthe debt to our children.\n  Some say we don't need a balanced budget--that we should not amend \nthe Constitution. We have a series of 33 out of 34 years where we have \nfailed to balance the budget. We have a systemic problem, and we need a \nsystemic solution. This amendment will bring integrity to the finances \nof the United States. I think it is absolutely crucial that we pass it. \nI can't believe anything more important will come before this body than \nthis amendment, and I am in support of it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I will vote to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment. This is a vote for a stronger America, for \nresponsible Government, and for our children.\n  In 1982, I approached the constitutional amendment with a certain \ndegree of skepticism. My vote against the amendment at that time \nreflected my belief that Congress could and would correctly eliminate \nour budget shortfall. Since that time, however, we have come to a point \nof national financial crisis. In 1982, we had a Federal debt of less \nthan $1 trillion. This year, we have more than $5 trillion in Federal \ndebt. This debt is crippling our Government's ability to solve our \ndifficult problems.\n  Like many, I wish there was a way to make Congress and the \nadministration balance the budget without amending the Constitution. \nBut we have tried, over and over and over, and we have failed. These \nmeasures have always fallen short.\n  We must have in Washington what we take for granted in Montpelier, \nVT, and State capitals across the country--a balanced budget.\n  This Congress must be remembered as the one that made life better in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding to me.\n  The question has been asked many times during the day: Do you have \nthe votes? There are 55 Republican Senators who have given their word \nthat they would vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment. \nThere are a number of Democrats who have campaigned for this balanced \nbudget amendment. If they keep their word, we will pass this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  What is to be gained as a result of doing this? The benefits are to \nour constituents. We believe that $125 a month could be the benefit \nderived from a constitutional amendment through lower interest rates, \nmore affordable mortgage loans, more affordable student loans, cheaper \nautomobile loans, and so forth.\n  Mr. President, if we were to pass this constitutional amendment, we \nwould finally put some kind of outside restraint on the ability of \nCongress to spend the taxpayers' dollars. We need to do that. We have \nfailed 28 years in a row. It is time to get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, this is about leadership. The balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution is about the future of this \ncountry. It is about bold leadership. It is about stepping up to the \nchallenges that face our Nation and what kind of country we are going \nto leave to our children and to our grandchildren.\n  This is about doing the right thing. This is not about esoteric, \ntheoretical, and academic issues. This is not about deferring more of \nthe same that we have deferred for almost 50 years in this country. \nThis is about stepping up to the real challenges that affect real \npeople that will have a lasting impact on this country. If we do not \nprovide the bold, dynamic leadership that this country requires, then \nwe will pay a heavy price in the future for our inaction. Our children \nand our grandchildren will pay a very high price. They will pay a price \nthat will restrict their opportunities, restrict their future, and \nrestrict the future of our Nation and the good this country can do for \nthe rest of the world and for our people over the next 25 to 50 years.\n  For those reasons, I strongly support this constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, as we debate the balanced budget amendment, we would \nbe wise to listen to the words of one of our Founding Fathers, Thomas \nJefferson. Mr. Jefferson once wrote that ``the question whether one \ngeneration has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a \nquestion of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental \nprinciples of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \nsaddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them \nourselves.''\n  Mr. President, I agree with Thomas Jefferson: It is morally wrong for \none\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\ngeneration to burden a future generation with its debts. Yet, that is \nexactly what has happened during the past 27 years in America. The \nFederal budget has not been balanced since 1969, and as a result, our \nnational debt has grown to more than $5 trillion. In fact, a child born \nin America today begins life with a $20 thousand share of the national \ndebt. During his or her lifetime, that child can expect to pay $187 \nthousand in taxes just to cover the interest payments on this debt--\ndebt he had nothing to do with creating, but debt which will \nsubstantially limit his opportunities in life.\n  Mr. President, just look at the strain current interest payments are \nputting on our national resources. Interest payments consume about 15 \npercent of the Federal budget, and they are now the third largest item \nin the budget--only Social Security and defense are larger. Last year, \nwe spent a record $241 billion on interest payments to service the \nnational debt. That is more than double the amount of money the \nGovernment spent on education, training, crime, and transportation \ncombined.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to continue wasting the taxpayers \nmoney in this fashion. This must stop, and the balanced budget \namendment will help stop it by ending deficit spending and the growing \ninterest payments on the national debt.\n  However, the opponents of a balanced budget amendment have put forth \nmany false arguments to try to confuse the issue. I want to address \nseveral of these arguments one by one.\n  The most deceptive argument opponents of a balanced budget amendment \nuse is that this amendment will hurt the Social Security system, unless \nSocial Security is specifically exempted from the amendment. Mr. \nPresident, nothing could be farther from the truth. If the Social \nSecurity system is left as the only area of the budget which does not \nhave to come into balance, then future Congresses will have a \ntremendous incentive to take the FICA revenues, which currently fund \nthe Social Security system, and use them to help fund all other areas \nof the budget which must be balanced. That would leave the Social \nSecurity system in serious financial trouble.\n  Second, exempting Social Security from the balanced budget amendment \nwould further threaten Social Security by allowing Congress to move \nprograms out of the area of the budget which must be balanced and into \nthe exempt Social Security system. This would be a heavy drain on the \nmoney originally collected for Social Security.\n  Finally, the whole point of the balanced budget amendment is to put \nan end to deficit spending. But, as the Social Security trustees tell \nus, there are massive deficits projected in the system in just a few \nshort years. Therefore, while the rest of the budget is balanced, the \nGovernment will still be borrowing huge sums of money to pay its \nliabilities in the Social Security system. Moving Social Security off-\nbudget is just another sham put forth by those who do not want to face \nthe reality that we must stop piling debt on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The truth is the balanced budget amendment will protect Social \nSecurity by reducing its biggest threat--massive interest payments. If \nleft unchecked, these payments will dramatically reduce the money \navailable for Social Security benefits. A balanced budget amendment \nwill keep interest payments from increasing and will allow more money \nto be spent on meaningful programs, including Social Security.\n  Another argument put forth by opponents of a balanced budget \namendment is that it will transfer power over the purse strings to the \njudicial branch of government. This is a serious concern, but one which \nis misplaced. One of the reasons why the courts will not become unduly \ninvolved in the budgetary process is the doctrine of ``standing'' \ncontained in article III of the Constitution. The doctrine of standing \nrequires that a plaintiff has a direct and specific, personal stake or \ninjury. A ``generalized'' public grievance, such as a taxpayer \nadversely affected by macroeconomic decisions, will not be recognized. \nMoreover, the courts will owe deference to Congress under both the \n``political question'' doctrine and section 6 of the amendment itself \nwhich gives Congress the enforcement authority.\n  Another objection to the balanced budget amendment is that it does \nnot provide for a capital budget. The argument here is that just as \nmost families need to borrow money for large purchases, such as a home, \nthe Federal Government should also have the ability to borrow money for \ncapital investments. Those who hold that view, point out that if \nfamilies had to live under the same circumstances imposed on the \nfederal Government by a balanced budget amendment, no one would be able \nto purchase a home.\n  Mr. President, comparing the Federal Government to the typical family \npurchasing a home is a very misleading comparison. The Federal \nGovernment has an annual budget of more than $1.6 trillion and the \nability to increase its income at will by raising taxes. There is \nvirtually no project conceivable which the Federal Government could not \nafford to finance without incurring debt. Just consider that we built \nthe entire interstate highway system on a pay-as-you-go basis. The \nprice of a home can easily be three times as much as the annual income \nof a family, which is why they need to borrow money to purchase it. By \ncomparison, if the Federal Government wanted to undertake a project \nthree times the amount of its annual income, the project would need to \ncost $4.8 trillion in 1 year. That is simply ludicrous. The truth is \nthat with the amount of resources at the disposal of the Federal \nGovernment, there is simply no need for a separate capital budget.\n  The final objection I will address is that the balanced budget \namendment will hamper the Government's ability to stimulate to the \neconomy during a recession. Mr. President, the truth is that the \nFederal Government does not have a very good track record when it comes \nto trying to stimulate our economy. Bruce Bartlett of the National \nCenter for Policy Analysis, points out that since November of 1948, \nthere have been seven recessions, followed by ``anti-recession'' \nlegislation. In each instance, the recession the legislation was \ndesigned to end was over by the time the legislation was finally \npassed. In fact, Bartlett concluded that ``Without exception, stimulus \nprograms have failed to moderate the recessions at which they were \naimed, and have often sowed the seeds of the next recession.''\n  Part of the reason for this is that Government jobs are very \nexpensive to create. President Carter's budget director testified \nbefore the Joint Economic Committee in 1980 that public works jobs cost \nbetween $70,000 and $198,000 per job per year. The truth is, Mr. \nPresident, Congress should not be in the business of trying to micro-\nmanage our economy. If Congress cannot even balance its own books, why \ndo opponents of the balanced budget amendment believe Congress can \nmanage the entire economy?\n  Mr. President, the decision before us is a simple one. It is a choice \nof fiscal responsibility or fiscal foolishness. It is a choice of \nprotecting our children's financial future or destroying it. It is a \nchoice of allowing the 50 States to have a say in this matter or \ndenying them that freedom. In the end, Mr. President, it is a question, \nas Thomas Jefferson said, between right and wrong, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the right thing and vote for the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, the decision before us today is the most important one \nthat this Senate will make in the 105th Congress. Let there be no doubt \nabout it. Since the last balanced budget in 1969, deficit spending has \nbecome a permanent way of life in Washington. The result, as we all \nknow, is a $5.3 trillion national debt. This debt is costing the \ntaxpayers of America a quarter of a trillion dollars each year in \ninterest payments alone. The reality is that without a balanced budget \namendment, deficit spending will continue as usual and our children and \nour grandchildren will be left to pay the bill.\n  Mr. President, now that the debate is over and all of the smoke has \ncleared, we are faced with a simple choice between fiscal \nresponsibility or fiscal foolishness, a choice of protecting our \nchildren's financial future or destroying it, a choice of allowing 50 \nStates to have a say in the matter or denying them that freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the economic arguments for this \nconstitutional amendment were eloquently stated--lower interest rates, \nmore jobs, and a higher standard of living for Americans in the future.\n  I want to emphasize that the moral arguments favor this \nconstitutional amendment. Mr. President, it is simply morally wrong for \nus, year after year after year, to consume the services of government \nand to send the bills to our children and to our grandchildren, who \nhave not had a voice in this body. We must be responsible enough to see \nto it that what we want from government today we pay for today. The \nfact is that we will not do it without a constitutional amendment, as \nevidenced by the heavy stack of unbalanced budgets in front of the \nleader of the debate on this issue.\n  This balanced budget is for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, who has put so much effort into this issue.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate prepares for the final vote on the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, I again offer my support for \nthe passage of this critical piece of legislation.\n  Over the course of the last several weeks, I have listened to many of \nmy colleagues as they have come to the floor to debate the merits or \nthe detriments of the amendment. I have listened to many of my \nconstituents during my travels through Colorado, most recently at town \nmeetings in Colorado Springs, Trinidad, Longmont, Greeley, and Golden. \nI also have reviewed mail that has come into my office here in \nWashington, DC, addressing this important issue. And I must say I am \ngreatly pleased by the large number of people who support the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment.\n  As I've indicated, I have been conducting a series of town meetings \nin my home State of Colorado. When the discussion turns to balancing \nthe budget, the majority of Coloradans realize that we can only begin \nto address this issue with constitutional authority. I have also \nreceived numerous letters from special interest groups located here in \nWashington, DC, asking me to vote against the will of the American \npeople and against the amendment. Well, I am not going to do that. I \nsupport the balanced budget constitutional amendment and have supported \nit since becoming a Member of Congress back in 1987.\n  I believe this amendment is in the best interest of the future of \nthis country, and I become frustrated to hear some of the arguments \nagainst this amendment, such as in the letters I receive from special \ninterest groups. For instance, opponents claim that the amendment would \nlimit the Federal Government's ability to address short-term economic \ncrises or threats to our national security. Well, we have heard this \nargument on numerous occasions over the past few weeks, as well as over \nthe years. Many of my colleagues have addressed this issue, and in \nfact, we have even voted on several amendments relative to these \nconcerns.\n  Section 1 and section 5 of the amendment, as it is currently written \nand was reported by the Committee on the Judiciary, provide Congress \nwith the ability to waive the requirements of the amendment, so I do \nnot find this argument against the amendment to be particularly \ncompelling.\n  Another often repeated argument against the amendment claims that \nCongress can balance the budget on its own without passing the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. Well, folks, I have been a member of \nthis institution for 10 years now, and I have yet to see a balanced \nbudget or one that even approaches balance. In fact, there has not been \na balanced budget since 1969. Congress has even passed deficit-\nreduction legislation on numerous occasions in an effort to achieve a \nbalanced budget, and we still cannot get to a balanced budget.\n  This constitutional amendment will make the Federal Government \naccountable to the Constitution when formulating a budget, and by doing \nso, this amendment will force the Federal Government to behave in a \nfiscally responsible manner just as more than half of the States are \nalready required to do.\n  Again, opponents argue that a balanced budget constitutional \namendment will only lead to devastating cuts to many federally funded \nprograms. Well, I certainly do not argue that this amendment will not \nforce Congress and the administration to make some tough choices. Tough \nchoices need to be made in order to balance the budget. But what is the \nalternative?\n  Because of our inability to balance the budget, we continually run a \ndeficit each year. Our country currently has a national debt of over \n$5.3 trillion--and it is growing--and each and every year the Federal \nGovernment pays interest on this debt. In fiscal year 1996, this \nGovernment spent $344 billion on interest costs, roughly 15 percent of \nthe entire Federal budget for that year. Let me repeat this. The \nFederal Government spent $344 billion on interest costs last year, and \nof this $344 billion, not $1 of it went to education, law enforcement, \nhighways, or even healthcare. At 15 percent of the Federal budget, \ninterest costs are our third largest expenditure, and it continues to \ngrow.\n  What does this mean? It means that our national debt is strangling \nthe rest of the budget. My friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, has \nbeen on this floor each and every day of this debate arguing in favor \nof this amendment, and I believe he best put this whole issue of \ninterest payments in perspective. If my colleagues will indulge me, I \nwould like to reiterate some of my colleague's comments from a couple \nof weeks ago because I think they need to be continuously repeated in \norder to drive home the importance of balancing the budget and ending \nthe escalation of our national debt.\n\n  As my friend from Utah stated once before, the Federal Government \nspent more money last year on net interest payments than it did for the \ncombined budgets of the Department of Commerce, the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of State, and the Department of Transportation. Our \ninability to balance the budget over the years has contributed to an \nenormous debt which requires more money to service annually than we are \nable to put toward the combined budgets of ten departments within the \nFederal Government.\n  If we do not get a handle on the budget, we will continue to add to \nour national debt. In the long-term this debt, and the costs that \naccrue in interest, will endanger the funding for those programs that \ntruly need, deserve, and require Federal funding. Of course, as this \nproblem continues to escalate, it will be our children and our \nchildren's children who will be forced to deal with this problem. It \nwill be they who will be hurt by low levels of funding--all because we \ndid not seize the opportunity to pass the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  And yet, there are still those who oppose the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment--who think that Congress can balance the \nbudget on its own. Well, we have not done so in the last 28 years, and \nwithout this amendment I see no possible way that we can do so. If we \nwere able to pass a budget plan this year which would balance the \nbudget by the year 2002, without the constitutional requirement there \nis nothing to stop future Congresses and future administrations from \nimplementing unbalanced budgets.\n  And each year we fail to balance the budget, we run a deficit. These \ndeficits will continue to add to the debt, increasing it and the size \nof the interest payments on the debt we leave to our children. It is \nestimated that in the year 2002 the interest payments will be $412 \nbillion. It will continue to increase thereafter unless we find the \nfortitude to control our spending.\n  You know, as legislators we should realize that our constituents \nexpect certain things of us and of the Federal Government, and they \nrightly should. They trust us when we pledge our support for \nlegislation such as this, and\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\nthey have a right to expect our support when the time comes to vote. \nAll of us meet with constituents and constituency groups, and barely a \nday goes by that we do not hear someone asking for our support for \nfunding for certain programs or to work to increase funding for others. \nHowever, the fact of the matter is that money is scarce, and if we \ncontinue to run deficits and add to the national debt, it is going to \nbecome increasingly difficult to fund programs at the level they need \nand deserve.\n  This body is going to vote on the balanced budget constitutional \namendment, and it makes me angry to think it may fail to pass--once \nagain by possibly only one vote. It makes me angry because this \nlegislation and all of the same debates will continue to come up in \nfuture Congresses until one Congress has the good sense and courage to \npass this measure and send it on to the States where it rightly belongs \nfor ratification. As Members of the United States Congress, we often \nthink that we know best on every single issue. Well, this is an issue \nwe should send to the States and the American people, to finally \nprovide them with the opportunity to debate the merits of this \namendment and allow them to have the final decision.\n  Mr. President, for 3 weeks we have seen every chart, we have viewed \nevery graph, we have heard every point of view, and in some cases we \nhave looked for every hole in which to hide in an effort to scuttle the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  In my view, the American people are not buying any more excuses, nor \nshould they. The American people know that their elected leaders, just \nlike the wage earner in their household, cannot spend themselves into \nprosperity. Regardless of our own personal and varying views in this \nChamber, one inescapable question remains. That question is: Do we \ntrust the people of this Nation? By not passing this amendment we are \ntelling them that we do not trust them, that we don't trust them to do \nthe right thing in making decisions that will affect our lives. We, \nfrom our lofty perch in the U.S. Senate, will relieve them of the \ndecision by not letting them discuss the balanced budget amendment in \ntheir State legislatures and in their hometowns. No one knows if the \nnecessary 38 States would actually ratify the balanced budget \namendment. But to not even allow the citizens of our home State the \nopportunity to review it, I find rather arrogant on our part. Let's not \ninsult our constituents with that denial. They do not take this issue \nlightly any more than we do. But they also know that eight balanced \nbudgets out of 66 years simply isn't good enough for America.\n  Let's pass this important bill and give this Nation a chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, any time a contemporary generation is \nengaged in the business of consuming the resources of generations yet \nto come, they are in the business of abrogating the freedom of \ngenerations yet to come. This democracy was formed in a war for \neconomic freedom and independence. As you look to the children yet to \ncome, we are in the business of robbing them of the choices and the \nfreedoms we have known as American people. The balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution is an act that must be engaged in in \norder to preserve the freedoms that we have known as Americans for all \nthose generations yet to come.\n  My mother and father kept 80 percent of their wages to raise their \nfamily. My sister will keep 46 percent, and her children will keep 16 \npercent. They will not be free as we know it.\n  We need to pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 or 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding and \ncompliment him on his leadership on this very important issue.\n  Here we are having the same debate on the same issue and the same \nreversal of positions by Senators who have previously supported this \namendment--the same excuses and the same problems. We don't have a \nbalanced budget amendment. Two years ago the opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment said a constitutional amendment isn't necessary in \norder to achieve a balanced budget; that, in fact, the constitutional \namendment is only an enforcement mechanism, but it isn't the balanced \nbudget plan itself. They admonished Republicans by saying, ``Show us \nyour plan. Show us your plan.'' The President, in the State of the \nUnion Address in February, expressed the same sentiment. He said, \n``Rewriting the Constitution isn't necessary to balance the budget. All \nwe need is your vote and my signature.'' Exactly, Mr. President. \nRepublicans delivered a balanced budget plan last year statutorily. We \ndelivered a plan. We delivered it to the President of the United \nStates. The President demonstrated with the swift stroke of the pen the \nneed for a balanced budget amendment because he vetoed that \nlegislation.\n  History has proven that a force greater than politics is necessary in \nthis institution in order to achieve a balanced budget. History has \nproven the repeated failures of statutory attempts to balance the \nbudget. The last time we had a balanced budget was in 1969. We have \nonly had a balanced budget five times since 1950. In fact, we have \ndebated this amendment, in the last two decades, in 1982, 1986, 1990, \n1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, and now here in 1997. And guess what? We don't \nhave a statutory balanced budget. The fact is the opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment understand that you can't have a \nconstitutional amendment without achieving a balanced budget.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it now appears that the balanced budget \namendment will pass or fail by a single vote. If the amendment is \ndefeated, I would venture that there is a greater chance that UFO's \nwill land on Earth tomorrow than there is that the Federal Government \nwill actually balance its books by the year 2002. It is unlikely that \nCongress and the President will ever balance the budget without a \nconstitutional requirement to do so.\n  Two years ago, President Clinton vetoed a balanced budget--the first \nbalanced budget to pass Congress in 26 years. Not one Senate Democrat \nvoted for the plan. And of course, since it would have taken 67 votes \nin the Senate to override the President's veto, the balanced budget \nnever became law.\n  President Clinton now says he has changed his mind--that he is for a \nbalanced budget, but once again his support is conditional: we have to \nwait until after he leaves office to make 98.5 percent of the savings \nrequired to get there. Until then, it is business as usual. The \nPresident would create six new entitlement programs, costing at least \n$60 billion over the next 5 years. He would have us increase total \nFederal outlays by $827 billion over that period. We can do all this, \nyet somehow the deficit magically disappears in 2002.\n  I am reminded of the old Peanuts cartoon when Lucy promises time and \nagain to hold the football still for Charlie Brown, only to pull it \naway at the last minute. Every Republican Senator will vote for this \namendment. A few Democrats will vote for it, too. An overwhelming \nmajority of the American people want us to pass it. Yet President \nClinton and most Senate Democrats ask us to trust them--they do not \nneed a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  How do we know that, in 3 or 4 years, when it finally comes time to \nget serious about deficit reduction under the Clinton budget, they will \nnot yank away their support for a balanced budget again?\n  Mr. President, we must pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the last time we had a balanced budget in \nthis country, as my colleague from Maine has pointed out, was 1969. I \nhappened to be at that time a senior in college. I turned 50 this year. \nIt has been a long time. A lot of things have happened\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nsince 1969. The one thing that has not happened is for this Congress \nand the President to balance the budget.\n  It is, frankly, time that we stopped spending our children's money. \nIt is time we stopped spending our grandchildren's money and great-\ngrandchildren's money. We need to balance the budget. Within the next 2 \nhours, I intend to cast a ``yea'' vote for a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  I will quote Ronald Reagan, who said in 1985:\n\n       Almost 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us \n     to a time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a \n     moment for the hard decisions. If not us, who? If not now, \n     when? Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal \n     Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes \n     in.\n\n  A very simple notion. Ronald Reagan, our President, said this in \n1985. It is 1997, and we have not yet taken the action the American \npeople have asked us to take, to make it unconstitutional to mortgage \nthe futures of our children and grandchildren. That is the vote today. \nThe Republicans are going to keep their promise. We will be back again \nuntil we win this fight so that when we leave this place, we will know \nwe have done our duty to protect the future of this great country that \nso many people have died to defend.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Texas.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  I think this is a very significant day. We had a very blessed event \nover the weekend at my house. We had our fifth grandchild. And when \nlittle Mollie Elizabeth Inhofe was born, I say to Senator Thurmond, she \ninherited a $20,000 personal debt. I remember it was only a year before \nwhen little Jase, our fourth grandchild, was born. He inherited a \n$19,000 debt. So it is going up every year.\n  When I look over, I see Senator Hagel from Nebraska. You do not have \nto go back just to the Reagan administration. If you go back long \nbefore that, one of our very fine Senators, Carl Curtis, had an idea \nthat he would balance the budget by getting the States to preratify it. \nIt was an ingenious idea, and it did not work, even though in the State \nlegislature, I was the first State legislator to get it preratified.\n  So we have something we are faced with today that we have been \nfighting for 20 or 25 years. This is our opportunity to do it. If we do \nnot do it now, I do not think we will be able to do it in the near \nfuture. This is a moral issue, Mr. President, we have to meet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his excellent \nstatement.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. I appreciate that.\n  I am honored to be able to address this body today once again on the \nimportance of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Balancing the budget is simply no longer an option. The future of our \nchildren literally hangs in the balance. Every day we spend debating \nthis issue, we add billions of dollars to the deficit. We have to give \nourselves the tools to be able to assure that we can stay in balance.\n  This is an astounding fact, but in the February issue of Nation's \nBusiness they state that unless Government spending policies are \naltered, the average--the average--net tax burden on Americans born \nbetween 1960 and 1993 will soar from the current 34 percent to 85 \npercent of their lifetime incomes. That is 85 percent lifetime income \ngoing to taxes. It is thoroughly reprehensible to allow our children to \nbe taxed at this rate simply because we do not have the courage to do \nwhat is right.\n  How can we do this to our children? It is imperative that we pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution for the kids.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield a couple of minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, who has led the fight for this \namendment in the House, along with Congressman Stenholm and, of course, \nplayed a pivotal role in leading the fight for it each time we brought \nit up in the Senate as long as he has been here, Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. I thank the senior Senator from Utah \nfor his tremendous leadership on this issue and the hours of debate he \nhas conducted in the Chamber in behalf of the passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment to our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I feel compelled to rise one more time to discuss how \nthe Social Security trust funds would be treated under the balanced \nbudget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  Unfortunately, day after day, we hear reference made to what the \nCongressional Research Service supposedly said about this subject.\n  It is about time to put these issues to rest, once and for all.\n  Therefore, Congressman Charlie Stenholm and I submitted several more \nquestions to CRS.\n  We asked CRS to compare, in several areas, the impact of two \ndifferent kinds of balanced budget amendments: One that excluded Social \nSecurity from budget calculations, as several amendments to Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 would have; and one that counts all Federal spending \nin the budget, as does Senate Joint Resolution 1 as reported.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table summarizing the results of this \nmemo be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of CRS Memo to Senator Craig and Congressman Stenholm, February \n                                26, 1997\n\n       CRS Analyzed five Balanced Budget Amendment proposals: S.J. \n     Res. 1/H.J.

Yes            No \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. There are compelling reasons for not excluding Social \nSecurity from budget calculations. Some Senators may feel there are \ngood reasons for that exclusion. Some Senators may feel there are good \nreasons to vote against Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  But this table and the CRS memo it summarizes convincingly show that \nseveral of the reasons offered for voting against Senate Joint \nResolution 1 simply do not stand up.\n  In three key respects, S.J.Res. 1 and the amendments to exclude \nSocial Security, such as the Reid and Dorgan amendments, would operate \nidentically.\n  First, neither approach would change the way Social Security \nsurpluses are invested in Treasury bonds. Some have called that raiding \nthe trust funds. But the Social Security Act required that from the \nstart, because Treasury bonds are the safest investment in the world.\n  If the Social Security trust funds are being raided today, and if \nthat so-called raiding continued under Senate Joint Resolution 1, then \nit would also continue under the Dorgan, Reid, and Feinstein \namendments.\n  Those amendments don't change the law in this area.\n  So there's no reason here to vote for those amendments and against \nSenate Joint Resolution 1.\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\n  Second, consistent with its two previous memos, this new CRS memo \nconfirms again that the following is equally true for both approaches: \nThe Treasury will redeem Treasury bonds held by the Social Security \ntrust funds; the Treasury will repay cash borrowed from the trust \nfunds; and the trust funds will pay out benefits as promised.\n  I want to emphasize the consistency of CRS here.\n  The February 5 CRS memo was misunderstood and misrepresented. Some \ncontinue to make the misstatements today.\n  CRS clarified that misunderstanding in a February 12 memo. But the \nmisstatements continue.\n  This newer CRS memo makes it clear that, if there were a problem \ndrawing upon Social Security surpluses in the future under Senate Joint \nResolution 1--and there is not--then the same problem would exist under \nthe Reid and Dorgan amendments.\n  So there's no reason here to vote for those amendments and against \nSenate Joint Resolution 1.\n  Third, neither version would overturn the current law that protects \nthe balances of the Social Security trust funds.\n  Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, there are points of order--\na 60-vote point of order in the Senate--against any legislation that \nwould change trust fund outlays or receipts in a way that would erode \nthe balances in the trust funds.\n  So there's no reason here to vote for those amendments and against \nSenate Joint Resolution 1.\n  Fourth, in a fourth key area, one version, Senate Joint Resolution 1, \nwould take the current, statutory process of protecting the Social \nSecurity balances, and elevate it into the Constitution.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 prohibits any change that would increase \ndeficits or reduce surpluses--including those in the Social Security \ntrust fund balances.\n  The Dorgan, Feinstein, and Reid amendments, by contrast, would allow \nthe Social Security trust funds to run unlimited deficits.\n  Whether you have been for or against amendments excluding Social \nSecurity from the budget calculations, those amendments did not pass.\n  Now, if you really care about Social Security, you will still vote \nfor Senate Joint Resolution 1 on final passage.\n  Under the status quo, we will add another $3 trillion to the national \ndebt over the next 10 years.\n  Does anyone think that adding nearly another $3 trillion to the debt \nis good for Social Security?\n  The debt is the threat to Social Security. The debt is the threat to \nour children and their standard of living.\n  Passing the balanced budget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, is \nthe answer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following be included in the Record: \nA copy of the CRS memo we recently received and bipartisan materials we \ndistributed analyzing the various CRS memos.\n  There being no objection, the memoranda was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Clubb--Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget\n\n\n                       crs--the rest of the story\n\n     Social Security Trust Funds and the BBA\n       The Congressional Research Service has prepared a memo in \n     response to questions from Rep. Stenholm and Sen. Craig, \n     comparing several key operations of the Social Security trust \n     funds under two different kinds of balanced budget amendment \n     to the Constitution.\n       The February 26 CRS memo compared S.J. Res. 1 (and it \n     companion, H.J. Res. 1) on the one hand, with S.J. Res. 12 \n     (and its companion H.J. Res. 50, as well as the Reid \n     amendment #8). S.J. Res. 1 requires a balanced ``unified'' \n     budget (i.e., total federal outlays would not exceed total \n     receipts), while S.J. Res. 12 would exclude Social Security \n     from budget calculations.\n     The CRS memo confirms that the treatment of the Social \n         Security trust funds would be identical in several key \n         ways under both versions.\n       Neither version would change the current law requirement \n     that trust fund surpluses must be invested in U.S. Treasury \n     securities. Under either version (as well as under current \n     law), that requirement could be changed by amending the \n     Social Security Act.\n       Neither version would affect the legal obligation of the \n     Treasury to repay these borrowings to the trust funds when \n     the appropriate time came to draw down trust fund surpluses \n     and make promised benefit payments. (This would occur when \n     Social Security is projected to start running annual deficits \n     in 2019, while it still retains an accumulated surplus.) This \n     is the issue raised in connection with the much-discussed and \n     disputed CRS memo of February 5.\n       Neither version would change or overturn provisions in the \n     Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 that protect the balances in \n     the trust funds. The BEA includes points of order--including \n     a 60-vote point of order in the Senate--against any \n     legislation that would change trust fund outlays on receipts \n     in a way that would erode trust fund balances.\n     The CRS memo pointed out one difference in the impact of the \n         different amendments:\n       S.J. Res. 1 essentially would elevate the BEA protections \n     to constitutional status, by requiring a 3/5 vote to approve \n     any change that would increase deficits or reduce surpluses, \n     including those in the Social Security trust fund balances.\n     The February 26 CRS memo should put some issues to rest, once \n         and for all\n       Whatever preference one may have on any other basis, the \n     ``drawdown'' issue is not a reason to prefer S.J. Res. 12, \n     nor a reason to vote against S.J. Res. 1.\n       The February 5 CRS memo was incorrectly cited as saying \n     that, beginning in 2019, S.J. Res. 1 would make it harder to \n     draw down accumulated trust fund surpluses in order to pay \n     promised Social Security benefits. No matter how that memo is \n     interpreted, CRS has now made it crystal-clear: Both S.J. \n     Res. 1 and S.J. Res. 12 (Dorgan-Reid) would have exactly the \n     same impact on Social Security drawdowns and benefit \n     payments.\n       Whatever preference one may have on any other basis, the \n     issue of the Treasury borrowing the Social Security surpluses \n     is not a reason to prefer S.J. Res. 12, nor a reason to vote \n     against S.J. Res. 1.\n       This process has been variously characterized as ``raiding \n     the trust funds'' versus ``investing Social Security \n     surpluses in the safest investment in the world''. But either \n     way, one thing is clear: Neither S.J. Res. 1 nor S.J. Res. 12 \n     would change in any way the process of investing trust fund \n     surpluses in Treasury securities.\n       The DEBT is the threat to Social Security--and to other \n     priorities and to our future standard of living. Under \n     current trends, over the years 2002-2007 (the first 6 years \n     in which the Balanced Budget Amendment would be effective), \n     the amount of federal debt held by the public will increase \n     by $1.47 trillion. No one can argue that another $1.47 \n     trillion in debt is good for Social Security.\n       Reasonable persons can disagree over which version, \n     overall, offers the better protection for Social Security. \n     But the only way to ensure any protection for Social Security \n     is for Congress to pass a strong, effective Balanced Budget \n     Amendment and send it to the states for ratification.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1997.\n     From: David Koitz, Specialist in Social Legislation, \n         Education and Public Welfare Division, and Johnny H. \n         Killian, Senior Specialist in American Constitutional \n         Law, American Law Division.\n     Subject: Treatment of Social Security under the Balanced \n         Budget Amendment.\n       This memorandum is in response to four specific questions \n     you and Representative Charles Stenholm raised with regard to \n     five pending legislative measures to adopt a constitutional \n     amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. These measures \n     include H.J. Res. 1 and S.J. Res. 1, both of which prescribe \n     a ``unified'' balanced federal budget that would count all \n     receipts and outlays of the federal government. H.J. Res. 50 \n     and S.J. Res. 12, and an amendment to S.J. Res. 1 by Senator \n     Reid, offered on February 24, 1997, would not count the \n     receipts and outlays of the Social Security trust funds for \n     purposes of satisfying the requirements of the balanced \n     budget amendment. Your questions and our responses follow.\n       Question #1. What differences, if any, would the different \n     amendments mentioned above have on the ability of the Social \n     Security trust funds to invest annual surpluses in Treasury \n     bills?\n       Answer: The five measures all include the same language \n     requiring approval of ``three-fifths of the whole number of \n     each House'' to increase the portion of the federal debt held \n     by the public. However, none of the bills places a limit on \n     raising the government's gross federal debt, which includes \n     both debt held by the public and debt held in government \n     accounts such as the Social Security trust funds, or on the \n     portion of the debt held in government accounts. Therefore, \n     there would be no restrictions beyond those of current law \n     that would explicitly limit the investment of surplus Social \n     Security income in the Social Security trust funds.\n       Current law (P.L. 104-121) does place an explicit limit of \n     $5.5 trillion on the government's gross debt, and this \n     potentially could constrain the Secretary of the Treasury \n     from purchasing additional federal securities for the trust \n     funds with surplus Social Security income if the amount of \n     outstanding gross federal debt bumps against this ceiling. \n     Whether this explicit limit on gross federal debt would be \n     continued, raised, or abolished in the event of passage of \n     any of the pending measures to create a constitutional \n     limitation on publicly-held debt is a matter of conjecture.\n       Question #2: What differences, if any, would the amendments \n     have on the obligation of\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\n     the federal government to redeem the Treasury bills held by \n     the Social Security trust funds?\n       Answer: Section 201 of Title II of the Social Security Act \n     provides for a drawdown of the Social Security trust funds to \n     pay for benefits and administrative expenses of the program. \n     None of the five bills explicitly hinders the operations of \n     this section of law.\n       Question #3: What differences, if any, would the different \n     amendments mentioned above have on the ability of the federal \n     government to increase the limit on the debt held by the \n     public in order to borrow money to redeem Treasury bills held \n     by the Social Security trust funds if the receipts of the \n     federal government other than Social Security revenues are \n     not sufficient to cover the outlays of the government other \n     than Social Security and redeem Treasury bills held by the \n     Social Security Administration.\n       Answer: The five measures all include the same language \n     requiring approval of ``three-fifths of the whole number of \n     each House'' to increase the portion of the federal debt held \n     by the public. Hence, if it were necessary to borrow money \n     from the public over and above this limit in order to cover \n     non-Social Security outlays and make good, as well, on \n     government securities held by the Social Security trust \n     funds, all five measures set forth an identical prohibition.\n       As with any debt ceiling limitation set by law, if the \n     government's income were less than its outlays and the \n     Treasury Department had reached a legal limit on borrowing \n     set forth by one or another of the proposed constitutional \n     amendments, the operations of the federal government as a \n     whole would be jeopardized. How any single program or \n     function of the government would be affected is a matter of \n     conjecture. Although there appears to be some flexibility \n     under current law with respect to continuing certain \n     essential services in the event of a debt ceiling impasse, \n     there is nothing in the five pending measures or in current \n     law that would prioritize expenditures to be made from the \n     Treasury in that event. Whether the enactment of any one of \n     these five proposed constitutional amendments would best \n     facilitate attaining the necessary three-fifths approval of \n     both Houses to increase the publicly-held portion of the debt \n     or the passage of tax increases or spending reductions (or \n     both) to obtain the resources to make good on the liquidation \n     of Social Security trust fund securities also is a matter of \n     conjecture.\n       Question #4: What differences, if any, would the different \n     amendments mentioned above have on the ability of Congress to \n     enact legislation increasing outlays from the Social Security \n     trust funds or reducing revenues into the trust funds without \n     obtaining a vote of three-fifths of the whole number of both \n     Houses as required under the amendment.\n       Answer: H.J. Res. 1 and S.J. Res. 1 would require a vote of \n     three-fifths of the whole number of both Houses to enact \n     legislation to reduce federal receipts or increase federal \n     outlays, including Social Security receipts and outlays, in \n     any year (in the absence of offsetting measures). These \n     limitations would not apply under H.J. Res. 50, S.J. Res. 12, \n     and the amendment by Senator Reid since the definition of \n     total receipts and total outlays under these measures would \n     exclude the receipts and outlays of the Social Security trust \n     funds.\n       However, none of the five measures would preclude the \n     operation of the so-called Social Security ``firewall'' rules \n     enacted in Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 that permit points \n     of order to be raised against measures that would erode the \n     balances of the Social Security trust funds. Presumably, they \n     would act as an impediment, as they do today, to legislation \n     that would reduce Social Security receipts or increase \n     expenditures (without offsetting measures). Although in the \n     House a simple majority may override any objection raised \n     against such measures, it takes three-fifths approval of the \n     whole Senate to do so.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last week several Senators and \nRepresentatives held a bipartisan, bicameral press event on the Capitol \nGrounds. Among other things, we received a letter, signed by more than \n250 economists, endorsing the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. The letter was put together by the American Legislative \nExchange Council, the largest bipartisan individual association of \nState legislators in the country.\n  These economists, from both sides of the political aisle, have signed \nan open letter to Congress, asking us to approve the balanced budget \namendment. Both Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, \nthey have based their support of the balanced budget amendment upon \nsound reasoning and a concern that America's future will be crippled if \nFederal deficits are allowed to continue. Among the signatories are \nJames Buchanan, a Nobel laureate in economics, as well as William E. \nSimon, who served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1974 to 1977.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a partisan issue--it is an \neconomic and moral issue. We need to recognize that through deficit \nspending we are selfishly spending on ourselves today the earnings that \nwill be confiscated from future generations without their consent or \nknowledge.\n  The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution imposes procedural \nconstraints on the making of budgetary choices. It doesn't take away \nthe power of the Congress to spend or tax. The amendment requires only \nthat the Congress and the Executive spend no more than what they \ncollect on taxes.\n  The effects of the balanced budget amendment would be real as well as \nsymbolic. Elected politicians would be forced to act responsibly and \nmake fiscal choices within meaningfully constructed boundaries. \nCongress would be faced with important decisions regarding the \nfinancial fate of programs sooner rather than later. In its simplest \nterms, the balanced budget amendment amounts to little more than \nhonesty in budgeting.\n  It is time to acknowledge that mere statutes that claim to control \nFederal spending or deficits have failed. It is time to adopt \nconstitutional control through a balanced budget amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letter that was \nsigned by over 250 economists who believe that Congress must place \nconstitutional restraints on spending.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              American Legislative\n\n\n                                             Exchange Council,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     An Open Letter to Congress from U.S. Economists.\n       It is time to acknowledge that mere statutes that purport \n     to control federal spending or deficits have failed. It is \n     time to adopt constitutional control through a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment. In supporting such an amendment, Congress \n     can control the federal government's spending proclivities by \n     setting up control machinery external to its own internal \n     operations, machinery that will not be so easily neglected \n     and abandoned.\n       Why do we need the Balanced Budget Amendment now, when no \n     such constitutional provision existed for two centuries? The \n     answer is clear. Up until resent decades, the principle that \n     government should balance is budget in peacetime was a part \n     of our effective constitution, even if not formally written \n     down. Before the Keynesian-inspired shift in thinking about \n     fiscal matters, it was universally considered immoral to \n     incur debts, except in periods of emergency (wars or major \n     depressions). We have lost the moral sense of fiscal \n     responsibility that served to make formal constitutional \n     constraints unnecessary. While we can't legislate a change in \n     political morality; we can put formal constitutional \n     constraints into place.\n       The effects of the Balanced Budget Amendment would be both \n     real and symbolic. Elected politicians would be required to \n     make fiscal choices within meaningfully-constructed \n     boundaries; they would be required to weigh predicted \n     benefits against predicted tax costs. They would be forced to \n     behave ``responsibly,'' as this word is understood by the \n     citizenry, and knowledge of this fact would do much to \n     restore the confidence of citizens in governmental processes. \n     Important decisions (such as the fate of entitlement programs \n     facing financial insolvency) would be faced sooner rather \n     than later.\n       It is important to recognize that the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment imposes procedural constraints on the making of \n     budgetary choices. It does not take away the power of the \n     Congress to spend or tax. The amendment requires only that \n     the Congress and the Executive spend no more than what they \n     collect in taxes. In its simplest terms, such an amendment \n     amounts to little more than ``honesty in budgeting.'' If we \n     as people want a certain program, we--not future \n     generations--should pay for it.\n       Of course, we always pay for what we spend through \n     government, as anywhere else. But those who pay for the \n     government spending that is financed by borrowing are \n     taxpayers in future years, those who must pay taxes to meet \n     the ever-mounting interest obligations that are already far \n     too large an item in the federal budget. The immorality of \n     the inter-generational transfer that deficit financing \n     represents cries out for correction.\n       Opponents of the BBA often suggest that Congress and the \n     Executive must maintain the budgetary flexibility to respond \n     to emergency needs for expanding rates of spending. This \n     prospect is fully recognized, and the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment includes a provision that allows for approval of \n     debt or deficits by a super-majority vote of those elected to \n     each house of Congress.\n       Opponents also make the case that the BBA in no way \n     accounts for needed capital spending which is more \n     appropriately funded through debt finance. In the ideal non-\n     politicized world that BBA opponents imagine, it may be \n     correct to include a capital budgeting provision. But just as \n     politics intruded to destroy the Keynesians' vision of using \n     deficits and surpluses to rationally counter the business \n     cycle, so too politics would intrude\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\n     here. In this case, we can well imagine all sorts of creative \n     accounting and politicking to make non-capital expenditures \n     be labeled as such.\n       The past four decades demonstrate that debt finance is \n     simply a way to fund short-term, not long-term benefits. \n     Since the early 1960s, while deficits have risen \n     tremendously, long-term federal investments (excluding \n     defense) have remained at about 6 percent of GNP. But short-\n     term federal benefits have risen from about 6 percent of GNP \n     to more than double that. Politicians have used the trillions \n     in deficit financing over the past decades to finance short-\n     term benefits, not long-term.\n       When all is said and done, there is no rational argument \n     against the Balanced Budget Amendment. Simple observation of \n     the fiscal record of recent decades tells us that the \n     procedures through which fiscal choices are made are not \n     working. The problem is not one that involves the wrong \n     political leaders or the wrong parties. The problem is one \n     where those whom we elect are required to function under the \n     wrong set of rules, the wrong procedures. It is high time to \n     get our fiscal house in order.\n       We can only imagine the increase in investor and business \n     confidence, both domestic and foreign, that enactment of a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment would produce. Perhaps even more \n     importantly, we could all regain confidence in ourselves, as \n     a free people under responsible constitutional government.\n       (Signed by 253 economists.)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, recently, the citizens of Idaho, through \ntheir elected representatives in the State legislature, called upon the \nMembers of the U.S. Congress to pass a constitutional amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget. This is further proof that Idahoans are \nacutely aware of the devastating impact 28 deficits in a row and 36 \nunbalanced budgets in 37 years have had on our country.\n  If asked, the overwhelming majority of Idahoans would say it is not \nright to saddle every child born today with nearly $200,000 in \nadditional taxes just to pay interest on the national debt.\n  Most Idahoans would say it is not right to rob future generations of \nthe opportunity to participate in a vibrant, growing economy. They \nunderstand the implications of the Congressional Budget Office's words, \nthat without changes in current tax and spend policies, the Federal \n``debt would exceed levels the economy could reasonably support.''\n  Most Idahoans can see the debt is the threat to Social Security and \nthat no program, no matter how important, can survive the squeeze of \nincreasing interest payments on the debt--$344 billion in fiscal year \n1996.\n  Idahoans have known for years that balancing the budget would have an \nimmediate positive impact on American families. In 1982 I was \nencouraged by Idahoans to vote for BBA. If the BBA would have passed \nthen, the national income would be at least 5 percent higher today, \naccording to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n  Idahoans understand passing the BBA would put more than $1,500 a year \ninto the pockets of American families--per DRI-McGraw-Hill, and others.\n  The citizens of Idaho are hard working, wise, and astute in their \nunderstanding of the need for the BBA. They know you don't need to be \nclairvoyant to see what the future holds if our current course of \nfiscal irresponsibility is maintained.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that a copy of Idaho \nSenate Joint Memorial No. 102 be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is do ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Idaho is not the only State in the Union with wise \ncitizens who have requested Congress send them a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Yesterday, along with a bipartisan group \nof Senators and Representatives, I accepted a letter delivered by the \nbipartisan American Legislative Exchange Council in which nearly 600 \nState legislators from across the country urge Congress to approve a \nFederal BBA.\n  These State representatives have eloquently articulated the momentous \nnature of, and need for, the BBA. They state that we ``will be faced \nwith many historic opportunities to advance the American dream of \nfreedom, opportunity and prosperity. But none will be as significant as \nenacting and sending to the states for ratification a Constitutional \nBalanced Budget Amendment.''\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council's Open Letter from State \nLegislators to Congress be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. As is pointed out in this letter, congressional passage is \njust the first step--next, during ratification, in State capitols and \ncoffee shops, the American people would begin one of the greatest \ndebates ever, one of the greatest civics lessons ever, on the size and \nscope of their Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, 70 to 80 percent of Americans are calling on the \nCongress to pass the BBA and provide them with the opportunity to, once \nand for all, put our fiscal house in order. It is unconscionable for us \nto ignore that call.\n  The wisdom of our Founding Fathers is evident in the construction of \nour Constitution. They reached a delicate balance by creating a \ndocument strong enough to ultimately hold the States, with all their \ncompeting interests, together, yet with a mechanism allowing the \nflexibility necessary for future generations to deal with the \nunforeseen circumstances they knew would develop.\n  The Constitution of the United States vests the ultimate \nresponsibility to approve or disapprove constitutional amendments with \nthe people, as represented by their elected State legislatures. Mr. \nPresident, it is time that Congress tap into the wisdom displayed by \nIdahoans, the Nation's State legislators, and our country's Founding \nFathers by passing Senate Joint Resolution 1 and sending the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution to the States for ratification.\n\n                              [Exhibit 1]\n\n    Legislature of the State of Idaho, Senate Joint Memorial No. 102\n\n       Whereas, the annual federal budget has not been balanced \n     since 1969, and the federal public debt is now more than five \n     trillion dollars, or twenty thousand dollars for every man, \n     woman and child in America; and\n       Whereas, continued deficit spending demonstrates an \n     unwillingness or inability of both the federal executive and \n     legislative branches to spend no more than available \n     revenues; and\n       Whereas, fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level is \n     lowering our standard of living, destroying jobs, and \n     endangering economic opportunity now and for the next \n     generation; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's unlimited ability to \n     borrow raises questions about fundamental principles and \n     responsibilities of government, with potentially profound \n     consequences for the nation and its people, making it an \n     appropriate subject for limitation by the Constitution of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States vests the \n     ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove \n     constitutional amendments with the people, as represented by \n     their elected state legislatures; and opposition by a small \n     minority repeatedly has thwarted the will of the people that \n     a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution should be \n     submitted to the states for ratification; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-fourth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, That the Congress of the \n     United States expeditiously pass, and propose to the \n     legislatures of the several states for ratification, an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States requiring, \n     in the absence of a national emergency, that the total of all \n     federal appropriations made by the Congress for any fiscal \n     year may not exceed the total of all estimated federal \n     revenues for that fiscal year; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives of Congress, the congressional \n     delegation representing the state of Idaho in the Congress of \n     the United States, and to the Secretary of State and the \n     presiding officers of both houses of the Legislatures of each \n     of the other states in the Union.\n\n                              [Exhibit 2]\n\n             Open Letter From State Legislators to Congress\n\n       Dear Member of Congress: As members of the American \n     Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) we would like to take \n     this opportunity to welcome the 105th Congress. It is both an \n     exciting and challenging time to be an elected official in \n     this great nation.\n       During the next few years, you will be faced with many \n     historic opportunities to advance the American dream of \n     freedom, opportunity and prosperity. But none will be as \n     significant as enacting and sending to the states for \n     ratification a Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       As state legislators who must balance our state budgets \n     each year, we understand the\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\n     difficult choices you will face. Unfortunately, as the past \n     29 years have shown, it has been impossible for past \n     Congresses to withstand the political pressure of special \n     interests and make the tough choices necessary to balance the \n     budget. Clearly, the federal budget process is broken and \n     needs fixing. As the experience in the states shows, balanced \n     budget amendments work, and a federal Balanced Budget \n     Amendment is the only way to guarantee the fiscal integrity \n     of this nation and a solvent future for our children and \n     grandchildren. Therefore, we call on you to exercise the \n     courage and fiscal responsibility to stand up to the special \n     interests who are willing to place their interests ahead of \n     the nation's future.\n       We hope that the 105th Congress will make the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment its first priority. The nation cannot afford \n     to wait. The federal government cannot continue to borrow \n     from future generations to pay for current consumption. If \n     deficit spending is not curbed now, when it can be done \n     sensibly and gradually, it will have to be done under \n     desperate circumstances. The only way to ensure that programs \n     like Social Security and Medicare are there for us and our \n     children is to set a course of fiscal responsibility today.\n       As you may know, ALEC is the nation's largest bipartisan, \n     individual membership association of state legislators, with \n     nearly 3,000 members. ALEC is dedicated to the Jeffersonian \n     principles of individual liberty, limited government and the \n     free enterprise system. We believe that reducing the \n     devastating $5 trillion national debt is central to these \n     principles and critical to the strength of the nation's \n     economy.\n       The historic opportunity to provide a brighter, more \n     prosperous future lies in your hands. We in the states are up \n     to the challenge and ready to ratify the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment. This is not about whether you are a Democrat or \n     Republican or a liberal or conservative--this is about what \n     you must do for the future of this great nation. It is up to \n     you to make the right choice for this country, the fiscally \n     responsible choice--pass a Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       (Signed by 572 State Legislators.)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, years ago, we changed our Constitution to \nassure that never again in this Nation would we have human bondage. We \nchanged our Constitution to allow women to vote. Today, we are asking \nthis Senate to allow the American people to once again change the \nConstitution to step away from fiscal bondage or the risk of a bankrupt \nGovernment, to take off the backs of our children and grandchildren the \nburdensome, overpowering debt that we are causing them to accumulate.\n  Yes, it is time once again that we ask the American people to change \ntheir Constitution to require us to balance the budget, to bring fiscal \nsanity to our Government, and to ensure the stability of this country, \nits economy, and the American dream for future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Utah, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the old words come back to haunt us almost during \nthese times of debate, especially over the issue of a balanced budget. \nI quote the words of Thomas Jefferson when he was speaking to the \nFramers of the Constitution. He expressed these words of his concerns \nregarding debt:\n\n       We, Congress, should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Why is it so hard to understand that the Federal Government should \nbalance the budget when State governments and county governments and \ncity governments do? Why is it that we cannot accumulate or mandate to \ncarry reserves in each line for a rainy day? That is not too hard to \nunderstand, and that is what we are talking about here, responsibility \nand the integrity of Government to function.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I now yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me, too, thank the leaders who have been in the Chamber for some \ntime.\n  Again we are asked to vote on a balanced budget amendment. This is \nthe most important and vital action that any of us will take this year \nif we are to be financially and fiscally responsible. This is more than \njust a balanced budget. This is more than just arithmetic. It is more \nthan numbers. It has to do with character. It has to do with our \nwillingness to face up to the realization that you cannot keep spending \nmore than you take in.\n\n  It has to do with debt. We now have a debt of $5.5 trillion, which we \nhave put on our credit card for young people to pay. Our card is maxed \nout. It has to do with interest payments. Probably, next year, the \nlargest item on the budget will be interest on the national debt--$270 \nbillion a year in interest.\n  It has to do with priorities in the Government. We have not had to \nchoose what we think is most important for Government. We have simply \nsaid, ``Let's do it and put it on the tab.'' That is not responsible \nfor any of us.\n  It has to do with smaller Government. There is a relationship between \nhow much money you spend and how much Government you have. I can tell \nyou, the folks in my State would like to have less central Government, \nless activity. It has to do with savings for families, if we can reduce \nthe interest payments on their cars and on their kid's college.\n  It is the right thing to do. I am proud of the 55 Republicans who \nwill vote ``aye'' and 11 Democrats who will join them to vote ``aye'' \non this issue. I am proud of the fact that Members of this institution \nhave talked the talk, and now are ready to walk the walk. That is \nimportant for us to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I now yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to pay tribute to our \nRepublican leadership in this great battle, this epic battle where we \ntry to achieve some financial stability for future generations, more \nespecially the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  There were some comments that were made by a scholar over 200 years \nago about the fall of the Greek Republic. It was prefaced by this \nstatement:\n\n       When historians look back upon great civilizations, they \n     invariably identify a time when society chose growth or \n     decay.\n\n  Such is the time today in this body. And this scholar said this about \nthe fall of the Greek Republic:\n\n       The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has \n     been 200 years. These nations have progressed through the \n     following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith, from \n     spiritual faith to great courage, from courage to liberty, \n     from liberty to abundance, from abundance to complacency, \n     from complacency to apathy, from apathy to dependency, from \n     dependency back again into bondage.\n\n  And then he made this prediction, which I think applies to the vote \nthat will be forthcoming:\n\n       A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. \n     It can only exist until the voters discover that they can \n     vote themselves largess from the Public Treasury. From that \n     moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates \n     promising the most benefits, with the result that a democracy \n     always collapses over a loose fiscal policy, always followed \n     by a dictatorship.\n\n  I think those are sobering thoughts. Can our American system meet the \nchallenges of future generations? We will have that vote this \nafternoon. The voters did not vote for a majority to continue down that \npath that was followed by the Greek Republic. That is why we need the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank and commend the able Senator \nfrom Utah for his outstanding leadership in this matter. Why do we need \na constitutional amendment? We have not balanced this budget but one \ntime in 36 years, eight times in 64 years. The Congress has failed to \nperform its duty. Therefore, we need a constitutional amendment that \nwill make the Congress balance its budget. That is the only way I know \nto do it. A constitutional amendment will demand--demand--that the \nCongress balance the budget.\n\n  Several years ago, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nauthored a similar amendment and got it\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nthrough the committee and passed it through the Senate and sent it to \nthe House. And who killed it? The Speaker of the House, Mr. O'Neill, \nand the Democratic leader of the House, Mr. Wright, led the movement to \nkill it. The Democrats don't seem to want it--certainly a majority of \nDemocrats.\n  There are some good Democrats, and I ask them to join us, pass this \nconstitutional amendment, and protect the people of the United States. \nWe cannot keep on going like this. We are going in debt, debt, debt. \nThe only way to stop it is to pass a constitutional amendment to make \nthe Congress balance the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I now yield 1 minute to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the constitutional amendment. I \nknow you have a hard time seeing me over the big stack of budgets which \nhave not been balanced. I support this amendment because I think \nCongress needs the discipline, the discipline itself to live within its \nmeans.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the city of Philadelphia, the Arlen \nSpecter household, all have to live within their means. If I don't, I \nend up in a bankruptcy court. Regrettably, the history of our \nGovernment has been that we have spent more than we have taken in and \nhave run up deficits, and that is why the discipline is necessary.\n  I think it is very useful to have the pendency of the balanced budget \namendment, which has led many to say, ``Well, we don't need the \namendment. We can balance the budget without the amendment.'' And if \nthat provides an incentive to balance the budget without the amendment, \nthat is all to the good.\n  But even if we do balance the budget, and, so far, the signs are not \nvery promising based upon what the President has submitted, it is fine. \nBut the discipline is necessary in the long run, and that is why I \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I now yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my voice to the \nchorus of support for adding a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  For a generation, this Government has spent billions more than it has \nreceived, all the while talking, always talking, about the urgent need \nto balance the Federal budget. History has borne out the facts: No \nmatter how well-intentioned the debate, Congress has failed for the \npast 28 years to balance the budget.\n  Since coming to the Senate 12 years ago, I have listened to those who \noppose a balanced budget tell the American people that all we need is \ncourage to get our fiscal house in order. Yet, year after year, \nCongress runs up billions upon billions on the public credit card that \nmust be paid for by future generations. What right do we have to ask \nour children and grandchildren to pay for today's excesses?\n  Mr. President, the time for talk has passed. Now is the time for \naction.\n  Like most Americans, I am outraged that interest on the debt has \nbecome the third largest item in the Federal budget. According to the \nPresident's budget for fiscal year 1998, the U.S. Government will spend \n$250 billion in net interest costs, which makes up nearly 15 percent of \nthe total budget. That means, we spend four times more on interest than \nwe do on education, training, and employment combined. We spend 10 \ntimes more on interest than we spend on the administration of justice.\n  We are the greatest Nation on earth, and yet we spend more retiring \ndebt than we do on educating our children? This is madness and it must \nstop.\n  Mr. President, it does not have to be this bad. If we pass a balanced \nbudget we can give families relief by reducing interest rates on \nborrowing for items like home mortgages and school loans. A typical \nfamily would save $1,500 per year in interest payments. Think of how \nthat money could be put to better use: saving for a college education, \ninvesting in a secure retirement, or maybe enjoying a long anticipated \nvacation.\n  Sadly, the path to a balanced budget is now being blocked by \ndetermined and enthusiastic partisan gamesmanship. Opponents of a \nbalanced budget have decided to play on the fears of seniors. In words \nwhich recall last year's shameless mediscare campaign, the balanced \nbudget amendment is attacked and misrepresented--all while the national \ndebt whirs wildly out of control.\n  Mr. President, I will spend exactly one sentence answering this \nSocial Security red herring. The best way to ensure the solvency of the \nSocial Security Program is to balance the budget now. Clever \nlegislative shell games will not add a single day to the life of Social \nSecurity, only a balanced budget will do that.\n  So the decision is ours. Do we want to balance the budget or not. And \nif not now, when? Our children want to know.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the American people are rightfully skeptical that this \nCongress will balance the budget, not only in 7 years but for every \nyear thereafter. Why are they skeptical? For a generation, for a \ngeneration we have failed our children and grandchildren by piling up a \nmountain of debt to the tune of over $5 trillion. So the American \npeople are saying, ``If you need some assistance in doing the job, why \ndon't you mandate--so that you have no discretion--mandate that we have \na balanced budget in the future?'' It is the only way to protect our \ncountry. It is the only way to have a country fit to live in for our \nchildren and their children.\n  We all know what has happened. The debt is the third largest item in \nthe Federal budget. We are spending more on retiring the debt than we \nare on educating our children. It is time to call it to a halt, to get \nour fiscal affairs in order.\n  Mr. President, a constitutional amendment to require us to do the job \neach year, for the future, is the only way to achieve this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, when the Federal Government spends more \nthan it collects in tax revenue, then it must borrow the difference. \nAnd when it keeps borrowing, that adds to the debt.\n  When we have run up, as we currently have, a $5 trillion national \ndebt, what we are really saying is that is a bill we are passing on to \nour children and our grandchildren to pay. Currently, for a family of \nfour, the national debt amounts to $80,000, namely $20,000 for every \nindividual in that family, all four individuals.\n  As has been mentioned, the interest on the debt is now the third \nlargest item in the Federal budget. This means that money we are \nspending on interest on the debt is not available for Head Start or \nhealth care or better education or improving our parks or all the \nthings we want.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment, balanced budget amendment, which \nwe are voting on will not solve all our problems, but it will be a big \nstep forward, and I hope it passes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMaine for yielding. I take this opportunity to thank Senator Hatch for \nhis tremendous leadership, day after day, on the floor of the Senate, \nleading the battle on behalf of the American people and for the future \ngenerations of America who are going to have to pay the price if we \ndon't get this done. If we lose this vote today by one vote, which is \nwhat the predictions are, and projections, then the headline tomorrow \nshould be: ``It Was Business as Usual in Washington Again. The American \nPeople Lost.''\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of the American people want the budget \nbalanced. If you think, in 1969, the last\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\ntime we had a balanced budget, the year after that the debt was $369 \nbillion, and the people said then, ``We don't need an amendment, all we \nneed to do is get the job done, have the courage to do it.'' The debt \nis now $5.3 trillion.\n  The President says we do not need an amendment; we just have to have \nthe courage to do it. He submits a budget to us out of balance which \nwill add half a trillion dollars to the debt in the next 5 years, $70 \nbillion out of balance in the last year. It is business as usual in \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I now yield to the junior Senator from \nMaine for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to urge Senate approval of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. Some have argued that a \nconstitutional amendment is not needed to ensure a balanced budget, but \nhistory clearly demonstrates that, despite good intentions, we will not \nget the job done absent the constitutional requirement.\n  Every President during the past two decades has pledged to balance \nthe budget. In 1970, President Nixon said that he would recommend a \nbalanced budget by 1971. President Ford pledged to achieve a balanced \nbudget in 1976. In 1978, President Carter pledged to move rapidly \ntoward a balanced budget. In 1983, President Reagan talked of achieving \na balanced budget by the end of the decade. The list goes on and on.\n  The simple fact is that the road to our huge national debt has been \npaved with good intentions. The old saying that ``we have met the enemy \nand it is us'' has never been more applicable.\n  I know the pressures on Washington to spend money, even borrowed \nmoney. By and large, each Congress sets out to be fiscally responsible, \nbut our national debt still grows. The truth is that experience has \ntaught us that even in good times, we need the discipline of a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I now yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma very \nmuch. Let me say to all the Senators on our side who are here, I am \nvery proud to be here with you, and I am exceptionally proud that every \nsingle Republican Senator is going to vote for this constitutional \namendment. I think the American people ought to make note of that.\n  I also call to your attention, in case you wonder why we are losing \nthis amendment today--if we do--that 72 sitting Senators, 72 out of the \n100 who sit, have voted for this constitutional amendment, or one just \nlike it. Now, isn't it intriguing that at one time or another, 72 could \nvote for it, but today only 66 will find their way clear to vote for \nit?\n  It seems to me games are being played with the American people, \nwithout any question. If 72 voted for it before, I say to Senator \nCochran, how come only 66 today? Are we better off? Are we more apt to \nget a real balanced budget today? Has our President sent us some budget \nthat should renew our faith and our hope that we will do it ourselves?\n  The budget the President sent us starts with a deficit of $106 \nbillion, and our accounting department tells us, when we are finished \nwith 5 years of cuts under his budget, the deficit is still $70 \nbillion. What a dramatic budget. It should renew our hope and our faith \nthat we can do it and that Presidents can lead us, right? Wrong. It \nmeans that we ought to have a constitutional amendment, there is no \nquestion about it. We won't do it.\n  For a nation that was born in tax revolutions where we said, ``No \ntaxation without representation,'' I close this debate by saying, why \nshould we tie the hands of our children and leave them a legacy of debt \nwhen they cannot be represented because we refuse to pay our own bills? \nThat is why we need a constitutional amendment. We should not burden \nour children with a legacy that says no prosperity, no growth, a life \nof taxation to pay our bills, because 72 Senators heretofore have voted \nfor a constitutional amendment like this.\n  But games are being played so that today, it will lose, once again.\n  I close with, isn't it a curious turn of events that it loses by one \nvote each time? Perhaps those watching this debate might wonder, how \ndoes that happen? Well, I tell you how it happens. Members of the \nSenate on that side of the aisle tell their voters one thing, and when \nit gets right down to voting, either a President or their own leaders \ntalk just enough of them out of it to make us lose by one vote. We \nought to be proud we are not on that team.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I now yield 2 minutes to the senior \nSenator from Florida, Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I want to express my disappointment that \nwe are apparently on a path which will lead to yet another defeat of a \nbalanced budget amendment. This could be seen as a lack of commitment \nto balance the budget.\n  My hope is that it will be seen instead as a message that a \nsignificant minority in Congress does not think a balanced budget \namendment is necessary to achieve a balanced budget.\n  That without the discipline of a balanced budget amendment, the \nPresident and Congress will redouble our efforts to get to balance in \n2002 and to remain in balance in future years.\n  I agree with critics who say we can balance the budget by 2002 \nwithout a constitutional amendment. That same statement could have been \nmade at virtually any time since our last balanced budget in 1969. We \nhave not done so.\n  CBO projections indicate that without changes in our current budget \npolicies, the deficit will rise to $280 billion by 2007, nearly \nreaching the levels we experienced during the late 1980's and early \n1990's.\n  The President's budget as submitted for the next 5 years and analyzed \nby CBO, projects that the deficit will jump from our 1996 level of $107 \nbillion to $145 billion in 1998. The deficit will stay near that level \nuntil 2001.\n  This trend line is not a reassuring trumpet blast of commitment to a \nbalanced budget. I hope that my colleagues are correct in saying we can \nkeep the budget balanced without a constitutional amendment.\n  We are about to be put to the test.\n  Most States have a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget.\n  As Governor, I operated under a balanced budget. I can say with \nexperience that it has served my State well. It would also serve our \nNation well.\n  There are numerous State legislatures asking that we in Congress \nsubmit a balanced budget amendment to them.\n  In the short time that State legislatures have been in session this \nyear, 4 have passed resolutions asking Congress to approve a balanced \nbudget amendment; another 21 States have introduced resolutions asking \nfor a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  We owe the States an opportunity to decide whether we should amend \nthe constitution to put an end to the growing Federal debt that this \ncountry has been building.\n  And although we have made tremendous progress over the past 4 years, \nwe still have a large and expanding annual deficit.\n  Our national debt is expected to reach $5.4 trillion at the end of \nthis fiscal year.\n  One concern that many of my colleagues have expressed is their \nconcern for how Social Security would fare under a balanced budget \namendment.\n  My personal feeling is that establishing the principal of a balanced \nbudget during normal periods, such as most of the years since 1982, \nwould strengthen the Social Security system.\n  If we had passed a balanced budget amendment in 1982, the first year \nin recent history that one was considered and defeated, we would have \n$2.9 trillion less in debt held by the public than we do today.\n  The interest on this portion of the Federal debt alone totaled $190 \nbillion in 1996. Last year, that amount was more than enough to pay for \nall Medicare expenses. Instead this money was dissipated on interest \npayments.\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\n  That same $190 billion in interest payments on the additional debt \naccrued since 1982 could have paid for over half of all the money the \nFederal Government spent last year on Social Security retirement \nbenefits.\n  Let us look at Social Security from another angle--in 1982 the total \ninterest on the Federal debt was $85 billion. In that year, all Social \nSecurity benefits were $156 billion.\n  The interest payment equaled about half of the Social Security \nbenefits for that year.\n  In 1996, the total interest in the Federal debt was $241 billion and \nSocial Security retirement benefits were $350 billion.\n  The interest payment in 1996 equaled about three-quarters of the \nentire outlay for Social Security retirement benefits.\n  Yearly interest payments are growing faster than yearly Social \nSecurity payments. This trend is not good and we must put an end to it \nnow.\n  Passing the balanced budget amendment now is critical to the future \nhealth of our Social Security system.\n  Let me ask you--would our country be better off spending tax dollars \nto service the Federal debt or for needed programs like Social \nSecurity?\n  I believe the money would be better spent on Social Security.\n  The budget deficit has become a permanent fixture in our Nation's \nfiscal policy.\n  While there are those who say Congress can, without a constitutional \namendment, balance the budget, history has shown this not to be the \ncase.\n  A disturbing example of the lack of resolve to balance the budget \noccurred last Thursday evening when we extended the aviation tax to \nSeptember 30--ignoring losses of $5 billion in Federal revenue for the \naviation trust fund because of lapses in the aviation tax during 10 of \nthe last 14 months.\n  Five billion dollars lost for American aviation safety.\n  We extended the tax to September 30 knowing that a report on whether \nthe current tax should be replaced by a user fee system is not due to \nCongress until October 1997.\n  We voted to terminate the ticket tax on September 30, raising the \nstrong possibility of another lapse at the end of this fiscal year with \nthe excuse that we should wait for the report. Why did we do this?\n  We did it for budget scoring purposes.\n  By allowing the tax to expire on September 30 before reinstating it, \nour Budget rules will claim to create almost $6 billion in ``new'' \nrevenue every year after September 30, 1997, for a total of over $30 \nbillion between then and September 30, 2002.\n  It is for this kind of creative accounting that we send people to \njail in the private sector.\n  Some 40 percent of the revenue increases in the President's budget \nfrom 1997 to 2002 come from this scoring gimmick.\n  The President and the Congress must be strong in their resolve to \nachieve balance through tough decisions rather than through creating \nfictional new revenue or spending cuts.\n  This archaic and destructive maneuver is exactly what undercuts \npublic confidence in our ability to balance the budget with real \nnumbers and rational policies.\n  With failures like this in mind, and after witnessing numerous \nattempts by Congress to enact legislation to force itself to tighten \nits fiscal belt, my conclusion is that we must pass an amendment to \nconstitutionally mandate a balanced budget. It is imperative that we \nnot lose this opportunity.\n  Madam President, the failure to pass a balanced budget amendment \ntoday would be a grave mistake.\n  For too many years we have delayed the hard decision until tomorrow.\n  Well, Madam President, tomorrow has come. It is our generation's duty \nto ensure that we pay our national bills rather than asking our \nchildren and grandchildren to do so.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nvaliant fight on his side of the aisle to help make this a reality. We \nreally appreciate him and honor him today.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, first, I commend the distinguished \nSenator from Utah for his great leadership on the floor of the Senate \nin support of this resolution to require a balanced budget.\n  Let me just say, we have heard Senators come to the floor and point \nout that this puts in jeopardy the Social Security beneficiaries of \nAmerica. We have heard others claim that this amendment forces us to \nconsider investments in capital spending the same as operating \nexpenses, as a matter of budget policy. We have heard one thing after \nanother used as excuses for voting against this resolution.\n  But let me say, I am for protecting Social Security beneficiaries. I \nam for doing whatever we need to do to help ensure that those who \ndepend on Social Security can be confident that they are going to get \nthe benefits to which they are entitled, whether this resolution passes \nor not. And for budget policy, you just have to look at the plain \nlanguage of this resolution. It says:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  We are not giving away the power to decide budget policy and \nmechanics and whether you have a capital budget or another kind of a \nbudget. The point is, this is national policy, if this passes, that we \nwill live within our means. It is just as simple as that and just as \nnonscary as that.\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I call on the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, my friend and colleague from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I believe we need to have this balanced \nbudget amendment adopted by the Senate. As I see what is happening now \nin terms of the controllable expenditures of the United States, I see \nthat next year we will spend about as much money for interest on the \nnational debt as we will to maintain our defenses.\n  There is pressure on us across the whole spectrum for control of \nexpenses. We need a Coast Guard. We need the National Park Service. We \nneed the FBI. Think of all of the controllable expenses in the \ndepartments that we fund. Every year we have to say cut more, cut more. \nWhy? Because the interest continues to mount on the national debt, \nuntil we get it in balance.\n  So, if for no other reason than that, I believe the Senate should \npass this amendment so that we can get a handle on the interest we must \npay on the national debt. It continues to go up because the deficit \ncontinues to go up. That must be controlled, Madam President. I am \nproud to join my friend, Judiciary Chairman Hatch of Utah, in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  I want to thank my colleague, the Senator from Utah, for his \noutstanding leadership on this issue. He has brought to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate the budgets from 28 years of unbalanced budgets. They \nrepresent about, oh, I would say, close to 8 or 9 feet of a stack of \npapers that has really impaired the capacity of this Nation to move \nforward.\n  But I would like to mention another problem with that barricade of \npaper. Whenever you can just displace the cost of doing government to \nthe next generation, you are not forced to make the innovations and \nimprovements that you need to make.\n  Most of us have noted that, in the recent years, the most dynamic and \nworkable solutions to our problems have come from the States. It is \nbecause they operate with balanced budgets. They cannot just spend \nmoney they do not have and pass the bill to the next generation.\n  Necessity being the mother of invention, the discipline of a balanced \nbudget improves the quality of Government we get. It not only makes \nsure that we have liberties which would otherwise\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\nbe forfeited if we grow bigger and bigger Government, but it also \nimproves the quality of what Government does by saying we have to \nconstantly look at what we are doing. We have to innovate and create \ninstead of appropriate just to get better service with limited \nresources.\n  So the quality of our life now, the quality of Government we receive, \nand the integrity of the next generation is at stake. We must pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution to add discipline to our \nsystem which would drive creativity and improvement in what we do.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Madam President, what message does it send to the American people \nwhen we vote ``no'' on the balanced budget amendment?\n  First, it says that Congress prefers its own judgment over the \njudgment of the people. This is not a vote to enact the balanced budget \namendment. This is a vote to send it to the people to see if they want \na balanced budget amendment. Why should we put our judgment ahead of \nthe people?\n  Second, it is an exercise in political power that says that political \npower is more important than the desires of the people. Clearly, 80 \npercent of the American people have said they want fiscal \nresponsibility and believe it can only be achieved through a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Third, it continues a system that allows us to vote public benefits \nto the very people who keep us in office while placing the burden of \npaying for those benefits on people who cannot vote for us. Therefore, \nit gives us the natural inclination to vote for those benefits and pass \non the obligations to people in the future.\n  Finally, we avoid the moral tradition of sacrificing for posterity. \nInstead, we ask posterity to sacrifice for us. That is wrong.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in the last hour we have had 37 Senators \nfor the balanced budget amendment who have spoken here on the floor. I \nthink that sends about as powerful a message as we can. But I would \nlike to end with our remaining time going to the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee who deals with these matters all the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my good friend from Utah for yielding the \nwrapup minutes to me.\n  Frequently we use a word to describe what we are all for--that is \n``freedom.'' I would like to suggest that the constitutional amendment \nis about freedom, because to the extent that Government grows and \ngrows, freedom diminishes and diminishes. To the extent we tax and tax, \nthe freedom of our people diminishes.\n  It has been said that all significant achievement occurs because a \nman or a woman is free. That is why America is so great. That is why we \nhave achieved so much.\n  So it seems to me that today we have a very historic vote. I honestly \nbelieve those who have twisted the last arm and got this where we will \nlose by one vote once again are those who are frightened about the \nconcept of less Government rather than more. They are the ones who want \nmore Government rather than less or at least they want the opportunity \nto have more Government rather than less. For they see Government as \nthe achiever rather than individuals who maintain more of their freedom \nif they are taxed less and if Government is smaller.\n  So to me, it is a very interesting philosophical debate. Those who \nwill vote for it say we trust--we trust--people, we trust families, we \ntrust States, we trust individuals, and we trust decisionmakers at the \nhome level. The others are saying, we are not sure of that. We want to \nreserve the option to continue to incur debt and let Government grow \nand grow. I believe it is clear. I wish we would win today. I am sorry \nwe will not. I think I understand why. I hope the American people do. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There now will be 30 minutes under the control \nof the Democratic leader or his designee.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished \nminority leader.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Michael \nCarrasco, of the Judiciary Committee staff, be permitted privileges of \nthe floor during the duration of the debate on Senate Joint Resolution \n1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to begin by complimenting the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, for his extraordinary leadership on this debate over the \nlast several weeks. His effort on the floor is appreciated by all of \nthe Members of our caucus. While I am not surprised at his \ndemonstration of leadership and his work on this legislation, as he has \ndemonstrated on so many occasions, we are deeply indebted to him.\n  I must also express my gratitude to the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, and Senator Dorgan, Senator Reid, and many \nothers who have done so much to represent our concerns time and time \nagain over the course of the last 4 weeks of debate on this particular \nissue.\n  I had hoped, Madam President, that the next time Congress voted on a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, I could support it. \nInstead, we are faced with the same deeply flawed amendment that was \nrejected last year.\n  This did not have to be. We had scores of opportunities to fix it, to \nprotect Social Security, to provide for the possibility of a capital \nbudget, to build into this amendment the flexibility to protect our \nNation in times of war, disaster, or regional or national economic \nemergency. But every one of those opportunities--every one--was \nrejected along party lines. I have been astonished during the debate to \nhear some of my colleagues say they will vote for this amendment even \nthough, in their words, it is not perfect.\n  In fact, one of my colleagues came up to me recently to say, ``We \nshouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good when we legislate.'' \nWell, that is often true in other matters. But when it comes to the \nConstitution of the United States of America, Madam President, we \nshould demand perfection. This is not a campaign position paper we are \ntalking about changing. It is the most inspired, the most important \npolitical document in the history of this country.\n  People have died to defend our Constitution. Every Senator here has \ntaken an oath to protect it. We may rarely achieve perfection. After \nall, we are human. But when we are dealing with the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America, we should never knowingly settle for anything \nless--not now, not ever. No, this amendment is far from perfect. Under \nthis amendment, we now know that Congress would be required--not just \npermitted, but required--to raid the Social Security trust funds to run \nthe Government. That isn't my opinion; that is the conclusion of the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the Office of Management \nand Budget.\n\n  Social Security is now running huge surpluses because of the 1983 \nbipartisan agreement that rescued the program. We all look back with a \ngreat deal of satisfaction at that particular vote and the actions \ntaken, on a bipartisan basis, by the Congress at that time. The heart \nof that agreement was a plan to set aside funds for the baby boomers' \nretirement that we know are going to be needed. This year, that surplus \nis $78 billion. By the year 2002, it will reach $104 billion. By 2019, \nwhen many of the baby boomers start to retire, the Social Security \ntrust funds will have built up a $3 trillion surplus, which will be \ndesperately needed to pay those retirees, including this Senator.\n  But if we pass this version of the balanced budget amendment, none of \nthose funds will be available to pay those Social Security benefits--\nnot $1. Social Security could be paid only\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\nfrom taxes raised in the same year, not from surpluses built up years \nbefore. That means when the baby boomers retire, Congress would have to \nraise taxes dramatically or slash Social Security benefits deeply, or \nboth, to accommodate the circumstances that we will be facing at that \ntime.\n  Madam President, this isn't conjecture; this is the analysis given to \nus by virtually every credible budgetary source to whom we have gone \nfor counsel and advice on this important matter. So what was our \nresponse? Well, our response was to offer amendments to resolve that \nproblem. Our amendments said if we are going to build up that trust \nfund to $3 trillion and know full well that we are going to have to \ndraw down that trust fund at some point in the future, let's take every \nprecaution to ensure that it will be there. We offered amendments to \nprotect it.\n  Now, our Republican colleagues defeated every single amendment as it \nwas brought up in committee and on the floor. Again, our Republican \ncolleagues argued that this is not something we should really worry \nabout. Misusing the Social Security trust funds to pay for other \nGovernment programs is not just bad accounting, it's bad faith. \nCombining the Social Security trust funds with the rest of the budget \ndoesn't pay off the deficit; it just masks its size. It allows us to \nclaim that the budget is balanced when we know really it isn't. When \nthey claim we have a balanced budget in the year 2002, we are going to \nincrease our debt by $130 billion.\n  Madam President, this isn't the way we ought to legislate. This isn't \nsimply a question of making perfect the amendment. It becomes clear \nthat this amendment is not perfect in any fundamental way when one \nanalyzes how it would work.\n  In my view, this amendment, as it is presented right now, is \nduplicitous. Social Security has never been a day late or a dollar \nshort. It is the most successful social program in the history of our \ncountry. For millions of older Americans, it is the difference between \nliving in dignity and living in fear and poverty. A balanced budget \namendment should not force us to break that historic contract. It \nshould be honest in how it accounts for and uses the Social Security \ntrust funds.\n  While misuse of the Social Security trust funds is my gravest \nconcern, I am also deeply troubled that this amendment would limit, for \nall perpetuity, how Congress can treat large-scale capital investments. \nLet there be no misunderstanding here. If this amendment passes, any \nproposal to create a capital budget would be declared unconstitutional. \nIf a project could not be paid for in one year, it could not be \nundertaken. Capital investments, such as roads, bridges, and water \nprojects strengthen our economy for the future. It seems to me that it \nwould be profoundly unwise for us to pass an amendment that forbids \neven consideration of a capital budget. It would threaten the very \neconomic competitiveness that we all say we desire. Again, we offered \namendments to correct this flaw, to allow for the possibility of a \ncapital budget, and, again, they were defeated--every single one along \nparty lines--in committee and on the floor.\n\n  The majority leader suggested a willingness to provide for a capital \nbudget, only after it was clear that he didn't have the votes without \nit. While I welcome such sudden openness, we have not yet seen any \nsolid proposals from the other side in this regard.\n  Madam President, I just ask the question: If virtually every State \nrecognizes the importance of distinguishing between a capital budget, \nlong-term investments, and operating costs, why is it that we don't see \nthe need to do so as well? If every family and every business were \nrequired to pay off every mortgage and investment every year, I \nquestion whether any of them could sustain that kind of requirement or \nthat kind of an economic procedure. Yet, that is exactly what we are \nsuggesting must be our course of action, for all perpetuity, for the \nFederal Government. We can't even consider the possibility of a capital \nbudget under the amendment as it is drafted right now.\n  Another serious flaw with this amendment has to do with our national \nsecurity. Section 5 of this amendment jeopardizes our ability to \nprepare for situations that we know will require intervention, such as \nin the Persian Gulf. For Congress to waive this amendment, the United \nStates ``must be engaged in military conflict.'' Let me restate that. \nFor us to be eligible for the exception under this constitutional \namendment, we already have to be fighting a war in order to tap \nresources that may be required to fight that effort. In Desert Shield, \nwe needed to build up before the conflict. We stipulated that the \nconflict was imminent. As a result, we were able to be prepared when \nthe conflict came in Desert Storm. To say that there has to be a \nconflict before we can provide legislative support, in my view, is \nextraordinarily poorly worded and ill-founded.\n  None of us, today, would want to look the men and the women we sent \nto the Persian Gulf in the eye and say that we want you to go fight \nfirst, and we will support you later. We want you to go put your lives \non the line and, at some point after you start fighting, we will get \naround to providing you with the necessary resources.\n  Madam President, that is exactly what this amendment says. I hope \nthat everybody will think very carefully about whether or not we want \nto commit to section 5 of this constitutional amendment. No, this \namendment isn't perfect, and it is not as good as it could have been, \nand it is clearly not good enough to include in the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America. So I, with many of my colleagues, am left \nwith the inescapable conclusion that we must vote against it.\n  At the same time, I think it is imperative that we redouble our \nefforts to actually balance the budget, rather than just talk about it. \nMadam President, in the last couple of days, I have been dismayed at \nsome of the remarks made by some on the other side with regard to the \nbudget process. I thought we had an understanding that we were going to \nwork toward a budget agreement that would allow us to meet our \ndeadlines by April 15.\n  Instead, now we are playing politics on the other side with a budget \nagreement, telling the President to come forth with a second budget \nagreement, prior to the time those who are complaining have even come \nwith a first one.\n  I hope we can quit playing political games with the budget process \nand get in that room and do what we are supposed to do in the Budget \nCommittee to balance the budget. Let's start working through this \nbudget process tomorrow. Let's start meeting the deadlines set into \nlaw. The committee hasn't met in 2 weeks. I think it is high time to \ndemonstrate some real leadership here. When it comes to the budget \nprocess, that ought to start with a date certain for a markup on the \nbudget itself.\n\n  We have come a long way. We have a record now that we can look back \non with some pride, having reduced the deficit from $290 billion in \n1993 to $107 billion this year. We need to go the rest of the way, and \nwe can do so only if we continue to reduce spending as successfully and \naggressively in the next 5 years as we have in the recent past.\n  I am troubled, frankly, not only with the fact that we have not seen \nany proposal on the part of Republican Members with regard to a budget \nitself, but by the tax proposal being proposed now by the majority \nleader. It would create a deficit of over $1 trillion in the next 20 \nyears to pay for new tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefit those who \ndon't need them at all. If these new tax breaks were to pass, they \nwould cost $500 billion over the first 10 years and $750 billion over \nthe next 10 years, at a time when we ought to be reducing the deficit, \nreducing the debt, and coming together in a bipartisan way to resolve \nour differences.\n  It must be difficult for South Dakotans to understand how some of \nthose who argue that we need to pass a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget can turn around and offer tax breaks that add more \nthan $1 trillion to the deficit.\n  I might remind my colleagues that, even if we balance the budget, we \nhave a $5.5 trillion accumulated debt that we have not yet paid down. \nEliminating the deficit is only the first step. We still have the debt. \nIf Senators continue to complicate our situation by offering tax \nmeasures that contribute massively to the deficit we are facing\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nover the next few years, it is hard to believe that they are really \nserious about fiscal responsibility.\n  My expectation today is that this amendment will fail. But if I am \nwrong, if somehow it passes, then I am confident that it will fail when \nit is sent to the States for ratification. As Americans learn more \nabout the consequences of this ill-considered proposal, I hope that \nCongress will ultimately resolve to work through the many deficiencies \nin this amendment, and correct it in ways that we have suggested time \nand again on the Senate floor.\n  David Ramsey was a member of the Continental Congress that adopted \nour Declaration of Independence. He said, ``The adoption of the \nConstitution was a triumph of virtue and good sense over the vices and \nfollies of human nature.''\n  It was, in fact, that rarest of events, the triumph of the perfect \nover merely the good. For 208 years, Congress has defended that triumph \nof the perfect over the good when it comes to the Constitution. It is \nour solemn responsibility now to uphold that standard.\n  When it comes to the Constitution, we should settle for nothing less \nthan perfection.\n  Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  Madam President, for those who want to know where this Constitution \nwas written, it was written in a small room in Constitutional Hall \ncalled the Assembly Room. Fifty-five white men wrote the Constitution \nover 200 years ago. George Washington's chair is still at the front of \nthe room because he presided over the writing of the Constitution. His \nchair is still there if you want to go see where George Washington sat \nas they drafted the framework for our form of government. George \nWashington was the fellow who was reported to have said, ``I cannot \ntell a lie'' about cutting down the cherry tree.\n  I was thinking about his chair when I saw it in this room, and about \nthe cherry tree, and lies, and about political wafflers when we get \ninvolved in a discussion of this type. This is a very, very important \ndiscussion.\n  In the debate in the last couple of hours, one would think it is \nabout balancing the budget. It is not that. It is about altering the \nConstitution of the United States. It is now 4:32. If, by some magic, \nwe could by 4:35 amend the Constitution just like that, at 5 o'clock \nnothing would have changed with respect to this Government's deficit or \ndebt.\n  This is about altering the Constitution. The question is, shall we do \nit? And, if so, how shall we do it?\n  We voted on a constitutional amendment last week to balance the \nFederal budget. I offered it. It got 41 votes. Almost all--except two--\non that side of the aisle voted against it. Had they voted for it, we \nwould have had a constitutional amendment to balance the budget passed \nby this Chamber. It was identical to the one they offered, with one \nexception: It said you can't count the over $1 trillion in Social \nSecurity trust funds to pretend you have balanced the budget.\n  Based on all the crowing that I hear, one would think, if a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget is passed, the budget \nwill be balanced. Of course, that is not the case. The budget will be \nbalanced when you make individual spending and taxing decisions to \nbalance the budget.\n\n  In 1993, I cast a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate for a deficit \nreduction package. It was a hard vote. The politically easy vote was to \nsay, ``I am gone. I am on vacation. Count me as no because I do not \nwant the baggage that comes with having to vote to reduce the budget \ndeficit.''\n  We passed that by one vote. And we didn't get one vote from that side \nof the aisle--not a bit of help, not a bit of help from the people who \nnow stand on this floor and crow about how much they want to balance \nthe Federal budget. And the budget deficit came down 60 percent.\n  We paid an enormous price for casting that vote. It was a price I was \nwilling to pay. I am glad I cast the vote. And that is the way you \nreduce the budget deficit.\n  How do you eliminate the budget deficit? Well, amending the \nConstitution, if you do it the right way, will help. And I am willing \nto do that. We had a vote on it last week. I offered the substitute \nthat would have amended the Constitution the right way. But I refused \nto alter the Constitution in a way that will allow the Federal debt to \nkeep increasing when they say it is in balance.\n  I have asked repeatedly, and there is no answer to it, why do the \nmanagers of this constitutional amendment pretend to the American \npeople that if they pass it and then pass a budget that accomplishes \nit--when they pass this budget and then claim the budget is in \nbalance--why will the Federal debt keep increasing? Why, in the very \nyear that they claim the budget is in balance, will they be required to \nincrease the Federal debt limit by $130 billion, in that year alone? \nWhy? Why, if the budget is balanced, will the Federal debt keep \nincreasing?\n  I have asked that a dozen times, and no one has answered it. Why has \nno one answered it? Because it is a fiction. This constitutional \namendment, the way it is crafted, is a fiction. It misuses over $1 \ntrillion in Social Security trust funds to pretend they are balancing \nthe budget, and, in fact, it is not balanced. In fact, the Federal debt \nwill keep increasing. That is why they can't answer the question.\n  It is one more chapter in a book of fiction. But this is a chapter of \nfiction that they intend to put in the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  In North Dakota they want a balanced budget. I have voted for \nbalanced budgets. But in North Dakota they understand the virtue of, if \nyou are going to do something, doing it the right way. There is the \nright way and the wrong way. The proposal here is the wrong way.\n  This is a country that seems obsessed sometimes with instant \ngratification and quick fixes.\n  Madam President, I ask for 30 more seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is a mentality that would have us believe sometimes \nthat instant gratification is paramount--quick fixes, fast foods, \nMinute Rice, instant coffee, instant pudding, Jiffy Lube. Hook the \nbudget to the Constitution and pretend you have balanced the budget, \nbut have the Federal debt keep increasing. It fits right in with the \nwhole genre of quick and easy fix--no trouble at all.\n  The American people know better. There is the right way to do things \nand the honest way to do things. Yes, we ought to balance the budget. \nAnd when we have taxing and spending decisions on the floor of the \nSenate to do that, join us and help us to it.\n  I am amazed that those who come here speaking the loudest about this \nissue will come on one of the largest spending bills that will come \nbefore this body, the defense appropriations bill, and say, ``No, we \nare not spending enough. We want to add $10 billion more, and we insist \nthat you spend it.''\n\n  I am amazed that those who come to this floor and talk about \nbalancing the budget are also the ones who come and say, ``And, by the \nway, we want $500 billion in tax breaks.'' They propose plans \nsuggesting $30,000-a-year tax breaks for those that have $250,000 a \nyear in income. Why? I guess they think we can afford it. Do you know \nthat every dollar of tax break will be borrowed and will add to the \nFederal debt in that plan? These are the people who are now suggesting \nwe alter the Constitution the wrong way in order to pretend that we \nhave balanced the budget.\n  Madam President, we ought to balance the budget. Yes. Last week I \neven offered a constitutional amendment to do so drafted the right way, \ndrafted in a way that it will not misuse the Social Security trust \nfunds. But we ought not, no matter what the price--any of us--ought not \nstand up and say, ``Well, it doesn't matter. We are just amending the \nConstitution of the United States. It may not be perfect. Yes, it may \ncause some problems for Social Security. But let's do it anyway.''\n  The 55 people who wrote the Constitution of the United States \nprovided for a way that it might be amended. But they always assumed, I \nsuspect, that we would do the very best we\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\ncould to make sure this document is perfect, or is as near perfect a \ndocument for the governance of this country as is possible.\n  This is the greatest democracy on the face of this Earth. I get a \nlittle tired of people talking about how awful this place is. Most \npeople around the globe want to come here because they understand the \ntorch for freedom and the beacon of hope in this country still burn \nbrightly for all the rest of the world. It is a remarkable place. And \nwhen we alter the Constitution--and I am prepared to do so--let us make \ncertain we do it the right way.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from South Dakota yielding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nranking member, the senior Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to thank the distinguished Democratic leader for \nyielding me a few minutes of time as we finish up the debate on this \nimportant constitutional question.\n\n  By our Senate oath of office we each commit to ``support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States.'' That is our paramount duty and \na responsibility that I certainly cherish in this opportunity to \nrepresent the people of Vermont here today.\n  A constitutional amendment on the budget poses dangers to Vermont and \nthreatens the constitutional principles that have sustained our \ndemocratic form of Federal Government over the past 200 years. \nSeparation of powers, checks and balances, and majority rule are not \nconstitutional guarantees to be altered without serious deliberation.\n  The real question this year is not whether to reduce the deficit, but \nby how much and what cuts to make in order to bring the budget into \nbalance. That is the hard work that lies before us.\n  As President Clinton declared in his State of the Union Addresses: \nAll we need to balance the budget is for Congress to pass a bill and \nfor his signature. We do not need to change the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  The time and resources devoted to reconsidering a constitutional \namendment on the budget merely serve as a distraction from the real \ntask at hand. Let us not be distracted, again, from the true means to \ndeficit reduction: Hard work, hard choices, and bipartisan cooperation \nwith the President.\n  Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us \nreach the level of deficit reduction that has been achieved over the \npast 4 years. We cannot legislate political courage. We must summon \nthat ingredient from ourselves.\n  In addition to being unnecessary, there are six key reasons why \nadoption of this proposed 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nwould, in the words of Treasury Secretary Rubin, ``be a terrible, \nterrible mistake.''\n\n\n                          risks to the economy\n\n  First, this amendment could be economically ruinous.\n  During recessions, deficits rise because tax receipts decline while \nvarious Government payments, like unemployment insurance, increase. By \ncontrast, the amendment would require disastrous raises in taxes or \ncuts in countercyclical spending during a recession or depression.\n  As Treasury Secretary Rubin testified: ``a balanced budget amendment \ncould turn slowdowns into recessions, and recessions into more severe \nrecessions or even depressions.''\n  Our economic policy--especially as we attempt to compete and adjust \nin an increasingly global economy--must be flexible enough to allow \neach generation of Americans and each Congress and President to deal \nwith changing economic conditions as they see fit in serving the best \ninterests of the Nation and our citizens. Yet, this proposal would \nimpose an inflexible prescription on all future generations of \nAmericans in perpetuity.\n\n\n       it increases the risks of government shutdown and default\n\n  Second, this constitutional amendment would vastly raise the stakes \nand risks to taxpayers and all citizens of a Government shutdown and \ndefault. We now have the experience of a year ago to gauge just how \ngreat these risks would be to our economy.\n  Under the supermajority requirements in the proposed amendment, a \nminority of Members, either from a particular region or sharing a \npolitical philosophy, could force the U.S. Government into default \nunless they got their way--just like a handful of House Members in 1995 \ntried to force President Clinton to accept their balanced budget plan \nby refusing to vote to raise the debt limit.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment would prevent the Treasury \nfrom taking the same measures it did during the 1995 budget crisis to \navoid a default. Without that flexibility, the Government also would be \nunable to ensure on-time Social Security checks or Medicare and \nveterans benefits.\n\n\n                 an invitation to constitutional crisis\n\n  Third, this proposed constitutional amendment risks seriously \nundercutting the protection of our constitutional separation of powers.\n  No one has yet convincingly explained how the proposed amendment will \nwork and what roles the President and the courts are to play in its \nimplementation and enforcement. Constitutionalizing the budget and \neconomic policy would inevitably throw the Nation's fiscal policy into \nthe courts, the last place issues of taxing and spending should be \ndecided under our system.\n  The effect could be to toss important issues of spending priorities \nand funding levels to the President or to thousands of lawyers, filing \nhundreds of lawsuits in dozens of Federal and State courts. If \napproved, the amendment would let Congress off the hook by kicking \nmassive responsibility for how tax dollars are spent to the President \nor to unelected judges.\n\n\n          it erodes the fundamental principle of majority rule\n\n  Fourth, this proposed constitutional amendment undermines the \nfundamental principle of majority rule by imposing a three-fifths \nsupermajority vote to adopt certain budgets and to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  Our founders rejected such supermajority voting requirements on \nmatters within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described \nsupermajority requirements as a ``poison'' that serves ``to destroy the \nenergy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or \nartifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the \nregular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.'' These \nsupermajority requirements are a recipe for increased gridlock, not \nmore efficient action.\n  The amendment's supermajority requirements would permit minority \nfactions to extort pork barrel projects or extreme legislation as their \nprice for avoiding a Government shutdown and default. Do we really want \nto allow 40 percent plus one of the Members in either the House or the \nSenate to hold the budget hostage to their demands?\n\n\n                         it is a pig in a poke\n\n  There is much truth to the axiom that the ``devil is in the \ndetails.'' This proposed constitutional amendment uses such general \nterms that even its sponsors and proponents concede that implementing \nlegislation will be necessary to clarify how it will work.\n  What will this implementing legislation say? We will not find out \nuntil we see this implementing legislation. The questions raised that \nstill lack satisfactory answers are many: What programs will be off-\nbudget? What role will the courts and the President have in executing \nand enforcing the amendment? What will be considered compliance with \nthe amendment? How much of a deficit may be financed and carried over \nto the next year? Many other questions still await answers going to \ncore matters that are critical to our understanding of what this \namendment means.\n  Congress should not be asked to amend the Constitution by signing \nwhat amounts to a blank check. Nor should any State be asked to ratify \na pig in a poke.\n  In the interests of fair disclosure, Congress should first determine \nthe substance of any implementing legislation, as it did in connection \nwith the 18th amendment, the other attempt to draft a substantive \nbehavioral policy in the Constitution.\n\n\n         it fails to protect basic commitments to our citizens\n\n  Sixth, this proposed constitutional amendment fails to live up to the \ncommitments we have made to our citizens. It uses the annual surplus in \nthe Social Security trust fund to mask the\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\ntrue size of the Federal budget deficit for years to come. This is \nwrong.\n  In addition to using the Social Security trust funds, this proposed \nconstitutional amendment could short-change our seniors who depend on \nMedicare, our veterans who depend on service benefits, and our children \nwho depend on nutrition programs. We have made commitments to our \nseniors, our veterans, and our children. But this amendment fails to \nhonor our commitments. This is unacceptable.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  We Vermonters pride ourselves on being able to apply Yankee common \nsense in sorting the sensible from the fanciful, and this proposed \nconstitutional amendment lacks common sense, Yankee or otherwise.\n  One of the newspapers in my State observed: ``Amending the \nConstitution to require a balanced Federal budget would be like using a \nsledgehammer to nail a picket in a fence. The picket might stand, but \nat great risk to the fence.''\n  Even the short span of 2 years since the last debate on this \namendment has brought forward changed fiscal and budget circumstances \nand new insights into the implications of amending the Constitution in \nthis way.\n  Let us not proceed with a view to short-run popularity, but with a \nclear vision of our responsibilities to our constituents and the Nation \nin accordance with our venerable and venerated Constitution.\n  Madam President, for the last 4 weeks, I have been saying over and \nover again to Senators, think about what we are doing. This country, \nwhich has a Constitution the envy of all other democracies on Earth, \nhas amended that Constitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. \nIn that 17 times, one of those amendments was to repeal an earlier \nmistake, the amendment on prohibition.\n  Madam President, during that time, we have had civil wars, invasions \nof our Nation, the War of 1812, terrible world wars, Korean war, \nVietnam war, depressions, recessions, earthquakes, natural calamities, \nexpansion of our Nation. With all these changes, most of which were \nfar, far greater than anything we see today, we resisted the temptation \nto amend the Constitution. We resisted the temptation to tinker with \nour Constitution, and we always came out a stronger nation.\n  We hear talk about Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson borrowed twice \nthe budget of the United States for the Louisiana Purchase. Can you \nimagine what this country would be like had he not had the foresight to \ndo that? Or can you imagine what this country would be like had he had \nthe same constitutional amendment and not been able to borrow the money \nfor the Louisiana Purchase? Where would this Nation be?\n  I hear one Senator come in the Chamber and talk about Senators who \nappear to change their position. I would point out that I heard no \ncriticism from him of the three Senators who had opposed this \nconstitutional amendment and now support it.\n  I hear a Senator come in the Chamber and say we need this to balance \nthe budget, and yet that same Senator has done nothing to bring out of \nhis own committee a budget, even though the law requires him to do so, \nwithin the next month.\n  Madam President, we do not need a bumper-sticker, sloganeering \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. We can just have enough \ncourage to face up to the special interest groups of the left and the \nright and balance the budget ourselves. That is what we need.\n  So many of those who are hollering for this sound like the lion in \n``The Wizard of Oz.'' They are seeking courage. If we do not have the \ncourage to do what is right, then we do not belong here. But I am \nafraid that some who want this are simply looking for something that \nwill reflect the passing poll of the moment. The Constitution of the \nUnited States is not a passing poll of the moment. The Constitution of \nthe United States is the bedrock of this Nation. It is why we have the \nstrongest democracy in the world. It is why, incidentally, we have the \nstrongest economy in the world.\n  Instead of running down our economy, instead of running down our \nConstitution, instead of adding something that looks good on a public \nopinion poll but does not look good on the test of time, we ought to do \nwhat is right: bring down the deficit by the hard votes, not by \ntinkering with our Constitution. Let us not slap this bumper sticker on \nthe greatest Constitution ever written. It is beneath the Senate. It is \nbeneath the House of Representatives. But, more importantly, it does \ngreat disservice to the finest Constitution democracy has ever had.\n  Madam President, am I correct that the time of the Democratic leader \nhas expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 30 minutes under the control \nof the majority leader or his designee.\n  The Chair recognizes the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nof my 30 minutes, but I do want to reserve the closing 5 minutes for \nthe distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. So after 25 \nminutes, if I am still going, I hope the Chair will give me that \nnotification.\n  I should like to begin, Madam President, by expressing my \nappreciation to all the Members of the Senate. We have been debating \nthis issue now for a month or more. It has been a good debate. Every \nSenator has had an opportunity to express himself or herself, and I \nthink the debate for the most part has been good--troublesome to me \nsometimes and discouraging in some of the things I have heard said, but \nstill the Senate has worked its will in terms of having the time that \nwe needed to debate this very important issue and to offer amendments.\n  I thank particularly the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch of Utah, for the great work he has done, for the long hours, in \nfact--yes, hours--he has spent in this Chamber speaking in response to \ncomments from other Senators, commenting on the amendments that have \nbeen offered. He has done an outstanding job. If for no other reason, I \nhope we would pass this amendment because of the great work and the \ncommitment he has to this effort and to this constitutional amendment. \nI thank him for his great work.\n  Also, Senator Craig of Idaho, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, \nSenator Bryan of Nevada, a Democrat who has been involved, and 10 other \nDemocrats who have been committed to this constitutional amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget, who have had the courage of their \nconvictions to stand up and support this constitutional amendment and \nmake speeches in behalf of it.\n  Senator Coverdell has done an outstanding job in working with the \npeople from all over this country, through the land, who are interested \nin supporting this amendment. Senator Snowe has done a great job in \nhelping make sure that we had Senators who were aware of the time who \nwould come to the floor and make their statements. Many others have \ndone a great job. I wish to recognize the work they have done because a \nlot of time, a lot of thought, a lot of great speeches have been made \nas we have come to the conclusion of this debate on the constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget.\n  Thomas Jefferson has been mentioned a lot here in the debate. As a \nmatter of fact, as I just came from the majority leader's office, I was \nthinking about the fact that it was in that very room--yes, that very \nroom--that the House of Representatives met in 1801 and took 36 \nballots--36 ballots, would you believe it--to elect Thomas Jefferson of \nthe United States over Aaron Burr. How close they came to making a \nmistake.\n  I think that this, too, is of such historic significance. We should \nnot make a mistake here today and not pass this amendment. We should \nvote for it. And the impact would be monumental--perhaps not as \nmonumental as electing Thomas Jefferson, but certainly would have \nimpact on the future of all Americans for years and years to come. It \nis historic.\n  I am very proud that we have kept our word to the American people \nthat we would fight for this amendment, that we would bring it to a \nconclusion, and that we would try to get it added to the Constitution \nso that we would\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nhave the guarantee, the additional leverage, the backbone that is \nneeded to have in fact a balanced budget. So we have kept that \ncommitment, and all Americans will have a brighter, more prosperous \nfuture when we pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced \nbudget.\n  I noted the comments earlier today that 55 people wrote the \nConstitution. Well, 55 Republican Senators, every Republican Senator, \nwill vote for this amendment today, and a minimum of 11 Democrats. It \nis bipartisan. We do know that this needs to be done. We need to get \nthat additional vote that would give us the 67, and I think maybe that \nis still possible before all is said and done on this constitutional \namendment.\n  Just yesterday, we had additional proof of the need for this \nconstitutional amendment. Six Presidents, over 1,400 Members of \nCongress, and approaching 1,000 Senators over the years have made an \neffort to get a balanced budget agreement, but through 28 years and all \nthese Congressmen and Senators--and I want to make sure I have the \nexact number on the Senators. I think that number is high. We have had \nwell over 1,500 Congressmen and Senators who said we should have a \nbalanced budget, but we have not had one. We have not achieved one in \n28 years--good intentions by men and women, but it has not happened. It \nlooks like we will not have it for at least a couple of more years, at \nthe most not until the year 2002. And, yet, in the President's budget \nthat was sent to us, we find deficits do not go down, they go up by \nover $25 billion in the next fiscal year.\n\n  We find that, instead of having tax relief for working Americans, you \nhave a net tax increase in the President's budget. And, worst of all, \n98 percent of his so-called budget savings, or spending restraints, \nwould come in the last 2 years, after the year 2000, after the turn of \nthe century, after this President is gone--proof positive, once again, \nthat there is not yet a sufficient commitment by the President to get a \nbalanced budget agreement. Without this constitutional amendment, I \nstill have my doubts as to when it will happen.\n  Now, the Senator from North Dakota commented earlier about how he had \nvoted for a budget that reduced the deficit. Look, if everybody will \nagree just to raise taxes and keep raising taxes, I guess you could \nreduce the deficit. Of course, at some point there is a point of no \nreturn. When I hear from my own son, who calls me and says, ``Dad, \nlook, I am working hard, I have 55 people working for me, but 50 \npercent of everything I make is going to taxes, why is that? What are \nyou going to do about it?'' You know, that has an impact on me. The \nsolution to balancing the budget is not to raise more taxes, as \nhappened in 1993; it is to control spending for the interests of our \nchildren and for all Americans.\n  Social Security--when all else fails, bring up Social Security. I \nhave heard it for years. I have been worried about it over the years, \nand I have cast some votes that made it clear that I do not want Social \nSecurity to be threatened or abused in any way. This amendment will not \ndo that. In fact, the only thing that we could do that would threaten \nSocial Security is that we not get a balanced budget. That is how we \nwould get in trouble with Social Security.\n  By the way, if it is so critical, if it is, in fact, something that \nshould not be included in the budget, why does the President, year \nafter year, including this year, include Social Security in his budget? \nThis is absolutely a diversion, and it is unfair to the seniors in this \ncountry that we try to scare them by indicating in any way that this \nwould affect Social Security. The reverse is true. I will take my stand \nand stake my defense of Social Security against anybody's record in \nthis body.\n  Americans support this constitutional amendment. That is why you hear \nall these diversions. That is why you hear, ``Well, but for this,'' \n``Yes, but,'' ``Maybe, but I cannot do it unless you do that.'' The \nAmerican people are overwhelmingly for this.\n  Senator Cochran, my colleague from Mississippi, and I are for it and \nour constituents are for it; in my State, over 80 percent. So it is \nrelatively easy for us. But we are also for it because we believe \nincreasing debt is the wrong thing to do.\n  Let me just read some of the excuses we have heard over the years. \nThe truth of the matter is there are a few Democrats who do not want a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget. They just do not want \nit. But they have said: ``Well, I would be for it except we want a \nRepublican Congress to show their plan first,'' or, ``We want to wait \nuntil after Republicans have passed a budget plan,'' or, ``Only if you \nexempt Social Security,'' or, ``Yes, you must exempt emergency \nspending, you must exempt veterans, you must exempt housing.'' How \nabout an amendment by Senator Wellstone to exempt all education, \nhealth, and welfare; exempt all college aid and training? They would \nexempt all law enforcement, exempt the Tennessee Valley Authority, and \nhighways, bridges, dams, roads, buildings, ice skating warming huts, \nand pork. They would exempt 77 percent of the nondefense, noninterest \nbudget, if you went through that. And the list goes on, one excuse \nafter another.\n  Anybody who is looking for an excuse not to be for a balanced budget, \nlooking for an excuse not to be for a balanced budget amendment, they \ncan find it, they can find something to hide behind. But the American \npeople, I believe, see through that. They have watched for years. They \nknow that it has not been happening. They are worried about the \ninterest on the national debt. They are worried about the future of the \neconomy in our country. They know this should be done.\n\n  I do think that a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced \nbudget is an amendment that is worthy of going into the Constitution. \nSurely, Thomas Jefferson objected, back in the beginning of our great \ncountry, and would object now, to the debt we are building up--\ntrillions of dollars. If we do not get a balanced budget--in fact, even \nif we do get a balanced budget agreement--the debt will probably still \ngo up by close to $1 trillion. When will it end?\n  It brings to my mind the statement we have heard before, ``If not \nnow, when? If not us, who?\n  If we are not prepared to step up and pass this constitutional \namendment now, we are admitting, based on what we have seen from the \nPresident's budget proposal this year, it is not going to happen any \ntime soon. The deficits annually will begin to build up and to build up \nagain, and so will the debt.\n  We are stealing from the future of our children. They are the ones \nwho are going to pay the price for this, and I feel very strongly that, \nif we put this in the Constitution with the protections that are there \nso that if we do have economic problems or if we have a national \nemergency, there is a way to get out. There is the three-fifths vote--\n60 votes. We get 60 votes around here quite often.\n  We want to make it tough. If you make it so easy that you can just \nhave a vote and it will all just be wiped aside, you know Congress will \ndo that. Congress has proven time and time again they will do that.\n  In the past, we have tried to pass statutes that would guarantee that \nwe get a balanced budget, and it has not happened, because what has \nhappened? We come along and we say we are going to exempt all these \nvarious and sundry things. Or, if it really gets tough, like we did \nwith the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we just move the date. We just pass \nanother statute. As long as it is just a bill, as long as there is a \nway to avoid the tough decision, I fear the Congress will take \nadvantage of that.\n  We have proven here in this body, in the past 6 months, we can work \ntogether. We can be bipartisan. We can be civil to each other. And, \nwhen we work in a bipartisan way, when we put our minds to it, we can \nproduce results.\n  Last year, there we were passing these issues, many of them that had \nbeen in the making for years, like telecommunications and welfare \nreform, health insurance reform. We did not pass them by narrow \nmargins. We passed them by wide margins. Once we made up our mind we \nwould, we did it in a bipartisan way. That is one of the lessons I \nlearned. I am glad this is bipartisan. But I note also we must get one \nmore of the 34 Democrats in order to pass this constitutional \namendment.\n  A second lesson I have learned recently is good intentions just have \nnot worked. It is not enough. You need this additional leverage.\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\n  So, I urge my colleagues here today, be proud of what we have done. \nMake sure we are going to live up to the commitments that we have made \nto the American people. Join the American people. I want us all to have \nthe courage of our convictions and be prepared to vote yes or vote no, \nif that is what we think is right. But I do think we also should take \nsome lessons from our constituents. They have it figured out. They \nsupport a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget \noverwhelmingly. Why can we not get it through this institution?\n  I believe the House will take this issue up in the next month or so, \nand I believe they will pass it. Some people have their doubts about \nthat, but I still have confidence they will. And when they do, we will \ntake another look at considering this issue if, in fact, it does not \npass this afternoon. But this is an issue that will not go away.\n\n  In fact, if you look at the Constitution, the last amendment that was \nadded to the Constitution was actually pending for, I think, 200 years; \nthe 27th amendment to the Constitution. It was language for years and \nyears. Finally the State of Michigan ratified it and it became the 27th \namendment. I hope we do not have to wait that long for this amendment, \nbut we are going to pass this amendment and, if we do or we do not, I \nam going to work with the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. We are going to try to find a way to get a balanced budget \nagreement. But I believe that this additional requirement in the \nConstitution will guarantee that we will do that job.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the majority leader for his leadership on this \nparticular issue. He has been a leader on this issue ever since I have \nbeen working on it, I have to say, both in the House and in the Senate. \nI am proud of him.\n  Look, we have heard from the minority and the minority leader that \nthe perfect balanced budget amendment would exempt all capital \nexpenses, however defined; Social Security, however defined; military \nresponses or buildup, however understood, crime control; times of \neconomic downturn; national disaster or emergency; education; nutrition \nprograms, and so forth and so on. Gee, what is left under this \nproposal, under the minority leader's proposal? It is pretty apparent \nthey don't want a balanced budget amendment. They do not want a fiscal \nmechanism that will make it more difficult for them to increase taxes, \nto pay for more expensive programs or to increase the debt to pay for \nmore expensive programs. What's left? Just interest expenses? Well, \nthat's a perfect balanced budget amendment if you want to keep \nspending.\n\n  It was admitted today that if we had a ``capital budget exemption,'' \nwe would have a ``balanced budget'' today. I guess that's so. That's \nperfect. If you want to keep spending and borrowing, that's perfect. In \nother words, if you want to keep the status quo, that is the way to do \nit: Just hide everything in a loophole, and then you can say you \n``balanced'' the budget. No, we don't need this kind of perfection. \nWhat we need is a real-world solution, one that will make a difference.\n  I have to say, I am doggone tired of the demagoguery on Social \nSecurity. You would think these people here on the other side against \nthis amendment are the only ones who care about Social Security. Let me \ntell you something, I care about it. I watched what it did for my \nfolks. I know exactly what it does, and I don't want to ever see it \nhurt, and neither does anybody else who is voting for this amendment, \nand that is the vast majority of people in this body.\n  You are doggone right we like Social Security, and we are tired of \nthe demagoguery. Every time they are losing, they try to bring up a \nSocial Security amendment to hide behind, because they don't want to \ncast the right vote, and they know it, we know it, and, ladies and \ngentleman out there in the country, you know it, too. I am tired of it. \nIt is not right for them to continually hide behind these phony issues. \nCan you imagine having Social Security cast aside outside of the \nbalanced budget amendment and its protections, standing there all alone \nso that anything could be called Social Security? Once that game \nstarts, forget Social Security.\n  These people who are arguing that are the foes of Social Security. If \nthey really cared for Social Security, by gosh, they would be passing \nthis balanced budget amendment and getting spending under control. It \nis about time to get rid of the demagoguery, and I am tired of it.\n  Let me also say, I was quite upset today to hear in the closing \nremarks the minority leader come out here again and start using a \ndistortion of the Congressional Research Service. I was asked outside, \n``Have you lost confidence in the Congressional Research Service?'' by \none of the leaders in the media. Of course we have not, because they \nmade it clear that the interpretation was not as the minority leader \nhas been saying. As a matter of fact, we made that clear on the floor. \nThere should not even have been a question about it.\n  The CRS memorandum dated February 5 that my colleague was alluding to \ndid not conclude in any way whatever that the balanced budget amendment \nwould harm Social Security. All the CRS memorandum concluded was that \nassuming the Social Security surplus survived to the year 2019, the \nyear Social Security would start running annual deficits, this previous \naccumulated surplus could be used to help pay for future deficits, but \nonly if it is offset by revenues or budget cuts. Of course, we could \nalso vote to suspend the balanced budget rule for a year if that was \ntruly necessary. That is a considerably different position from what \nhas been demagoged throughout this debate.\n  Despite what my friend asserted, under the balanced budget amendment, \nassets of the Federal Treasury could be drawn upon to ensure payments \nto beneficiaries when the system starts running annual deficits. \nSenators Domenici, Mack, and I also received a letter from the CRS \nsupporting my provision. The nonpartisan Concord Coalition, founded by \nthe late Paul Tsongas, a Democrat, and Warren Rudman, a Republican, has \nalso addressed this issue. In a memorandum dated February 18, 1997, the \ncoalition concluded that the Senators' position that if the balanced \nbudget amendment does not exempt Social Security it will somehow \nnullify the trust fund surpluses and prevent payment of benefits to \nretired baby boomers is nonsense.\n\n  Let me quote further. This is what the Concord Coalition says:\n\n       What the BBA would do is to raise national savings and thus \n     make Social Security, along with a myriad other claims on \n     tomorrow's economy, more affordable. It would be ironic, \n     indeed, if concern about funding Social Security, whether \n     real or pretended, turns out to be an issue that sinks the \n     balanced budget amendment. Let's be clear, the balanced \n     budget amendment would in no way honor the status of the \n     Social Security trust funds.\n\n  The real issue here is, how are we going to fund the Social Security \ntrust funds when the system becomes insolvent around the year 2019, \n2029 for sure? The answer depends on the national debt. It is the size \nof the national debt that threatens the Social Security program, and, I \nmight add, we are adding to that national debt one more unbalanced \nbudget, and that is the one for fiscal year 1998. That is it. This is \nthe President's budget on top of these 28 other unbalanced budgets that \nwe have been pointing out throughout this debate.\n  Only if we pass the balanced budget amendment will we preserve Social \nSecurity, and that is the truth in this debate, and I am tired of the \ndemagoguery.\n  Just think about this national debt. Forty-six days ago, when the \nJudiciary Committee began the debate on the balanced budget amendment \nin the 105th Congress, I used a debt clock ticking off thousands of \ndollars each second to illustrate the magnitude of our country's \ngrowing debt. As we have debated Senate Joint Resolution 1 for the past \n46 days, that clock has continued to run, and our national debt has \nincreased in that period of time, that 46 days, $25 billion, while \nthese folks are talking about ``we just have to have the will to do \nit.'' Tell me where the will is in the last 29 years, including next \nyear's budget. That is the President's budget. It is unbalanced, by the \nway.\n  Madam President, I don't know about other States, but in Utah, 25 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nbucks is a lot of money. In fact, with that money, we could send every \nman, woman, and child in Utah to the University of Utah, pay their \ntuition, room, board, and books.\n  To give you the magnitude of that debt, let me give you an idea of \nhow much money we are talking about. With $5.3 trillion, which is our \nnational debt today, you could paper Washington, DC, with 100 dollar \nbills corner to corner with enough left over to give a block grant to \nevery State of about $6.3 billion. You could also purchase every new \nautomobile ever sold in the United States and still have enough left \nover to purchase every airline ticket ever sold for travel in the \nUnited States.\n  The U.S. Bureau of Printing and Engraving and U.S. Mint would need \n37\\1/2\\ years at its current rate of printing to print and coin enough \nmoney to equal $5 trillion.\n  Madam President, $5 trillion stacked in pennies would reach all the \nway to the planet Jupiter. Give me a break, will you?\n  All disposable personal income in the United States does not approach \n$5 trillion--all disposable income.\n  If all the home equity in the United States was applied to the \nnational debt, there would still be a half trillion dollars of debt \nleft over. That is what a mess this is, and we have these people \nsaying, ``Let's just do it and the President will sign it.''\n  Give me a break. Here is the President's budget right there, on top \nof the other 28 other unbalanced budgets.\n  Madam President, $5 trillion would consume all the wages and salaries \nearned by every American for 18 months.\n  Unfortunately, without the constitutional discipline offered by \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, the downward deficit spiral is likely to \ncontinue. The point is underscored by CBO's most recent projection that \nin the year 2002, total Federal debt will exceed $6.8 trillion. Come \non, it's time to wake up. I wonder what some people are thinking, I \nreally do.\n  Well, I don't mean to demean the Senator from Vermont who has had to \nmake almost every argument against it today by himself. He did have two \nor three others come over.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would yield, it would be OK if I win, \nthough. I will not lie.\n  Mr. HATCH. He said we won 14 or so votes, it is time for him to win \none.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  I heard this language, by one of the Members of the Senate, that we \nare just interested in a quick and easy fix, like instant rice, like \nJiffy Lube, like instant coffee. A quick and easy fix, my foot. We do \nnot believe that the only way to solve problems is by increasing taxes \nevery time, which is exactly what happened here when this President \ntook over. That is not the way to do it.\n  This stack of books is a wall standing between us and fiscal \nresponsibility and balanced budgets. The bricks in this towering wall \nare the unbalanced budget submissions for the last 28 years, 28 years \nof strapping debt on to the backs of our children, a towering wall of \noverspending the hard-earned money of the American people, a towering \nwall that demonstrates that the score for special interests is 28, the \nAmerican people zero.\n  Some people say, all we need is the will. Well, this towering wall \nrepresents 28 straight years of the failure of will and the failure of \nresponsibility--now, 29. It is higher than I am, and that is two \nstacks, not one. Before we are through, if we do not do something about \na balanced budget amendment, these will go all the way to this ceiling. \nThe President's actions, evidenced by his budget submission and his \nallies' work in defeating the balanced budget amendment here in the \nSenate, suggests that we are just putting another brick on this wall.\n  Frankly, I believe we will never get past this wall without a \nconstitutional requirement to balance the budget.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. You just placed the President's budget for this year on \ntop. Am I correct in saying that last year the deficit was $107 \nbillion, forecasted for 1997 to be $116 billion, and then in 1998, \nunder the President's budget--this is by the Congressional Budget \nOffice----\n  Mr. HATCH. His budget.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It goes to $145 billion, and then in 1999 to $142 \nbillion, and the year 2000 to $135 billion? Isn't that the report that \nwe just had from the Congressional Budget Office? We have 4 years of \ndeficit increases under the President's proposal?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. In the last 2 years we are going to cut \n98.5 percent in order to get to a balanced budget by the year 2002. \nAnybody believes that, boy, do I have something to sell for you.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Isn't it correct that under the President's budget, \nactually the deficit next year, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, will be $24 or $25 billion more than if we did not pass a \nbudget? In other words, his budget actually increases the deficit for \nthe next 4 years in relationship to present law?\n  Mr. HATCH. If we did just what we are doing now, the Senator is \nright, we would be a lot better off than the President's next 5-year \nbudget. He is saying that is a balanced budget. I do not believe we \nwill get all the way to a balanced budget and stay there without a \nconstitutional requirement. I think this stack of books proves it. \nEvery time somebody says, ``Let's just do it''--I have heard that for \n21 straight years now, ever since I came to the Senate. I will tell you \nsomething; we are not just doing it.\n  To all those who say we can balance the budget without the \nconstitutional requirement, I say to Democrats and the President that \nthis towering wall of irresponsibility is limiting our young people's \nfuture. I am convinced we cannot do it without putting a fiscal \nmechanism in to cause us to stand up and vote to do what is right. It \nis a wall of irresponsibility that is limiting our young people's \nfuture. We must do something about it now.\n  Mr. President, you fought against the balanced budget amendment. I \nhave to say, this big wall here is going to cause us pain through the \nrest of our lives unless we pass a balanced budget amendment. I am \nsaying to the President right now, and to our colleagues on the other \nside, let us tear down this wall of unbalanced budgets and let us do \nwhat is right. If we will, everybody will benefit from it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 66, nays 34, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 24 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--66\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon H.\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\n\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The galleries are advised that \nexpressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate \nChamber.\n  On this vote, the yeas are 66, the nays are 34. Two-thirds of the \nSenators voting, a quorum being present, not having voted in the \naffirmative, the joint resolution is rejected.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 1) was rejected.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am disappointed with the Senate vote. I \nam disappointed for the American people, especially younger Americans, \nand our children and grandchildren. They were the ones who lost in this \ndefeat. I hope our younger voters will take notice of who was on their \nside and who was not, the next time they vote.\n  The sad reality is that the bridge to the 21st century is likely to \nbe washed out in a flood of debt. I hope I am wrong and that we will \nnow work to enact a real plan to get to a balanced budget. I hope that \nthose who have killed the balanced budget amendment this time will \nactually work to balance the budget. But I must admit, I am not too \nhopeful that we will get to balance and stay there without the force of \na constitutional requirement to do so. This year we will add another \nbudget to this mounting stack of fiscal irresponsibility.\n  When we began this Congress, less than 2 months ago there, were 68 \nSenators who had either previously voted for this amendment--the exact \nsame amendment, or who had promised during their recent campaign to \nsupport it. I believed that we could count on them to keep their \npromises. Yet, only moments ago, only 66 votes were cast in favor of \nfiscal discipline. Those two missing votes are the difference between \npassing the balanced budget amendment and adding still more failed \nbudgets to this pile of 28 straight years of deficits.\n  As disappointed as I am, however, I am also very proud of my \ncolleagues who stood up and were willing to vote to protect our \nchildren and grandchildren from worsening the crushing burden of debt \nthat has already been loaded on their backs. Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nbegan this Congress with 62 cosponsors, Mr. President. That is an all-\ntime high. We have now had two consecutive Congresses in which the \nSenate missed approving the balanced budget amendment by a single vote. \nThere can be no doubt that support for this much-needed measure is \ngrowing.\n  I am particularly proud of, and grateful to, the 11 courageous \nDemocrats who did the right thing and voted for fiscal responsibility \nand accountability in spite of President Clinton's opposition. Among \nthem, Senators Bryan, Graham, Robb, Moseley-Braun, Kohl, Breaux, and \nBaucus deserve special recognition as they are all original cosponsors \nof the balanced budget amendment. Let me also recognize Senator Biden, \nthe former ranking member of the Judiciary Committee who also voted for \nthe amendment, and Senators Harkin, Landrieu, and Cleland.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is a \nbipartisan effort. The 11 courageous Democrats joined with all 55 \nRepublicans in the Senate to support what we understand is necessary if \nthe budget is to truly be brought into balance. Unfortunately for the \nAmerican people, the 34 Democrats who voted against the balanced budget \namendment were just enough to defeat it.\n  Two years ago I stood here after a very similar vote and promised \nthat we would not give up the fight for our children's future. This \nyear we returned stronger than ever. And so I make the same promise \nagain, we will be back! We will be back and we will continue to gain \nstrength until we enact the balanced budget amendment and finally, \nafter decades of excuses, broken promises, and more deficits, we will \nbalance the budget.\n  Mr. President, an effort such as the one we have been involved in \nover the past month requires the time, talent, and commitment of a \nlarge number of people. While I cannot name them all, I would like, at \nthis time, to extend my gratitude to the Senators and staff who were so \ninstrumental.\n  Let me first thank our majority leader for his pivotal role. Senators \nCraig, Thurmond, and Domenici of course, have my admiration and thanks. \nI am also especially grateful to Senators Nickles, Coverdell, Mack, \nGrassley, Gramm, Snowe, Abraham, and Thomas. Last, but certainly not \nleast, I would like to thank our new Republican colleagues: Senators \nEnzi, Hagel, Hutchinson, Allard, Collins, Sessions, Brownback, and \nRoberts. The energetic support of the newest Members of the Senate \nbodes well for the future prospects of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Let me also thank Senator Leahy, the new ranking member on the \nJudiciary Committee and the minority floor manager during this debate, \nfor his cooperation and courtesy.\n  Finally, I would like to single out some of the staff members who \nworked so long and hard on this matter: Damon Tobias with Senator \nCraig; Bill Hoagland, Austin Smythe, and Jim Capretta of Senator \nDomenici's Budget Committee staff; Tom Geier with Senator Snowe; Bryan \nReardon with Senator Abraham; Mitch Bainwol with Senator Mack; Doug \nBadger and Hazen Marshall of Senator Nickles's majority whip office; \nKyle McSlarrow and Carl Parks with Senator Coverdell; Andy Vermilye \nwith Senator Bryan; Russ Sullivan, Mike McGinn and Barbara Ramey with \nSenator Graham; and Rob Brazil with Senator Robb; and last but \ncertainly not least, David Hoppe, Alison Carroll and Keith Hennessy in \nthe majority leader's office. Let me also thank Bruce Cohen and Ed \nPagano of Senator Leahy's Judiciary Committee staff.\n  Last, Mr. President, I would like to thank the very special people \nwho have worked with me on this issue: Manus Cooney, Sharon Prost, \nShawn Bentley, Larry Block, Paul Larkin, Steve Tepp, Paul Joklik, Troy \nDow, Eric Sampson, Jennifer Carrico, Allison Vinson, and Irosha \nRatnasekera. Many staffers have worked long and hard in the most \ndedicated fashion, I thank them all for their devotion to duty and to \nour country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the distinguished \nmanager of the resolution and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The \nSenator from Utah is a tough opponent and one who I know is committed \nto and sincerely believes in this proposed amendment to the \nConstitution. He has certainly done everything that he could and spared \nno effort to persuade the Senate to pass this proposal.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to \nworking with him on important legislation and nominations through the \nremainder of this Congress.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle \nfor his leadership on this issue. He helped set the tone of the debate \nearly on, when he articulated the standard that we should apply when \nconsidering a proposal to amend the Constitution.\n  I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. \nWe all owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Byrd. I said in my opening \nstatement at our first Judiciary Committee hearing on January 17 that \nwe would be privileged to have Senator Robert C. Byrd with us during \nthis floor debate to instruct all of us on these historic matters. \nSenator Byrd did not disappoint. Indeed, his challenge to the \nproponents to explicate their proposal and their failure to do so \nprovided the fulcrum on which this debate has turned.\n  I want to commend those Members who had the courage to look behind \nthe title of the proposal and help us focus on its dangers and \nvagaries. In particular, I thank all those who came forward with such \nthoughtful amendments. Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, Feingold, Durbin, \nand Torricelli from the Judiciary Committee, and Senators Boxer, \nWellstone, Reid, Bumpers, and Dorgan each offered amendments that \nraised important issues and added greatly to the debate.\n  I want to thank Senators Lautenberg, Sarbanes, Conrad, and Glenn for \ntheir contributions and their full participation in this historic \ndebate.\n  I commend those cosponsors of the resolution who nonetheless offered\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\namendments, spoke in favor of various amendments, or voted not to table \nthe amendments that were offered. I hope that they will continue to \nthink about the problems that have been raised with the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I want to thank the organizations that have provided invaluable \ninformation and insights into this debate. In particular, I would like \nto thank Charles Loveless and Edwin S. Jayne, of the legislation \ndepartment at AFSCME, who spearheaded the Coalition on Budget \nIntegrity, and Robert Greenstein and Ellen Nissenbaum, of the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities, who spearheaded the Center's research on \nthis proposed constitutional amendment. I also thank Eugene Lehrmann \nfor his important testimony on behalf of the American Association for \nRetired Persons. I commend the 150 organizations that made up the \nCoalition on Budget Priorities for the hard work of each of their \nrepresentatives and all of their volunteers.\n\n  I also commend Professors Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, \nRobert M. Solow of MIT, and James Tobin of Yale University and the \n1,060 economists from around the country who came forward with a joint \nstatement to condemn the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Finally, I thank the Senate staff for its dedication and \nprofessionalism during the debate on this proposed constitutional \namendment: Larry Sein and Jonathan Adelstein from Senator Daschle's \nstaff; James English and Peter Kiefhaber from Senator Byrd's staff; \nCaroline Chambers and Jeremy Bates from Senator Dorgan's staff; Michael \nMyers and Melody Barnes from Senator Kennedy's staff; Kevin Cronin from \nSenator Feinstein's staff; Sumner Slichter and Michael O'Leary from \nSenator Feingold's staff; Tom Faletti from Senator Durbin's staff; Eric \nShuffler from Senator Torricelli's staff; Jim Ryan from Senator Reid's \nstaff; Bill Dauster and Jodi Grant from Senator Lautenberg's staff; and \nJulie Kehrli and Carlos Angulo from Senator Sarbanes' staff. From \nSenator Hatch's staff, I would like to thank Manus Cooney, Sharon \nProst, Shawn Bentley, Paul Larkin, Larry Block, Steve Tepp, and Troy \nDow. I was assisted, in particular, by Ed Pagano and Michael Carrasco.\n  As in so much that I do, my counsel Bruce Cohen was indispensable.\n  This effort would not have been successful, however, without the \nattention and efforts of hundreds and thousands of concerned Americans \nwho want to balance the budget while preserving the Constitution and \nthe guarantees that it provides. Their calls and letters made the \ndifference. This is their victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1884-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

DAUSTER\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a most \nvalued staff member of the Senate Budget Committee who will leave the \ncommittee this Friday to join Senator Kennedy at the Labor and Human \nResources Committee as general counsel and deputy staff director.\n  I am speaking of Mr. William G. Dauster, known to every Democratic \nSenator who ever had a question on the budget, an amendment to the \nbudget resolution, or a budget point of order, simply as, ``Bill.''\n  You could see Bill Dauster on the Senate floor, late at night, at the \nside of Budget Committee Chairmen Chiles or Sasser, or Ranking Minority \nMember Jim Exon. He was the best right hand and the finest counsel \nthese Senators could seek.\n  As the longest serving member on the Budget Committee, I have known \nBill since he first walked in the door almost 11 years ago after \nworking in private practice as a litigator with the New York City law \nfirm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Bill Dauster served on the committee, \nfirst as chief counsel from December 1986 to November 1994, and then \nrose to the position of Democratic staff director and chief counsel.\n  I saw Bill grow into one of the most respected and expert voices on \nthe budget. His advice and guidance made him an invaluable resource to \nall Democratic Senators. I think he taught a few lessons to some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle as well. But they respected \nhim, too.\n  Bill Dauster took on more thankless tasks than any reasonable man \ncould ask for, including some of the most arcane issues and twists and \nturns of budget process imaginable. And he did it with enormous \ndedication, consummate patience, an abundance of affability, and a \nlarge dose of excellent humor. Bill doesn't take himself seriously. He \ntakes the issues seriously.\n  Bill Dauster leaves behind him a string of accomplishments of which \nfew can boast, and of which many would envy. He has participated in \nCongress' reception of 11 Presidential budget submissions and 11 years \nof budget hearings.\n  He had a strong hand in drafting 8 budget resolutions, the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990, the 1987 revision of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, at \nleast a few amendments to the balanced budget amendment, and amendments \nexposing the weaknesses of entitlement caps.\n  During that time, Bill also wrote 3 editions of a budget process law \nbook, 3 budget law review articles, numerous speeches, and more than 20 \nop-ed pieces that have appeared in the Los Angeles Times, the \nWashington Monthly, Roll Call, the Hill and the Sunday Journal \nnewspapers of suburban Washington, DC. He can be justifiably proud of \nall of them. Bill's keen wit, nimble mind, and ability to turn a phrase \nare as evident and legendary as his extensive library and e-mail list. \nThe Budget Committee may have afforded Bill a wealth of opportunities, \nbut this body is the richer for it.\n  Bill's resume, however, does not do justice to the enormous \ncontributions he has made, not just to the budget process, but to our \nfellow citizens as well. He personifies a true servant, not only of \nthis great institution, but of the people we serve.\n  Blessed with enormous intellectual skills, Bill has also exhibited \ngreat compassion for the less fortunate among us, especially America's \nchildren and the disabled. Bill has toiled tirelessly on their behalf. \nAnd his source of inspiration has always been his family--his wonderful \nwife Ellen Weintraub and their three children, Matthew, Natanya, and \nEmma--to whom Bill is devoted.\n  I certainly don't want to make this sound like a eulogy, since Bill \nwill be just down the hallway from the Budget Committee. And I trust \nSenator Kennedy will still let us call or visit with Bill to benefit \nfrom his counsel. So this is not farewell, but merely thank you, Bill, \nfor a challenge well met and a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1922-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following measure was read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S.J.

Mr. President, I introduce the Older Americans \nAct amendments of 1997. The Older Americans Act expired in 1995 and we \nhave\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\nnot been able to reach consensus on reauthorizing it since then. I am \nintroducing last year's administration bill. This bill may not be \nperfect. But, I want to get the debate started. The act is critical to \nmeeting the day-to-day needs of America's seniors. This bill serves as \na starting point for our deliberations.\n  The Older Americans Act has been the major vehicle for organizing and \ndelivering social services to the elderly since it was passed in 1965. \nIt has supported a broad array of service programs through a network of \n57 State agencies and 670 local area agencies on aging. As a result of \nthis act, our seniors have benefited from millions of contacts and \nreferrals for services. They have benefited from millions of rides and \nmeals provided through the transportation and nutrition programs. They \nhave benefited from the elder abuse program. And, they have benefited \nfrom the jobs program. These examples show how coordinated service \nprograms help keep our seniors in their own homes and communities as \nviable members of society.\n  The bill I put forth today focuses on increasing flexibility to \nStates, area agencies on aging, and providers. This flexibility will \nallow them to be innovative in designing and implementing programs and \nservices for the elderly. It takes into account the distinct interest \nof all partners. It strives to balance those interest between all \npartners. It focuses on streamlining and enhancing effectiveness of \nprograms for our seniors. It sets the stage for performance \npartnerships and innovative ways of providing services. It ensures that \nperformance measures mandated under the Government Performance and \nResults Act [GPRA] are in place so that we can see the results of these \nprograms. It retains the programs for native Americans.\n  These are some of the things this bill will do. But, it is time for \nus to take action. It is time for us to address the issues at hand. It \nis time for us to pass a bill ensuring that the needed services and \nprograms are available to our seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 391. A bill to provide for the disposition of certain funds \nappropriated to pay judgment in favor of the Mississippi Sioux Indians, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  THE MISSISSIPPI SIOUX TRIBES JUDGMENT FUND DISTRIBUTION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will \nequitably resolve a longstanding problem involving a judgment fund \ndistribution to Sioux tribes in the Dakotas and Montana. Specifically, \nthe bill would distribute the accrued interest on funds awarded by the \nIndian Claims Commission in 1967 to the Mississippi Sioux Tribes. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Conrad, Johnson, Daschle, Baucus, and \nBurns in introducing this measure.\n  In 1972, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Secretary \nof the Interior to distribute 75 percent of a $5,900,000 judgment award \nto the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota, the Sisseton and \nWahpeton Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota, and the Assiniboine and \nSioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. The remaining 25 \npercent was to be distributed to individuals who could trace their \nlineal ancestry to a member of the aboriginal Sisseton and Wahpeton \nSioux Tribe.\n  The three Sioux tribes received their respective shares of the \njudgment award by the mid-1970's. To date, though, the funds allocated \nto the lineal descendants have not been distributed. This has resulted \nin a situation in which the accrued interest on the original principal \nof approximately $1.5 million has now grown to more than $13 million.\n  Today, if the 1,969 lineal descendants identified by the Department \nof the Interior receive their per capita payments, they will be paid \nmore than 18 times what the 11,829 enrolled tribal members received in \nthe 1970's.\n  In 1987, the three Sioux tribes filed suit in Federal court to \nchallenge the constitutionality of the lineal descendancy provisions of \nthe 1972 act. This litigation is currently in its second appeal. In \n1992, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Attorney \nGeneral to settle the case on any terms agreed to by the parties \ninvolved. I support this approach because I believe that it is long \noverdue that this matter be resolved. However, the Department of \nJustice has refused to proceed with any settlement negotiations and has \ntaken the position that the 1992 law did not authorize the Department \nto settle the case on any terms other than those laid out in the \noriginal 1972 Act. While I view this interpretation as flying in the \nface of Congressional intent, the Department has been unwilling to \nchange its position or actively seek a resolution of this matter \noutside of the courts.\n  The legislation I am introducing with my colleagues on behalf of the \nthree Sioux tribes represents a reasonable solution to this protracted \nmatter and a substantial compromise on behalf of the tribes. In the \npast, the tribes have sought to repeal the lineal descendancy \nprovisions of the 1972 Act altogether, and, in 1986, a bill was \nreported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs which would have \nachieved this goal.\n  In contrast to the 1986 measure, the Mississippi Sioux Tribes \nJudgment Fund Distribution Act of 1997 would retain the undistributed \nprincipal for the lineal descendants and distribute the accrued \ninterest to the three Sioux tribes. The distributed funds would have to \nbe deposited into a trust fund administered by the tribal governing \nbody. There would be no per capita payments of these funds, which would \nhave to be used by the tribes for economic development, resource \ndevelopment, or for other programs that collectively benefit tribal \nmembers, such as educational and social welfare programs. In addition, \nthe legislation contains an audit requirement by the Secretary of the \nInterior to ensure that the funds are properly managed.\n  I believe that this legislation takes a fundamentally fair approach \nto resolving a matter which will otherwise remain mired in legal \ndisputes for years. It keeps the commitment that the Federal Government \nmade to provide compensation to lineal descendants while ensuring that \nmost of the remaining undistributed funds go to the tribes. It was, \nafter all, the tribes who were wronged and who should be compensated \nfor their losses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 60\n\n       Whereas the continued success of our Nation's \n     constitutional democracy is dependent upon our Nation's youth \n     striving toward higher goals;\n       Whereas a student's intelligence, determination, \n     perseverance and continued interest in the workings of our \n     Nation's political processes must be nurtured and encouraged;\n       Whereas the pursuit of higher education, and participation \n     and interest in the political processes, remain priorities of \n     young citizens around our Nation; and\n       Whereas the United States Senate and the William Randolph \n     Hearst Foundation Senate Youth Program have provided high \n     school juniors and seniors who are leaders in education and \n     student government, as well as in their communities, with the \n     opportunity to travel to their Nation's capital and witness \n     the political process, supported solely by private funds with \n     no expense to the Federal Government since the program's \n     inception in 1962: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate hereby congratulate, honor, and \n     pay tribute to the 3,600 exemplary students who have been \n     selected, on their merit, to participate in the William \n     Randolph Hearst Foundation Senate Youth Program between 1962 \n     and 1997.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, along with Senator Hutchison and Senator \nWyden, I am pleased to submit this resolution to commemorate the 35th \nanniversary of the William Randolph Hearst U.S. Senate Youth Program. \nAs the first graduate of the program to become a U.S. Senator, I can \nhonestly say that the week I spent in Washington in 1971, as one of two \ndelegates from Maine, profoundly influenced my life and career.\n  Even though my family has a long and proud tradition of public \nservice-- my great grandfather, my grandfather and my father all served \nin the State legislature, and both of my parents served as mayor of \nCaribou, ME--it was a week I spent in Washington with the Senate Youth \nProgram that caused me to seriously consider a career in the public \nsector.\n  For the past 35 years, the Senate Youth Program has selected two of \nthe brightest and most active students in each of the 50 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the Department of Defense schools abroad to \nspend a week learning about our Nation's government first-hand. Over \nthe years, 3,600 such students have participated in the program and \ngone on to serve our Nation in various capacities, including public \nservice.\n  Monday morning, I had the pleasure of addressing this year's \ndelegates and was impressed with their enthusiasm, knowledge, and the \nhigh caliber of the questions they posed. I was delighted to see how \nthe program has maintained--perhaps even surpassed--the high standards \nfor which it is so well known.\n  The continued generosity of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation \nenables students to come to the District of Columbia and see a side of \ngovernment that few Americans see in their lifetime. Each year the \ndelegates meet with top members of the legislative, executive, and \njudicial branches.\n  I remember how fascinated I was as a delegate to listen to Senators \nByrd and Thurmond speak to us about the history of the Senate and the \nissues of the day.\n  But the highlight of my week was the time I spent talking with my \nhome State Senator, Margaret Chase Smith. I went to Senator Smith's \noffice hoping to shake her hand; instead, she took me into her private \noffice and spent 2 hours talking with me about the importance of public \nservice and the difference one person can make. When I left her office, \nI remember feeling so proud that she was my Senator and that I could do \nanything I set my mind to.\n  So, today it is my pleasure to sponsor this resolution paying tribute \nto the 3,600 delegates who have participated in the Senate Youth \nProgram over the past 35 years, some of whom we may see here in the \nCongress, the Supreme Court, or even the White House in years to come. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1926-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1927-S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 61--RELATIVE TO FUNDING FOR THE COMMITTEE ON \n                         GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS.\n\n  Mr. GLENN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

CONSIDERATION OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM LEGISLATION.\n\n       Not later than May 1, 1997, the Senate shall proceed to \n     consideration of S. 25 which shall remain the pending order \n     of business until final disposition.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate resolution \nfunding the Committee on Governmental Affairs for a special \ninvestigation of Federal election campaign fundraising and expenditure \npractices.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is in response to the growing need for \na fair, bipartisan investigation of the disturbing pattern of campaign \nfundraising at both the Presidential and congressional level in recent \nelections, as well as the need for campaign finance reform.\n  The resolution incorporates the investigatory scope agreed upon by a \nvote of the Governmental Affairs Committee at its meeting on January \n30, 1997. It also incorporates procedures to help ensure that the \ninvestigation will be bipartisan. This is critical to the success of \nthe investigation, if success is defined in terms of forward movement \nof reform of our campaign fundraising practices. And reform can only \noccur if the public realizes the truth about campaign fundraising--that \nthe abuses do not lie only on one side.\n  Indeed, an unbalanced, partisan investigation that suggested that all \nthe problems lie solely or even mainly with one party would be \ndestructive to forging a consensus, and would lead to more political \ngames, possibly including an attempt to pass reform legislation crafted \nnot so much to fix the system as to give one party a fundraising \nadvantage over the other.\n  As the Ranking Democrat on Governmental Affairs, I have urged the \nChairman and the other Republican members of the committee to follow \nstandard Senate practice and enter into an agreement that the \ninvestigation will be conducted in a bipartisan manner with a balanced \nagenda, a clear statement of mission and legislative purpose, a fair \nset of rules of procedure, a timeframe for completion of the \ninvestigation with provision for extension if necessary, and a \nreasonable amount of money.\n  Unfortunately and most disappoint-edly, agreement has eluded us thus \nfar, despite many hours of discussion.\n  Much attention has been lavished in the press on the difference \nbetween the proposed funding of this investigation by the Republican \nside--originally $6.5 million, subsequently reduced to $5.7 million \nafter receipt of assurances that 10 FBI personnel would be detailed to \nthe committee--and the Democratic side--an initial outlay of $1.8 \nmillion with provision for additional funds to be considered if \nnecessary. But the length of the investigation and the fairness of the \ninvestigation are or equal importance.\n  Length is important because an investigation that includes \ncongressional fundraising as one of its foci should not extend \nsignificantly into an election year.\n  Fairness is important if there is to be any credibility to the \ninvestigation.\n  There has been, in my view, a certain amount of disinformation that \nhas been disseminated about the position of the Democratic side \nregarding this investigation. I will have much to say about that at a \nlater time. For now, I believe it is important for the public to know \nprecisely what Democrats have been proposing for this investigation. \nThis resolution incorporates these proposals.\n  The resolution calls for a fair, bipartisan, adequately funded, \npotentially yearlong investigation into both Presidential and \ncongressional fundraising practices, and requires that the McCain-\nFeingold bill be brought to the floor for consideration no later than \nMay 1, 1997.\n  I believe this is a reasonable proposal and I urge its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1927-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                 committee on labor and human resources\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, the untimely death of Mr. Albert \nShanker is a moment of great sadness for this Nation and for me \npersonally. He lost his 3-year struggle with cancer Saturday evening on \nFebruary 22, 1997. Since 1974, Mr. Shanker served as the president of \nthe American Federation of Teachers. Prior to his election to that \npost, he was president of New York City's United Federation of \nTeachers, transforming it into one of the Nation's greatest unions. He \nwas the first\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nteacher to become a member of the AFL-CIO Executive Council and at his \ndeath, chaired the education committee and was chairman of the general \nboard of its department for professional employees.\n  Mr. Shanker was well known not only in this country, but also \ninternationally and was the founding president of Education \nInternational, an organization with some 20 million teachers from \ndemocratic countries around the world. He also established American \nFederation of Teacher projects assisting teacher unions in South \nAfrica, Chile, Poland, and Russia.\n  Mr. Shanker was a driving force in the education reform movement and \nwas well known for his column ``Where We Stand'' in the Sunday New York \nTimes. He was also a leader in promoting civil and human rights. \nSeveral times over the last few months, as I prepared for Education \nhearings, I requested his participation, and even though his health \nkept him from appearing in person, his presence was always there--\nthrough his statements which he prepared and which were read by his \ndesignee.\n  This Nation has lost a great leader, a great friend of education, and \na great man. I send my regrets and my sympathy to his wife Edith and \nhis children Adam, Jennie, Michael, and Carl.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1928-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RELEASE OF FUNDING FOR INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING AID\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly today about \nthe President's resolution requesting the release of fiscal year 1997 \ninternational family planning funding by March 1, 1997, on which the \nSenate recently deliberated. I am pleased that the President signed \nHouse Joint Resolution 36 on February 28, 1997, and that funding for \nfamily planning is now available to those overseas who so desperately \nneed such services.\n  I supported the President's resolution because I believe we must try \nto limit overpopulation. The world's population increases by 100 \nmillion each year. Overpopulation threatens to exert tremendous social, \necological, medical, and economic hardship on much of the world. Family \nplanning is one of the most effective ways to combat overpopulation and \nits detrimental results.\n  I also supported the President's resolution because family planning \nis one of the best weapons we have to save the lives of women and their \nchildren in developing countries. The longer we delay the funding for \nfamily planning, the harder it is to save those lives.\n  Let me explain: Family planning enables women to space their births, \npreserving their health and improving the odds that their children will \nbe born healthy. Delaying the release of family planning funding \nresults in less healthy mothers and children and increased rates of \nmaternal and infant mortality.\n  Mr. President, I served in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, \na developing country. For families living under the conditions that \nexist in many developing nations, family planning is critical. Without \nit, mothers have great difficulty spacing their births or limiting the \nnumber of children they bear. As a result, they suffer the tremendous \nphysical stress of repeated childbirth, often without the aid of \nphysicians, and sometimes die from the great burden they have placed on \ntheir bodies.\n  But mothers are not the only ones who suffer in these cases. Their \nchildren suffer too. When women have children too close together, the \nlength of time they can nurse each child is cut short. Mothers' milk is \nthe most nourishing food for children during their early years, \nproviding essential nutrients that are often hard to find elsewhere in \nthe food supply available to families in developing nations. \nFurthermore, children in such families find themselves competing for \nfood with many other siblings, instead of only the few siblings they \nmight have if their mothers had access to family planning. As a result, \nthey suffer from higher incidents of malnutrition.\n  And family planning programs have the added benefit of slowing the \nspread of AIDS by increasing access to appropriate contraceptives.\n  Mr. President, the agreement between Congress and the President last \nyear was that fiscal year 1997 international family planning funding \ncould be released by March 1, 1997, if the administration certified \nthat a delay in the release of funds until July 1, 1997 would harm \noverseas family planning programs and their beneficiaries. Indeed, the \nadministration has issued such findings and documented its case well. \nIts findings show that a delay in funding would result in serious \nshortage of contraceptives in at least 60 countries, including 50 \nmillion condoms, 500,000 IUD's, and 4.8 million cycles of birth control \npills. Additionally, the delay would result in the closure of 17 of 95 \noverseas programs and higher numbers of maternal and infant deaths.\n  Some, Mr. President, have attempted to circumvent last year's \nagreement by saying that family planning aid increases the number of \nabortions. On the contrary, by allowing women to prevent pregnancy, \nfamily planning reduces the need for and number of abortions. The \nadministration's findings speak to this issue, showing that a delay in \nfunding would result in increased incidents of unintended pregnancies \nand more abortions and that family planning helps decrease the number \nof abortions worldwide. Furthermore, UNICEF reported in 1996 that \n600,000 women die annually of pregnancy-related causes; 75,000 of those \ndeaths are due to self-induced, unsafe abortion.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that international family planning aid \nhelps protect the health and lives of women and children around the \nworld. As we aim to improve the socioeconomic conditions in developing \ncountries, let us recognize that family planning is a help, not a \nhindrance, that must be sustained.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1929-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1929-S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANOTHER CALL FOR AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have addressed the Senate already \non the need for an independent counsel to investigate the growing \nscandal concerning fundraising. Along those same lines, I recommend to \nall my colleagues a thoughtful editorial from the Washington Post \nentitled ``The Fund-Raising Fiasco: The Democrats' Problem . . .''.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n         The Fund-Raising Fiasco: The Democrats' Problem . . .\n\n       The Democrats' new chairman, Roy Romer of Colorado, did \n     right on Friday to acknowledge error and pledge a new, \n     reformed style of fund-raising behavior on behalf of his \n     party. But it seemed to us that something much more active, \n     intense and deliberate had gotten the Clinton White House \n     into its present troubles than the alleged mere failure of \n     ``screening'' that the president likes to talk about (and lay \n     off on the Democratic National Committee). The people whose \n     money has had to be returned (to the tune of $3 million, as \n     of today) did not, from all the evidence, simply slip through \n     the net in some random, inexplicable way. They were not a \n     byproduct of any simple breakdown of screening procedures. \n     The more important of them, in the first place (Mr. Trie, Mr. \n     Huang), who brought others into the fold, have connections \n     dating from Arkansas days with Mr. Clinton. The Clinton White \n     House brought them into national Democratic Party politics, \n     not the other way around.\n       Again, the nature of many of the favor- and respectability-\n     seeking money givers suggests that the word must have gotten \n     around that you could gain marketable, perhaps personally \n     extremely useful photo-op access to the president for a \n     sufficient number of bucks. Is there some other way to \n     account for the fact that, even at a time when the \n     administration had barricaded off a hunk of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue to protect the first family from criminal assault, it \n     was ushering into the president's presence a stream of folks \n     that sometimes seemed to resemble an international ``Ten Most \n     Wanted'' list? Let us remind you of a few of the more \n     memorable visitors.\n       Russ Barakat, the south Florida Democratic Party official. \n     Five days after his coffee session at the White House in \n     April 1995, Mr. Barakat was indicted on criminal charges and \n     ultimately convicted for tax evasion. A Florida newspaper was \n     full of stories about Mr. Barakat's problems with the law \n     before the executive mansion get-together, but he was asked \n     in for coffee anyway.\n       Wang Jun, the Chinese businessman and head of a military-\n     owned arms company. While part of the U.S. government was out \n     investigating Wang Jun for allegedly smuggling arms into this \n     country, he was with Mr. Clinton at a White House coffee, \n     courtesy of Mr. Trie.\n       Eric Wynn, whose $100,000 bail was revoked this past week \n     because he failed to tell authorities about his five arrests \n     since being\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\n     sentenced for theft and tax offenses a while back. He was at \n     the White House for coffee two days after a company partially \n     controlled by him gave $25,000 to the Democratic National \n     Committee. At the time Mr. Wynn hooked up with the president, \n     he bore the distinction of having been a twice-convicted \n     felon. But that was only the beginning. Mr. Wynn-who was \n     seeking a presidential pardon for himself--turned up last \n     year at four other DNC fund-raisers involving the president \n     including one in which he, his attorney (a close presidential \n     friend from Arkansas) and Mr. Clinton reportedly had a brief \n     private chat. Whatever about? The president, said White House \n     press secretary Michael McCurry, ``recalls no substantive \n     private meeting with Mr. Wynn and is certain he never \n     entertained any discussion of Mr. Wynn's legal situation.''\n       Jorge Cabrera of Miami, DNC donor who was jailed on drug \n     charges in the 1980s. Mr. Cabrera turned up at a White House \n     Christmas party, only to get caught a short time later with \n     more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine, for which he is now \n     serving 19 years in jail.\n       Chong Lo. Convicted of tax evasion in the 1980s under the \n     name of Esther Chu, Chong Lo was another visitor for coffee \n     with Mr. Clinton. She has since been arrested again on 14 \n     charges of falsifying mortgage applications--to which she has \n     pled not guilty.\n       Roger Tamraz. While Interpol was looking for Mr. Tamraz all \n     over the world under a 1989 international arrest warrant on \n     conspiracy and embezzlement charges, the fugitive from \n     Lebannon was here in Washington at the White House sipping \n     coffee with the president.\n       Here in another indicator, in our view, that something \n     beyond a mere screening mishap befell the White House in \n     these fund-raising transactions. It is the sheer number of \n     times that some of the fund-raisers visited the White House. \n     We daresay there are department bigwigs in the administration \n     who haven't been there nearly as often.\n       So what was actually going on during these recurrent White \n     House sessions? At this stage, little is known about the \n     purposes of their visits, who the visitors saw each time, \n     what they did when they got there, or who authorized their \n     entry to the White House. More should be known. Ponder just a \n     few of the numbers we find so startling: Mr. Huang visited \n     the White House 78 times in 15 months (most of the money he \n     raised in 1996 was returned, having been deemed inappropriate \n     or from unlawful foreign sources); Thai businesswoman and \n     major Democratic party donor Pauline Kanchanalak has been at \n     the White House at least 26 times since the president took \n     office; businessman and contributor Johnny Chung reportedly \n     visited the White House at least 49 times. This wasn't a \n     question of screening or failing to screen. These were people \n     apparently well known to their White House hosts, people who \n     had business to do at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and went right \n     in.\n       Then there are the sleepovers. The White House has \n     disclosed that 900-plus individuals have spent a night at the \n     White House since the Clintons moved in. The acknowledgment \n     of this fact and the publication of the list rather sharply \n     change the impression the White House earlier gave a more \n     casual, friends and family kind of hospitality. More than a \n     third of the sleepovers were financial benefactors of Mr. \n     Clinton or the DNC. ``They were my friends and I was proud to \n     have them here,'' the president explained, but as the White \n     House deputy communications director delicately corrected \n     him, some weren't friends yet'' but ``were people the \n     president and the first lady wanted to spend more time \n     with.'' As Charles Krauthammer observed on the opposite page \n     the other day, the word for people who aren't friends yet is \n     usually ``strangers.''\n       Much more needs to be known about these sojourns--\n     especially the number of visits and their dates in relation \n     to events that preceded and followed. This is especially \n     relevant where the visitors weren't strangers at all, as a \n     matter of fact, but persons involved in the other, related \n     legal matters concerning the Clinton administration.\n       Our conclusion about all this is threefold. It is that \n     first, a great deal more needs to be disclosed about all \n     these transactions; second, it will be disclosed, as it has \n     been to date, reluctantly and in response to various events \n     and pressures; and third, (see below) the odds are not great \n     for a good and fairminded congressional inquiry into the \n     subject. For the moment that leaves Janet Reno in \n     charge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1929-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROPOSED ENCRYPTION LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern over \nbills introduced last Thursday, February 27, 1997 by the Senators from \nVermont and Montana. These bills, the Encrypted Communications Privacy \nAct of 1997 and the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era \nAct of 1997, deal with the complex and controversial issue of \nencryption and the export of encryption products. I too am concerned \nover our Nation's policy regarding encryption, but I believe rash \naction on this issue at this time by Congress would be inappropriate.\n  I agree with both Senator Burns and Leahy that digital \ncommunications, the internet, and the global information infrastructure \nare already revolutionizing the way we live and work. I also believe \nthere is a need to ensure the security of private, commercial, and \nGovernment messages and information sent over global communication \nlinks and stored in computer databases. The information revolution is \nunderway and technology is progressing at exponential rates.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, our Nation still has needs that must be \naddressed. The same digital information, communication links, and \ncomputer memory that allows for great advances in personal convenience \nand entertainment, in commercial productivity and competitiveness, and \nin Government services and efficiencies can also be abused by \nindividuals with other designs and intentions. Our society has \nentrusted its elected leaders and public servants to protect its \ncitizens from such activities. Therefore, I think it is imperative that \nwe study thoroughly how this proposed legislation will affect our \nGovernment's ability to fulfill its responsibilities. The National \nsecurity and the ability to effectively enforce our extraterritorial \nlaws is at stake.\n  The executive branch is the part of our Government responsible for \nimplementing and enforcing the laws of this Nation. For the past \nseveral years the administration has been involved in a dialog with \nindustry leaders in an attempt to promote the use of encryption and \nexpand exports while also protecting the legitimate needs of our \nGovernment to gain access with properly executed search warrants to \ncommunications. This is not done for nefarious intentions, as some have \nclaimed. The negotiations took place because our Government is charged \nwith fulfilling its responsibility to protect the lives and livelihood \nof all its citizens.\n  But our concern for access to encrypted data extends beyond our \nshores. Our Nation faces threats from nations, groups, and individuals \noverseas. The United States' ability to counter and thwart these \nthreats will likely be hampered if encryption products are allowed to \nbe exported worldwide with unlimited strength or without key recovery \nprovisions.\n   Mr. President, the administration has also been negotiating with \nother OECD nations regarding encryption policy. We are not the only \nnation which realizes the benefits and possible abuses of encryption \nproducts. Other nations are also considering how to ensure that their \ngovernment needs and responsibilities are addressed in their encryption \nexport and import policies. I do not believe our relations with other \nnations will be furthered if the administration's negotiations are \nundercut by unnecessary and potentially damaging congressional action. \nFurther, the interests of our Nation's technology industry will not be \nadvanced if other nations shut their borders to American encryption \nproducts.\n  Today, many established software and hardware firms are successfully \nmarketing encryption products with key recovery features here and \nabroad. The President has put forward a plan which in good faith \nattempts to balance our Nation's interests in commerce, security, and \nlaw enforcement. While other firms say the administration policy is \nuntenable, these American companies are producing and selling advanced \nencryption products worldwide which meet both the needs of private \ncommerce and industry, and the requirements of our Government. This \nsuggests to me that the administration's policy not only can work, it \nis working. I believe Congress should let the administration's \nnegotiations and policies on encryption go forward, to succeed or fail \non their own merits. Mr. President, caution and careful study are in \norder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1930-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1930-S1931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PEARL HARBOR SURVIVORS ASSOCIATION ON \n                         THEIR 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the New Hampshire Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. Those \nbrave men stood tall in perhaps one of the most tragic moments in \nAmerican history. Against overwhelming odds, these great Americans \nfought to defend the United States. Their heroic actions were an \ninspiration to the people of the\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\nUnited States and help propel our Nation to victory in World War II.\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor the New Hampshire Pearl Harbor \nSurvivors on the occasion of their 25th anniversary. They are our \nAmerican heros and we applaud them for defending our country. I also \nwish to commend these brave men for touring New Hampshire schools and \ntalking to our young Americans in an effort to keep Pearl Harbor \nmemories and history alive. Those who fought in the war and were \nvictims of the Pearl Harbor attack deserve a special place in our \nhistory books.\n  My father was a Navy pilot who died in a war-related incident during \nWorld War II. I have a special place in my heart for these courageous \nmen.\n  When United States Army and Navy commanders in the Pacific area had \nreceived a final war warning on the 27th of November 1941, Hawaii was \nnot mentioned and American authorities thought that the Philippines or \nMalaysia would be the possible target. Any potential attack on Pearl \nHarbor was therefore interpreted as a form of sabotage and no effective \nsecurity patrol was established. Antiaircraft batteries around the \nharbor consequently had no ready ammunition and USAAF aircraft on the \nground were easy targets as they were unarmed and grouped together on \nairfields for easier protection against saboteurs.\n  On Saturday, December 6, 1941, many Army and Navy personnel were on \nthe usual weekend shore leave when the destroyer Ward radioed that it \nhad sunk a submarine early Sunday morning. The information, though, was \ndelayed in reaching the high command and consequently the harbor gate \nhad not been closed.\n  At 7:55 a.m., on December 7, 1941 the first Japanese bombers attacked \nUnited States airfields and the fleet. Virtually the entire U.S. fleet \nof 94 vessels, including 8 battleships, was concentrated at Pearl \nHarbor and the disposition of troops, airplanes, and antiaircraft guns \nmade effective defense almost impossible. When the last attack had \nended about 2 hours later, the Japanese won a significant tactical \nvictory since they had been practically unopposed. Within 2 hours, \n2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed and 1,178 wounded. \nWhen the news of the attack reached the people of the United States, \nour country went into shock. Japanese capabilities had been \nunderestimated and information about the fast-moving developments had \nbeen relayed too slow to the commanders in Hawaii.\n  Pearl Harbor is a very poignant chapter in our history. We must seek \nto remember the grave sacrifice so many Americans made there. As a \nveteran, I am very proud to honor the outstanding patriotism of the New \nHampshire Pearl Harbor Survivors on their 25th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1930-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA DAY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am honored to join again with \nnearly 1 million Lithuanian Americans in commemorating the 79th \nanniversary of the proclamation of an independent Lithuania, especially \nat a time when the Lithuanian people are rebuilding their democracy.\n  After more than seven centuries of struggle, the Lithuanians have \nfinally succeeded in reestablishing an independent republic. While \ntheir hopes were realized once before in this century, their freedom \nwas abruptly revoked in 1940, after 22 years of democratic governance.\n  Throughout this long and difficult period, the people of Lithuania \nand the other Baltic nations never wavered from their beliefs in \ndemocratic values and their desires for liberty and freedom. In keeping \nwith such a strong commitment, their independence after so many years \nis not only something to celebrate, it is an incentive for us all to \nrededicate ourselves to the democratic principles commemorated by this \nanniversary.\n  Since 1990, when Lithuania rejoined the international community of \ndemocratic nations, the country has recognized the importance of \nmeaningful political and economic reforms. Most significantly, \nLithuania recently experienced another peaceful transfer of civilian \nrule, demonstrating the increasing stability of its democracy.\n  Lithuania's commitment to continue along the path of economic reforms \nalso promises greater prosperity in the years to come. A number of \nindicators suggest the possibility of a brighter future for the \nLithuanian economy, despite the difficult period of transition that has \nresulted from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gross domestic product \nis expected to rise this year, and continue to do so the next. \nInflation is expected to decline. Industrial production is also on the \nrise.\n  In addition, Lithuania has reached out to its neighbors, both those \nin the Baltic region and those further to the west. The Baltic Economic \nCooperation Agreement and Lithuania's decision to join the Council of \nEurope are examples of this young democracy's determination to remain \neconomically and politically engaged with the rest of the world.\n  At this time of year, our thoughts also turn to those Lithuanians who \nsuffered under the brutality of the Nazi and Soviet occupations. Many \nrisked and lost their lives for the rights and freedoms that \nLithuanians today are privileged to enjoy. Their steadfast \ndetermination and courage eventually prevailed, providing hope for all \npeoples who dream someday to be free.\n  The writer Vincent Boris has observed that Lithuanian ``statehood was \nreestablished within a continuum of nationhood.'' Indeed, the \nLithuanian people have drawn their strength from a very real sense that \nnationhood can never be oppressed. That sense of nationhood has been \nmost evident here in the United States, where we have witnessed the \nunyielding dedication of Lithuanian Americans to the freedom of their \nnative land. Their perseverance encouraged many of us to stand in this \nbody over the last several decades and proclaim our support for a \nLithuanian republic.\n  We in Maryland, and our Nation, are particularly fortunate to have \nsuch an active Lithuanian-American community. Its longstanding \ntraditions of self-help and voluntarism and its dedication to the \ndemocratic ideals that have prevailed in Lithuania have truly enriched \nthe history of this country. In areas ranging from business, to \nacademia, to the arts, Lithuanian-Americans consistently make \nsignificant contributions across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, recently, Lithuanians gathered in their capital, \nVilnius, to commemorate this anniversary. I am proud that we in the \nUnited States have continued to stand with them on this occasion, both \nin years when there was much to celebrate and in years when there were \nonly memories and dreams of a better future. It is my sincere hope that \nwe can celebrate this anniversary with the same optimism that we do \nthis year for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1931-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1931-S1932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WHAT AL SHANKER TAUGHT US\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a \ngreat man and a very good friend, Al Shanker. His contributions to \neducation and society at large are too great to enumerate so I \nrespectfully ask that E.D. Hirsch, Jr.'s column from the Washington \nPost be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                       What Al Shanker Taught Us\n\n       In the course of the past two decades, Albert Shanker made \n     himself the most important figure in American education. In \n     the wake of his untimely death on Feb. 22, the movement \n     toward rigorous academic standards in public schools must \n     still go on. But his death leaves a void, and the standards \n     movement will have less force and focus than it had before.\n       No other high official in education spoke home truths so \n     consistently, or with more clarity, or to greater effect. No \n     one contributed more to the change in attitude among teachers \n     and the general public toward universally high academic \n     standards. If a single person could be said to be responsible \n     for the shift in sentiment that prompted the President to \n     call, in his State of the Union address, for national \n     educational standards in the public school--a proposal that \n     would have been unthinkable a few years back--it would be Al \n     Shanker.\n       We teachers, like the rest of humankind, are creatures of \n     habit and tradition who follow the ideas we were taught. Our \n     leaders are inclined to preserve their popularity by telling \n     us what we are comforted to hear. Al Shanker was different. \n     His loyalty was to the wellbeing of public education as a \n     whole. Only a rare and great leader risks the disfavor of his \n     followers and brings them to a new understanding of \n     uncomfortable new realities.\n       Long before his colleagues, Shanker had the insight to \n     perceive and the courage to\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\n     acknowledge some harsh truths about our public schools. He \n     led teachers to recognize that public support for public \n     education could no longer be taken for granted, that schools \n     would need to set much higher standards of achievement for \n     all and that students would need to face serious consequences \n     for not attaining them--a stern message that went against the \n     dominant sentiments of students, teachers and parents alike.\n       Still, teachers adored him. They knew that he spoke with \n     conviction and good will. They respected and loved him for \n     being so brainy and honest, so much himself. ``Let Al be Al'' \n     was the resigned decision of his union's executive committee \n     after he had written some particularly forthright and \n     discomforting numbers of ``Where We Stand''--the weekly essay \n     through which he promulgated his ideas. Sometimes the ``We'' \n     was an editorial ``We'', in later years maybe a royal ``We.''\n       Among the educational leaders I have known, Shanker was the \n     most intellectually brilliant and tough-minded. He had talent \n     for clarity and trenchancy. But those gifts would have \n     counted for little had they not been joined to high \n     patriotism, a sense of responsibility, unflinching honesty, \n     imagination and courage. His brains alone would have made him \n     a distinguished CEO of a big organization that represented \n     hundreds of thousands of teachers. But his courage, honesty, \n     and imagination make him prophetic. If we are lucky enough to \n     follow in the direction he set, history will view him as a \n     pivotal figure in American educational renewal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/04/senate-section/article/S1931-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise to make a couple of comments \nabout the action that just took place here on the Senate floor with \nrespect to the balanced budget amendment and to express, obviously, my \ndisappointment as someone who supported the balanced budget amendment, \nmy disappointment that we did not succeed in passing what I believe is \na vitally important measure for this country's future. We will have \nanother day where we will be back here and try again, whether it is \nthis year or next year or in the next session of Congress, to fight \nthat fight again. In a sense, the battle is not lost; it only \ncontinues.\n  I am a little more concerned about another battle which I fear has at \nleast as lasting consequences as not passing this constitutional \namendment, and that is something that is important to all of us here \nand to all Americans. As important as our Constitution is the public's \nfaith in our institutions, our governmental institutions and the people \nwho serve in them.\n  One of the real concerns I have--in fact, I have been traveling \naround my State of Pennsylvania talking at a lot of high schools and \nexpressing there my concerns that a lot of young people choose not to \nvote. In fact, in the last election, of 18 to 24-year-olds, I believe \nonly a third even bothered to turn out to vote. That is a low since 18-\nyear-olds were given a right to vote. Not only that, but the last \nelection was the low point in turnout for the general electorate. I \nthink it was under 50 percent in the last Presidential election.\n  A lot of people have postulated as to what is going on with the \nAmerican public, that we seem to become either disinterested or cynical \nabout the electoral process and our Government in general. I think, \nunfortunately, what has happened in this debate over the last 2 weeks \nhas added to that cynicism, has added to the mistrust that many \nAmericans feel toward their institutions and toward the people who \nserve in those institutions.\n\n  I speak, of course, about the people who campaigned promising the \nelectors of their State that they would vote a certain way on what many \npeople consider the most important issue we will vote on here in this \nCongress. It is a seminal issue. It sort of divides you between the \npolitics of the old and the politics of the new, in my opinion. You had \nat least 12 Members in this most recent election who campaigned, and \ncampaigned vigorously, stating that they were going to support the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution in the same form they had \nsupported it in the House of Representatives. And yet not more than 3 \nor 4 months after their election, they have changed their minds.\n  Yes, the Constitution is important. Yes, amending the Constitution, \nin my opinion, is important. But public confidence in us is as \nimportant, for if the public does not see us as legitimate, if the \npublic does not see its institutions and the people who run them as \ntrustworthy, then the Constitution is not nearly as strong a document--\nin fact, some would suggest it is even a worthless document--because \ndemocracy cannot exist without the public faith in what we are about \nand the legitimacy of our Government.\n  So I think this debate is sad for, yes, the reason we did not pass \nthe balanced budget amendment. That is very sad. But I think the \ngreater long-term\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\nthreat to our country is public cynicism over this institution and all \nof our democratic institutions.\n  That was harmed and, in some places, it was devastated in the past \nfew weeks. That is something we will have a hard time with when \nfighting the battle again. It makes the battle to come back much \nharder. It is not as if we can bring this up again as we can a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. It now is something young and old \npeople will be looking at, what happened here, and saying, does \npolitics really matter? Why bother to vote; they do not mean what they \nsay anyway.\n  I commend the Members; some of them had very tough votes in bucking \ntheir President and their leaders, for standing up and doing the right \nthing, doing what they said they would do. When it comes down to it, in \nthis institution--and I suspect in every workplace in America--the \nbottom line comes down to you have nothing here except your word. You \nhave nothing except your word. With respect to me and my relationship \nto my constituents in Pennsylvania, I find that to be a solemn vow. My \nword means something. And if my word is no good, then they have every \nright to question me and question the institution in which I serve.\n  So I think we did have a defeat today. We had a defeat not for the \nconstitutional amendment. Yes, we had that defeat. We had a defeat for \nour institution. We had a defeat for our democracy. We had a defeat for \nthe process that legitimizes everything we do here. And that truly is a \nsad thing. It is a sad day for the Senate. It is even a sadder day for \nthis country.\n  I would just suggest as some anecdote to the people who feel \ndisenfranchised as a result of what happened here that most of the \npeople in this Senate did do what they said they were going to do, on \nboth sides of the aisle. Most of the Members of this Senate stood up \nand told the public the truth when it, frankly, may have not been easy \nto tell the truth. And from that, I think, we should take some solace, \nthat, in fact, most Members do stand up and say what they mean. And I \nhope that we can learn from this lesson, all of us learn from this \nlesson, the importance of having the public's faith in who we are, what \nwe say and what we do. It matters.\n  We have a lot of people in this town now who seem to be pushing the \nedge on a lot of activities. And you see the public just does not \nseem--I get this question all the time--to care about all these \nshenanigans that go on around here. I agree. I think there are so many \nshenanigans going on around here they discount them at the time. They \nthink they are all bad, and why is he any different than anyone else.\n  Wow, that is a dangerous sentiment in this country. That is a \nsentiment that gets you in trouble. We should be outraged when people \ndo things that are illegal, when people do things that are unethical. \nWe should be outraged when our public officials, whom we hold up to \nrepresent us, do not meet the standards that we ourselves meet, and we \nshould think differently about them because they do not meet those \nstandards.\n  It is a sad day, but I hope that we again have learned the lesson \nthat it is important for us to be men and women of our word. And that \ngoes beyond any bill, any amendment, any issue that we deal with in \nthis body. Once we understand that lesson, I think we will be a greater \nbody and a greater country as a result.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
