Mr. President, I rise today to address a subject that \nis both extraordinarily difficult and painful. In times of \ninternational turmoil, the Nation should rally behind our leaders, and \nwe are in the midst of such times. But President Clinton's abdication \nof the duties of leadership has made this impossible. The report of the \nindependent counsel is now under seal. When its contents are released \nto the Members of Congress, questions of criminal wrongdoing will \nunavoidably dominate this branch of government.\n  The Congress must determine whether the President will be impeached. \nI will not prejudge that question. As a Member of the body that will \ndeliberate on this issue, I believe it is important to have access to \nall the evidence before reaching a conclusion on the issue of \nimpeachment. Rather, I rise today to respectfully ask President Clinton \nto do the right thing for our country and resign from his office \nvoluntarily.\n  There are three reasons why I believe this has become necessary at \nthis point in time.\n  First, the President's conduct has all but destroyed his ability to \nlead as head of state and Commander in Chief.\n  Second, the President's actions have been corrosive to our national \ncharacter and have debased the Office of the Presidency.\n  Third, President Clinton should spare our Nation the debilitating \nspectacle of impeachment hearings.\n  Over the last several weeks, we have witnessed the disastrous \nconsequences abroad of diminished American leadership. There are some \nwho have said that the President's conduct is purely a private matter. \nThey are wrong. Private actions have public consequences. They do for \nall of us, but especially the President of the United States. In all of \ngovernance, but with foreign policy in particular, credibility is \neverything. Weakness is provocative; deceit can be deadly. When \nAmerican foreign policy is unpredictable, our allies are unreliable, \nand tyrants are emboldened. These hypothetical dangers have become \ntragic realities.\n\n  Yesterday afternoon, I chaired a hearing on U.S. foreign policy in \nIraq, for instance, and we heard from Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.N. \nSpecial Representative; James Woolsey, former CIA Director; and \nLawrence Eagleburger, former Secretary of State. What we heard was \ndeeply distressing. It appears that the President's policy toward Iraq \nconsists of paying lipservice to the importance of comprehensive and \nunrestricted weapons inspections and then preventing the arms \ninspectors from carrying out their mission.\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\n  Such abdication of leadership leaves Saddam Hussein free to build \nweapons of mass destruction, thus jeopardizing the security of our \ntroops, our allies in the region, and ultimately the United States \nitself. Nor is Iraq the only nation that has thumbed its nose at a \nweakened United States.\n  Around the world, rogue nations are violating fundamental human \nrights, waging wars of aggression, and flouting international treaties. \nOur ability to deter these acts has been sadly compromised by an \nabsence of leadership, a total lack of credibility. Enemies of our \nvalues and interests have judged the President's ability to lead the \nUnited States and have found it wanting. As a result, the world is a \nmuch more dangerous place.\n  Second, the President's actions have squandered his moral authority \nto lead at home. The problems of family breakdown and moral decay are \nthe most significant that we face. Just one comes glaringly out into \nmind: that nearly 30 percent of our children born in this country are \nborn to single moms, many of whom are teenagers having children.\n  Can the President, with the problems he has today, lead our fight in \nthat area? The President cannot address these problems when he himself \nhas contributed to the decay. One of the privileges and obligations of \nhigh office is to act as a role model for children. We need our \nPresident to set an example to be admired, not to be avoided. The \nPresident's ongoing adultery with an intern of barely legal age, misuse \nof the Oval Office, and repeated lies from he and his staff have done \nenormous damage to the body politic. Unfortunately, at the very time \nwhen most need strength, focused resolve, and moral leadership from our \nPresident, he has been unable to supply it. We live in a volatile world \nwith very real dangers and very difficult problems. We cannot afford to \nlet these dangers go unnoticed and problems unresolved by a President \nunable to lead.\n  I say all of this with great respect and with deep regret. President \nClinton is a talented man who believes in America and has spent his \nlife serving others.\n  Yet his immoral indiscretion, and months of lies to the Nation have \ntarnished his leadership ability beyond repair. None of us are without \nsin. But the high call of leadership demands a certain moral authority \nthat by the President's own actions is now lost.\n  There is a final point to be made. Very soon the contents of the \nindependent counsel's report will be made known publicly. The contents \nof this report will result in impeachment proceedings. Such hearings \nwill surely take a heavy toll on the function of our government, on the \ntrust invested in our civic institutions, and on the American people \nthemselves. President Clinton could spare us this ordeal. He could \nquickly and decisively enable our Nation to put this sorry chapter in \nour history behind us and to move on. But at this point there is only \none way for him to do that. Sadly and reluctantly, I have concluded \nthat the only way for us to move forward as a Nation is for the \nPresident to resign.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak on the issue of campaign finance reform, and that I be \nallowed to complete my statement even if it runs into the period \ndesignated for the campaign finance reform discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10143-6", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10144-S10145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this debate about the campaign finance \nbill is really about a single question, and that is what should \ndetermine the outcome of our Federal elections? Should money determine \nthe outcome of our Federal elections or should instead we have those \nelections determined by a balanced discussion, a complete and a \nbalanced discussion about the differences between the candidates and \nthe different positions they are taking? Should it be money or should \nit be helpful information for voters? Should it be money or should it \nbe a robust debate on issues?\n  The question that I just posed has been obscured because opponents of \ncampaign finance reform are hiding behind what I believe are mistaken \nSupreme Court decisions, and in doing so they have tried to equate \nmoney and speech. They argue that money is speech, and therefore to \nlimit money is to limit speech. They say that money means more robust \ndebate. They say that more money means more helpful information for \nvoters. They say that even more money means more complete and balanced \ndiscussion about the differences between the candidates.\n  In my view, this argument does not pass the laugh test. Any reasoned \nobserver of our Federal campaigns knows that the argument is without \nmerit. Ask any challenger to an incumbent Senator the following \nquestion: Have not the millions more in dollars that the incumbent has \nbeen spending on his or her reelection meant more robust debate? Have \nnot the millions of dollars that the incumbent has been spending meant \nmore helpful information to the voters and more complete and balanced \ndiscussion about the differences between the candidates? The \nchallenger, I am sure, would laugh out loud at that notion.\n  Ask any voter who has been deluged with negative television \nadvertisements funded by very large campaign war chests whether those \nTV ads have produced more robust debate and more helpful information \nfor the voters and more complete and balanced discussion of the \ndifferences between the candidates. Again, those voters will think that \nyou are crazy to even suggest that idea. The vast increase in money \nspent on political campaigns has not produced more robust debate. It \nhas not produced more helpful information for voters and more complete \nand balanced discussion about the differences between candidates.\n  More money has produced just exactly the opposite. Voters themselves \nwill tell you that money does not equal speech. In fact, they will tell \nyou that money is not speech and that money too often results in an \nundermining of our ability to meaningfully discuss issues in a \ncampaign. They are very specific about this. Voters were surveyed by \nPrinceton Survey Associates recently and those voters said that \ncampaign money leads elected officials to spend too much time \nfundraising--63 percent of the public believes that; that money not \nspeech determines the outcome of elections under the current system--52 \npercent of voters believe that.\n  Even more importantly, voters believe that campaign money gives one \ngroup more influence by keeping other groups from having their say in \npolicy outcomes. They believe that campaign money keeps important \nlegislation from being passed. They think campaign money leads elected \nofficials to support policies that even those elected officials do not \nthink are in the best interests of the country. And finally, the public \nbelieves that campaign money leads elected officials to vote against \nthe interests of their own constituents, the people who have sent them \nto Congress to represent them.\n  Let me add parenthetically that in this very Senate session the \nkilling of the tobacco bill in June, Congress' refusal now to even \nconsider serious HMO reform in the Senate, these are recent \nvindications of the people's beliefs about the effects of money on our \npolicymaking efforts.\n  So the argument by opponents of campaign finance reform that money is \nspeech and that it should in no way be limited simply does not pass the \nlaugh test with the American people. People are right that we \ndesperately need to reform our campaign finance system. We need to \nreduce the amount of money raised and spent in our campaigns. We need \nto increase the amount of robust debate and helpful information that we \nprovide to voters. We need to increase the discussion, the complete \ndiscussion about differences between candidates on issues of importance \nto the people.\n\n  The modified McCain-Feingold campaign reform bill offered to the \nSenate today is a big step in that direction. It\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\ndoes at least two very important things. First, it will reduce the \namount of big, unregulated donations from corporations and unions and \nwealthy individuals in our campaigns. Second, it will regulate the huge \namounts of money spent by so-called ``independent'' special interest \ngroups on advertising, which is disguised as ``issue ads'' but in fact \nis designed to advocate the defeat of a particular candidate.\n  The original McCain-Feingold bill did even more, but the bill had to \nbe scaled back to reduce the objections from some of the opponents to \ncampaign finance reform. I stand ready to support the motion to allow a \nvote on the modified version of McCain-Feingold. I hope today that \nminority of Senators who have repeatedly denied the people an up-or-\ndown vote on this bill will change their minds. I hope that with the \nhistoric passage of the bill by the House--representing a majority of \nthe voters of the United States--this minority of Senators will see \nthat they should not again thwart the clearly expressed will of the \npeople.\n  I hope this minority of Senators will not want to be the single force \nresponsible for continuing the undermining of our national political \nsystem that is accomplished each day by the millions and millions of \ndollars of unregulated campaign money when today they have a unique and \nhistoric opportunity to change all of that.\n  So, I hope those who have, in recent months, opposed the will of the \npeople on this vote, on this issue, will vote for cloture, will give \nthe people the up-or-down vote they very much want and very much \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10144-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ANGELA RAISH\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Ever gracious and thoughtful, she has been a wonderful \nfriend to my staff and me.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed \nto control the time of Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Alaska such \ntime as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky, who \nhas labored in the area of campaign finance for an extended period of \ntime, whose expertise many of us depend upon because once again this \nSenate is being called upon to reform our campaign finance laws.\n  As with many issues, the issue of so-called reforming the laws is \nsomewhat in the eyes of the beholder. As a consequence, I ask my \ncolleagues to consider this legislation in perhaps a different context. \nThe issue before this body, in my opinion, is simply: To what extent, \nif any, should the Federal Government regulate political free speech in \nAmerica? The campaign finance debate is not just about politicians and \ntheir campaigns. At the core of this debate are the values and freedoms \nguaranteed by the first amendment. As a consequence, I suggest when \nGovernment attempts to place limitations on speech, it has an \noverwhelming burden to demonstrate why such restrictions to our \nfundamental freedoms are necessary. Surely the Government can no more \ndictate how many words a newspaper can print than it can limit a \npolitical candidate's ability to communicate with his or her \nconstituents, yet that is precisely what the sponsors of this \nlegislation are proposing for candidates for office.\n  The McCain-Feingold legislation bristles with over a dozen different \nrestrictions on speech, provisions that I believe flagrantly violate \nthe first amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. I cannot \noveremphasize the point that was made by George F. Will in a Washington \nPost editorial. He stated, commenting on the McCain-Feingold bill:\n\n       Nothing in American history--not the left's recent ``campus \n     speech codes,'' nor the right's depredations during the 1950s \n     McCarthyism or the 1920 ``red scare,'' not the Alien and \n     Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the First \n     Amendment posed by campaign ``reforms'' advancing under the \n     protective coloration of political hygiene.\n\n  One of the most serious problems with this bill is that it contains \nrestrictions on ``express advocacy'' within 60 days of an election by \nindependent groups. And what is ``express advocacy''?\n  Mr. President, if this proposal ever becomes law, we can change the \nname of the Federal Election Commission to the Federal Campaign Speech \nPolice. Every single issue advertisement would be taped, reviewed, \nanalyzed, and perhaps litigated. The speech police will set up their \noffices in all of the 50 States to ensure the integrity of political \nadvertising. Is that what we in this Chamber really want? I don't think \nso. But that is what will eventually happen if we adopt McCain-\nFeingold.\n  I assure my colleagues, and hope they understand, that this wholesale \nencroachment on the first amendment would be immediately struck down by \nthe courts as unconstitutional.\n  Moreover, if a group of citizens decide to pool their money and \nadvocate their political position in newspaper advertisements and \ntelevision ads, what right does the Federal Government have to restrict \ntheir right of speech? Indeed, do we want to turn over the debate on \npolitical issues to the owners of the broadcast stations, the owners of \nthe newspapers, and the editorialists during the 60-day period leading \nup to an election? Would my colleagues who are supporting this bill be \nready to stand up and vote to ban election editorials in newspapers and \non television in the last 60 days of a campaign?\n  Many members of the public think we need fundamental changes to our \nelection financial laws because in the 1996 Presidential election they \nwitnessed the most abusive campaign finance strategy ever conceived in \nthis country.\n  There is an answer to those who abuse power. And the answer does not \nmean you have to shred the first amendment. The answer is a very simple \none. It is that our current election finance laws must be strictly \nenforced, something that this administration has been extremely \nreluctant to do for obvious reasons.\n  Mr. President, as grand jury indictments amass with regard to \nDemocratic fundraising violations in the 1996 Presidential election, we \nlearn more and more about President Clinton's use of the prerequisite \nof the Presidency as a fundraising tool. It is important to recall some \nof those abuses as we consider this debate.\n  You recall, Mr. President, the Lincoln bedroom. During the 5 years \nthat\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nPresident Clinton has resided in the White House, an astonishing 938 \nguests have spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom and generated at \nleast $6 million for the Democratic National Committee.\n  Presidential historian Richard Norton Smith stated there has ``never \nbeen anything of the magnitude of President Clinton's use of the White \nHouse for fundraising purposes * * * it's the selling of the White \nHouse.''\n  The Presidential coffees: President Clinton hosted 103 ``Presidential \ncoffees.'' Guests at these coffees, which included a convicted felon \nand a Chinese businessman who heads an arms trading company, donated \n$27 million to the Democratic National Committee.\n  President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, gave the President \nweekly memorandums which included projected moneys he expected at each \nof the ``Clinton coffees'' and what they would raise. He projected each \nwould raise no less than $400,000.\n  In the area of foreign contributions, investigations by both the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee and the Department of Justice \ninto campaign abuses into the 1996 Presidential campaign have revealed \nthat the Democrats recklessly accepted illegal foreign donations in \nexchange for Presidential access and other favors.\n  A few examples: We recall John Huang. John Huang raised millions of \ndollars in illegal foreign contributions for the Democratic National \nCommittee which the DNC has already returned.\n  John Huang, despite being wholly unqualified according to his \nimmediate boss, received an appointment to the Department of Commerce \nwhere he improperly accessed numerous classified documents pertaining \nto China.\n  John Huang made at least 67 visits to the White House, often meeting \nwith senior officials on U.S. trade policy. The committee had deemed \nthat this was unusual because Huang's position in Commerce was at a \nvery low level.\n  Senator Specter stated that the activities of Mr. Huang at the \nCommerce Department had ``all the earmarks of * * * espionage.''\n  Charlie Trie, a long-time friend of President Clinton, raised and \ncontributed at least $640,000 in contributions to the Clinton, Gore \nCampaign and for the Democratic National Committee.\n  Shortly thereafter, President Clinton signed an Executive Order that \nincreased the size of the U.S. Commission on Pacific Trade and then \nappointed Mr. Trie to the Commission.\n  On January 29th of this year, the Department of Justice indicted Trie \non charges that he funneled illegal foreign contributions to the 1996 \nClinton-Gore reelection campaign in order to buy access to top \nDemocratic Party and Clinton administration officials.\n  Vice President Gore was present at an event in a Buddhist temple \nwhere $80,000 in contributions to the Democratic National Committee \nwere laundered through penniless nuns and monks.\n  Vice President Gore offered differing characterizations of the \nBuddhist temple event. First, the Vice President described the event as \na ``community outreach.'' He later characterized it as a ``donor-\nmaintenance'' event where ``no money was offered or collected or raised \nat the event.''\n  However, the Department of Justice determined otherwise. So on \nFebruary 18, veteran Democratic fundraiser Maria Hsia was charged in a \nsix-count indictment by the Department of Justice for her part in \nraising the illegal contributions for the Democratic National Committee \nat the Buddhist temple event.\n\n  Mr. President, just the day before yesterday, our Attorney General \nordered a 90-day inquiry into whether President Clinton circumvented \nFederal election laws in 1996. This investigation could lead to yet \nanother independent counsel investigation. This 90-day inquiry is in \naddition to an inquiry focusing on Vice President Gore's statements \nabout his 1996 telephone fundraising calls in the White House.\n  Mr. President, our current campaign finance system has many flaws, \nbut the point I want to make to my colleagues is that these flaws do \nnot justify shredding the first amendment, especially because the \ncurrent occupant of the White House pushed the envelope of legality in \nhis search to finance his reelection campaign.\n  Mr. President, as Floyd Abrams, a noted first amendment lawyer, has \nstated:\n\n       First amendment principles should guide whatever \n     legislative solution we choose. The first principle is that \n     it is not for Congress to decide that political speech is \n     some sort of disease that we must quarantine.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this unconstitutional \ninfringement on free speech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his outstanding \nspeech and his contributions over the years to this important first \namendment discussion.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There was some discussion yesterday on the floor with \nregard to the issue of advocacy about a case called Furgatch. And the \nsupporters of McCain-Feingold spent a lot of time trying to interpret \nthe Furgatch decision as allowing the kind of suppression of issue \nadvocacy by citizens that I think clearly is a misreading of the case.\n  Those who advocate McCain-Feingold and, for that matter, the Snowe-\nJeffords substitute regulatory regimes, have precious few court cases \non which to base their arguments. Most prominent among these is the \nninth circuit's Furgatch decision, dating back to 1987. It is mighty \nslim, Mr. President, the Furgatch limb upon which their issue advocacy \nregulation case rests.\n  While Furgatch is not my favorite decision, it is certainly not the \nblank check for reformers who seek to shut down issue advocacy, either.\n  Furgatch was an express advocacy case, nothing short. It was about a \ndifferent subject. It was an express advocacy case, not an issue \nadvocacy case. It hinged on the content of the communication at issue--\nwords, explicit terms--just as the Supreme Court required in Buckley \nand reiterated in Massachusetts Citizens for Life.\n  The words in Furgatch were not those contained in Buckley's footnote \n52. Indeed, no one, least of all the Supreme Court, ever intended that \nthe list--also known as ``footnote 52''--was exhaustive. That would \ndefy common sense.\n  Desperate for even the thinnest constitutional gruel upon which to \nbase their regulatory zeal to extend their reach to everyone who dares \nto utter a political word in this country, the FEC leapt at Furgatch \nand won't let go. FEC lawyers misread it, they also misrepresent it, \nand are rewarded with loss after loss in the courts.\n  In last year's fourth circuit decision ordering the FEC to pay one of \nits victims, the Christian Action Network's attorneys' fees, the \nFurgatch-as-blank-check-for-issue-advocacy-regulation fantasy was \nthoroughly dissected, debunked and dispensed with.\n  The court in the Christian Action Network case puts Furgatch in the \nproper perspective. Let me just read a couple of parts of the Christian \nAction Network case.\n  The court says:\n\n       . . . less than a month following the Court's decision in \n     [Massachusetts Citizens for Life], the Ninth Circuit in FEC \n     v. Furgatch . . . could not have been clearer that it, too, \n     shared this understanding of the Court's decision in Buckley. \n     Although the court declined to ``strictly limit'' express \n     advocacy to the ``magic words'' of Buckley's footnote 52 \n     because that footnote's list does ``not exhaust the capacity \n     of the English language to expressly advocate election or \n     defeat of a candidate . . .\n       Curiously, the Ninth Circuit never cited or discussed the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in [Massachusetts Citizens for Life], \n     notwithstanding that [Massachusetts Citizens for Life] was \n     argued in the Supreme Court three months prior to the \n     decision in Furgatch and decided by the Court almost a month \n     prior to the Court of Appeals' decision. The Ninth Circuit \n     does discuss the First Circuit's opinion in [Massachusetts \n     Citizens for Life], but without noting that certiorari had \n     been granted to review the case. . . . Thus, the Furgatch \n     court relied upon Buckley alone, without the reaffirmation \n     provided by the Court in [Massachusetts Citizens for Life], \n     for its conclusion that explicit ``words'' or ``language'' of \n     advocacy are required if the Federal Election Campaign Act is \n     to be constitutionally enforced.\n       . . . the entire premise of the court's analysis was that \n     words of advocacy such as those recited in footnote 52 were \n     required to support Commission jurisdiction over a given \n     corporate expenditure.\n\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\n\n  The point here is that in case after case after case the FEC has lost \nin court seeking to restrict the rights of individual citizens to \nengage in issue advocacy. There is no basis for this effort. And the \ncourts have been turning them down and turning them down and turning \nthem down. In fact, there have been three cases in the last few months: \nNorth Carolina Right to Life versus Bartlett, April 30, 1998, an issue \nadvocacy case decided consistent with the observations the Senator from \nKentucky has made; Right to Life of Duchess County versus FEC, June 1, \n1998 of this year, another decision consistent with the points the \nSenator from Kentucky has made; and Virginia Society of Human Life \nversus Caldwell, June 5 of this year.\n  In short, there is no constitutional way--and importantly, we are not \ngoing to do that by passing this unfortunate legislation--but there is \nno constitutional way that the government can shut these people up at \nany point, up to and including the election. There is no legal basis, \nno constitutional basis for the assumption that there are any \nrestrictions that can be placed upon the ability of citizens to \ncriticize elected officials, or anyone else for that matter, up to and \nincluding the day before the election.\n  Finally, let me say, as I mentioned yesterday, the institutions in \nAmerica pushing the hardest for these restrictions on groups are the \nnewspapers who engage in issue advocacy every day, both in their news \nstories and on their editorial pages, up to and including the election. \nTheir issue advocacy would be totally untouched, and I am not arguing \nthat we should touch it. I think they are free to speak. What bothers \nme about the newspapers, particularly the New York Times, the \nWashington Post and USA Today, they want to shut everybody else up. \nThey want to have a free ride when it comes to criticizing political \nfigures in proximity to an election. Fortunately, the courts would not \nallow that.\n  This measure is not going to pass so we won't have to worry about it, \nbut it is a flawed concept, and I think it is important for our \ncolleagues to understand that.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 39 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \ncontrol the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to just take a moment of the time \nto point out that once again a case that the Senator from Kentucky has \nbeen discussing is a case that is appropriate in some situations but is \nnot really applicable to the current provision of the McCain-Feingold \nbill that is before the body. The Senator can stand up and cite all \nkinds of cases about a lot of provisions, but the provisions are not in \nthe bill at this time. So I hope those who are listening don't get \nconfused about case law that has nothing to do with our actual \namendment.\n  Previous versions of the McCain-Feingold bill included a codification \nof the Furgatch decision, but with the passage of the Snowe-Jeffords \namendment in February, the provision that we have before the Senate now \nsimply doesn't include that approach. It takes a different approach to \nthe issue advocacy problem. A number of constitutional scholars, \nincluding Dan Ortiz of Virginia Law School, believe this approach is \nconstitutional.\n  I understand the strategy--keep bringing up aspects of the bill that \nwere concerns in the past, make people think those are still there and \nget people to be uncomfortable with the bill. I understand the strategy \nbecause we have 52 votes already for this amendment as it actually is \nbeing presented. So that everyone understands, these are arguments \nagainst a bill that is not before the Senate. I assume that is because \nthey don't have very strong arguments against the bill that is, in \nfact, before the Senate.\n  This afternoon we will vote once again on the McCain-Feingold \ncampaign finance reform bill. Twice before we have debated this issue \nand twice we have been blocked by filibusters--I might add, not just by \nfilibusters conducted after an amending process has occurred, but \nfilibusters used to prevent the legitimate and normal process of \nallowing Members of the Senate to amend a bill.\n  Some may ask, Why do you keep bringing us back to vote on it? The \nreason, quite simply put, is that this is a crucial issue. It is a \ndefining issue for the 105th Congress. After all, we spent an entire \nyear investigating the campaign finance abuses of the 1996 elections. \nThat investigation, as the distinguished Senator from Tennessee who led \nthe investigation I am sure will tell us when he speaks today, showed \nbeyond a shadow of doubt that reform is needed. Of course, in response \nto that, the House has passed a strong campaign finance reform bill, \nvery similar to the amendment we have offered here.\n  We owe it to the American people to finish the job. The American \npeople elected us to be legislators, Mr. President, not just \ninvestigators. Investigations are fine and appropriate, but we will \nhave failed in our duties as legislators if we do not enact laws to \naddress the problems that our investigations uncover. With the House \nvote early last month, meaningful campaign finance reform is in sight. \nThis Senate has an obligation to address the campaign finance issue, \nand the public expects us to act. We know that a majority here \nunderstands that obligation. The question is whether we can get closer \nnow to the supermajority of 60 votes that we apparently will still need \nin order to end debate on this amendment and get to a vote on the \nmerits.\n  I hope that in the short time we have to debate this issue today we \nwill actually debate our amendment, what is before the Senate. Again, \nyesterday we heard a number of opponents of the bill speak at length \nabout cases that have nothing to do with the provisions that are \nactually in this bill. We heard a lengthy discussion of the history of \ncampaign spending, with interesting, but really not very relevant, \nexpositions about donors to an unsuccessful Presidential campaign 30 \nyears ago.\n  I really hope we hear an actual justification from those on the other \nside today, an actual justification for voting against a ban on the \nunlimited corporate and labor contribution to political parties known \nas soft money. I hope that when they wax eloquent again about the first \namendment rights of citizens, they will actually direct their criticism \nto our bill, to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment on electioneering \ncommunications, rather than severely exaggerating the effect and intent \nof those provisions.\n  To no one's surprise, the headlines this morning in the newspapers \nare not about campaign finance reform. The scandal that has occupied \nthe Nation's attention for the past 8 months has reached a new and \ncritical phase with the delivery of the Starr report to the House of \nRepresentatives. Many Senators are understandably very much concerned \nabout how the impeachment process will play out. But for now, the \nreport is on the other side of the Capitol. We still have a job to do \nhere. We have many things to do here. But first on the list has got to \nbe to somehow address the scandals that occupied our attention for much \nof 1997. Of course, the matters of 1998 have to be addressed, but are \nwe just going to leave the scandals of 1996 behind, let them be washed \naway as if nothing wrong was done?\n  The biggest threat to our democracy still comes from this out-of-\ncontrol campaign finance system, notwithstanding the very serious news \nof the day. Let us not be distracted from our duty to address that \nthreat.\n  There are many Senators who support reform who would like to speak \ntoday, and our time is limited. So let me conclude by putting my \ncolleagues on notice. The vote this afternoon on cloture will not be \nthe end of the effort to pass campaign finance reform this year. I am \nsorry if this is an issue that is inconvenient or uncomfortable for \nsome Senators to deal with. The American people didn't send us here for \nour convenience or for our comfort. They sent us to do a job, and we \nare going to do it.\n  This amendment that is pending will continue to be pending. I hope it \nwill become the subject of a legitimate legislative process. What I \nmean by that\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\nis, when there is an amendment that has a majority of support in this \nbody, at the bare minimum Senators should be allowed to offer \namendments, offer their ideas and their concepts about how to make it \nbetter. I understand the argument that you need 60 votes to pass it \nanyway. That has a lot of truth to it. But this process has repeatedly \nand cynically denied us the chance to simply amend the bill. That is \nhow they passed it in the House. Everybody didn't love the bill right \naway. They adopted a number of amendments. They were allowed to offer \ntheir ideas and vote on them.\n  We have been prohibited from improving this bill beyond the Snowe-\nJeffords amendment. Of course, we know why. When we did Snowe-Jeffords, \nlo and behold, we got three more votes and we had a majority. Then the \ngame was declared over. That is not a legitimate legislative process. \nThat is not a fair process. That is the intentional denying of the \nmajority of both Houses their right to fashion a bill that they can \nsend on to the President. So I am not denying the right to filibuster. \nBut denying the right to amend this amendment is well beyond the norm \nin this body, especially when we have demonstrated that 52 Senators are \nalready committed to this amendment as it currently stands. So they \ncontinue to deny the majority even the right to make a reasonable \nchange, to ask each other, ``What change would you like in order to \nmake this bill acceptable to you?'' I think that is highly \ninappropriate.\n  So the only way to avoid this discomfort is for Members to vote for \ncloture and let the majority do its will on this issue.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator from Maine is interested, I will yield \nto her. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I need 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance amendment before us. It is often said that \nwhen it comes to the important things in life, we don't get a second \nchance. Well, today, we are presented with such a second chance this \nyear to pass comprehensive, meaningful campaign finance reform. We have \na third chance this Congress, for which I thank Senators McCain and \nFeingold for their unflagging determination. I also want to thank the \nmajority leader for allowing us an opportunity to have another vote on \nthis issue on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  Indeed, it seems, to paraphrase Mark Twain, that reports of campaign \nfinance reform's demise have been greatly exaggerated. I hail authors \nof the House bill for their tenacity and the Members of the House who \ndefied conventional wisdom and passed a comprehensive reform bill along \nthe lines of McCain-Feingold.\n  We are back here to attach this legislation to this appropriations \nbill because the House of Representatives courageously chose to do \ntheir part to dispel the cynicism that hung over the Capitol like a \ncloud. They have brought this issue out into the light of day, and it \nis long past time that we here in the Senate do likewise.\n  When you consider the veritable mountain, indeed, the sheer cliff \nwall of legislative obstacles the Shays-Meehan bill had to overcome, it \nis unthinkable that we cannot overcome our hurdles in this Chamber. It \nwas truly a ``long and winding road'' for the Shays-Meehan bill which, \nat first, wasn't even going to be considered. Finally, when the \ndrumbeat for the Shays-Meehan bill would not die, a process was devised \nthat would allow for the consideration of 11 different plans and more \nthan 250 amendments.\n  The so-called ``Queen of the Hill'' contest played itself out from \nMay 21 through August 6. But in the end, when the smoke finally \ncleared, the Shays-Meehan bill remained standing in what has to be one \nof the most remarkable legislative victories in recent memory.\n  By a vote of 252-179--including 61 Republicans--Shays-Meehan was \npassed in the House in the face of overwhelming odds and, thus, our \nmandate was handed to us here in the Senate.\n  Like the House, we, too, have a majority who are already on record in \nfavor of reform--52 Senators--thanks to the leadership of Senators \nMcCain and Feingold in bringing this legislation to the floor earlier \nthis year. Unlike the House, we have twice failed to pass a bill. We \nhave twice failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to defeat a \nfilibuster. But for the very first time, as a result of the McCain-\nFeingold vote we had earlier this year, we received a majority in \nsupport of that legislation--the very first campaign finance reform \nbill to receive a majority vote here in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, I cannot believe there aren't eight other Senators in \nthis body who understand the fundamental issue we are faced with: the \nvery integrity of this institution, as well as the process that brings \nus here. When the House of Representatives can get a bipartisan \nmajority of 252 Members to understand the implications, people might \nwonder why it is so hard to find eight more Senators to do the same. I \nhave asked the same question myself.\n  Last week, Senator Lieberman, during a widely and deservedly praised \nspeech, stood in this Chamber and appealed to a higher principle than \npartisanship or the politics of self-preservation. He wasn't speaking \nof election reform, but his appeal to our more noble instincts is \nrelevant to this debate. In fact, it is integral.\n  Reforming our broken campaign system is not a Republican thing, not a \nDemocrat thing, but the right thing. It is something we owe to \nourselves as leaders, it is something we owe to this institution, and \nit is something we owe to the American people as participants in the \nworld's greatest democracy.\n  I know that some have said that the American people actually aren't \nvery concerned about this issue. They point to studies, such as a poll \nconducted this year by the Pew Research Center, which ranked campaign \nreform 13th on a list of 14 major issues. But let's look at the reason: \nThe report also said that public confidence in Congress to write an \neffective and fair campaign law had declined. In other words, the \nAmerican people have given up on us. They are betting we won't do it. \nThat is a sad commentary. I say, let's surprise them and do the right \nthing. I say, we have a solemn obligation not to justify their \ncynicism.\n  And to those who argue that now is not the time to take up this \nissue, my response is: What better time than now? This is the most \noptimum time to change the political dynamic today.\n  After an election in which the most corruptive elements were brought \nto bear, after we learn of illegal donations from the Chinese in an \nattempt to gain influence, after we learn of more than 45 fundraising \ncalls from the White House, after we learn that the President may have \ncontrolled advertising paid for by the DNC but aimed at reelecting the \nPresident, after the Attorney General launched three separate \npreliminary investigations in the last 2 weeks into these allegations, \nafter we learn of the explosion of soft money and electioneering ads--\nafter all of these things, now is the time to clean up the system.\n  Mr. President, I come to this debate as a veteran supporter of \ncampaign finance reform. As someone who has served on Capitol Hill for \nalmost 20 years, I understand the realities and I know there are \nconcerns on both sides of the aisle that whatever measure we may \nultimately pass, it must be fair, it must treat everyone as equitably \nas possible.\n  In fact, I agree with those concerns. That is the challenge that \nbrought Senator Jeffords and me to the table last October when we first \nattempted to consider this issue. It is what brought us back in \nFebruary, and it is the reason I am here again today.\n  I said last year that we should be putting our heads together, not \nbuilding walls between us with intractable rhetoric and all-or-nothing \npropositions. Senator Jeffords and I attempted to bridge the gulf \nbetween two sides and expand support for McCain-Feingold by making \nsensible incremental changes.\n  We were joined in this bipartisan effort by both Senators McCain and \nFeingold, as well as Senators Levin, Chafee, Lieberman, Thompson, \nCollins, Breaux, and Specter.\n  I thank them again for their tremendous help and support.\n  Together we not only won adoption of the amendment, but we helped \nbring\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nthis body to the first real vote on campaign finance reform and moved \nthe debate forward by actually having the debate, and we solidified \nmajority support for McCain-Feingold.\n  I would like to take a few moments to speak about the provisions of \nthe Snowe-Jeffords measure and why I think this measure is now \nconsidered worthy of the support of my Republican colleagues.\n  The McCain-Feingold measure we are now considering takes a tremendous \nstep forward by putting an end to soft money, tightening coordination \ndefinitions, and working to level the playing field for candidates \nfacing opponents with vast personal wealth spent on their own \ncampaigns. It also addresses the issues concerning the use of \nunregulated and undisclosed advertising that affects Federal elections, \nand the concerns that the original bill's attempt at addressing this \nissue would not withstand court scrutiny. This is important because if \nthe courts had ruled the bill's efforts to address the distinction \nbetween true advocacy ads that influence Federal elections to be \nunconstitutional, then essentially all that would remain would be a ban \non soft money. If that were to happen, we would be left with only one-\nhalf of the equation, and I share the concerns of those who want to see \nbalanced reform--and a level playing field, not throw it even further \noff kilter.\n  The Snowe-Jeffords approach would be much more likely to pass court \nmuster. It was developed in consultation with noted constitutional \nscholars and reformers such as Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise \nInstitute and Josh Rosenkrantz, Director of the Brennan Center for \nJustice at NYU, as well as others. And it goes to the heart of the \n``stealth advocacy ads'' which purport to be only about issues but are \nreally designed to influence the outcome of federal elections.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the document from the \nBrennan Center for Justice be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the approach in this amendment is a \nstraightforward, two tiered one that only applies to advertisements \nthat constitute the most blatant form of electioneering. It only \napplies to ads run on radio or television, 30 days before a primary and \n60 days before a general election, that identify a federal candidate. \nAnd only if over $10,000 is spent on such ads in a year. What is \nrequired is disclosure of the ads' sponsor and major donors, and a \nprohibition on the use of union dues or corporate treasury funds to \nfinance the ads.\n\n  We called this new category ``electioneering ads''. They are the only \ncommunications addressed, and we define them very narrowly and \ncarefully.\n  If the ad is not run on television or radio; if the ad is not aired \nwithin 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election, if the ad \ndoesn't mention a candidate's name or otherwise identify him clearly, \nif it isn't targeted at the candidate's electorate, or if a group \nhasn't spent more than $10,000 in that year on these ads, then it is \nnot an electioneering ad.\n  If is an item appearing in a news story, commentary, voter guides or \neditorial distributed through a broadcast station, it is also not an \nelectioneering ad. Plain and simple.\n  If one does run an electioneering ad, two things happen. First, the \nsponsor must disclose the amount spent and the identity of contributors \nwho donated more than $500 to the group since January 1st of \nthe previous year. Right now, candidates have to disclose campaign \ncontributions over $200--so the threshold contained in McCain-Feingold \nis much higher. Second, the ad cannot be paid for by funds from a \nbusiness corporation or labor union--only voluntary contributions.\n  The clear, narrow wording of the amendment is important because it \npasses two critical first amendment doctrines that were at the heart of \nthe Supreme Court's landmark Buckley versus Valeo decision: vagueness \nand overbreadth. The rules of this provision are clear. And the \nrequirements are strictly limited to ads run near an election that \nidentify a candidate--ads plainly intended to convince voters to vote \nfor or against a particular candidate.\n\n  Nothing in this provision restricts the right of any group to engage \nin issue advocacy. Nothing prohibits groups from running electioneering \nads, either. Let me be clear on this: if this bill becomes law, any \ngroup running issues ads today can still run issue ads in the future, \nwith no restrictions on content. And any group running electioneering \nads can still run those ads in the future, again with absolutely zero \nrestrictions on content.\n  So to those who will argue, as they did in February, that this \nmeasure runs afoul of the first amendment, I say that that is simply a \nred herring, Mr. President. And you don't have to take my word for it. \nConstitutional scholars from Stanford Law to Georgia Law to Loyola Law \nto Vanderbilt Law have endorsed the approach that is now part of this \nlegislation.\n  If anything, Mr. President, this provision underscores first \namendment rights for union members and shareholders by protecting them \nfrom having their money used for electioneering ads they may not agree \nwith, while maintaining the right of labor and corporate management to \nspeak through PACs.\n  This is a sensible, reasonable approach to addressing a burgeoning \nsegment of electioneering that is making a mockery of our campaign \nfinance system. How can anyone not be for disclosure? How can anyone \nsay that less information for the public leads to better elections? \nDon't the American people have the right to know who is paying for \nthese stealth advocacy ads, and how much?\n  This problem is not going to go away, Mr. President. The year 1996 \nmarked a turning point in American elections--make no mistake about it.\n  The Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania \npublished a report this year on so-called issue advertising during the \n1996 elections, and if any member of the Senate hasn't read it I \nrecommend you get hold of a copy.\n  As this first chart demonstrates, the report finds that, during the \n1996 elections, anywhere from $135 million to $150 million was spent by \nthird-party organizations in the 1996 election on radio and TV ads. \nThis totals almost one-third of the amount of money that was spent in \nthe election; $400 million was spent by all candidates for President, \nU.S. Senate, and the House, but other organizations spent a third of \nall of the money that was spent in the last election.\n  Then chart two, if there is any doubt about the intent of these ads, \nindicates, according to the Annenberg Report, that in a study of 109 \nads that were supported by 29 different organizations, almost 87 \npercent of those so-called issue ads referred to a candidate, and 41 \npercent of those issue ads were identified by the public as being \n``attack ads''--41 percent. Almost 87 percent of these so-called issue \nads identified a candidate. That is the highest percentage recorded \namong a group that also included Presidential ads, debates, free-time \nsegments, and news program organizations.\n  Clearly, these ads were overtly aimed at electing or defeating \ntargeted candidates, but under current law they aren't even subject to \ndisclosure requirements. We are only talking about those individuals \nwho provide $500 or more to an organization that runs ads identifying a \ncandidate 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general \nelection.\n  But let's look at the ads that I am talking about. Again, we are \ntalking about stealth advocacy ads. First, you get the ``True Issue \nAd,'' according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which says that \n``McCain-Feingold would have no impact on True Issue Ads.'' It says \nhere that it is ``A True Issue Ad.'' It says:\n\n       This election year, America's children need your vote. Our \n     public schools are our children's ticket to the future. But \n     education has become just another target for attack by \n     politicians who want huge cuts in education programs. They're \n     making the wrong choices. Our children deserve leaders who \n     will strengthen public education, not attack it. They deserve \n     the best education we can give them. So this year, vote as if \n     your children's future depends on it. It does.\n\n  That is a true issue ad.\n  Look at chart four. This is what I call a ``Stealth Advocacy Ad.'' \nThis is what McCain-Feingold would define as ``Electioneering \nCommunications.''\n  That is totally permissible under any of the rulings that have been \nmade and\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\nrendered by the Supreme Court, because those distinctions can be made \nbetween electioneering and between constitutionally permitted freedom \nof speech.\n  This is a stealth advocacy ad:\n\n       Mr. X promised he'd be different. But he's just another \n     Washington politician. Why, during the last year alone he has \n     taken over $260,000 from corporate special interest groups. . \n     . . But is he listening to us anymore?\n\n  That identifies a candidate.\n  I defy anyone to tell me with a straight face that the intent of this \nstealth advocacy ad is anything other than to advocate for the defeat \nof candidate X. That is the kind of ad that is covered by the McCain-\nFeingold measure.\n  Let me tell you something. This ad could still run. Any group in \nAmerica can run any ad that they want before the election identifying a \ncandidate. But the fact is it would require disclosure of those donors \nwho provide more than $500 to that organization, if these ads run 30 \ndays before a primary or 60 days before a general election. And the \nmoney could not be funded by unions or corporations through their \ntreasuries. If they want to finance these ads, by unions or \ncorporations, they will have to do so by a PAC, if these ads run 30 \ndays before a primary and 60 days before a general election.\n\n  So what are we talking about? Disclosure. That is what we are talking \nabout. And 87 percent of these issue ads, these so-called issue ads, \nare what I would call stealth advocacy ads, because they identify a \ncandidate but we don't know who finances these ads. This, on the other \nhand, is a true issue ad. It doesn't identify a candidate. Groups can \nrun ads saying: ``Call your Senator. Call your Member of Congress.'' \nThey don't have to identify the candidate. But if they do, it requires \ndisclosure of their major donors.\n  Mr. President, we are accountable to the people. We are required as \ncandidates for office to file disclosure forms as candidates. PACs are \nrequired to disclose. But hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on \nthese ads without one dime being reported--not one dime. And I remind \nyou that one-third of the money that was spent in the last election, in \n1996, was spent by organizations that did not have to disclose one \ndime. And there is no reason to think it will not get worse.\n  You do not need a crystal ball. Just look at some of the special \nelections this year. For example, it has been widely reported that just \none group spent $200,000 on special election TV commercials. We don't \nhave the total of exactly how much was spent overall, because there is \ncurrently no accountability, no disclosure. That is what the McCain-\nFeingold legislation is addressing.\n  And think about this. Overall, national party committees raised over \n$115 million in soft money during the first 18 months of the 1997-1998 \nelection cycle, the most money ever on a nonpresidential election \ncycle. Total soft money contributions to both Democrats and Republicans \nhave more than doubled during the past 4 years. In fact, soft money \ncontributions to national party committees have grown by 131 percent \nfrom the first 18 months of the 1993-1994 election cycle compared to \nthe same period in this 1997-1998 election cycle--grown 131 percent.\n  Enough is enough. I have said before that it is the duty of leaders \nto lead, and that means making some difficult choices. I know this is \nnot an easy vote. It requires looking at ourselves and asking what is \nimportant, protecting the status quo, or is it protecting the integrity \nof our system of elections?\n  How we choose our elected officials goes to the heart of who we are \nas a nation. It defines us as a country and it defines whether or not \nwe will continue to maintain the integrity of this process. But there \nis a very great danger that if we do nothing, if we shroud ourselves in \nthe rhetoric of absolutism, if we turn our backs on a monumental \nopportunity that we now have, then our mantle of greatness will decay \nfrom the inside, because if the American people lose faith in the \nsystem that elects our public officials, they have lost faith in the \nintegrity of Government itself, and we cannot allow this to happen. We \ncannot preside over this disintegration of public trust.\n  Eight votes stand between us and a reform bill. Eight votes stand \nbetween us and the passage of the McCain-Feingold legislation. After \ntwo tries in the Senate, the labyrinthian parliamentary procedure, \nhundreds of amendments, and a ``Queen of the Hill'' contest in the \nHouse, all that is holding back a reform bill this year is eight \nSenators. This is our chance, my friends, and I implore my colleagues \nto seize this historic opportunity. After this vote, there will be no \ndoubt who stands four square behind fair, sensible, meaningful reform \nand who does not.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for yielding me the \ntime and for his leadership and his commitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                        Brennan Center for Justice\n\n\n                                         at NYU School of Law,\n\n                                  New York, NY, February 20, 1998.\n     Re NRLC objections to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment.\n       Dear Senator: We write to rebut letters from the National \n     Right to Life Committee (NRLC), dated February 17 and \n     February 20, 1998, in opposition to the Snowe-Jeffords \n     Amendment to the McCain-Feingold Bill. NRLC mischaracterizes \n     what the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would achieve and \n     misrepresents constitutional doctrine. The Amendment would \n     not restrict the ability of advocacy groups such as NRLC to \n     engage in either issue advocacy or electioneering. But it \n     would prevent them from (1) hiding from the public the \n     amounts they spend on the most blatant form of \n     electioneering; (2) keeping secret the identities of those \n     who bankroll their electioneering messages with large \n     contributions; and (3) funneling funds from business \n     corporations and labor unions into electioneering. These \n     goals, and the means used to achieve them, are \n     constitutionally permissible.\n\n\n               What the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment Would Do\n\n       The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment applies only to advertisements \n     that constitute the most blatant form of electioneering. If \n     an ad does not satisfy every one of the following criteria, \n     none of the restrictions or disclosure rules of the Snowe-\n     Jeffords Amendment would be triggered: Medium: The ad must be \n     broadcast on radio or television. Timing: The ad must be \n     aired shortly before an election--within 60 days before a \n     general election (or special election) or 30 days before a \n     primary. Candidate-Specific: The ad must mention a \n     candidate's name or identify the candidate clearly. \n     Targeting: The ad must be targeted at voters in the \n     candidate's state. Threshold: The sponsor of the ad must \n     spend more than $10,000 on such electioneering ads in the \n     calendar year.\n       If, and only if, an electioneering ad meets all of the \n     foregoing criteria, do the following rules apply:\n       Restriction: The electioneering ad cannot be paid for \n     directly or indirectly by funds from a business corporation \n     or labor union. Individuals, PACs, and most nonprofits can \n     engage in unlimited advocacy or the sort covered by the \n     Snowe-Jeffords Amendment. The Amendment would prohibit these \n     advocacy groups from financing their electioneering ads with \n     funds from business corporations or labor unions. Since it is \n     already illegal for business corporations and labor unions to \n     engage in electioneering, these limitations are intended to \n     prevent evasion of otherwise valid federal restrictions.\n       Disclosure: The sponsor of an electioneering ad must \n     disclose the amount spent and the identity of contributors \n     who donated more than $500 toward the ad. This requirement is \n     necessary to prevent contributors from evading federal \n     reporting requirements by funneling contributions intended to \n     influence the outcome of an election through advocacy groups.\n\n\n    the nrlc's misrepresentations about the snowe-jeffords amendment\n\n       The NRLC has so completely distorted the effect of the \n     Snowe-Jeffords Amendment with false and misleading \n     allegations that it is important at the outset to set the \n     record straight.\n       The Amendment would not prohibit groups such as NRLC from \n     disseminating electioneering communications. Instead, it \n     would merely require the NRLC to disclose how much it is \n     spending on electioneering broadcasts and who is bankrolling \n     them.\n       The Amendment would not prohibit NRLC and others from \n     accepting corporate or labor funds. If it wished to accept \n     corporate or labor funds, it would simply have to take steps \n     to ensure that those funds could not be spent on blatant \n     electioneering messages.\n       NRLC and similar organizations would not have to create a \n     PAC or other separate entity in order to engage in the types \n     of electioneering covered by the Amendment. Rather, they \n     would simply have to deposit the money they receive from \n     corporations and unions (or other restricted sources) into \n     separate bank accounts.\n       The Amendment would not bar or require disclosure of \n     communications by print media, direct mail, or other non-\n     broadcast modes of communication. NRLC and similar advocacy \n     groups would be able to organize their members or communicate \n     with the public at large through mass communications such as \n     newspaper advertisements, mass mailings, voter guides, or \n     billboards, to\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\n     the same extent currently permitted by law. There is no \n     provision in the current version of the Snowe-Jeffords \n     Amendment that changes any of the rules regarding those non-\n     broadcast forms of communication.\n       The Amendment would not affect the ability of any \n     organization to ``urge grassroots contacts with lawmakers \n     regarding an upcoming vote in Congress.'' The Amendment \n     has no effect on a broadcast directing the public, for \n     example, to ``Urge your congressman and senator to vote \n     against [`or in favor of'] the McCain-Feingold bill.'' The \n     sponsor could even give the telephone number for the \n     audience to call. And the ad would be free fom all the \n     Amendment's new disclosure rules and source rules--even if \n     the ad is run the day before the election. By simply \n     declining to name ``Congressman X'' or ``Senator Y,'' \n     whose election is imminent and the outcome of which NRLC \n     presumably does not intend to affect, NRLC could run its \n     issue ad free from both the minimal disclosure rules and \n     the prohibition on use of business and union funds.\n       The Amendment's disclosure rules do not require invasive \n     disclosure of all donors. They require disclosure only of \n     those donors who pay more than $500 to the account that funds \n     the ad.\n       The Amendment would not require advance disclosure of the \n     contents of an ad. It would require disclosure only of the \n     amount spent, the sources of the money, and the identity of \n     the candidate whose election is targeted.\n\n\n                    Basic Constitutional Principles\n\n       NRLC is simply mistaken in suggesting that the minimal \n     disclosure rules and the restrictions on corporate and union \n     electioneering contained in the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment are \n     unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has made clear that, for \n     constitutional purposes, electioneering is different from \n     other speech. See FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 \n     U.S. 238, 249 (1986). Congress has the power to enact \n     campaign finance laws that constrain the spending of money on \n     electioneering in a variety of ways, even though spending on \n     other forms of political speech is entitled to absolute First \n     Amendment protection. See generally Buckley v. Valeo, 424 \n     U.S. 1 (1976). Congress is permitted to demand that the \n     sponsor of an electioneering message disclose the amount \n     spent on the message and the sources of the funds. And \n     Congress may prohibit corporations and labor unions from \n     spending money on electioneering. This is black letter \n     constitutional law about which there can be no serious \n     dispute.\n       There are, of course, limits to Congress's power to \n     regulate election-related spending. But there are two \n     contexts in which the Supreme Court has granted Congress \n     freer reign to regulate. First, Congress has broader latitude \n     to require disclosure of election-related spending than it \n     does to restrict such spending. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67-\n     68. In Buckley, the Court declared that the governmental \n     interests that justify disclosure of election-related \n     spending are considerably broader and more powerful than \n     those justifying prohibitions or restrictions on election-\n     related spending. Disclosure rules, the Court opined, in \n     contrast to spending restrictions or contribution limits, \n     enhance the information available to the voting public. Plus, \n     the burdens on free speech rights are far less significant \n     when Congress requires disclosure of a particular type of \n     spending than when it prohibits the spending outright or \n     limits the funds that support the speech. Disclosure rules, \n     according to the Court, are ``the least restrictive means of \n     curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and corruption.'' \n     Thus, even if certain political advertisement cannot be \n     prohibited or otherwise regulated, the speaker might still be \n     required to disclose the funding sources for those ads if the \n     governmental justification is sufficiently strong.\n       Second, Congress has a long record, which has been \n     sustained by the Supreme Court, of imposing more onerous \n     spending restrictions on corporations and labor unions than \n     on individuals, political action committees, and \n     associations. Since 1907, federal law has banned corporations \n     from engaging in electioneering. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b(a). \n     In 1947, that ban was extended to prohibit unions from \n     electioneering as well. Id. As the Supreme Court has pointed \n     out, Congress banned corporate and union contributions in \n     order ``to avoid the deleterious influences on federal \n     elections resulting from the use of money by those who \n     exercise control over large aggregations of capital.'' United \n     States v. UAW, 352 U.S. 567, 585 (1957). As recently as 1990, \n     the Court reaffirmed this rationale. See Austin v. Michigan \n     Chamber of Commerce, 491 U.S. 652 (1990); FEC v. National \n     Right to Work Committee, 459 U.S. 197 (1982). The Court \n     emphasized that it is perfectly constitutional for the state \n     to limit the electoral participation of corporations because \n     ``[s]tate law grants [them] special advantages--such as \n     limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of \n     the accumulation of and distribution of assets,'' Austin, 491 \n     U.S. at 658-59. Having provided these advantages to \n     corporations, particularly business corporations, the state \n     has no obligation to ``permit them to use `resources amassed \n     in the economic marketplace' to obtain `an unfair advantage \n     in the political marketplace.'' (quoting, MCFL, 479 U.S. at \n     257).\n       The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment builds upon these bedrock \n     principles, extending current regulation cautiously and only \n     in the areas in which the First Amendment protection is at \n     its lowest ebb.\n\n\n               Congress Is Not Stuck with ``Magic Words''\n\n       The Supreme Court has never held that there is only a \n     single constitutionally permissible route a legislature may \n     take when it defines ``electioneering'' to be regulated or \n     reported. The Court has not prescribed certain ``magic \n     words'' that are regulable and placed all other \n     electioneering beyond the reach of any campaign finance \n     regulation. NRLC's argument to the contrary is based on a \n     fundamental misreading of the Supreme Court's opinion in \n     Buckley v. Valeo.\n       In Buckley, the Supreme Court reviewed the \n     constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     (FECA). One section of FECA imposed a $1,000 limit on \n     expenditures ``relative to a clearly identified candidate,'' \n     and another section imposed reporting requirements for \n     independent expenditures of over $100 ``for the purpose of \n     influencing'' a federal election. The Court concluded that \n     these regulations ran afoul of two constitutional doctrines--\n     vagueness and overbreadth--that pervade First Amendment \n     jurisprudence.\n       The vagueness doctrine demands precise definitions. Before \n     the government punishes someone--especially for speech--it \n     must articulate with sufficient precision what conduct is \n     legal and what is illegal. A vague or imprecise definition of \n     electioneering might ``chill'' some political speakers who, \n     although they desire to engage in discussions of political \n     issues, may fear that their speech could be punished.\n       Even if a regulation is articulated with great clarity, it \n     may still be struck as overbroad. A restriction that covers \n     regulable speech (and does so clearly) can be struck if it \n     sweeps too broadly and covers a substantial amount of \n     constitutionally protected speech as well. But under \n     the overbreadth doctrine, the provision will be upheld \n     unless its overbreadth is substantial. A challenger cannot \n     topple a statute simply by conjuring up a handful of \n     applications that would yield unconstitutional results.\n       Given these two doctrines, it is plain why FECA's clumsy \n     provisions troubled the Court. Any communication that so much \n     as mentions a candidate--any time and in any context--could \n     be said to be ``relative to'' the candidate. And it is \n     difficult to predict what might ``influence'' a federal \n     election.\n       The Supreme Court could have simply struck FECA, leaving it \n     to Congress to develop a narrower and more precise definition \n     of electioneering. Instead, the Court intervened by \n     essentially rewriting Congress's handiwork itself. In order \n     to avoid the vagueness and overbreadth problems, the Court \n     interpreted FECA to reach only funds used for communications \n     that ``expressly advocate'' the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate. In an important footnote, the \n     Court provided some guidance on how to decide whether a \n     communication meets that description. The Court stated that \n     its revision of FECA would limit the reach of the statute \n     ``to communications containing express words of advocacy of \n     election or defeat, such as `vote for,' `elect,' `support,' \n     `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' `vote against,' \n     `defeat,' `reject.' '' Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44 n.52.\n       But the Court emphatically did not declare that all \n     legislatures were stuck with these magic words, or words like \n     them, for all time. To the contrary, Congress has the power \n     to enact a statute that defines electioneering in a more \n     nuanced manner, as long as its definition adequately \n     addresses the vagueness and overbreadth concerns expressed by \n     the Court.\n       Any more restrictive reading of the Supreme Court's opinion \n     would be fundamentally at odds with the rest of the Supreme \n     Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Countless other \n     contexts--including libel, obscenity, fighting words, and \n     labor elections--call for delicate line drawing between \n     protected speech and speech that may be regulated. In none of \n     these cases has the Court adopted a simplistic bright-line \n     approach. For example, in libel cases, an area of core First \n     Amendment concern, the Court has rejected the simple bright-\n     line approach of imposing liability based on the truth or \n     falsity of the statement published. Instead the Court has \n     prescribed an analysis that examines, among other things, \n     whether the speaker acted with reckless disregard for the \n     truth of falsity of the statement and whether a reasonable \n     reader would perceive the statement as stating actual facts \n     or merely rhetorical hyperbole. See, e.g., Milkovich v. \n     Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 14-17 (1990). Similarly, in \n     the context of union representation elections, employers are \n     permitted to make ``predictions'' about the consequences of \n     unionizing but they may not issue ``threats.'' The courts \n     have developed an extensive jurisprudence to distinguish \n     between the two categories, yet the fact remains that an \n     employer could harbor considerable uncertainty as to whether \n     or not the words he is about to utter are sanctionable. The \n     courts are comfortable with the uncertainty of these tests \n     because they have provided certain concrete guidelines.\n       In no area of First Amendment jurisprudence has the Court \n     mandated a mechanical test that ignores either the context of \n     the speech at issue or the purpose underlying the regulatory \n     scheme. In no area of First Amendment jurisprudence has the \n     Court held that the only constitutionally permissible test is \n     one that would render the underlying regulatory scheme \n     unenforceable. It is doubtful, therefore, that the Supreme \n     Court\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\n     in Buckley intended to single out election regulations as \n     requiring a mechanical, formulaic, and utterly unworkable \n     test.\n\n\n    The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment's Prohibition is Precise and Narrow\n\n       The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment presents a definition of \n     electioneering carefully crafted to address the Supreme \n     Court's dual concerns regarding vagueness and overbreadth. \n     Because the test for prohibited electioneering is defined \n     with great clarity, it satisfies the Supreme Court's \n     vagueness concerns. Any sponsor of a broadcast will know, \n     with absolute certainty, whether the ad depicts or names a \n     candidate, how many days before an election it is being \n     broadcast, and what audience is targeted. There is little \n     danger that a sponsor would mistakenly censor its own \n     protected speech out of fear of prosecution under such a \n     clear standard.\n       The prohibition is also so narrow that it easily satisfies \n     the Supreme Court's overbreadth concerns. Any speech \n     encompassed by the prohibition is plainly intended to \n     convince voters to vote for or against a particular \n     candidate. A sponsor who wishes simply to inform the public \n     at large about an issue immediately before an election could \n     readily do so without mentioning a specific candidate and \n     without targeting the message to the specific voters who \n     happen to be eligible to vote for that candidate. It is \n     virtually impossible to imagine an example of a broadcast \n     that satisfies this definition even though it was not \n     intended to influence the election in a direct and \n     substantial way. Though a fertile image might conjure up a \n     few counter-examples, the would not make the law \n     substantially overbroad.\n       The careful crafting of the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment stands \n     in stark contrast to the clumsy and sweeping prohibition that \n     Congress originally drafted in FECA. Unlike the FECA \n     definition of electioneering, the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment \n     would withstand constitutional challenge without having to \n     resort to the device of narrowing the statute with magic \n     words. Congress could, if it wished, apply the basic rules \n     that currently govern electioneering to all spending that \n     falls within this more realistic definition of \n     electioneering. Congress could, for example, declare that \n     only individuals and PACs (and the most grassroots of \n     nonprofit corporations) could engage in electioneering that \n     falls within this broadened definition. It could impose \n     fundraising restrictions, prohibiting individuals from \n     pooling large contributions toward such electioneering.\n       But, of course, the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment does not go \n     that far. The flat prohibition applies not to advocacy groups \n     like NRLC, but only to business corporations and labor \n     unions--and to the sorts of nonprofits that are already \n     severely limited in their ability to lobby. The expansion in \n     the definition of electioneering will not constrain NRLC from \n     engaging in grassroots advocacy or spending the money it \n     raises from its members for electioneering purposes. An \n     individual, any other group of individuals, an association, \n     and most nonprofit corporations can spend unlimited funds on \n     electioneering that falls within the expanded definition and \n     can raise funds in unlimited amounts, so long as they take \n     care to insulate the funds they use on electioneering from \n     funds they collect from business corporations, labor unions, \n     or business activities. Since all corporations and labor \n     unions receive reduced First Amendment protection in the \n     electioneering context--remember.  they can be flatly barred \n     from electioneering at all--the application of the new \n     prohibition only to labor unions and certain types of \n     corporation is certainly constitutional.\n\n\n                  the extended disclosure requirement\n\n       NRLC incorrectly argues that the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment's \n     disclosure requirements infringe on the public's First \n     Amendment right to engage in secret electioneering. In short, \n     there is not such right. In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections \n     Commission, 115 S. Ct. 1511 (1995), the Court was careful to \n     distinguish the anonymous pamphleteering against a referendum \n     at issue in that case from the disclosure rules governing \n     electioneering for or against a particular candidate for \n     office that were permitted in Buckley. Similarly, NRLC \n     improperly relies on NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), \n     which recognizes a limited right of anonymity for groups that \n     have a legitimate fear of reprisal if their membership lists \n     or donors are publicly disclosed. NRLC, like any other group, \n     may be entitled to an exemption from electioneering \n     disclosure laws if it can demonstrate a reasonable \n     probability that compelled disclosure will subject its \n     members to threats, harassment, or reprisals. See McIntyre, \n     112 S. Ct. at 1524 n.21. But the need for these kinds of \n     limited exceptions certainly do not make the general \n     disclosure rules contained in Snowe-Jeffords \n     unconstitutional.\n       Since the new prohibition in the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment \n     does not apply to the funds of individuals, associations, or \n     most nonprofit corporations, the First Amendment implications \n     for them are diminished. They will simply be required to \n     report their spending on speech that falls within the \n     broadened definition of electioneering, just as they \n     currently must report the sources and amounts of their \n     independent expenditures. They would be required to disclose \n     the cost of the advertisement, a description of how the money \n     was spent, and the names of individuals who contributed more \n     than $500 towards the ad. Contrary to the NRLC's claim, they \n     will never be required to disclose in advance any ad copy \n     that they intend to air.\n       The overbreadth and vagueness rules are particularly strict \n     when applied to rules that restrict speech--such as the \n     aspect of the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment that bars business \n     corporations and labor unions from spending any funds on \n     electioneering. But, as the Supreme Court has observed, \n     disclosure rules do not restrict speech significantly. \n     Disclosure rules do not limit the information that is \n     conveyed to the electorate. To the contrary, they increase \n     the flow of information. For that reason, the Supreme Court \n     has made clear that rules requiring disclosure are subject to \n     less exacting constitutional strictures than direct \n     prohibitions on spending. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 68. There \n     is no constitutional bar to expanding the disclosure rules to \n     provide accurate information to voters about the sponsors of \n     ads indisputably designed to influence their vote.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment is a sensitive and sensible \n     approach to regulating spending that has made a mockery of \n     federal campaign finance laws. It regulates in the two \n     contexts--corporate and union spending and disclosure rules--\n     in which the Supreme Court has been most tolerant of \n     regulation. The provisions are sufficiently clear to oversome \n     claims of unconstitutional vagueness and sufficiently narrow \n     to allay overbreadth concerns. The Amendment will not \n     restrict the ability of advocacy groups such as NRLC to \n     engage in either issue advocacy or electioneering, but it \n     will subject their electioneering spending to federal \n     disclosure requirements, which is constitutionally \n     permissible.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Burt Neuborne,\n       John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law, NYU School of Law.\n     Norman Ornstein,\n       Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute.\n     Daniel R.

Joshua Rosenkranz,\n       Executive Director, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU \n     School of Law.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator McConnell, and I thank all Members of \nthe body for this excellent debate on a very important issue. I suggest \nthat there are different views about what is noble and fair and of the \nhighest order. A jurist at one time said that to talk of justice is the \nequivalent of pounding on the table; everybody seems to say that their \nview is just and fair and wonderful. But I think there are a lot of \ncompeting principles here, and I would just like to share a few \ncomments on this subject.\n  I ran in a Republican primary, had seven opponents, two of whom spent \nover $1 million of their own money, and the total that those seven \nopponents spent was some $5 million. My opponent in the general \nelection spent about $3 million, the Democratic nominee. But when you \nfigure it on 4 million people in Alabama, that is about $2 per voter.\n  A number of the expenditures--and it irritated me at the time--were \nthese stealth advocacy ads that have been referred to. Groups ran ads \nthat tried to claim they were advocacy ads but in fact were aimed at me \nand trying to drive my numbers down and to help their candidate get \nelected. It irritated me, and when I got here I was irritated with some \nof the campaign laws. It struck me as somewhat unfair that a man could \nspend $1 million but I could not ask anybody for more than $1,000. So I \nwas pretty open to reviewing that.\n  Since I have been here and had the time to do a little thinking about \nit, talking with Senator McConnell and others, I have become pretty \nwell convinced that we do not need to deregulate the institutional \nmedia, allow them to run free doing whatever they want to, and just \ntell groups of people, even if I don't agree with them, they can't come \ntogether, peaceably assemble and raise money and petition their \nGovernment.\n  That is a fundamental first amendment principle. The right to \nassemble\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\npeaceably and petition your Government for grievances is a right that \nis protected by our Constitution. In no way can we abridge freedom of \nspeech. We have a number of cases dealing with that.\n  The particular Snowe-Jeffords amendment that we talked about has been \ntouched upon in a famous case from Alabama. NAACP v. Alabama, in 1958, \nclearly established that groups have a right to assemble and they do \nnot have to reveal the names of individuals who have contributed to \nthem.\n  They said: Well, we don't want to demand that of everybody, just if \nyou run a campaign ad 60 days in front of a general election. Only then \ndo we want to know who gave you money; only then do we abridge your \nright to free speech, because we are abridging it by saying you can't \nexpress yourself unless you tell who gave money to your organization \nonly within 60 days of the election. That is the only time we want to \ndo it.\n  So, Mr. President, I would ask, when do you want to speak out? When \ndo people become concerned and energized about issues? I believe in my \nState, for example, that we had abuse of the laws of Alabama, and we \nhad too many lawsuits and uncontrolled verdicts, and we needed tort \nreform. The trial lawyers of Alabama are a very aggressive group. A \nsmall group of them contribute huge sums of money. I saw recently where \nabout seven plaintiff law firms, relatively small law firms, had given \nsome $4 million to political campaigns in the last cycle. They spent $1 \nmillion--some of these were stealth advocacy ads aimed at me. They ran \none ad against a Supreme Court Justice, the skunk ad that was voted the \ndirtiest ad in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  We have a robust democracy. People have their say. I am inclined to \nthink this obsession with eliminating the ability of people to speak \nout freely in an election cycle is unwise. It does threaten the robust \nnature of this democracy.\n  I recall last year we had 30 Members here who voted to amend the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution so they could pass this kind of \nlegislation.\n  I think at least they were honest enough to propose a constitutional \namendment to amend the first amendment, which I thought was stunning.\n  But at any rate, my time has expired. I just wanted to share those \ncomments. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could just thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nimportant contribution to this debate, he is a distinguished lawyer, \nwell versed in the first amendment. I think his points were very, very \nwell made, and I just wanted to thank him for his contribution to this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield up to 5 minutes to another of our tremendous \ncosponsors and supporters of this legislation, the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \namendment being offered by Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold to \nmotivate the Senate and conclude action on campaign finance reform \nlegislation.\n  Before I proceed, I would like to point something out about the \ndecision the Senator from Alabama referenced to defend nondisclosure. \nThe Supreme Court in that case said if the people were threatened with \nbodily injury or death, they did not have to disclose their names. That \nis hardly, I hope, the case that we have here. I hope people would not \nrely upon that Alabama decision to say that the present procedure that \nwe have here, allowing people to hide themselves behind their ads, is \nlegitimized by that decision.\n  I also thank the Senator from Maine, who worked very strenuously on \nthis amendment with respect to disclosure. To me, it is incredible to \nthink anybody can object to what we are suggesting, which is that if \npeople put something on the air obviously aimed at candidates, we ought \nto know who they are. I just cannot understand how anybody can take the \nposition that is a violation of the freedom of speech.\n  Also, let me congratulate the House of Representatives for passing \ncampaign finance reform legislation shortly before the August break. \nThis was a first step toward achieving our mutual goal of having a \ncampaign finance system that is fair and equitable. Such a system \nshould ensure that the electorate is fully informed and that the pool \nof potential candidates is not limited by financial barriers.\n  Earlier this year we fell eight votes short of passing the McCain/\nFeingold campaign finance reform legislation. During consideration of \nthis bill an important amendment offered by Senator Snowe and I was \nadopted, and I am pleased that Senators McCain and Feingold have \nincluded this language in the amendment we are considering today. I \nthink it is a critical amendment. The willingness of my colleagues to \ninclude this language and the leadership of the Vermont legislature on \nthis issue last year has convinced me that it is time to move forward \nand pass this amendment.\n  The McCain-Feingold amendment with the Jeffords-Snowe language boosts \ndisclosure requirements and tightens expenditures of certain funds in \nthe weeks preceding a primary and general election. The last few \nelection cycles have shown that spending has grown astronomically in \ntwo areas that cause me great concern. First, issue ads that have \nturned into blatant electioneering. Second, the unfettered spending by \ncorporations and unions to influence the outcome of an election. This \namendment with the Jeffords-Snowe language addresses these areas in a \nreasonable, equitable and last but not least, constitutional way.\n  Mr. President, reform of the campaign finance system is long overdue. \nThe litany of problems and short comings of our current system is long \nand well known, but the full Congress has so far been reluctant to act.\n  Since my election to the House in the wake of the Watergate scandal, \nI have worked with my colleagues to craft campaign finance reform \nlegislation that could endure the legislative process and survive a \nconstitutional challenge. We came close in 1994, and I believe \ncircumstances still remain right for enactment of meaningful campaign \nfinance reform during this Congress. This belief has only been \nstrengthened by the recent actions taken by the House.\n  The Senate is known for its ability to have full and complete debates \non any issue, and campaign finance should be no different, but debate \non this important topic should eventually reach an end. We may not \nagree on the solution, but we must move forward, debate the issue and \nultimately reach a conclusion. Let the process run its course, let \nSenators offer their amendments and get their votes. But, in the end \nlet the Senate complete consideration of this issue.\n  Mr. President, if Mark McGwire can hit 62 home-runs, Congress can \nsurely pass this important legislation and hit one home-run for cleaner \ncampaign financing. I remain hopeful that my colleagues will join me in \nallowing the Senate to conclude debate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the First Amendment to the Constitution \nmandates that Congress shall make no laws which abridge the freedom of \nspeech. The freedom to engage in political speech is the bedrock of our \ndemocracy. We may not like what people say when they exercise their \nFirst Amendment rights, but this Senator acknowledges that everyone has \nthe right to engage in political speech.\n  This bill places unconstitutional limits on the First Amendment \nrights of individuals, groups and even unions. The bill creates a rule \nwhich virtually prohibits any political ads by individuals, groups and \nunions which mention specific candidates within 60 days of an election.\n  That would serve to muzzle political speech at the most critical time \nduring a campaign. Not only is this unconstitutional, it is bad policy, \nbecause it will only serve to make the media more powerful.\n  I have examined the provisions in this bill very carefully, and even \non the slightest chance the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\nwould find these provisions constitutional, I ask my fellow Senators: \nis this good policy?\n  The reason I ask this question is that, in my view, when you muzzle \nthe political speech of individuals and groups, whose voice will then \ncarry the day?\n  In our zeal on both sides of the aisle to address the role of certain \nentities in our elections, we need to ask ourselves: what will be the \nconsequence of restricting the free speech rights of unions, \ncorporations and wealthy individuals to engage in campaign-related \nspeech? In my mind, by restricting freedom of speech for these groups, \nwe will make the media an even more powerful player in the political \nprocess.\n  During the 60 days prior to the election when the so called bright \nline rule is in effect, the only one who will be able to speak directly \nabout the candidates will be the news media.\n  We all know the saying around Washington: ``you shouldn't pick a \nfight with someone who buys paper by the ton and ink by the barrel.'' \nBecause it enjoys the full protection of the First Amendment, we call \nthe media the Fourth Estate, or the Unofficial Fourth Branch of \ngovernment. The media are the ``Big Opinion Makers''--they write the \neditorials, present the news and decide which issues deserve the \nattention of the American people on a daily basis.\n  We also know that members of the media are only human--and by that I \nmean that they are opinionated. Their opinion tends to lean in favor of \na liberal, Democrat agenda. Recent surveys have shown that close to 90 \npercent of the media votes for liberal Democrat candidates. What of \ntheir independence? What about their role in the election of federal \nofficials?\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote: There are rights which it is useless to \nsurrender to the government, but which rights governments always have \nsought to invade. Among these are the rights of speaking and publishing \nour thoughts.\n  This bill is a giant step toward Congress invading the rights of many \nto engage in political discourse and surrendering those rights to the \nmedia. In my view, you can choose McCain/Feingold or you can choose the \nFirst Amendment. I choose the First Amendment. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the \ntime, and particularly for the effort and information that he has \nparticipated in giving during this debate.\n  I am interested in the fact that our fellow Senators talk about \nhaving a discussion. How long are we going to discuss this? It seems \nlike we have been through this every year. We have been through it \nthree times last year; we have been through it the second time this \nyear. I can hardly imagine that anyone can make a case that we have not \nhad a chance to talk about this issue.\n  As a matter of fact, frankly, I just think we have a lot of things to \ndo in the next 3 weeks. I hope we focus on doing those things and not \ncontinue to repeat and discuss the same things that we have done \nbefore. This subject had three failed cloture votes in 1997. This is \nthe second cloture vote in 1998. We had the opportunity to talk about \nthis, and under the system in the Senate which we all use, this issue \nhas failed to be approved. Frankly, I think it will be one more time. I \nheard earlier that this is something that everybody in the country is \nclinging to and wanting to have resolved. I have not seen that. Where \npeople are asked to list the things that are most important to them, \nwhere do you see this on the list? If at all, on the bottom.\n  I think the fact is times have changed. The fact is we do spend more \nmoney, perhaps too much money, but we want people to vote. We believe \nthey should be educated, and if you do that, you do that through the \npublic media, which is expensive. So we are changing those things a \ngreat deal.\n  What puzzles me a great deal--and I am not here to talk about the \ndetails; others are much more familiar with them than am I--but we find \nourselves with the dilemma of having a campaign finance law in place \nnow that we seem to be unable or unwilling to enforce, and in fact what \ndo we want to do? We want to have more laws put on top of the ones that \nwe are not willing to enforce now. That seems to be a real difficult \nthing for me to understand.\n  I think it would be a mistake to pile more bureaucracy, more new laws \non top of the ones that we have, and then say to ourselves, ``Look at \nall the things that were illegally done in 1997 or 1996.'' We haven't \nenforced the laws that we have. It is strange to me there is a pitch \nfor making more laws until we do that.\n  I will not take much time. I do think there ought to be some changes. \nI certainly support the idea of strengthening and enforcing disclosure. \nI think disclosure ought to be there prior to the election, and I am \nfor that. I would even probably support the amount of soft money that \ncan be contributed. But I am also quick to understand that there are \nlots of ways to do it, and laws simply do not have the effect that \nsometimes we think they should.\n  So, I think most everything has been said here, but I did want to \nrise to say that the notion if you are not for this somehow you don't \ncare about elections, somehow you don't care about voting, that is not \ntrue. That is not at all true. All of us want to have an open \ndeclaration of spending. We want to have disclosure. We also want to \nhave people have the opportunity to participate as fully as they choose \nunder the first amendment, and there are some restrictions in here.\n  So, we will continue to talk about this, I presume. But McCain-\nFeingold is not the answer, in my opinion. That doesn't mean that I \ndon't care about elections, because I do care about them, and so do all \nof us. That allegation is simply not true.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Wyoming \nfor coming over and participating in the debate and for his insightful \nobservations.\n  Seeing no speakers on the other side, I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky, and I \nrise in opposition to the McCain-Feingold amendment to the Interior \nappropriations bill. Rather than ``reform'' the way campaigns are \nfinanced, this amendment would infringe on the first amendment rights \nof millions of American citizens and place enormous burdens on \ncandidates running for office, and one of our primary obligations here \nis to preserve the Constitution of the United States.\n  While the McCain-Feingold amendment claims to ``clean up'' elections, \nit does so by placing unconstitutional restrictions on citizens' \nability to participate in the political process. We have heard several \nMembers of the Senate bemoan the fact that various citizen groups and \nindividuals have taken out ads criticizing them during their elections.\n  I must admit that I can sympathize with my colleagues who have been \nthe object of often pointed and critical campaign ads. In fact, during \nmy last campaign, some ads were aired against me that were downright \nfalse. I do support truth in advertising. Even that, I am told, is an \ninfringement on freedom of speech, and the Washington Supreme Court \njust ruled that it is OK to lie in campaign advertising.\n  How do you counter that? During my campaign, my opponent ran a series \nof ads that said I put a tax on Girl Scout cookies. Fortunately, Girl \nScout cookies were delivered during the campaign, and those poor little \ngirls had to say, ``No, he didn't put a sales tax on Girl Scout \ncookies.'' Had it not been for the delivery of those cookies, I would \nhave had to find a lot of money to counter the false advertising done \nagainst me. If we can't get truth in advertising, we don't have \ncampaign reform, and that is an infringement on freedom of speech.\n  At the same time, I believe in a free society it is essential that \ncitizens have a right to articulate their positions on issues and \ncandidates in a public forum. The first amendment to our Constitution \nwas drafted to ensure\n\n[[Page S10155]]\n\nthat future generations will have the right to engage in public \npolitical discourse that is vigorous and unfettered. Throughout even \nthe darkest chapters of our Nation's history, our first amendment has \nprovided an essential protection against inclinations to tyranny.\n  The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the first amendment to \nprotect the right of individual citizens and organizations to express \ntheir views through issue advocacy. The Court has maintained for over \ntwo decades that individuals and organizations do not fall within the \nrestrictions of the Federal election code simply by engaging in this \nadvocacy.\n  Issue advocacy includes the right to promote any candidate for office \nand his views as long as the communication does not ``in express terms \nadvocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.'' As \nlong as independent communication does not cross the bright line of \nexpressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, individuals \nand groups are free to spend as much as they want promoting or \ncriticizing a candidate and his or her views. While these holdings may \nnot always be welcome to those of us running in campaigns, they \nrepresent a logical outgrowth of the first amendment's historic \nprotection of core political speech.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which parades under the disguise of \n``reform,'' would violate these clear first amendment protections. The \namendment impermissibly expands the definition of ``express advocacy'' \nto cover a whole host of communications by independent organizations. \nThe McCain-Feingold amendment attempts to expand bright-line tests for \nissue advocacy to include communications which, ``in context,'' \nadvocate election or defeat of a given candidate.\n  Are we comfortable with giving a Federal regulatory agency the power \nto determine what constitutes acceptable political speech--a Federal \nregulatory agency the power to determine what constitutes acceptable \npolitical speech?\n  This amendment gives expansive new powers to the Federal Election \nCommission. This is one Federal agency which has abused the power it \nalready has to regulate Federal elections. Just last year, the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals strongly criticized the Federal Election \nCommission for its ``unsupportable'' enforcement action against the \nChristian Action Network. The network's only crime was engaging in \nprotected political speech. The Court of Appeals required the Federal \nElection Commission to pay the network's attorney fees and court costs \nsince the FEC's prosecution had been unjustified. Congress should not \ncondone flagrant administrative abuses by giving the FEC expanded new \npowers and responsibilities.\n  The McCain-Feingold substitute also includes within its new \ndefinition of ``express advocacy'' any communication that refers to one \nor more clearly identified candidates within 60 calendar days preceding \nan election. These provisions would allow the speech police to regulate \ncore political speech during the most crucial part of an election \ncycle. They would also place an economic burden on thousands of small \nradio and television stations which carry those ads. I don't think we \nin Washington should be placing any more restrictions on America's \nsmall businesses. Our Founding Fathers drafted the first amendment to \nprotect against attempts such as these to prohibit free citizens from \nentering into public discourse on issues that greatly affect them.\n  I cannot support legislation that stifles the free speech of American \ncitizens and gives expanded new powers to a Federal bureaucracy. For \nthese reasons, I must oppose the McCain-Feingold amendment. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in paying tribute to the first amendment and \nopposing the McCain-Feingold substitute and any other amendment that \nwould unconstitutionally restrict the rights of citizens to participate \nin the democratic process.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming for his \nparticipation, once again, in what seems to be an endless debate. We \nhave this periodically, and I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nalways coming over and making an important contribution.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes, 25 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Wisconsin. I commend him and \nSenator McCain and the bipartisan group that has worked so hard to pass \ncampaign finance reform.\n  A couple of nights ago, Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home run. In doing \nso, he defied the odds. He warmed the hearts of Americans everywhere \nwith his grit, his determination, and his dedication. It was a shining \nmoment for American baseball and for America. Today, we should hold him \nup as our example. We need to show equal grit and equal determination. \nWe need to hit a home run for the American people by passing campaign \nfinance reform.\n  To do that, we are going to have to defy the odds. The House did it; \nthey defied the odds. They passed campaign finance reform, and now the \nquestion that we are going to face in the days ahead is whether we can. \nCan the Senate rise to the occasion? Or will we go with the status quo, \ncontinuing the demoralizing and debilitating money chase that now funds \nour election campaigns and undermines public confidence in our \ndemocracy?\n  Seventy-five percent of the American people want campaign finance \nreform. They want limits restored on contributions, real limits. They \nwant the end of the loophole called the soft money loophole.\n  The House passed a strong bipartisan bill. The President is ready to \nsign it. A majority of the Senate supports similar legislation which is \nbefore us now. We are ready to vote to enact this legislation into law.\n  But instead of going to a vote on the bill, the majority leader has \ninstead filed a cloture motion. And what is surreal about this cloture \nmotion is that while a cloture motion is usually intended to be a \ndevice to close debate on an issue, and to move to a vote, the Senators \nwho signed the cloture motion in this instance do not want to end \ndebate or go to a vote. They oppose their own petition. They hope that \nthe pending legislation and this issue will go away. They hope the \nsupporters of campaign finance reform will withdraw the bill because it \nis being filibustered.\n  This is an inside-out filibuster. The opponents of reform want to \nfilibuster the reform bill without actually filibustering it. They are \nhoping that if supporters do not have the 60 votes to close debate, \nthat the supporters will agree to withdraw their own amendment. I \nbelieve it would be wrong to withdraw this bill because opponents are \nfilibustering the bill. Opponents have the right to filibuster under \nour rules. They have the right to filibuster. But the supporters have \nno obligation to help them succeed by agreeing to change the subject or \nby agreeing to withdraw the amendment.\n  This is an issue of transcendent importance. Huge contributions that \ncome through that soft money loophole have sapped public confidence in \nthe electoral process. The House has acted. They did what conventional \nwisdom said could not be done. They passed a bill with meaningful \ncampaign finance reform to close the soft money loophole. Our colleague \nfrom Kentucky said that when the House passed reform and sent it over \nhere, that the bill and reform was dead on arrival, DOA. Well, it was \nnot. The struggle for life for campaign finance reform will be \ndetermined by a test of wills between a bipartisan majority who support \ncampaign finance reform and the minority that is filibustering in \nopposition to campaign finance reform.\n  But campaign finance reform is not dead on arrival. It is struggling \nfor life here on the Senate floor in a kind of a titanic struggle which \nhas existed with prior legislation of this importance,\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\nlegislation which has such meaning to the country that both its \nsupporters and its opponents are willing to test their strength. \nOpponents filibustering, as is their right, but supporters not yielding \nto that filibuster, as is our right.\n  So just as the House defied the odds by passing a bill, just like \nMark McGwire defied the odds by hitting home run No. 62, now it is our \nturn at bat. The American public is waiting for us to step up to the \nplate and to fight for campaign finance reform. And that is what our \nintention is. Again, I commend the bipartisan group that has led this \neffort. It is a vital effort for the well-being of democracy in this \ncountry. It is worth fighting for.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not submit for the record the 400 \ncampaign finance reform editorials from 196 newspapers across America \nthat have been published just since March 30, 1998.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of those newspapers that published editorials, 196 newspapers. \nIt is about a four-page document. I will not ask that the editorials be \nput in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Attached are more than 400 campaign finance reform \n     editorials from 196 newspapers.

Mr. President, I do think it is of interest that \nnewspapers from the Aiken Standard all the way to the York Sunday News, \n196 newspapers--some of them more than once; some of them as many as \nfive or six times--have editorialized in favor of campaign finance \nreform.\n  Mr. President, one of the people that I admired and revered in many \nways, and in many ways was a mentor to me when I was in a different \navocation, was Senator John Tower. On March 28, 1974, Senator Tower \nrose to speak in favor of campaign finance reform. At that time, it was \nS. 3261, a bill to reform the conduct and financing of Federal election \ncampaigns, and for other purposes.\n  Senator Tower gave a speech at that time, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat this statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Congressional Record, March 28, 1974]\n\n       Mr. Tower. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \n     Federal Campaign Reform Act of 1974. The bill generally \n     encompasses President Nixon's election campaign reform \n     proposals as outlined in his message delivered to the Nation \n     on March 8. As one package, it represents the most \n     comprehensive set of reform proposals yet to be offered. It \n     does not subject the political process to the abuses that \n     would naturally flow from public financing of Federal \n     elections as envisioned by S. 3044.\n       I need not dwell on the necessity for campaign reform that \n     works. What I do wish to emphasize now are the specific ways \n     in which this bill is in the Nation's best interest.\n       First, this bill requires each candidate to designate a \n     single political committee, which would ultimately receive \n     all contributions made in his behalf. That committee would \n     make all expenditures by check from a designated federally \n     chartered bank. These provisions would substantially ease the \n     administrative burden of enforcing compliance with campaign \n     laws.\n       Second, a candidate's political committee would be \n     prohibited from accepting more than $3,000 from an individual \n     donor in any Senate or House election, and not more than \n     $15,000 in any Presidential election. All contributions from \n     any kind of organization would be prohibited, except those \n     made by national committees or political action groups.\n       Third, comprehensive and timely reporting and disclosure \n     requirements are imposed upon political committees and \n     political action groups. For example, political action groups \n     would be required to disclose the ties their principal \n     officers have to political parties.\n       Fourth, an independent Federal Election Commission is \n     established with the independence necessary to effectuate the \n     provisions of the bill.\n       Fifth, the bill provides real safeguards against express or \n     implied intimidation or coercion used against corporate \n     employees and union members in soliciting campaign \n     contributions.\n       Sixth, specific prohibitions against so-called ``dirty \n     tricks'' are provided. Such activities have no proper role to \n     play in any campaign, and this bill successfully draws the \n     line between constitutionally protected campaign activity, \n     and activity which is universally recognized as intolerable.\n       Seventh, a shortening of Presidential campaigns, and a \n     corresponding reduction in the costs of campaigning, are \n     provided for by prohibiting the holding, before May 1 of an \n     election year, of Presidential primaries or conventions at \n     which delegates to the national nominating convention are \n     selected.\n       A central theme of the bill is the restoration of the \n     dignity and power of the individual donor to a proper role in \n     political campaigns. For too long, big organizations have run \n     roughshod over the wishes of their individual members. \n     Implicit intimidation or coercion has often been used to \n     compel contributions which cannot fairly be characterized as \n     voluntary. Individual contributors have often been misled as \n     to the true nature of the political action groups to whom \n     they gave. Individuals have also felt of insignificant value \n     in campaigns because of the enormous contributions made by \n     many organizations.\n       The ascendancy of the power of faceless organizations in \n     campaigns is unhealthy. It leads to unfair and \n     unrepresentative influence on the part of the few who \n     manipulate the many. Individuality is a hallmark of America \n     that has made it great. It promotes that diversity of thought \n     and influence so necessary to a thriving and robust \n     democracy.\n       This bill dignifies and encourages each individual to \n     participate actively in Federal elections. It assures each \n     voter that he will not be harassed, intimidated, or misled by \n     political action groups representing narrow and special \n     interests. It assures each voter that his contribution will \n     count as much as others.\n       I must admit that I have philosophical reservations about \n     placing limitations on an individual's privilege to determine \n     the amount of his personal contribution. There even might \n     well be constitutional problems with such a congressional \n     mandate. However, as I have previously stated, excesses can \n     and have occurred. Thus, absent judicial reversal of the \n     concept, such limitations are inevitable and represent a \n     significant part of this reform package.\n       Mr. President, I shall consider offering this bill as a \n     substitute amendment for S. 3044 in substantially the same \n     form as I am introducing it today. Therefore, I urge my \n     colleagues to review it carefully.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In the body of his remarks, Senator Tower said:\n\n       The ascendancy of the power of faceless organizations in \n     campaigns is unhealthy. It leads to unfair and \n     unrepresentative influence on the part of the few who \n     manipulate the many. Individuality is a hallmark of America \n     that has made it great. It promotes that diversity of thought \n     and influence so necessary to a thriving and robust \n     democracy.\n\n  The bill he is referring to is the campaign reform bill that was then \nbeing considered by the Senate.\n\n       This bill dignifies and encourages each individual to \n     participate actively in Federal elections. It assures each \n     voter that he will not be harassed, intimidated, or misled by \n     political action groups representing narrow and special \n     interests. It assures each voter that his contribution will \n     count as much as others.\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Tower described the situation pretty much as \nit is today. Each voter does not believe that his or her contribution \ncounts as much as others. We have seen manifestations of that in \nvirtually every primary this season. Every voter does not believe that \nthere is fair and representative influence on the part of the many. In \nfact, the voters, in recent polls that have been taken, believe that \nthere is undue influence on the part of special interests. And I, \nhaving witnessed it myself, am convinced of it.\n  In 1974, on August 8, Representative Anderson said:\n\n       Under our representative system of government, the people \n     elect fellow citizens to speak for, vote on behalf of, and \n     represent their interests in the legislative bodies--the \n     House and Senate--and they elect a President to administer \n     the laws, conduct foreign affairs, and established \n     priorities. And, I believe this to be the best system of \n     government devised by man.\n       If some people, however, are given preferential treatment \n     because of their ability and willingness to contribute large \n     sums toward the election of an individual, then the system \n     breaks down. If some are ``more equal'' than others, then our \n     representative system fails and the interests of all the \n     people are aborted.\n       And this is a very serious threat to our democracy. It is a \n     very serious threat if the interests of the rich and powerful \n     are placed above the interests of the weak and the poor.\n       Our country was founded on the principle of equality--all \n     are equal in the eyes of the law. But, if the rich and the \n     powerful have a greater influence on writing and \n     administering the laws, is not equality a sham, a farce?\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday I noted a document that was put out by the \nDemocratic National Committee in the 1996 election where a broad \nvariety of privileges would be extended to those who contributed \n$100,000. One of the most egregious were seats on trade missions. These \nthings have consequences, Mr. President. One of the ongoing \ncontroversies--in fact, we will have a hearing in the Commerce \nCommittee next week on the transfer of technology to China being \ndirectly related to the issue of these ``trade missions.''\n  Mr. President, both parties do this. Both parties do this as far as \nmany of these are concerned. This is a memo from the Democratic \nNational Committee. If you want to give a contribution of $100,000 \nannually:\n\n       Two annual Managing Trustee Events with the President . . .\n       Two annual Managing Trustee Events with the Vice President.\n       One annual Managing Trustee Dinner with senior \n     Administration officials.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Two Annual Retreats/Issue Conferences . . .\n       Invitations to Home Town Briefings\n       As senior Administration officials travel throughout the \n     country, Managing Trustees are invited to join them in \n     private, impromptu meetings.\n       Monthly Policy Briefings\n       Administration officials discuss topics ranging from \n     telecommunications policy to welfare reform at regular \n     Washington policy briefings to which Managing Trustees are \n     invited.\n       Personal DNC Staff Contact\n       Each Managing Trustee is specifically assigned a DNC staff \n     member to assist them in their personal requests. [et \n     cetera.]\n\n  But of course the one that strikes me is:\n\n\n[[Page S10158]]\n\n\n       Annual Economic Trade Missions\n       Managing Trustees are invited to participate in foreign \n     trade missions, which affords opportunities to join Party \n     leaders in meeting with business leaders abroad.\n\n  Is that equal opportunity? Could any American citizen go on these \ntrade missions? I think it is pretty clear that if you are willing to \ngive $100,000 annually, then indeed you can take those trade missions.\n  A memorandum from whoever Ann Cahill is:\n\n       To: Ann Cahill\n       From: Martha Phipps\n       RE: WHITE HOUSE ACTIVITIES\n       Two reserved seats on Air Force I and II trips.\n\n  Is that the way you ride on Air Force One and Two, Mr. President?--\n``In order to reach a very aggressive goal of $40 million this year . . \n. very helpful if we could coordinate the following activities between \nthe White House and the Democratic National Committee.''\n  Let me repeat that memorandum: ``. . . coordinate the following \nactivities between the White House and the Democratic National \nCommittee.''\n\n       Two reserved seats on Air Force I and II trips . . .\n       Six seats at all White House private dinners . . .\n       Six to eight spots at all White House events (i.e. Jazz \n     Fest, Rose Garden ceremonies, official visits).\n\n  And in this memorandum it says who the contact is. Ann Stock seems to \nbe a person to contact; and Alexis Herman, now Secretary of Labor.\n\n       Invitations to participate in official delegation trips \n     abroad.\n       Contact: Alexis Herman . . .\n       Better coordination on appointments to Boards & Commissions \n     . . .\n       White House mess privileges.\n\n  Patsy Thomason was the contact for that.\n\n       White House residence visit and overnight stays.\n\n  Ann Stock was the person on that.\n\n       Guaranteed Kennedy Center Tickets (at least one month in \n     advance) . . .\n       Six radio address spots\n       Contact: David Levy . . .\n       Photo opportunities with the principles . . .\n       Phone time from the Vice President.\n\n  That was Jack Quinn's job, Mr. President, general counsel. He was \nresponsible, he is the contact, for phone time from the Vice President. \nThat would be the subject of some ongoing inquiry.\n\n       Ten places per month at White House film showings . . .\n       One lunch with Mack McLarty per month.\n\n  Boy, it makes me better understand why Mr. Mack McLarty decided to go \ninto private life.\n\n       One lunch with Ira Magaziner . . .\n\n  I think that might be a penalty rather than a benefit.\n\n       One lunch with the First Lady per month.\n\n  I will leave that unremarked.\n\n       Use of the President's Box at the Warner Theater and at \n     Wolf Trap . . .\n       Ability to reserve time on the White House tennis courts . \n     . .\n       Meeting time with Vice President Gore.\n\n  Again, Jack Quinn was the contact person.\n  To be very clear, this is a memorandum of May 5, 1994, to Ann Cahill \nfrom Martha Phipps, and it is titled ``White House Activities.'' Again, \nit reads:\n\n       In order to reach our very aggressive goal of $40 million \n     this year, it would be very helpful if we could coordinate \n     the following activities between the White House and the \n     Democratic National Committee.\n\n  I have stated several times that every institution of government was \ndebased in the 1996 campaign. I think that this document certainly \nindicates that was the case.\n  We will have a vote on a tabling motion by my dear friend from \nWisconsin here in a few minutes and then we will have a cloture vote \nlater this afternoon. I will have a lot more to say before we finish \nthis debate.\n  How do we go home and tell our constituents that we are all equal \nwhen this kind of thing has become commonplace? And the same kinds of \nthings are done by the Republican Party. Obviously, they didn't have \nthe White House boxes and those other conveniences or perks. How can we \ntell the American people that they are equal when these kinds of things \ngo on?\n\n  The reason I bring this up, this all has to do with the most \negregious aspect of the present system, and that is soft money. When \nyou look at the dramatic increase in soft money over the last couple, \nthree cycles, it is dramatic. So there will be more memorandums like \nthe one I just cited and there will be more soft money and there will \nbe more requests for large contributors.\n  I see a couple of my colleagues who are waiting to speak. I believe--\nand I will say this again before the final vote--this issue will be \nresolved over time and we will prevail because the American people \nwon't stand for this. They won't stand for it, and I believe they will \ndemand we clean up this system either sooner or later.\n  I will talk again later on. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I inform my colleagues I will not be \noffering a motion to table at 12:00 noon. Instead, as I understand it, \nwe will continue to debate until the cloture vote at 1:45. We will have \nthe opportunity to vote on this issue again in the days to come, so I \ndon't see a need for another vote before our cloture vote.\n  May I inquire of the Chair, am I correct that the time after 12:00 \nnoon but prior to 1:45 will be equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent I control the time on our side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I didn't hear the \nearlier unanimous consent.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I did not propose a prior unanimous consent; the only \nunanimous consent I propose is I control the time after 12 noon and \nprior to 1:45 on our side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the suggestion was, we will continue to divide the \ntime until 1:45?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do we have remaining on our side prior to \n1:45?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 54 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Prior to 1:45?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, and the Senator from Kentucky \nhas 63 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank Senator Feingold for yielding the time, and I both thank and \ncommend Senator Feingold and Senator McCain for their leadership on \nthis very critical issue. They have been fighting a very lonely--at \ntimes lonely--but a very extraordinary battle for not only the \nreforming of our campaign system but, many suspect, the continued \nviability of our political system.\n  We have a campaign finance system in place, but that system has \nliterally collapsed. The exceptions, the loopholes, the ingenious ways \naround, have in fact devoured the rules and we no longer really have a \nsystem of campaign finance. What we have is an all-out race for \ndollars, constantly, incessantly, and then an all-out escalation of \nspending and political campaigns which has left our constituents amazed \nand at times disgusted. We have a responsibility and an obligation to \nchange this system today, with the opportunity to vote for very modest \nreform which will begin to, once again, make elections about ideas and \npolicies, and not auctions to the highest bidder.\n  The McCain-Feingold compromise seeks to accomplish two basic goals: \nFirst, to ban the unlimited, unregulated gifts by corporations, wealthy \nindividuals and labor unions to political organizations, the so-called \nsoft money; second, to regulate the so-called issue advertisements \nwhich impact on campaigns and which are growing in frequency and in \ntheir emphasis impact on campaigns. By ending soft money contributions, \nwe will do what we persistently have said we want to do, and that is to \nprevent corporations from participating directly in elections.\n  This is not radical reform, this is commonsense consistent reform \nthat we thought we accomplished back in 1973 and 1974 with the original \ncampaign finance reform system.\n  Second, this legislation would attempt to provide a modicum of \ncontrol over the new phenomenon of the issue ads. They would require \nthe disclosure of the contributions by these individuals and also \nindicate who is sponsoring these advertisements, or where they are \ngetting their money. We have\n\n[[Page S10159]]\n\nseen, over the last several years, an amazing phenomenon--candidates \nare in a race and they are discussing the issues and, suddenly, out of \nnowhere, comes a mysterious advertisement on television attacking one \nor praising another. And they both claim that they had nothing to do \nwith it. It is no longer their campaign. They are, in a sense, \nbystanders on issue advertisements and issue campaigns of which they \nthemselves, many times, disclaim having any knowledge. All of this \ntakes out of the hands of the candidates and, ultimately, the hands of \nthe electorate, what should be at the heart of every election--a \nvigorous debate between individual candidates about their vision of the \nfuture of this country.\n  So we have to do these things. We have to ensure that our campaigns \nare not tainted by soft money and not overwhelmed by these issue \nadvertisements. This is a problem that plagues both of our Houses. As \nSenator McCain pointed out, it is not just a situation with the \nDemocrats or just with the Republicans; both sides are locked into this \ninexorable, it seems, race for dollars. In doing that, we have created \na situation where the American people, in many cases, are increasingly \ndisenchanted; they are voting less and less and are getting to the \npoint of being contemptuous of the best political system the world has \ncreated to date.\n  We have to do this modest reform today. Frankly, this is just modest \nreform. There are many things that we could and should do that we are \nnot even talking about today on the floor of the Senate. The States--\nthe so-called laboratories of reform--are doing things today that we \nshould be at least contemplating. In my own State of Rhode Island, we \nimplemented voluntary spending limits with limited public financing. \nThe States of Maine and New Jersey have done the same thing. The State \nof Vermont has implemented strict limits on candidate spending--\nlegislation which directly challenges the Court's decision in Buckley \nv. Valeo, which I believe incorrectly equates money with speech.\n  In fact, I have introduced similar legislation in this body which \nwould legislatively put limits on and legislatively force the Court to \nreevaluate Buckley v. Valeo. These are very aggressive steps that we \nshould take. These are things we should do to ensure that our system is \nentirely resistant to the ravages of money that is affecting it today. \nBut at least today we can stand up with Senators McCain and Feingold \nand say that we must stop the influence of soft money. We must at least \nhave the disclosure rule behind these issue advertisements. This is the \nfirst step toward long-term campaign finance reform that will not only \nmake races about ideas, but will, in fact, I believe, restore the faith \nof the American people in their system of government and what we do for \nthem.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Very properly, Senator McCain made reference to the bipartisan nature \nof the problem and the bipartisan nature of the effort. I commend \nSenator McCain for doing that, for his strong leadership, which is \nessential if this is going to succeed.\n  I want to put in the Record some documents, for the sake of \ncompleteness, showing how bipartisan this problem is. Senator McCain, \nvery appropriately, put in a document relative to what the benefits of \nmajor contributors to the Democrats are going to be offered. I don't \nknow if that was actually implemented under that document or not, but \nplenty was implemented.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these two documents be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n 1997 RNC Annual Gala, May 13, 1997, Washington Hilton, Washington, DC\n\n\n                       gala leadership committee\n\n     Cochairman--$250,000 fundraising goal\n       Sell or purchase Team 100 memberships.

Benefits based on receipts.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. One of these documents is an invitation to the Republican \nNational Committee Annual Gala 1997, in which for $250,000, the \ncontributors to the Republican National Committee get to attend a \nluncheon with Senate and House leadership and the Republican Senate and \nHouse committee chairmen of your choice. That is $250,000. You get a \nluncheon with the committee chairmen.\n  Next is a 1992 Republican President's Dinner. Major contributors got \na private reception, among other things, hosted by President and Mrs. \nBush at the White House. And the Republican Eagles promised major \ncontributors who became members of the Republican Eagles' contributor \ngroup ``foreign economic and trade missions,'' in which the Eagles have \nbeen welcomed enthusiastically by heads of state, such as Premier Li \nPeng of the People's Republic of China.\n  Again, Mr. President, I think the point Senator McCain very properly \nmade is that we have a major, massive, bipartisan problem that is \nundermining public confidence in elections in this country. It is a \nbipartisan problem. It requires a bipartisan solution, and hopefully \nthis coalition will stand together in the face of a filibuster and\n\n[[Page S10160]]\n\nsay, yes, you have a right to filibuster; that is your right, but we \nneed not withdraw in the face of a filibuster.\n  This problem is so huge that it requires action, and we cannot simply \ndefer it year after year. There has never been a better time for action \nthan when the House has acted on reform, against the odds, just as we \nhave to act against the odds if we are going to succeed. I thank \nSenators McCain and Feingold, the leaders on both sides of the aisle, \nwho can succeed if we hang tough here and not withdraw in the face of a \nfilibuster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first strongly concur with the \nremarks of the Senator from Michigan. We have to proceed on this issue. \nWe will proceed on this issue this year until we get the job done. I am \ngrateful for his strength and leadership on this.\n  I am pleased now to be able to yield some time to the distinguished \njunior Senator from Maine, who brings many important qualities to this \nissue, but the two that I will list at the top are her extremely \ngenuine commitment to this issue and her courage. It is a difficult \nthing to be a part of this bipartisan issue. I see her involvement as \nbeing absolutely central to the fact that we are even here today still \ndiscussing it.\n  With that, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to start by commending the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin for his leadership and thanking him for his kind \ncomments.\n  It is with a renewed sense of enthusiasm that I rise today to urge \nthis body to pass much-needed reforms to our campaign finance laws. I \nam buoyed by the courage shown by my Republican colleagues in the House \nwho were willing to put their commitment to good government ahead of \ntheir parochial interests.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is needed because the twin loopholes of \nsoft money and bogus issue ads have virtually obliterated our campaign \nfinance laws, leaving us with little more than a pile of legal rubble. \nWe supposedly have restrictions on how much individuals can contribute \nto political parties; yet, at last year's hearings before the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, we heard from one individual who gave \n$325,000 to the Democratic National Committee in order to secure a \npicture with the President of the United States. Another mockingly \ntestified that the next time he is willing to spend $600,000, rather \nthan $300,000, to purchase access to the White House.\n  We supposedly prohibit corporations and unions from financing \npolitical campaigns; yet, the AFL-CIO reportedly spent $800,000 in \nMaine on so-called issue ads which anyone with an ounce of common sense \nrecognized were designed to defeat a candidate for Congress. And as \nreported in Sunday's Washington Post, when the class action lawyers \ncollect their tens of billions in fees from the tobacco lawsuits, the \nresulting flood of cash to the Democratic Party will make past \ncontributions look like pocket change.\n  We in this body decry legal loopholes, but we have reserved the \nlargest ones for ourselves. Indeed, these are more like black holes, \nand that sucking sound you hear during election years is the whoosh of \nsix-figure soft money donations rushing into party coffers.\n  Why should this matter, we are asked by those all too eager to equate \nfreedom of speech with freedom to spend? It should matter because \npolitical equality is the essence of democracy, and an electoral system \nfueled by money is one lacking in political equality.\n  Mr. President, the hope of Maine support campaign finance reform. If \nmy colleagues will indulge me a bit of home state pride, I think the \nMaine perspective results from old fashion, Down East common sense. \nMaine people are able to see through the complexities of this debate \nand focus on what is at heart a very simple, yet very profound, \nproblem. As long as we allow unlimited contributions--whether in the \nform of hard or soft money--and as long as we allow unlimited \nexpenditures, we will not have political equality in this country. It \nis not just that there will not be a level playing field for those \nseeking public office, but more important, there will not be a level \nplaying field for those seeking access to their government.\n  The Maine attitude may well be shaped by the fact that many people in \nmy state live in communities where town meetings are still held each \nyear. I am not talking about the staged, televised town meeting that \nhas become so fashionable of late. I am talking about a rough and \ntumble meeting held in the high school gym or in the grange hall. \nAttend one of these meetings and you will observe an element of true \ndemocracy; people with more money do not get to speak longer or louder \nthan people with less money. Unfortunately, what is true at Maine town \nmeetings is not true in Washington.\n  Mr. President, the amendment pending before this body is dramatically \ndifferent from the original McCain-Feingold bill. It does not seek to \nradically alter how we finance our campaigns. Indeed, it does not alter \nat all the basic framework that Congress established more than two \ndecades ago in the 1970s.\n  Before us today is legislation designed simply to close election law \nloopholes that undermine the protections the American people were \npromised in the aftermath of Watergate. Put differently, this amendment \ndoes not create new reforms, but merely restores reforms adopted two \ndecades ago.\n  Let me be more specific. Gone from this version of the legislation \nare the voluntary limits on how much a campaign can spend. Gone is the \nfree TV time, as well as the reduced TV time. Gone is the reduction in \nPAC limits. Gone are the restrictions on certain types of so-called \nissue ads run by nonprofit organizations, replaced instead by a \nrequirement that they disclose their sources of funding.\n  Most of these continue to be very important reforms to which I remain \npersonally committed. But in the interest of securing action on the \nmajor abuses in the current system, we who support the McCain-Feingold \nproposal have agreed to significant compromises. This is now a modest \nbill but nevertheless, a critical first step in the journey toward \nreform.\n  Mr. President, history demonstrates that the current uses of soft \nmoney and issue ads were not intended by the framers of our election \nlaws. Go back to the early 1980s when soft money was used only for \nparty overhead and organizational expenses, and you will find that the \ncontributions totaled a few million dollars. By contrast, in the last \nelection cycle when soft money took on its current role, these \ncontributions exceeded $250 million.\n  Bogus issue ads were such a small element in the past that it is \nimpossible to find reliable estimates of the amounts expended on them. \nUnfortunately, that is no longer the case, and these expenditures have \nnow become worthy of studies, the most prominent of which estimates \nthat as much as $150 million dollars was spent on these ads in 1995-96.\n  When I ran for a seat in this body, I advocated major changes to our \ncampaign finance laws, but I recognize that goal must wait for another \ntime. The challenge before us today is far more modest. Are we prepared \nto address loopholes that subvert the intent of the election laws that \nwe enacted more than two decades ago? Are we willing to restore to the \nAmerican people the campaign finance system that rightfully belongs to \nthem?\n  Those are the questions before this body. Mr. President, a strong \nmajority of the Members of the House of Representatives support reform \nas do a majority of the Members of the Senate. I would hope that the \nSenate this week will finally vote to reform a loophole-ridden system. \nThe American people deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, it remains to be seen whether campaign finance reform \nis an idea whose time has come. But I can assure my colleagues of one \nthing--it is an idea that will not die.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support the McCain-\nFeingold amendment, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I again am grateful for the comments of \nthe Senator from Maine and for her support.\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\n  I am also delighted to be able to yield time to someone who has been \ndeeply involved in this issue, both as a supporter of our legislation \nand one of the original supporters of the legislation, but who also of \ncourse is intimately familiar with the problems that have occurred \nbecause of the campaign finance scandal--the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. At this point I would like to yield 20 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment. I do so not only \nbecause of what I believe to be the inherent merits of the amendment \nbut because I think it has broader implications for us today in the \ntimes that we live in.\n  We have had good times in this country for some time now--\neconomically, we have low unemployment, we have low inflation, and we \nhave prosperity. When we look abroad, we have had peace. We are the \nlone remaining superpower in the world.\n  It seems that during times like this, Washington becomes irrelevant \nto a lot of people, and in some ways perhaps that is good. But we are \nnot very mindful of the need for leadership in times of trial and times \nof trouble. But the fact of the matter is that in more recent times we \nhave seen the beginnings of such times of peril and trouble. Many \npeople think that we have some serious chickens coming home to roost \nand that both peace and prosperity are at issue now.\n  As we look at what is going on in this country and the fact that we \ncannot forever remain the only buying nation in a world of sellers--\nthat we cannot be immune to what is going on in the Pacific rim, the \nSoviet Union, perhaps Japan and South America, and the troubling \neconomic conditions there--we cannot forever be immune, and our economy \ncannot be immune, from what is going on in the rest of the world.\n  We see, as we broaden our perspective, a foreign policy that is in \nshambles in many respects. We see that we are losing the respect in \nmany ways that the United States has had around the world. It is \nevidenced by our troubled coalition with regard to Iraq. It is \nevidenced by a very, very troubling policy with regard to Iraq where \nthe credibility of the Nation's leading figures is at issue.\n  It is at issue when you look at a country such as North Korea, with \nwhom we are supposed to have a nuclear understanding and agreement, as \nthey send missiles across our ally in Japan. We are told by the \nRumsfeld Commission that rogue outlaw nations are going to have the \ncapability within just a few years of launching a missile containing \nbiological or nuclear or chemical weapons to hit the continental United \nStates.\n  So all of this is before us now, and the American people, I think, \nare going through somewhat of a period of readjustment in their \nthinking because we have not only that, but we have very much of a \ntroubled Presidency. We have seen for some time now that while nobody \nhas been paying much attention to a lot of these things, the level of \ncynicism continues to go up in this country.\n  We see the Pew report, for example, which shows that our confidence \nin the leadership in this country is low. We see that this lack of \nconfidence is even greater among our young people. A lot of people used \nto attribute the growing cynicism and lack of confidence in many \nrespects--and it is somewhat affected by the economy as it goes up and \ndown--but fundamentally the cynicism grows and lot of people say \nbecause of Watergate, because of Iran Contra, because of various other \nthings, the assassinations of one generation that we saw, Dr. King and \nthe President, and so forth, but what we are seeing now in these \nreports is that the cynicism and the concern is the greatest among our \nyoung people who have never witnessed or had to experience many of \nthese things. So it makes it even more troubling.\n  So all of this goes to the point of now that we see the need for \nstrong leadership, after we have done so much to destroy the confidence \nthat the American people ought to be having in the leadership of this \ncountry, who is going to listen to our leaders? I have been saying for \nwell over a year now that with peace and prosperity we can go on \nautopilot for a little bit. But if our people continue to be \ndistrustful of their own Government and the cynicism levels rise, \nespecially among our young people, when that pendulum swings back, as \nit invariably does, and we no longer have peace and we no longer have \nprosperity, where is the leadership going to be, and who is going to \nfollow the leadership of those of us in Washington who stand up and say \nhere is the way; here is what we need to do; this is the way out of \nthis problem. We have been in problems before, and we can get out of \nthis one if you follow us. Who is going to follow us?\n  That is the question yet to be answered. We do not know what we have \ndone to our institutions, in many cases by our own actions, in many \ncases for other reasons, but we don't know the answer to that. And when \nthe tough times come, as they invariably will in the short term or the \nlong term, I only hope that we are strong enough in our institutions, \nin the Presidency, in the Congress, and the respect for our court \nsystem to be able to lead the American people.\n  Mr. President, that is why this issue that we are discussing today is \ndoubly important. It has to do with the very fundamentals of our \nGovernment. It has to do with the way we finance campaigns in this \ncountry, the way we elect the elected leaders who in turn are supposed \nto lead us when we need that leadership. I must say, in my opinion, we \nnow have the worst campaign finance system that we have ever had in \nthis country. In fact, you cannot call it a campaign finance system at \nall. It is a situation that is an open invitation to abuse. It is an \nopen invitation to corruption. It is an open invitation to cynicism. \nAnd after the scandal of the 1996 campaign, if we do not do something \nabout it, the level of cynicism that I talked about earlier, I think, \nis going to be even higher.\n  If people think that we have gotten over the hump and everyone loves \nCongress now, you wait until that economy dips just a little bit; it \nwill come back to the trend it has been following for a long, long \ntime. It is a scandal waiting to happen. It is a system that after all \nthis time has come to the point where there is no limitation on big \ncorporate contributions or big labor contributions, and we are spending \nmore and more and more time going after more and more money from fewer \nand fewer people who have the millions of dollars that is fueling our \nsystem, the same people who come back before us wanting us to either \npass or defeat legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have said ever since I have been in the Senate, I \nsay here again today, that is a system that cannot last. That is an \ninherently defective system that cannot last over any period of time. \nSo now because of that system, everybody is onto it and the race is on, \nand we are seeing the millions go to tens of millions and the tens of \nmillions go to the hundreds of millions being put in by the large \ncorporations and the large labor unions and the large vested interests \nthat have those kinds of dollars.\n  It makes me wonder how the small donor, which has been the bedrock of \nmy party, perceives himself in all this. We are not getting enough \ncheckoff on the tax returns in the Presidential system right now, and \nthat is probably going to fail. Voter turnout is getting down there now \nwith some of the banana Republics, and I think part of that has to be \ndue to the fact that in a system that I have just described the average \nperson does not see that it has a whole lot to do with him or with her.\n  The ironic part about it is that this is not even a system that we \ncreated in Congress. We could not. No one would ever come in here and \noffer a piece of legislation that would create the system that we have \ntoday. We can discuss that a little bit further in a moment.\n  We have had a lot of good discussion about the details of the \namendment and the details of the legislation and some discussion about \nthe broader principles involved, but the crux of it all has to do with \nwhether or not we think it is a good idea to have unlimited corporate, \nlabor, and individual contributions to political candidates and to \nincumbents and to have those contributors come in and try to get \nlegislation passed after they have given us all that money. I think \nasking the\n\n[[Page S10162]]\n\nquestion answers it. When you put it out like that, I think it answers \nitself. I think the answer is, no, we do not want that even though that \nis what we have.\n  Why do I say that I think we do not want that when people seem to be \nso afraid of reform? Well, it is because throughout our entire history \nwe have indicated that we do not want that because we ourselves learn \nsome things sometimes from history, and we look around the world and we \nsee that almost 2,000 years ago scholars were saying that this is the \nsort of thing that brought down the Roman Empire. The Venetians imposed \nstrict limitations on contributions and money that would go to public \nofficials. In their system, if donors had favors to ask, they were not \nallowed to give anything.\n\n  We have seen that political influence money brought down entire \npolitical systems in times past in Japan and Italy. We have seen \ncorruption in South Korea and Mexico. It is all around us--at the end \nof the last century, influence buying scandals; the Watergate; campaign \nfinance scandal--time and time again.\n  So, we have seen that. And we also understand that it is a potential \nproblem from our real world experience. People are sometimes surprised \nthat a conservative Republican like myself would feel strongly about \ncampaign finance reform, and they say: Why would that be? I say for the \nsame reason Barry Goldwater was for campaign finance reform. We will \ntalk about that in a minute, too.\n  But I think it has more to do with the fact that up until 3 or 4 \nyears ago I was not involved in the political system, I was not running \nfor office or holding office. But I did prosecute cases. I did defend \ncases. And I am very familiar with the idea that if you have people \nmaking decisions, you have to be very careful about how those decisions \nare influenced. If you are a purchasing agent, for example, you cannot \ntake favors from someone from whom you are considering to buy \nsomething. If you are a loan officer at a bank, you cannot take favors \nfrom people whom you are considering for a loan. People get prosecuted \nfor things like that all day, whether or not it was the real reason \nthat the loan was made. The point being--the analogy is not perfect--\nbut the point being, we have always been very concerned about that. We \nhave gratuity laws in this country where, regardless of whether or not \nit bought anything, there are some people under some circumstances that \nyou cannot give gifts to, because we are very mindful of the \nappearances of that.\n  We even do that with regard to our own activities. We passed gratuity \nlaws that pertain to the Congress so now a friend cannot buy you \ndinner. He can go out here and raise $100,000 for a committee and, in \nturn, it will go to your benefit, he can bundle a few hundred thousand \ndollars for you, but he cannot buy you dinner. So at least we are \npaying some lip service to the idea that we have to be somewhat mindful \nof money going to those who are in positions of decisionmaking power.\n  We recognized that in 1907 when, as a Congress, as a nation, we \nprohibited corporate contributions. We recognized it again in 1943 \nwhen, in the same manner, we prohibited labor contributions and set up \npolitical action committees. We recognized it further as a Congress \nwhen we set up the current system of $1,000 limitations and $5,000 \nlimitations on PACs, and so on and so forth.\n  You can argue over the amounts. I certainly think those amounts now \nare ridiculously low. They ought to be raised. The hard money limits \nought to be raised. That is a debate for another time. But the fact of \nthe matter is, we have been mindful of that. We addressed that. We \nalways said, in this country, it is a bad idea to have wealthy \nindividuals being able to give large amounts of money, unlimited \namounts of money, to politicians. It is a bad idea to have big \ncorporations who are usually involved in government contracts giving \nunlimited amounts to politicians or big labor unions. Yet that is what \nwe have.\n  By the same token, we are mindful of that, especially with regard to \nour Presidential campaigns and our Presidential elections. That is why \nwe set up a public finance system for our Presidential elections. It is \nin shambles now because we have an Attorney General who is not doing \nher job and has a singular, a unique way of interpreting laws. But the \nfact of the matter is, we set up a system to take our candidates for \nPresident out of the money grubbing system. If you agree to take public \nfinancing, then you get public money, and the public, the taxpayers, \nwere willing to run those campaigns on their own money, on their dime, \nin order to keep their candidates above and separate and apart from \nhaving to raise large amounts of money from these large contributors.\n  We have always been mindful that large amounts of money and the \ndecisionmaking of government are things that we have to be very, very \ncareful about. We do allow some contributions. We do have a system--it \ntakes money to run campaigns and all of that. We can argue over the \namounts and so forth. But hardly ever has anybody, really, in this \ncountry, carried on a serious debate espousing the idea that all bets \nought to be off, that any big corporation or any big labor union could \ngive any amount that they wanted to regardless of whether or not they \nhad legislation pending.\n  So, if that is the case, how in the world did we get to where we are \ntoday, where, I say, there are no limitations anymore? You have to jump \nthrough a few hoops and you have to be hypocritical--which is no big \nhurdle to overcome--and you have to run it through the right kind of \ncommittee and so forth, and you have to word the ad a little bit \ncorrectly, and a few other things that 100 years from now we will look \nback on--somebody will look back on, and laugh at, as to how we ever \nhad a deal like this.\n\n  But essentially, whether you are running for President now--under the \nAttorney General's current interpretation, running for President now or \nto be a Member of Congress or a Member of the U.S. Senate, you can \nbasically take any amount of money or get the benefit from any amount \nof money from anywhere, including the other side of the world. That has \nnot been fully pushed yet, but I assure you, unless things change, that \nwill be the next shoe to drop. There are people arguing in courts in \nthis country right now that there is no limitation, under current law, \non foreign contributions--foreign soft money contributions to our \npolitical parties. So that is the next step.\n  So, how did we get here? If Congress, if we as a people, have always \nbeen mindful of this problem and Congress has legislatively set up a \nrestrictive framework, then how did we get to where we are? It is \nreally pretty simple when you distill it all down. It happened over a \nperiod of time, but essentially the FEC, Federal Election Commission, \ndecided to open up a little soft money crack and said parties can use a \nlittle soft money in their party-building activities. Then they went a \nlittle bit further and said parties can use some soft money, a certain \npercentage of soft money, in their TV issue ads.\n  And what happened then? The Clinton-Gore campaign took that crack and \nran a Sherman tank through it and basically said, not only are we going \nto do that, but we are going to totally coordinate that entire activity \nso it will not be independent at all, and that we will sign the \ncertification that we will take public financing and raise no more \nmoney, but we will really pretend like this is not money for our \ncampaign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator's 20 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I just want to inform my colleague, we only have a \ntotal additional 16 minutes for other Senators, and that will bring \nsome difficulty here unless I ask unanimous consent that an additional \n10 minutes be added to our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We reserve the right to object until we have \na----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What was the consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was for Mr. Feingold to add 10\n\n[[Page S10163]]\n\nadditional minutes to his side for the debate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Thereby making the vote later?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be the effect, yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in light of something I was informed of \nafter I put in my request, I withdraw my unanimous consent request and \nI simply yield an additional 2 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \nanother 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. All right. I was not aware that there was a time \nagreement. So I apologize for the necessarily abbreviated nature of the \nrest of my remarks, which basically have to do with the fact that we \nhave an interpretation now by the Attorney General which permits that.\n  Therein lies part of the problem of those who advocate for campaign \nfinance reform, because those who advocate it in many cases have lost \nthe high ground. The President certainly lost the high ground because \nof his behavior, and I must say that after our congressional hearings \non this subject where we saw foreign money coming in, people taking the \nfifth amendment, unlimited access to the White House, shakedowns with \nregard to American Indians and Buddhist nuns, use of the White House, \nsetting people up in positions with classified information, and then \nraising money and all of the coverups attendant to that, while we need \nto address that from a campaign finance standpoint for the future, we \nhave not adequately addressed what has gone on in the past.\n  When we look around for blame to assess with regard to the fact we \ncan't move this legislation, we have to come to terms with the fact \nthat those who want to reform cannot be content with saying all we need \nis reform and forget about the past. We have not adequately addressed \nthe past. Those who have let those things go by without blowing the \nwhistle on them, without seeing anything wrong, without saying that is \nwrong conduct, as we saw for the last year in this country in our \nhearings, have lost the moral high ground with regard to this \nlegislation.\n  I am hoping we can do better in the future. I think those of us who \nwant reform have to understand, yes, we need to clean up the past, but \nwe cannot let this hold us hostage for what we need to do in the \nfuture. Those of us who promote campaign finance reform need to \nunderstand that before we can really have it, we have to have justice \nfor the past. I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering \ncampaign finance reform. As my colleagues know, the House of \nRepresentatives in August passed a strong reform measure. I'm pleased \nthat their action has prompted a renewed effort here in the Senate to \npass a comprehensive campaign finance reform measure.\n  I started my career in politics as a community activist, working to \nprevent a highway from demolishing my Fell's Point neighborhood. I \ndon't want the next generation of community activists shut out of the \nprocess. I want them to know that their efforts matter. I want people \nto have an opportunity to participate in their communities and in our \npolitical process. I want to restore each American's faith and trust in \ngovernment. The McCain-Feingold amendment is an important part of that \neffort.\n  I have consistently supported campaign finance reform, so I will \ngladly vote to close debate on the McCain-Feingold amendment. I hope we \nwill invoke cloture, and move quickly to a vote on final passage of \nthis amendment. Vote after vote this year has shown that a majority of \nthe Senate supports McCain-Feingold.\n  Unfortunately, through parliamentary tactics and filibuster, a \nmajority of the Senate has not been able to work its will on this \nissue. I hope we will be successful today in at last ending the \nfilibuster on this issue.\n  During my time in the United States Senate, I have voted 19 times to \nend filibusters on campaign finance reform. So I know we have a fight \non our hands. But it is time for action, and it is time for reform. The \nAmerican people are counting on us.\n  I believe we need campaign finance reform for a number of reasons. \nFirst and most important, we need to restore people's faith in the \nintegrity of government, the integrity of their elected officials, and \nthe integrity of our political process.\n  Many Americans are fed up with a political system that ignores our \nNation's problems and places the concerns of working families behind \nthose of big interests. Our campaign finance system contributes to a \nculture of cynicism that hurts our institutions, our government and our \ncountry.\n  When Congress fails to enact legislation to save our kids from the \npublic health menace of smoking because of the undue influence of Big \nTobacco, it adds to that culture of cynicism. When powerful health care \nindustry interests are able to block measures to provide basic patient \nprotections for consumers who belong to HMOs, that adds to the culture \nof cynicism. Is it any wonder that Americans do not trust their elected \nleaders to act in the public interest?\n  Today we have a chance to help break that culture of cynicism. We can \nenact legislation to eliminate the undue influence of special interests \nin elections.\n  How does this amendment do that? First of all, it stems the flood of \nunregulated, unreported money in campaigns. It will ban soft money, \nmoney raised and spent outside of federal campaign rules and which \nviolates the spirit of those rules. It will end the sham of ``issue \nads'' that are really designed to support or oppose federal candidates.\n  This amendment will improve the disclosure of contributions, and \nexpand the Federal Election Commission's enforcement capabilities. It \nwill codify the Beck decision, by allowing non-union members who pay \nfees in lieu of union dues to obtain a refund of the portion of those \nfees used for political activities. It will make it less likely for \nwealthy candidates to try to buy elections, by barring political \nparties from making coordinated expenditures for candidates who do not \nagree to limit their personal spending.\n  These are all reasonable reforms. They will get the big money and the \nsecret money out of campaigns. They will help to strengthen democracy \nand strengthen the people's faith in their elected officials.\n  Mr. President, we can improve our political process, making it more \nfair and more inclusive, without compromising our rights under the \nConstitution.\n  By limiting the influence of those with big dollars, and increasing \nthe influence of those with big hearts, we can bring government back to \nwhere it belongs--with the people.\n  The McCain-Feingold amendment will help us to do that. I am proud to \nsupport it with my voice and my vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, twice during this Congress, the Senate has \ndebated reforming the manner in which campaign funds are raised and \nspent. A majority of Senators clearly believes that the current system \nis in need of reform. Progress has been made during this Congress in \ntwo important areas: in the substance of the issue and in gaining \ngreater Congressional support for reform.\n  It would be a shame to sully this bipartisan progress by resorting to \npolitical tactics, as too often has occurred in past debates. In 1992, \nboth the House and the Senate approved a campaign reform bill that had \nno hope of becoming law. It was wholly unacceptable to President Bush, \nand he had no recourse but to veto it. In 1993 some of us worked hard \nwith Members from the other side to craft serious legislation. But the \nSenate bill was not agreeable to House Democrats, and it languished in \nthe House for months before any action occurred. As the election year \nadjournment neared, the Democratic leadership reached an agreement on \nwhat would be included in a conference report before the conferees had \never met, and that agreement was far from the reform that I had hoped \nfor and supported. In 1996, another election year, a far less \nacceptable version of the McCain-Feingold bill was debated and \ndefeated.\n  This year, supporters of reform find themselves in a slightly more \nhopeful position. The bill before us has been greatly improved; it has \nbipartisan support; and the House has already approved very similar \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S10164]]\n\n  The paramount goal of any true effort to reform the system of \nfinancing elections for federal office must be to reduce the influence \nof special interest money on elected officials. Although the proposal \nbefore us may not be the final resolution to the problems that afflict \nthe current system of campaign fundraising, it provides a better \nstarting point than we have had in previous years.\n  I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle to take another look \nat the modified version of McCain-Feingold that is before us today. \nThis is a solid proposal that addresses the soft money abuses that have \neffectively obliterated federal election law. It addresses the problem \nof unregulated, unrestricted, and unreported spending by anonymous \ndonors. It addresses blatant electioneering disguised as issue \nadvocacy. And it eliminates enormous soft money contributions from \ncorporations and big donors. In other words, it goes a long way to \nreducing the influence of special interests.\n  And I urge my colleagues on the other side not to let this debate \ndegenerate into political gamesmanship.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last fall, the Majority Leader and the \nother Republican opponents of campaign finance reform denied the will \nof a majority of the Senate--and a majority of the American people--by \ndenying an up or down vote on the McCain-Feingold bill. This past \nFebruary, we witnessed again successful efforts to block consideration \nof this proposal. At that point, I stated that such maneuvers violate \nthe Senate's well-earned reputation for thoughtfulness and \ndeliberation, in which it rightly takes such pride, and I noted that \nfull consideration of the campaign finance issue by the Senate is \ncrucial to maintaining the public's confidence in its government.\n  Mr. President, the McCain-Feingold bill is before us again, but under \nchanged circumstances which make the need for Senate consideration of \ncampaign finance reform all the more vital. We must now consider this \nmost important issue in the context of House passage of its own \ncampaign finance legislation--passage which occurred only after \ndetermined members of both parties successfully navigated a minefield \nof amendments erected by the House Republican leadership with the goal \nof killing campaign finance reform there. Despite these efforts, a \nmajority of the House held together and enacted legislation that gives \nvoice to the belief of the American public that our system of campaign \nfinancing needs fixing.\n  I hope that this time the Senate leadership will give us the same \nopportunity to express our support for campaign finance legislation \nthat the members of the House earned this summer. I am a cosponsor of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, and will therefore vote in its favor when--\nif--the issue comes before the Senate. Others oppose this legislation. \nWhat the American public deserves at least, however, is an up or down \nSenate vote that gives effect to the will of the majority and that \nmakes the American public confident that the issue has received \nthorough review by its elected representatives. Based on prior votes, I \nsuspect that such review will in fact yield a decision by a majority of \nthe Senate that campaign finance reform is appropriate and necessary. \nBut even if I am mistaken and a majority of Senators now oppose such \nlegislation, a fair Senate process demands that an up or down vote take \nplace as soon as possible and that the will of the majority be allowed \nto carry the day.\n  In February I noted that the Senate's failure to consider the McCain-\nFeingold bill on an up or down vote merely increases the public \ncynicism that makes campaign finance reform necessary. Now that the \nHouse has acted, my prior statements are even more true. I therefore \nonce again urge the Majority Leader to observe a process consistent \nwith the Nation's desires and needs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleague from Kentucky has, as usual, \nmade a persuasive case why the McCain amendment is, as it has been for \nseveral years, flawed beyond salvage. I commend him for his leadership \non this issue.\n  Like most of my colleagues, I do not oppose reform of our campaign \nfinance laws if it is done in a constitutionally sound manner. But, I \ndo not think passing campaign finance reform--this McCain-Feingold \namendment, for example--just to say we've enacted reform gives us any \nsort of bragging rights. There is no virtue in passing a bad bill.\n  I would like to spend just a few minutes addressing what, in my mind, \nis a much greater issue: the investigation of the fundraising abuses \nduring the 1996 election cycle. At a time when the supporters of \nMcCain-Feingold are urging adoption of an unprecedented increase in \nfederal regulation of campaigns and public discourse, which would be \nenforced by this administration, that same administration has made \nalmost no progress in finding out whether the laws already on the books \nwere trampled by the Clinton/Gore campaign, the White House, and the \nDemocratic National Committee. Unfortunately, the Attorney General of \nthe United States, Janet Reno, has continued to refuse to do what the \nlaw compels her: appoint an independent counsel to conduct the \ninvestigation of the fundraising activities surrounding the 1996 \nreelection campaign. And her own investigation, mired in obvious \nconflict of interest, has been a dismal failure.\n  Last week I met for almost three hours with Attorney General Reno and \ntop officials and staff of the Justice Department, including Deputy \nAttorney General Holder and Former Task Force head Charles LaBella, \nalong with House Judiciary Chairman Hyde, House Government Reform and \nOversight Chairman Burton, and Ranking Member Waxman, regarding the \ncampaign finance investigation and the application of the independent \ncounsel statute to this widespread and dangerous scandal.\n  I had requested this meeting in late July after the existence of the \nso-called LaBella memorandum had come to light. In that memo, Mr. \nLaBella, the handpicked lead investigator with the most extensive \nknowledge of the facts of this scandal, concluded that the facts and \nlaw dictated that a broad independent counsel be appointed to \ninvestigate campaign finance abuses by the 1996 Clinton/Gore reelection \ncampaign, the Clinton administration, and the Democratic National \nCommittee. This memo came several months after a similar written \nconclusion made by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nLouis Freeh.\n  Under federal law, the Attorney General must apply to the special \ndivision of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for appointment \nof an independent counsel whenever, after completion of a preliminary \ninvestigation, she finds finds information that a high-ranking official \nincluded in a specific category of individuals within the executive \nbranch may have violated federal law.\n  More than one and a half years ago, all ten Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee felt the time had come to request such an \nappointment. We sent a letter to the Attorney General, as we are \nauthorized to do by the independent counsel statute, requesting that \nshe make an application for an independent counsel and demonstrating \nthe evidence which requires such an application concerning the campaign \nfinance scandal.\n  After reviewing redacted versions of the memos prepared by Mr. \nLaBella and Director Freeh, it is clear that both gentleman have \nadvanced strong, convincing arguments in support of a broad-based \nindependent counsel. Importantly, when I asked the Attorney General and \nher top advisors why those recommendations have, thus far, been \nrejected, the answers I received were vague, insufficient, or \nunconvincing.\n  I have urged Attorney General Reno to appoint a broad-based \nindependent counsel for campaign finance for well over a year. I have \nwritten the Attorney General numerous times to demonstrate how she is \nmisapplying and misunderstanding the independent counsel law. The law \nallows her to appoint a independent counsel if she has information that \na crime may have been committed, but she has read the law as requiring \nthat the evidence shows without a doubt that a crime has been \ncommitted. By setting up this legal standard, she basically has \nrequired that a smoking gun walk in the doors of Justice Department \nbefore she appoints an independent counsel.\n  As has been widely reported, numerous individual investigations are \nbeing\n\n[[Page S10165]]\n\nhandled by the task force. Yet, the task force has reportedly never \nconducted an investigation or inquiry into the entire campaign finance \nmatter in order to determine if there exists specific and credible \ninformation warranting the triggering of the independent counsel \nstatute. Indeed, as has been reported, the task force has been \nutilizing a higher threshold of evidence when evaluating allegations \nthat may implicate the Independent Counsel Act or White House \npersonnel.\n  I have admired the courage of FBI Director Freeh and lead \ninvestigator LaBella in discussing, within applicable rules, their \nviews on these important issues. They made it clear that the \nindependent counsel is required under the law, that there are no legal \narguments for the Attorney General to hide behind. Director Freeh \nstated that covered White House persons are at the heart of the \ninvestigation. Investigator LaBella said there was a core group of \nindividuals at the White House and the Clinton campaign involved in \nillegal fundraising.\n  Now some may attempt to defend the Attorney General by noting that \nshe has gone through the process of legal reviews of many aspects of \nthe campaign finance scandal. These actions are good, although clearly \nincomplete, steps. Each month that goes by sees the Attorney General \nlurch towards a real investigation of the campaign finance scandal. We \nnow have action on several peripheral fronts, including the independent \ncounsel investigating Bruce Babbitt, the reviews of potential false \nstatements by the Vice President concerning his fundraising calls and \nby Harold Ickes regarding his involvement with unions, and now the \nreview of the President's control of DNC advertising.\n  My primary focus, however, has been and remains the infusion of \nforeign money and influence on our campaigns. Until we have a broad-\nbased independent counsel investigation, we will only be looking at the \nloose threads of the scandal and not the most serious alleged \nviolations.\n  In addition, I hope that the Attorney General will not take the \nentire three months to make decisions on these latest matters. The \ncampaign finance violations we are discussing happened two and three \nyears ago and every day that passes means leads are drying up, evidence \nis lost, and statutes of limitations are running.\n  While Lead Investigator LaBella and FBI Director Freeh recommended \nthat the Attorney General appoint an independent counsel to look into \nthe coordination issue, it is clear that they both think an independent \ncounsel should be appointed to handle the whole scandal, not just these \nperipheral issues. Any independent counsel must be given authority to \ndelve into the most important questions of the scandal. As the New York \nTimes concluded, a limited appointment would be a ``scam to avoid \ngetting at the more serious questions of whether the Clinton campaign \nbartered Presidential audiences or policy decisions for contributions. \nA narrowly focussed inquiry could miss the towering problem of how so \nmuch illegal foreign money, possibly including Chinese government \ncontributions, got into Democratic accounts.''\n  I must also take issue with the Attorney General's assertions that \nthe current investigation is not a failure because it has secured a \nlimited number of indictments. Let's remember that the ongoing campaign \nfinance investigation has only indicted the most conspicuous people who \nmade illegal donations to the DNC or the Clinton/Gore campaign. It has \nmade no headway in finding out who in the administration or DNC knew \nabout or solicited these illegal donations. Until it does so, the \ninvestigation is a failure.\n  In closing, let me quote the New York Times, which, I believe, \ncaptured the situation perfectly: ``Ms. Reno keeps celebrating her \nstubbornness as if it were some sort of national asset or a \nconstitutional principle that had legal standing. It is neither. It is \na quirk of mind or personality that has blinded her to the clear \nmeaning of the statute requiring attorneys general to recuse themselves \nwhen they are sunk to the axle in conflict of interest.''\n  The inability of the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute \nthe violations of existing laws is the real scandal here. That is what \nwe should be talking about, rather than legislation which would \nrepresent an unconstitutional, unwise, and partisan trampling of our \nelectoral system and First Amendment rights.\n  One final note, Mr. President. I believe that the American people \nwant accountability in the electoral market place--not more \nrestrictions on what they can and cannot do to participate in it. \nAccountability is a desirable thing in campaigning. I have always \nfavored disclosure, and I believe we can take steps to enhance the \ninformation available to the press and to the public. But, \naccountability is not the same as regulating, which is what we are \ndebating here today.\n  This measure imposes new restrictions without necessarily increasing \naccountability, and it does so at a time when there has been little \neffort to effectively enforce the campaign laws we already have on the \nbooks. I join the Senator from Kentucky in urging defeat of this \namendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, in the next few weeks I will be casting my \nfinal votes and concluding my four terms in the Senate. During this \nlast term, a significant amount of my time has been devoted to \ninvestigating abuses of our current campaign finance system. What I \nhave learned is that this is a problem which cannot wait. I am pleased \nthat one of my remaining votes can be cast in support of important \nreform, however, I am disappointed that the Senate will likely not pass \nthis much needed legislation.\n  Although I have always been a supporter of campaign finance reform--\nand indeed I personally believe that a system of campaigns fairly and \nequally underwritten by all Americans through some form of publicly \nsupported financing is the only way to ensure public officials are not \nunduly influenced--but this last session has been a lesson for me on \njust how urgently we need to fix the campaign finance laws.\n  When we originally passed the current campaign finance laws it was in \nthe wake of allegations that the presidential campaigns of the early \n1970s had accepted hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars \nfrom secret contributors not known to the voters. The goals of that law \nwere right and for many years it served us well. But there are few \nthings that change as quickly as campaigns and politics. By 1996 our \nlaw had been eroded to the point that it was barely recognizable.\n  In 1996, we again faced a system totally out of control--filled with \nsoft money and thinly disguised political advertisements masquerading \nas ``issue'' advertising funded by secret sources. We faced an election \nin which even the Members of this body--the people governed by the \ncampaign finance laws--did not know what was legal and what was not.\n  The amendment that is before us today and the bill that passed the \nHouse are a direct product of the chaos of the 1996 election. They are \ngood legislation that address the two key problems of our campaign \nfinance system--the proliferation of soft money and the use of thinly \ndisguised ``issue'' advertisements. In addition, the legislation takes \nimportant steps to strengthen the Federal Election Commission. The \ngoals of the bill before us today are the same as those of the original \nlaw: to deter corruption, to inform voters and to prevent wealthy \nprivate interests from exercising disproportionate influence over the \ngovernment.\n  There is no question that most problems we saw in the 1996 election \nstemmed from legal activity. There is also no question that both \npolitical parties and groups supporting candidates on both sides of the \naisle in 1996 took advantage of these loopholes in their quest to win. \nThe problems of soft money being used to purchase access and of secret \ncontributors funding their own attack advertising campaigns without \ndisclosing their identity can not be solved by any other means than by \npassing a new law.\n  The proposals in this bill are carefully drafted to protect the First \nAmendment right of voters to engage in political speech. The \nlegislation simply requires public disclosure and compliance with \ncontribution limits. To those who see no problem with soft money \nadvertising campaigns by parties and issue advertising by unknown and \nundisclosed contributors I can only wonder what they will say after the \nnext time they run for re-election and\n\n[[Page S10166]]\n\ndiscover they no longer have any control over the course of their own \ncampaigns?\n  No one can seriously argue that the system of soft money and secret \nissue ads is consistent with the spirit of the campaign finance laws. \nTogether, the soft-money and issue-advocacy loopholes have eviscerated \nthe contribution limits and disclosure requirements in federal election \nlaws and caused a loss of public confidence in the integrity of our \ncampaign finance system. By inviting corruption of the electoral \nprocess, they threaten our democracy. For parties to accept \ncontributions of hundreds of thousands--even millions--of dollars, from \ncorporations, unions and others to air candidate attack ads without \nmeeting any of the federal election law requirements for contribution \nlimits and public disclosure is a fundamental step backwards.\n  Twice in the past year we have voted on the amendment before us \ntoday. Each time, although a majority of the Members of this body have \nvoted in support of the bill--a minority opposed to reform has blocked \nits passage.\n  Today we again take up this measure--but this time with a \ndifference--this time the House of Representatives has worked together \nin a bi-partisan manner, recognized the critical need for reform, and \npassed a bill. By coming together and passing this reform legislation \nwe in the Senate can take advantage of a narrow window of opportunity \nand turn these bills into a new and vital campaign finance law. This is \na rare chance to fix a major problem. If we fail, it will plague us in \nmany elections to come.\n  Over the course of my Senate career, I have watched as public \ncynicism about government increases, and trust in government declines. \nIn 1996, for the first time, less than half the people in this country \neligible to vote cast a ballot. We must assure the integrity of our \ncampaigns if we are to have any hope that young Americans will continue \nto have the faith in our government and in its public servants.\n  If we do not act we here in the Senate will be responsible when the \nabuses witnessed by the American people in 1996 are repeated. All that \nwill change is that amounts of money will continue to increase and \npublic faith will continue to decline. In less than two months we will \nsee the loopholes ripped open in 1996 resulting in an even greater \nflood of money into the system as each party tries to elect their \nchosen candidates, and the candidates battle to be heard against the \nflood of issue advertising.\n  There is nothing I should like to be able to say so much as that I \nleft the Senate having helped to pass into law the amendment before us \ntoday. I would ask that my colleagues join with me to cast a vote to \nenact into law these sensible reforms that we know we need. Only then \ncan I depart with the confidence that we have acted to protect our \nelectoral process from the apathy and cynicism that are a danger to \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with this amendment the United States \nSenate has an excellent opportunity to restore public faith in the \npolitical system by enacting long overdue campaign finance reform. \nAfter cynically withdrawing the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform \nbill last winter, the Senate followed the lead of the House and passed \na needed new law to limit the role of money in election campaigns.\n  The current system is a scandal, and I commend Senator McCain and \nSenator Feingold for their leadership in demanding that the Senate act \non reform. The vast sums of special interest money pouring into \ncampaigns are a cancer on our democracy. The voice of the average \ncitizen today is scarcely heard over the din of lobbyists and big \ncorporations contributing millions of dollars to political campaigns \nand buying hundreds of TV ads to promote the causes of their special \ninterests.\n  Every Democrat supports the proposal before us. If enough Republicans \njoin us, this reform will pass.\n  It is time to end special interest gimmickry in campaign advertising. \nCurrently, special interests can run as many so-called issue ads as \nthey wish as long as they do not specifically advocate a candidate's \nelection. The American people aren't being fooled--they know that these \nare campaign ads in disguise and should be regulated accordingly.\n  Democrats also want to close the gaping loophole on soft money, which \nallows special interests to bypass legal limits on giving money \ndirectly to candidates. Big corporations and other special interests \nuse this loophole to funnel money to candidates through the back door, \nby making so-called ``soft-money'' contributions to political parties \nand other political organizations that are spent to benefit candidates.\n  More than $250 million in soft money contributions played a part in \nthe 1996 elections. McCain-Feingold proposal will ban this practice.\n  The fact is that phony issue ads and soft money contributions have \ncreated a climate in which our elections and our legislative agenda are \ndetermined more and more by how much money candidates can raise and \nless and less by issues of concern to families and communities across \nAmerica. The public doesn't have to look any further than the Senate \nfloor to see the effect big money has on the Republican legislative \nagenda.\n  For example, Republicans are determined to pass a bankruptcy bill \nbought and paid for by the consumer credit industry, despite the pleas \nof bankruptcy judges, scholars, and consumer groups.\n  Why is Congress moving so quickly to pass legislation that raises \nsuch grave concerns? Who benefits from the bill? Is it working \nfamilies, the elderly, women and children? The answer is a resounding \n``no.'' If you want to know who benefits from this legislation, just \nlook at the corporate interests making soft money contributions--the \nconsumer credit industry gave $5.5 million in soft money during the \n1995-1996 election cycle. Common Cause reports that since 1995, \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives have received more than \ntwice the PAC and soft money contributions from consumer creditors as \nDemocrats, and--not surprisingly--Republicans voted wholesale for the \nbankrtupcy bill. In the House of Representatives, the bill had the \nsupport of every Republican.\n  The tobacco industry's total PAC and soft money contributions are \nless than half of what the credit industry gave during the same \nperiod--but, it was enough for the Republican leadership to reject \nneeded anti-tobacco legislation and prevent it from being enacted.\n  The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids reports that Senators who voted \nconsistently against the tobacco reform legislation took far more money \nfrom the industry--four times more--than those who supported the bill. \nIn the past ten years, Senators supporting the tobacco industry's \nposition have accepted an average of $34,000, while those who support \nreform measures accepted about $8,000 in contributions.\n  The challenge of managed care reform is another example of the power \nthat big corporations can wield against the interests of individuals \nand families in the political process. In the halls of Congress, big \nmoney from campaign contributors is drowning the voices of our \nconstituents.\n  A year ago, in a private strategy meeting called to defeat the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, staff from the Senate Republican leadership \nexhorted insurance industry lobbyists to ``Get off your butts, get off \nyour wallets.'' And lo and behold, the industry ingloriously responded.\n  In fact, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and its state affiliates have made $1 \nmillion in political contributions during the 1997-1998 cycle, with \nfour out of every five dollars going to Republicans. They are also the \nnumber one PAC donors to leadership committees. They more than doubled \ntheir contributions during the 1995-1996 election cycle and 98 percent \nof the contributions were directed to Republicans.\n  According to the Center on Responsive Politics, managed care PACs--\nincluding the American Association of Health Plans, the Health \nInsurance Association of America, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield--gave \n$77,250 to leadership political action committees. All but $1,500 went \nto the Republican majority. As of July 1, these industry PACs have made \n$1.8 million in political contributions during this election cycle, and \n70 percent of the money is directed to Republicans.\n  These same corporations have also funded a multi-million dollar \nadvertising campaign of disinformation and distortion on managed case \nreform.\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\nThe same corporations profit by denying care to patients who have \nfaithfully paid their premiums. These same corporations, with their \ncrocodile tears, claim that patient protections will bankrupt them or \nforce them to raise premiums by hundreds of dollars.\n  These same corporations are spending millions of dollars--taken from \npremiums paid by patients--on political campaign contributions and \nadvertising to defeat the very legislation that patients need and \ndeserve.\n  What did this significant investment buy? Just what they wanted. \nInaction by Congress. Stonewalling. A ``just say no'' strategy. At the \nbehest of their big donors and special interest friends, the Senate \nRepublican leadership has delayed and denied consideration of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights for nearly a year and a half.\n  The choice is clear. Will the Senate stand with patients, families, \nand physicians, or with the well-heeled special interests that put \nprofits ahead of patients?\n  It is clear that the majority of Senator Republicans are standing \nwith the special interests. There is no mystery about what is going on. \nThe Republican Leadership's position is to protect the insurance \nindustry instead of protecting the patients. They know they can't do \nthat in the light of day. So their strategy has been to work behind \nclosed doors to kill the bill. Keep it bottled up in Committee. No \nmarkup. No floor debate or vote.\n  Bill Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica, was asked in a interview published in the Rocky Mountain News \nto sum up the coalition's strategy. According to the article, Mr. \nGradison replied ``[t]here's a lot to be said for `Just say no.' '' The \nauthor of the article goes on to report that:\n\n       [a]t a strategy session . . . called by a top aide to \n     Senator Don Nickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid \n     taking public positions that could draw fire during the \n     election campaign. Opponents will rely on Republican leaders \n     in both chambers to keep managed care legislation bottled up \n     in committee.\n\n  Just as managed care plans gag their doctors, the Republican \nleadership wants to gag the Senate. Just as insurance companies delay \nand deny care, the Republican leadership is trying to delay and deny \nmeaningful reform. Just as health plans want to avoid being held \naccountable when they kill or injure a patient, the Republican \nleadership wants to avoid being held accountable for killing patient \nprotection legislation.\n  That is why the Republican leadership is trying to hide its tactics \nof delay and denial behind a smokescreen of parliamentary maneuvers and \nphony procedural justifications. They say we don't have time to debate \nmanaged care. They reject offer after offer from the Democratic leader, \nthereby continuing the stall of this critically important legislation. \nI say, the American people aren't interested in excuses. They want \naction. They want reforms. They want clean elections. This legislation \nwill give it to them and it deserves to pass by an overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is the sixth year I have been a \nMember of the U.S. Senate. And this is the sixth year I can recall \ndebating campaign finance reform. I have voted to pass campaign reform \nlegislation in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, and now 1998. We actually passed \na good bill in the Senate in 1993. Each time it has been killed off by \nfilibuster.\n  Each time I thought, this is it. This is our chance to make some \nchanges that the people of this country will notice and respect. This \nis our chance to restore a measure of faith in American democracy. \nWhile I've had my share of disappointments, today we are here again \nwith a rare and valuable opportunity to actually get a bill signed into \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, it is critically important that we pass campaign \nreform legislation. The health of our democracy is not good. Yes, the \neconomy is strong, crime is down, and people are generally feeling good \nabout their lives. But there is an undercurrent that I find deeply \ntroubling, and it's been building for the past two decades.\n  People simply do not like government. They do not trust government, \nand they do not feel like they are part of the process. They are losing \nfaith and I think it would be terrible if we did not do something to \nre-invigorate peoples' interest in American democracy.\n  If any of my colleagues doubt this, just look at voter turnout rates \nand voter registration rates. People just are not participating any \nmore, and it gets worse each year.\n  What exactly is the problem? Money, plain and simple. Too much money, \nhaving too much influence over our democratic process.\n  The campaign system is so clogged with money, there is hardly room \nleft for the average voter. Political campaigning has become an \nindustry in this country. In the last election, over a billion dollars \nwere spent on federal elections alone. To what end?\n  That money--much of it undisclosed, from dubious sources--flowed into \nthe political arena and dictated the terms of our elections to the \npeople. Like water, it flowed downhill into campaigns all across the \ncountry. Some of it came out in the form of national party ads \nattacking candidates in the abstract; some came out in the form of \nissue-ads by interest groups trying to influence the outcomes. Some of \nit came out in the candidates' own TV ads.\n  It reaches the point where you almost cannot hear the voices of the \ncandidates or the people anymore, only the voices of the dueling \nspecial interests. We do not know who pays for these ads, where they \nget their money, or what they stand to gain if their candidate wins. \nYet they have found ways to have a huge influence over the election \nprocess.\n  Opponents of reform argue against the McCain-Feingold bill on free \nspeech grounds. They argue politicians and political parties should be \nable to take money in any amount from anyone in order to make the case \nfor their re-election. They believe that having more money entitles one \nto a greater influence over our campaigns and elections. I find this \nargument shocking, Mr. President. I find it profoundly un-democratic, \nand un-American.\n  The last time we debated reform, I told a story of a woman who sent \nmy campaign a small contribution of fifteen dollars. With her check she \nenclosed a note that said, ``please make sure my voice means as much as \nthose who give thousands.'' With all due respect, Mr. President, this \nwoman is typical of the people who deserve our best representation. \nSadly, under the current campaign system, they rarely do.\n  I have tried to live by my word on this issue. My first Senate \ncampaign was a shoe-string affair. I was out spent nearly three-to-one \nby a congressional incumbent. But because I had a strong, grassroots, \npeople-based effort, I was able to win.\n  Since then, I have worked hard to keep to that standard. I have over \n35,000 individual donors. The average contribution to my campaign is 69 \ndollars. Nearly 75 percent of my contributions come from within \nWashington state. I firmly believe that's the way campaigns should be \nrun: by the people.\n  We need more disclosure, not less. We need more restrictions on \nspecial interest money, not fewer. We need less money in the system, \nnot more. We need to amplify the voices of regular people, instead of \nallowing them to be shouted down by special interests.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of reform miss the point. In America, \nmoney does not equal speech. More money does not entitle one to more \nspeech. The Haves are not entitled to a greater voice in politics than \nthe Have-nots. In America, everyone has an equal say in our government. \nThat is why our Declaration of Independence starts with, ``We, the \npeople.''\n  When this Congress started, I thought this might really be our chance \nto pass a bill. The public was paying more attention. The excesses of \nthe last campaign season, brought to light through the good work of the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, made campaign reform a front-burner issue \nin every kitchen in America. More than one million signatures were \ndelivered to the Capitol from people all over America who joined a \nnationwide call for reform.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators committed to reform worked overtime to \ncraft a reasonable reform measure that makes sense for America. I think \nwe\n\n[[Page S10168]]\n\nall owe a debt of gratitude to Senators McCain and Feingold for their \nwork. They generated public support, made their case to the media, and \npushed for the last few votes necessary to pass a bill. Well, the time \nhas come to see if this is our chance to do the right thing.\n  Our like-minded colleagues in the other body did find the votes, and \nthey did pass a good strong bill. The Senate has more than enough votes \nto pass the same bill on an up-or-down vote. All we need are eight more \nvotes from the majority party to do the right thing for America. Mr. \nPresident, who will it be? Who will be the heroes on this vote? And who \nwill let down the millions of American citizens who have grown sick, \ntired, and alienated from our democratic system?\n  Mr. President, I believe we have made this debate way too \ncomplicated. After all the maneuvering, the cloture petitions, the \ntechnicalities, the procedural votes, this issue boils down to one \nbasic question: are senators willing to make some modest reforms to \nreduce the influence of big money in politics and encourage greater \nvoter participation? Or are they more interested in protecting the \ncurrent system, and the ability of parties and politicians to turn \nfinancial advantage into political advantage?\n  Are you for reform, or against it? Are you with the people, or \nagainst them on the need for a more healthy democracy? The votes we are \ntaking today will show the answers to these questions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I add my voice to the on-going \ndebate on the campaign finance reform bill that is before us once \nagain. Let me say right up front, so that there is no confusion, I \nsupport, and I have always supported enforceable, reasonable, common-\nsense reform. Unfortunately, I don't believe the amendment offered by \nSenators McCain and Feingold before the Senate meets those standards, \nnor do I believe it would stand a Constitutional challenge. As I stated \nwith my friend and fellow Coloradan, Senator Allard, in a joint \neditorial printed in the Denver Post back in October, ``real campaign \nfinance reform protects the right to free speech under the First \nAmendment while guaranteeing the public's right to know through full \ndisclosure.'' This amendment does not contain that kind of reform. The \nConstitution guarantees all Americans the right to freedom of speech \nand association in the First Amendment.\n  The Supreme Court applied those words to campaign spending in the \nlandmark case Buckley v. Valeo to mean that money spent in favor or \nagainst a candidate is a form of speech, and therefore entitled to this \nprotection. That decision has been reinforced over and over again. \nGiven this ruling, I cannot believe that the Court, or the Founding \nFathers, intended to impose a sixty- or thirty-day moratorium prior to \nelections on this right, as this amendment would do. I believe the \nFounders wanted Americans to have the unabridged right to speak their \nminds and show their support for candidates by using a collective \nvoice, including showing support by making contributions to one \ncandidate or another.\n  In order to have an educated electorate, money must be spent on \nspreading candidates' messages. In our free market system, advertising \nrates are determined by the industry. I would note that these days, \nthere is hardly such a thing as a ``free exchange of ideas,'' as nearly \nall forms of communication cost money. The exchange of ideas and \nopinions is what allows the public to become informed about the \ncandidates that are seeking office. But limiting the amount candidates \ncan raise and spend severely limits the ability to spread information \nabout their backgrounds and opinions, and only harms citizens. I cannot \nunderstand why this amendment targets some forms of spreading these \nmessages while allowing others to continue unchecked. Doesn't that \nsignal to the American people that the First Amendment only applies to \nspeech that is printed, and not speech that is broadcast?\n  I would note that my colleagues and I have been under tremendous \npressure this session to pass this particular legislation. But until we \nhave found a solution that answers all the Constitutional concerns that \nhave been raised, I am reluctant to act on this particular measure. As \nwas stated in an editorial that appeared in my state's Rocky Mountain \nNews, this ``particular piece of legislation would have betrayed \nseveral of the nation's most important principles, not the least of all \nis its guarantee of free political speech.'' I wholeheartedly agree \nwith this sentiment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The McCain-Feingold Fraud\n\n       As those of you with the radio on last week probably know, \n     Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell has been the target of an ad \n     campaign by a coalition that supports something known as the \n     McCain-Feingold bill, a campaign finance reform that died \n     last Thursday in the U.S. Senate.\n       Various local journalists also joined the crusade, in one \n     instance publishing Campbell's office phone number as a \n     service to readers who wished to complain about his failure \n     to support the bill.\n       But, in fact, that particular piece of legislation would \n     have betrayed several of the nation's most important \n     principles, not least of all its guarantee of free political \n     speech. Under one of its provisions, for instance, groups \n     focused on particular issues would be prohibited from \n     mentioning the names of candidates in advertisements as \n     elections drew near.\n       Can anyone with any understanding of the First Amendment \n     honestly believe that Congress can constitutionally prohibit \n     any organization of Americans from saying any politician at \n     nay time it chooses?\n       The American Civil Liberties Union has correctly identified \n     one probable result of McCain-Feingold: ``to shut down \n     citizen criticism of incumbent officeholders standing for re-\n     election at the very time when the public's attention is \n     especially focused on such issues.''\n       The truth is, McCain-Feingold would probably have fixed \n     very little on its way to hampering democratic discussion. It \n     would not have become easier--and might well have become \n     harder--to challenge an incumbent, especially if you happened \n     to be a third-party candidate. For that matter, the most \n     publicized campaign spending scandals of the past year \n     involved activity that was already illegal. If the bill had \n     been enacted, politicians probably would have figured out \n     ways to circumvent it--and the Supreme Court probably would \n     have declared it unconstitutional.\n       Sure, the present system is not pretty to look at. \n     Politicians work constantly to raise money for their \n     campaigns, and special interest groups are forever trying to \n     influence legislation with their donations, usually by \n     helping those who have helped them in the past. One possible \n     reform is full, instant disclosure of contributions so that \n     voters can themselves determine whether candidates are in \n     danger of being bought.\n       Give people liberty, and their political system is going to \n     be messy. Taking away some significant portion of that \n     liberty is too high a price for cleaning things up.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly support the McCain-Feingold \namendment to reform the federal campaign finance system.\n  It is clear that a majority of the United States Senate supports the \nMcCain-Feingold amendment. I urge senators to stop filibustering this \nextremely important matter, and let us pass the plan and send a bill to \nthe president.\n  I want to explain what the amendment does and the kinds of abuses of \nthe system that it would prevent.\n  First, it bans unlimited ``soft money'' contributions, which are \ncontributions to national political committees like the Republican and \nDemocratic National Committees.\n  Under current law, ``soft money'' contributions are unlimited and \nvirtually unregulated. This means that a corporation with an interest \nin legislation pending in Congress--such as an oil company--can give \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to the national political parties in \nan attempt to influence the outcome of the legislation.\n  The McCain-Feingold amendment would shut down the special interest \nmoney machine by imposing limits on contributions to the national \npolitical parties.\n  Second, the McCain-Feingold amendment bans attack advertising \ndisguised as ``issue ads'' by corporations and unions within 60 days of \nan election. The amendment also requires others--individuals and \nnonprofit organizations--to disclose their contributors and \nexpenditures for these ads.\n  Current law allows anyone to launch vicious attacks against \ncandidates and not disclose their true identity or the sources of their \ncontributions, as long\n\n[[Page S10169]]\n\nas the ad doesn't say ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' the candidate.\n  For example, a group of tobacco companies can get together, form a \nphony organization called ``Citizens for Good Government'', and have \nthat ``organization'' spend millions of dollars for television ads \nattacking a congressional candidate who supports tougher tobacco laws. \nAnd those companies never have to disclose what they did.\n  This isn't just a hypothetical: In my own state, outside special \ninterest groups regularly spend millions of dollars attacking \nCalifornia congressional candidates, often leaving those candidates \nmere spectators in their own election campaigns.\n  The amendment prohibits corporations and unions from buying these \nstealth attack ads, and anyone else--individuals and nonprofit \norganizations--has to disclose what they are doing.\n  Third, the amendment fixes a major problem in the law governing \n``independent expenditures'', which are efforts on behalf of a \ncandidate by someone not affiliated with that candidate's campaign.\n  Under current law, a political party can make ``independent \nexpenditures'' on behalf of a candidate at the same time it is making \nexpenditures that are coordinated with the candidate's campaign. Mr. \nPresident, this is an absurd situation! Clearly, a political party \ncan't--at the same time, with the same political operatives, from the \nsame office--be both ``independent of'' and ``coordinate with'' a \npolitical campaign!\n  The McCain-Feingold amendment allows a political party to do only one \nor the other: If the party makes ``independent expenditures'', it can't \nalso make ``coordinated'' expenditures for the campaign.\n  Finally, the amendment requires faster and more complete disclosure \nof contributions to campaigns.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for \ncloture on this amendment and move to passage so that we can send a \nbill to the president and make these changes in our campaign finance \nsystem.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In light of the fact we have limited time, I ask that \nany time that is open here, a quorum call time, be charged to the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I confess, I was not particularly \nattentive. What was the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request was that any \nquorum calls be charged exclusively to the time under the control of \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask that the time be equally divided with regard to \nthe quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague from Wisconsin whether I can speak \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I inform the Senator from Minnesota, we only have a \ntotal of 16 minutes remaining. Mr. McCain would like some time. If the \nSenator would like to speak for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is to be advised \nthat he has 11 minutes, 45 seconds remaining. The Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had a chance to speak yesterday for \nabout half an hour, so let me summarize this way:\n  First of all, I thank Senator Feingold who I think has just emerged, \nreally, as a leading reformer before the U.S. Senate for his work, \nalong with Senator McCain. This is a bipartisan effort, and I, frankly, \nthink it speaks to the core issue.\n  What I tried to say yesterday on the floor of the Senate is that as I \nthink about a whole range of questions, over and over and over again, I \ncome back to the fact that too few people have way too much wealth, \npower, and say, and too many people are just locked out. The polls show \npeople want to have faith in our political process, people want to \nbelieve in what we are doing, but the conclusion that many people have \nreached is that if you pay, you play, and if you don't pay, you don't \nplay, and that, basically, the same investors pretty much control both \npolitical parties; they control the political process.\n  So many people in Minnesota and across the country have reached the \nconclusion that when it comes to their concerns about themselves and \nabout their families and about their neighbors and about their \ncommunities, that their concerns are of little concern here in the \ncorridors of power.\n  I can't think of a better thing for us to do than to pass this piece \nof legislation. The Shays-Meehan bill passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. That was a very important victory. We now have an \nimportant vote on the floor of the Senate. There is an effort on the \npart of those who are opposed to reform to block this. That is what \nthis is all about. We have a majority support on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. I hope that other Senators will step forward and support this \nimportant piece of legislation, this important amendment offered by \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, a good government State, a progressive \nState, a State that cares about clean money and clean elections, a \nState that believes integrity in the political process is the most \nimportant thing that we can focus on, this piece of legislation, this \namendment is the most important amendment that we will be voting on \nduring this Senate.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to end this filibuster and support \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in light of the fact that we have very \nlimited time remaining, I ask that any time under subsequent quorum \ncalls not be charged against our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? As a Senator from the \nState of Minnesota, I lodge an objection.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am about to put in a quorum call. I am \ngoing to ask unanimous consent that we be able to use our remaining \ntime near the conclusion of this debate. We have how much time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has control of 8 \nminutes, 40 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that we be permitted to use \nthat time just prior to the end of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Again, as a Senator from the State of \nMinnesota, I have to object. I can equally divide--objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Sean \nO'Brien, who is an intern in my office, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10170]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who requests time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have control of the time. \nWho seeks time? The Senator has control of time on the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that it be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished proponent \nof this bill from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, would be willing to \nyield some time. Does the Senator have any additional time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Precious little. I can yield the Senator 2 minutes of \nour remaining 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My speech will be much better than sitting in a quorum \ncall. I thought I might get more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I came over to express my very strong \nsupport for campaign finance reform. From the time I ran for Governor \nin 1970 until 28 years later--this very moment--I have abhorred the \nsystem of financing campaigns in this country. One of the reasons--not \nthe main reason, but certainly one of the reasons I decided not to seek \nreelection this year was because I detested going out and raising \nmoney.\n  Let me also say that it is reaching the point in this country where \nthe cost of campaigning goes up every single year--and there is no end \nin sight.\n  Right now the Attorney General is conducting a 90-day interim period \ninvestigation on whether or not the DNC coordinated a 1996 campaign \nwith the President of the United States. The same thing is going on \nwith the Vice President. And the same thing will go on forever until we \nchange it, and change it dramatically--soft money, hard money, issue \nads, attack ads.\n  I close, Mr. President, by saying I consider not only the method of \nfinancing campaigns in this country ominous, quite frankly, I consider \nit rotten to the core.\n  I also want to say to the American people----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thirty seconds?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the Senator 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Anybody who believes that a democracy can survive when \nthe people you elect and the laws you pass depend on how much money is \ngiven for the cause are daydreaming. It is dangerous to our system. It \nis dangerous to our democracy. I plead with my colleagues to vote for \ncloture on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nvote is scheduled for the hour of 1:45?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This side has used all but 8 minutes of its time, and the \nother side has not used a significant amount of its time because there \nis an hour and 15 minutes approximately between now and when the vote \nis scheduled.\n  What we are trying to achieve here is, one, allow the debate to \ncontinue, and, two, allow the proponents of the legislation the \nopportunity to continue the debate.\n  I thought that this whole debate was being conducted in an atmosphere \nof comity. When I have been in other debates here on the floor of the \nSenate and there has been no one to speak in opposition or in favor of \na particular amendment, then those who wanted to speak were allowed to \nspeak.\n  If we are going to depart from that, Mr. President, OK. But I am \nasking unanimous consent, one, that the last 20 minutes be equally \ndivided, 10 minutes on each side, but also I am asking unanimous \nconsent that if there are no speakers in opposition to the legislation, \nthat speakers in favor of the amendment be allowed to speak rather than \njust throw the Senate into a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  In the Chair's capacity as a Senator from Minnesota----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I make one addition? I ask unanimous consent to add \none addition to that. That is, when Senator McConnell returns, and if \nhe or any of the opponents wish to use their time, they clearly would \nbe allowed to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the President, and I thank my colleagues for \ntheir cooperation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Under the unanimous consent agreement, I understand, as \nlong as there are not opposition speakers present, that we can go \nforward without that being charged against our remaining time. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In light of that, I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota has any \nadditional remarks. I am prepared go forward, if he does not.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of criticism of our bill during \nthis debate on constitutional grounds. The Senator from Kentucky said \nonce again yesterday something that he has said many times. He \nexpressed his opinion that there is ``absolutely no way'' that our bill \nwill be held constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. And obviously I \ndisagree with that analysis.\n  Our bill has been carefully crafted to be consistent with the Court's \ndecision in Buckley v. Valeo. The only way to find out who is right, of \ncourse--because you cannot call up the Chief Justice and ask him for \nadvice or his opinion--the only way is by passing this bill, and \nallowing a court challenge to take place. I and other supporters of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill are ready to defend this bill in court, and I \nsincerely hope that we will have a chance to do so.\n  The Senator from Kentucky does have one group on his side that does \nspecialize in the first amendment, the American Civil Liberties Union. \nAnd he is fond of reminding us that the ACLU, ``America's expert on the \nfirst amendment,'' as he likes to say, opposes our bill. Let me say, I \nhave a great deal of respect for the ACLU in many areas. In fact, I may \nhave agreed with them on more issues over the years than the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. But I think it is worth pointing out two things with \nrespect to the ACLU's position on campaign finance reform.\n  First, the ACLU is on record many times as opposing the Court's \ndecision in Buckley that limitations on campaign contributions are \nconstitutional. In other words, the ACLU disagrees with the Court's \nruling in Buckley. The ACLU believes, for example, that limitations on \nsoft money donations to political parties would be unconstitutional. \nBut that is an opinion that is by no means in the mainstream of \nconstitutional thought.\n  In fact, as we have noted many times over the last year, we have a \nletter signed by 127 law professors who wrote to Senator McCain and to \nme and gave their opinion that a soft money ban would be fully \nconsistent with the first amendment and the Buckley decision and \ntherefore would be constitutional.\n  Senator McConnell once said it would be easy to find 127 law \nprofessors of his own to say that soft money cannot be banned, but so \nfar no such letter has ever materialized. Senator McConnell has been \ncompletely unable to come up with a list of constitutional scholars \nthat would suggest that we cannot ban soft money, and I doubt that he \never could.\n  Second, there is a serious split within the ACLU itself. One of the \nmost interesting and significant developments in this whole debate \noccurred just this past June during the House debate on campaign \nfinance reform when a group of former leaders of the ACLU released a \nstatement on their opinion of the\n\n[[Page S10171]]\n\nconstitutionality of the House version of the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Mr. President, this isn't just one, if you will, disgruntled former \nleader of the ACLU. This statement was released by nine former leaders \nof the organization. They include every living person who has served as \npresident, executive director, legal director, or legislative director \nof the ACLU for the past 30 years, except for one person who is \ncurrently in Government service and is not free to express his opinion.\n  That is quite a thing--all of those former ACLU officials indicating \nthey do believe that this bill is constitutional. Let me just read from \nthe letter of June 19, the statement of persons who have served in the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union in leadership positions supporting the \nconstitutionally of efforts to enact reasonable campaign finance \nreform. They say:\n\n       We have devoted much of our professional lives to the ACLU, \n     and to the protection of free speech. We are proud of our \n     ACLU service, and we continue to support the ACLU's matchless \n     efforts to preserve the Bill of Rights. We have come to \n     believe, however, that the opposition to campaign finance \n     reform expressed by the ACLU misreads the First Amendment. In \n     our opinion, the First Amendment does not forbid content-\n     neutral efforts to place reasonable limits on campaign \n     spending.\n       We believe that the First Amendment is designed to \n     safeguard a functioning and fair democracy. The current \n     system of campaign financing makes a mockery of that ideal by \n     enabling the rich to set the national agenda, and to exercise \n     disproportionate influence over the behavior of public \n     officials.\n\n  Later in the letter the same individuals said,\n\n       . . . even within the limitations of the Buckley decision, \n     we believe that significant campaign finance reform is both \n     possible and constitutional. We support elimination of the \n     ``soft money'' loophole that allows unlimited campaign \n     contributions to political parties, undermining Congress's \n     effort to regulate the size and source of campaign \n     contributions to candidates. We believe that Congress, for \n     the purpose of regulating the size and source of federal \n     campaign contributions, may treat a contribution to the \n     political party sponsoring a federal candidate as though it \n     were a contribution to the candidate directly.\n       We also support regulation to the funding of political \n     advertising that is clearly intended to affect the outcome of \n     a specific federal election, but that omits the magic words \n     ``vote for'' or ``vote against''. We believe that Congress \n     may draft a narrowly tailored provision regulating the \n     funding of so-called ``issue advertisements'' that mention \n     one or more of the candidates, appear shortly before the \n     election, and are geographically targeted in an obvious \n     effort to affect the outcome of a specific federal election.\n\n  These individuals conclude by saying:\n\n       We believe that the current debate over campaign financing \n     reform in the House of Representatives and the Senate should \n     center on the important policy questions raised by various \n     efforts at reform. Opponents of reform should no longer be \n     permitted to hide behind an unjustified constitutional \n     spokescreen.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement of these nine former \nmembers of the ACLU be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 19, 1998.\n\nStatement of Persons Who Have Served the American Civil Liberties Union \nin Leadership Positions Supporting the Constitutionality of Efforts to \n                Enact Reasonable Campaign Finance Reform\n\n       We have served the American Civil Liberties Union in \n     leadership positions over several decades. Norman Dorsen \n     served as ACLU General Counsel from 1969-1976 and as \n     President of the ACLU from 1976-1991. Jack Pemberton and \n     Aryeh Neier served as Executive Directors of the ACLU from \n     1962-1978. Melvin Wulf, Bruce Ennis, Burt Neuborne, and John \n     Powell served as National Legal Directors of the ACLU from \n     1962-1992. Charles Morgan, Jr., and Morton Halperin served as \n     National Legislative Directors of the ACLU from 1972-1976, \n     and 1984-1992, respectively. Indeed, except for one person \n     currently in government service, and, therefore, not free to \n     express a personal opinion, we constitute every living person \n     to have served as ACLU President, ACLU Executive Director, \n     ACLU Legal Director, or ACLU Legislative Director during the \n     past 30 years, with the exception of the current leadership.\n       We have devoted much of our professional lives to the ACLU, \n     and to the protection of free speech. We are proud of our \n     ACLU service, and continue to support the ACLU's matchless \n     efforts to preserve the Bill of Rights. We have come to \n     believe, however, that the opposition to campaign finance \n     reform expressed by the ACLU misreads the First Amendment. In \n     our opinion, the First Amendment does not forbid content-\n     neutral efforts to place reasonable limits on campaign \n     spending.\n       We believe that the First Amendment is designed to \n     safeguard a functioning and fair democracy. The current \n     system of campaign financing makes a mockery of that ideal by \n     enabling the rich to set the national agenda, and to exercise \n     disproportionate influence over the behavior of public \n     officials.\n       We believe that Buckley v. Valeo, the 1976 Supreme Court \n     case that makes it extremely difficult to reform the current, \n     disastrous campaign financing system, should be overruled for \n     three reasons. First, the Buckley opinion inappropriately \n     treats the spending of money as though it were pure speech, \n     no matter how high the spending limits may be. But such an \n     approach ignores the long-established Supreme Court rule that \n     when speech is inextricably intertwined with conduct, the \n     conduct may be regulated if it threatens to cause serious \n     harm. While we agree that unreasonably low spending limits \n     would unconstitutionally impinge on free speech, the Buckley \n     Court failed to recognize that there is a compelling interest \n     in defending democracy that justifies reasonable spending \n     limits. Reasonable spending limits would free candidates and \n     officials to concentrate on substantive questions of public \n     policy, instead of spending excessive time raising campaign \n     funds. Reasonable spending limits would also free candidates \n     from becoming trapped in an arms race mentality, where each \n     candidate is forced to continue raising money, not because \n     they wish to, but to prevent being outspent by an \n     opponent.\n       Second, the Buckley opinion makes an untenable distinction \n     between campaign contributions, which may be subjected to \n     stringent government regulation, and campaign expenditures, \n     which are virtually immune from regulation. The bright-line \n     distinction between contributions and expenditures is neither \n     analytically nor pragmatically defensible. By upholding \n     limits on the size and source of campaign contributions, \n     while preventing any effort to limit the demand for campaign \n     funds by capping spending, the Buckley Court inadvertently \n     created a system that tempts politicians to break the law \n     governing campaign contributions in order to satisfy an \n     uncontrollable need for campaign cash.\n       Third, the Buckley Court erred in refusing to permit the \n     establishment of reasonable spending limits designed to avoid \n     unfair domination of the electoral process by a small group \n     of extremely wealthy persons. Instead of ``one person-one \n     vote'', the Buckley decision has resulted in a regime of \n     ``one dollar-one vote'' that magnifies the political \n     influence of extremely wealthy individuals and distorts the \n     fundamental principle of political equality underlying the \n     First Amendment itself, causing great harm to the democratic \n     principles that underlie the Constitution.\n       It is our hope that the current Supreme Court, confronted \n     with the unfortunate practical implications of the Buckley \n     decision, and the serious flaws in its constitutional \n     analysis, will reconsider the decision, and permit reasonable \n     legislative efforts to reform our campaign financing system.\n       Moreover, even within the limitations of the Buckley \n     decision, we believe that significant campaign finance reform \n     is both possible and constitutional. We support elimination \n     of the ``soft money'' loophole that allows unlimited campaign \n     contributions to political parties, undermining Congress's \n     effort to regulate the size and source of campaign \n     contributions to candidates. We believe that Congress, for \n     the purpose of regulating the size and source of federal \n     campaign contributions, may treat a contribution to the \n     political party sponsoring a federal candidate as though it \n     were a contribution to the candidate directly.\n       We also support regulation of the funding of political \n     advertising that is clearly intended to affect the outcome of \n     a specific federal election, but that omits the magic words \n     ``vote for'' or ``vote against''. We believe that Congress \n     may draft a narrowly tailored provision regulating the \n     funding of so-called ``issue advertisements'' that mention \n     one or more of the candidates, appear shortly before the \n     election, and are geographically targeted in an obvious \n     effort to affect the outcome of a specific federal election.\n       We believe that the current debate over campaign financing \n     reform in the House of Representatives and the Senate should \n     center on the important policy questions raised by various \n     efforts at reform. Opponents or reform should no longer be \n     permitted to hide behind an unjustified constitutional \n     smokescreen.\n\n         Norman Dorsen, Jack Pemberton, Aryeh Neier, Melvin Wulf, \n           Bruce Ennis, Burt Neuborne, John Powell, Charles \n           Morgan, Jr., Morton Halperin.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I think this is a very significant \nletter that undercuts this, frankly, false notion that the soft money \nban and some of the other key provisions in our bill are \nunconstitutional.\n  I am delighted now we have worked out the logjam on time and that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas is here to continue his remarks on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S10172]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to lead off with one of Mo Udall's \ngreat statements: Everything that needs to be said has been said but \neverybody hasn't said it. So I want to get my two cents in before we \nvote on this measure this afternoon.\n  A moment ago, I said everything about this issue I feel strongly \nabout, except for one thing: While I strongly support this legislation, \nI also believe that the ultimate solution to this problem is public \nfinancing. Unhappily, I will no longer be a member of this \ndistinguished body when this Country and Congress finally comes to its \nsenses and realizes that until we go to public financing, our democracy \nis simply not going to work. I am reluctant to make an admission today, \nbut I have always prided myself on standing up for things that \noftentimes were unpopular but I felt strongly were right.\n  I say to my colleagues, that I believe that one of the things that \nhas sustained me is the reputation of having taken a tough stance from \ntime to time. But since I announced that I would not seek reelection \nlast June, and as I have walked on the Senate floor to vote, I have \npondered how much the freedom of not running for reelection has \ninfluenced my vote. Now, that being said, I have cast many unpopular \nvotes that have irritated the people of my State, on such subjects as \nthe Panama Canal Treaty, and partial-birth abortion. However, after I \nannounced I wouldn't run again, I have asked myself, How would I vote \non this if I were up for reelection and knew I had to raise $3 or $4 \nmillion?\n  I believe there isn't a person in this body who can truthfully and \nfrequently say they are willing to take on interest groups. After all, \nwe are supposed to be servants of our constituents. But oftentimes \nthere are interest groups back home we are trying to satisfy because \nthey have a block of votes. We might vote their way. Even if we vote \nour conscious, the public can never be sure our votes were untainted.\n  The second thing that influences our vote is how our support or \nopposition will affect our money supply. I saw a comparison in the \npaper this morning of two PACs, of House and Senate leaders and the \namount of money that certain individual groups gave those leaders for \ntheir PACs. Staggering amounts of money. I don't care how altruistic it \nis for ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' it is foolish in the extreme \nto argue that this is a free speech debate. Mr. President, 94 percent \nof the people who run for office in this country win if they have more \nmoney than their opponents. A lot of good men and women are defeated \nevery year in this country because they are not incumbents and they \ncan't raise money. The people who give the big bucks don't like to give \ntheir money to challengers because they start out behind and usually \nstay behind. Of the 33 Senate races this year, I daresay there will be \nvery, very few changes, in any, of those seats. In almost every \ninstance, the candidate who has the most money and spends the most \nmoney will win the election.\n  Sometimes I think about debates. I have the first amendment that we \nwill consider on the Interior bill when we go back to it this \nafternoon. It is mine, and it is one that the mining industry of this \ncountry doesn't like. It is an environmental issue. I will make all of \nthe arguments that I have made on this floor time and again, not only \non that amendment but the whole issue of the 1872 mining law, which has \nbeen out of date for over 100 years now. God gave us one planet, only \none. We don't get a second chance. Incidentally, I have always argued \nthat the No. 1 problem in the world, of course, is population, but you \ncan't argue that here because the first thing you hear is that somebody \nhas converted it into an abortion argument. So we continue to neglect \nthe No. 1 problem in the world; namely, the growing population of the \nplanet. I saw a bumper sticker the other day that said, ``Help save the \nplanet, kill yourself.'' Clearly, that is a pretty draconian way to \nsave the planet. We ought to be talking sensibly about population \ngrowth, as we have been regarding campaign finance reform.\n  I can go on and on about this, and will continue to do so until the \ntaxpayers of this country understand that this is not an issue of free \nspeech. If the American people buy this argument, they are essentially \nsaying, ``I'm willing for somebody else to have more free speech than I \ndo because they have more money.'' As we all know, about 90 percent of \nthe people in this country can't afford to contribute and don't \ncontribute.\n  I had a few more remarks, but I understand the Senator from Georgia \nis pressed for time. I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the suggestion by the \nSenator from Arkansas. I have to depart in a few minutes, so he may \nchoose to continue his remarks at that point.\n  Let me say that I respectfully disagree with the comments we just \nheard from the Senator from Arkansas, as does the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. I am comfortable that if every member of the Founding \nFathers were here today, they would rise up in a loud chorus. The first \namendment to the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, makes it \nabsolutely and abundantly and succinctly clear that there shall be \nfreedom of speech. It doesn't define that somebody has this big a \nbucket and somebody has something else. It doesn't say a newspaper has \nthe right to say anything it chooses, but some other kind of company \nwill be constrained and managed by the Government.\n  Of all the things that I believe the forefathers were most concerned \nabout, it was the management of expression, the management of speech. \nThey were very careful. They were going to protect the American \ncitizens' right to assemble. Until the late 1700s, in Great Britain two \npeople could not get together in a club or in an association. Why? \nBecause the government was afraid of people coming together. They might \nthink up ideas; they might want to talk about them. So they said there \nwill be freedom of speech, there will be freedom of the press, there \nwill be a right to assemble, and there will be a right to petition the \ngovernment--they didn't say it, but without fear. These four things are \nin the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. They are probably, to \nthis day, the core of the American Constitution.\n  This has been tested over and over, and the Supreme Court has said \nthat expression costs money. If you are going to have a town hall \nmeeting, you have to rent the town hall. If you want to covey a message \nto a large audience, you can't go door to door; you are going to have \nto do it in a television ad or a newspaper ad. By the way, what is the \ndifference between a corporation that publishes a newspaper or runs a \ntelevision station and a corporation that makes tractors? Does one have \na higher standing? Not under the Constitution. The outfit that makes \ntractors can spend money and express themselves just like a newspaper. \nHeaven help us if we ever come to the point where the only institution \nin our country that has freedom of speech is the media. If everything a \npolitical person does or a Government official does is only interpreted \nby the media, heaven help us. I used to say, if you are for the \nGovernment managing what people say, you better know the manager. You \nbetter know the manager.\n  This whole issue is dominated by the subject of freedom of speech. I \nheard the distinguished Senator from Kentucky say many times that if \nthis ever became law, it won't last. The Supreme Court will strike it \ndown, which is probably the case, but it ought not to become law. It \nought not to become law. Anybody reading the rulings of the Supreme \nCourt understands very clearly that expression and financing expression \nare one and the same and cannot be separated.\n  The last institution in the world that the forefathers would have \never wanted to manage speech is the Government. In fact, if you look at \nthe Constitution from top to bottom, it is designed to protect us from \nGovernment--our own Government. They fought a revolution over this. \nThey knew well what was happening in Europe. They looked over and saw \nwhat was happening in Ireland and said that is not going to happen in \nAmerica. Of all the language in the Constitution, the most carefully \ncrafted language for which there can be no question about its \ninterpretation is the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. Freedom of \nspeech shall not be abridged.\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\n  This legislation does that. It abridges and begins to manage who can \nsay what, when they can say it, and how much of it they can say. And \nany Government official ought to be very wary of a situation where one \ngroup of Americans can say anything they choose, at any time, with any \nintensity, and another group of Americans can only say what somebody \nelse decided they should say, when they should say it, and how much.\n  Mr. President, I could never support anything like that, as \nfrustrated as we all get. Every American, at some point, has been \naffronted by freedom of speech. It has been frustrating to them to hear \nwhat somebody says or how they express themselves. I have been and \neverybody else has been. But better to suffer the frustration than to \ngive that liberty to somebody to manage speech. America would never be \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just conclude my remarks by \nreiterating something I said earlier about the issue of free speech. We \nall know that the difficulty is a constitutional one because the courts \nhave ruled that this is a free speech issue. But it can be overcome. It \ncan be overcome with the McCain-Feingold bill. It can be overcome with \npublic financing. There are all kinds of ways to amend the way we \nfinance campaigns in this country without violating free speech. But \nlet me just ask my constituents--no, let me ask my colleagues--no, my \ncolleagues have already made up their minds. Let me ask the American \npeople: Do you think we have a nice, democratic, fair system of \nelecting Members of the House and Senate when some fat cat can give a \ncandidate $4,000; he and his wife can give a candidate $4,000--$2,000 \nfor the primary, $2,000 for the general. I ask you, how much can a \nworking man making $10 an hour on an assembly line give? The question \nanswers itself. If he has a wife and two kids, he can't give anything. \nI don't care how much he may love a candidate; he is not in a position, \nat $10 an hour, to be making political contributions.\n  The second question: When a candidate gets $4,000 from a fat cat--\nwhen legislation is being considered in the U.S. Congress, who will get \nthe candidate's attention? The poor stiff with a wife and two children \nto feed, educate and clothe and who is trying to make a living? How \nmuch attention is he going to get compared to the guy who gave $4,000? \nNow, that is an illustration that is palpably clear to everybody.\n  Herman Talmadge, one of the great Senators who served here, had a lot \nof sayings in making speeches. He said, ``If you want your audience to \npay attention, you've got to throw the corn where the hogs can get to \nit.'' You have to say it so people can understand it. What I just said \nis understandable. It is essentially as much a one-line description of \nwhat this debate is about as anything I can conjure up.\n  The guy that gave $4,000 gets a lot of free speech, and a lot of the \nfree speech he gets goes right into the ear of the Senator or the \nCongressman that got the $4,000. And when the phone call comes into the \noffice from the poor guy making $10 an hour, with a wife and kids, \nbecause he wants a passport or because he knows a friend from Bolivia \nthat is being mistreated under the immigration laws, do you know where \nhis phone call goes if it is answered at all? It goes back to the \nstaff. Where does the call go from the guy who gave $4,000? You and I \nboth know where it goes. It goes directly into the office of the \nSenator. Do you call that free speech? Do you call that a democracy?\n  It is impossible to keep up with the campaign finance laws as they \nare written today. One of the things Al Gore is charged with is making \na phone call from his office to solicit money.\n  I am not going to say anymore about that because everybody here \nunderstands that. The President is under investigation now under a 90-\nday sort of determination by the Attorney General as to whether or not \nin 1996 his campaign coordinated some ads with the Democratic National \nCommittee.\n  Today my side is going to lose. The way we finance campaigns is going \nto continue exactly as it has been since the memory of mind runneth \nnot, and investigations of either Democrats, or Republicans, or both \nwill continue. It is impossible to level the laws of this country, and \nin this very hostile partisan environment.\n  Sometimes I think about offering a resolution in the Senate saying it \nis the sense of the Senate that there are some Democrats who have not \nyet been investigated and we want to know why.\n  We will continue to lose this debate until the American people wake \nup not only to the corruption of the financing laws of the country, but \nto the fact that their democracy is disappearing right under their \nnose.\n  It is so difficult at times to get people to focus on something that \nis a little bit complicated. They don't understand. Since it doesn't \nreally relate to them, they just do not want to be bothered.\n  Republicans--I will hand it to them. They are zealots. Rain or shine, \nthey go vote. My party--we have to ride in the sunshine. In all \nfairness, I have to say that we represent a lot of people who do not \nown automobiles. They oftentimes don't have ways to get to the polls, \nunless some of that campaign money is given to drivers to go out and \nget them and bring them in.\n  I saw a poll that showed that 71 percent of all Republicans say they \nare going to vote, and about 60 percent of the Democrats say they are \nnot going to vote. Unless that figure changes, I can tell you what this \nelection is going to do. I assume the President has to take some \nresponsibility for that. I just do not know. He is my friend, and that \nis a separate subject. We will deal with that later.\n  But even absent the Starr report, absent Monica Lewinsky, we had a \nplateful for the American people to ingest. Part of that plateful is \ncorruption, which is, in my opinion, as threatening to the Nation as \nthe Kenneth Starr report is.\n  I suspect this country is in a bit of a funk today. I haven't looked \nat the market yet. It started off down this morning. I think that is \nall the result of people being upset and depressed--and, is the country \nleaderless? How is this all going to come out? Is it going to take 5 or \n6 months to get this resolved? All of those things.\n  Tonight, when you listen to the news, that is all you will hear. \nTomorrow night, when you listen to the news, that is all you will hear.\n  And here is something that goes right to the heart of whether we \nsurvive as a democracy, or not. Frankly--I hate to condemn the public--\nthey are not paying attention. Every poll shows it. What is the most \nimportant thing to you? Campaign finance is about tenth on the list. \nDemocrats keep trying to make it a big issue, trying to get people to \npay attention to it, and in all fairness, seven or eight Republicans. \nBut how can you expect them to when they hear absolutely nothing on the \nevening news but Monica Lewinsky and Kenneth Starr's report. As I say, \nI am not condemning the American people. That is just the way we are \nmade. That salacious stuff is a lot more exciting than talking about \ncampaign finance reform, which is complex.\n  Mr. President, I have said all that I want to say, and all that I \nneed to say. But I especially wanted to put in the part about free \nspeech.\n  It is so tragic that everybody here knows who is getting the free \nspeech, and everybody knows whose voice is not heard because of the way \nwe finance campaigns. I say that we ought to go to public financing. \nThat way every person in this country who is a taxpayer would know that \nhis vote was as important as anybody else's. His voice would be as \nimportant as anybody else's. As long as it is the richest and the \nwealthiest people who determine the outcome of elections in this \ncountry, where do you think we are headed? I will leave that question \nwith you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to express my\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\nconcerns about the pending McCain-Feingold amendment.\n  Since the beginning of the 105th Congress, I have heard from \nMinnesotans on a variety of important issues such as high taxes and the \nfuture of social security. Despite the public outcry by my constituents \nto address these issues important to America's working families, I am \nvery concerned that the Senate is again debating a proposal to regulate \npolitical speech.\n  I commend Senators McCain and Feingold for their deeply held views \nthat the only way to restore the public's trust in their government is \nto reform the system for financing our federal campaigns. As someone \nwho has heard first-hand of the public's growing mistrust of their \ngovernment, I strongly agree with their belief that the people's trust \nin their government should be restored and their participation in our \ndemocracy encouraged.\n  However, I respectfully disagree with their approach to the passage \nof new campaign finance laws.\n  By the way, these new laws become even more restrictive on who can be \ninvolved, what they can say, and how they can be a participant in the \npublic policies of this country.\n  The people's faith in the Government can be restored, I believe, by \nencouraging greater enforcement of our existing campaign finance laws, \nrather than going out and trying to ignore the laws that were \nbroken, and passing new laws that again would only silence those \nAmericans who wish to have their voices heard.\n\n  Each time the Senate has considered a version of the McCain-Feingold \nproposal, Minnesotans have contacted me in large numbers not in support \nof its passage but out of great concern for its potential impact upon \ntheir first amendment right of free speech guaranteed by the U.S. \nConstitution. Moreover, they have demanded that Congress focus more on \nthe allegations of campaign finance irregularities during the 1996 \ncampaign cycle rather than passing new campaign finance laws. In other \nwords, not to brush over those laws that were broken or those who broke \nthose laws and try to camouflage this by saying all we have to do is \npass new campaign finance laws and everything will be fixed. That is \nlike trying to pass new laws every day to take care of old problems. We \nneed to get to the source of the problem.\n  In this regard, I am encouraged by Attorney General Reno's recent \ndecision to initiate a 90-day investigation of whether President \nClinton's involvement in Democratic National Committee campaign \nadvertisements in 1996 circumvented election laws. And the Attorney \nGeneral should also be commended for continuing the Justice \nDepartment's investigation of whether Vice President Gore unlawfully \nraised campaign contributions from the White House, and the activities \nof former White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, during the \n1996 campaign cycle.\n  Current law works if we enforce it. Despite the modifications that \nproponents of McCain-Feingold have made to improve support for this \ninitiative, my views on its basic premise have not changed. Similar to \nthe previous versions of this bill, this proposal will discourage \nrather than promote greater participation in the democratic process. \nThey always talk about big money and how that controls the process and \nhow we should be encouraging and what we should be doing to encourage \nmore people, those $10-an-hour workers who we have heard about in the \nChamber today, to become a voice no matter how small, and to \nparticipate in the political process. The way they can do that is \nthrough PACs, political action committees, and that is where a lot of \npeople with little incomes can put their money together to have a \nstronger voice in how their government works and how it operates, and \nwe should encourage that, not discourage it.\n  Most fundamentally, the McCain-Feingold proposal continues to be \nbased upon the belief that there is too much money spent on American \nelections--too much money. About $3.50 per person per year is spent on \ncampaigns, totally, in this country. That is less money than we spend \non a Value Meal at McDonald's.\n  I remember talking to somebody about the United Nations. We spend \nabout $3.81 per person per year supporting the United Nations, and \neverybody thinks we get a great deal out of that. But yet we spend less \nmoney per person to support our way of government in this country, and \nsomehow they say that is spending too much money. So the whole \npolitical process in this country is worth less to the supporters of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill than our support perhaps, say, for the United \nNations. I think we need to support this form of government and \nencourage more people to participate, not to close the door and say \nthat this is how you can participate or we are going to manage what you \nsay, how you say it, when you can say it, and who can afford to say it.\n  If we accept this assumption, then Congress has decided to assert \nquestionable authority to suppress the rights of Americans to become \ninvolved in the political process and suppress the rights of many \nAmericans to have their voices heard.\n  As my colleagues know, the belief that there is government \njustification for regulating the costs of political campaigns was \nrejected by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo. \nThe importance of conveying the ideas of those who seek office to the \nelectorate is critical and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in \nBuckley. And in Buckley the Court declared that ``a restriction on the \namount of money a person or groups can spend on political communication \nduring a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by \nrestricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \nexploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because \nvirtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society \nrequires the expenditure of money.''\n  That is from the Buckley v. Valeo Court decision. They label this \nbill as an effort to protect and preserve democracy. They say that \ndemocracy is disappearing because of this. But this bill would not \nprotect free speech. It would only limit free speech. I would like to \nask those watching today that if you can restrict the speech of one \nAmerican today, whose speech can you restrict tomorrow? Are you going \nto give the government this much control and say, well, let's do it \ntoday to protect this process, but in doing this we are going to have \nto take away some of your freedoms? We are going to have to impose \nrestrictions. We are going to manage those who want to participate in \nthe political process. And if we can do that today, who is going to \ncome tomorrow and say, well, let's squeeze these restrictions a little \nmore? And then who is going to come the next day and say, well, let's \nsqueeze these restrictions a little more? And pretty soon we are going \nto take the ability of free speech, to participate in our political \nprocess, away from Americans. And then who is going to have a voice? Is \nit going to be the media, the newspapers, television? Are they going to \nbe the ones that define my campaign or Senator McCain's campaign or \nmaybe Senator Feingold's campaign? I think we need to have that \nfreedom.\n  For these reasons, I remain concerned about the core provision of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill which continues to place, again, questionable new \nrestrictions upon the ability of national parties to support State and \nlocal party activities as well. We should not pursue a suspect \nexpansion of government control of national parties; rather, recognize \nthat political parties enjoy the same rights as individuals to \nparticipate in the democratic process.\n  For nearly two decades, political parties have been allowed to raise \nmoney for party building and similar activities without limits on the \nsize of contributions. Additionally, the Supreme Court decision in \nColorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, in which the \nCourt found that Congress may not limit independent expenditures by \npolitical parties, makes it questionable whether these restrictions \nwould be constitutional.\n  We have a responsibility to the American people to help restore their \nfaith in government. However, this cannot be accomplished by placing \nnew and expansive restrictions on the communication of ideas or the \nissue of free speech. And above all else, we should not use violations \nof existing laws that have raised a lot of this concern and ire of \nAmericans over campaign financing--those violations of existing laws \nshould not be used as an argument today to suppress our right of free \nspeech.\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, no one has been more active in the \nvineyards of the first amendment than the Senator from Minnesota. I \nthank him for his important contribution to this debate and his astute \nobservation that to the extent the parties and groups are quieted, the \nvoices are enhanced on the other side, or that is anybody's voice that \nis not quieted is necessarily enhanced by that action, and in \nparticular the fourth estate, our friends in the press, who love this \nissue, would have a dramatic increase in political clout as a result of \nthe quieting of the voices of so many other Americans.\n  So I thank my friend from Minnesota for his observations.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the fundamental notion underlying the \nMcCain-Feingold bill is that politicians should be allowed to control \nall of the political speech in proximity to an election except for that \nby the press. The press would be free and unfettered in engaging in \nissue advocacy, in endorsing candidates, and doing anything it wanted \nto under the first amendment at any time, up to and including the last \n60 days before an election. I do not dispute that. I think they should \nhave that right. But I find it disingenuous at best--absurd, the more \nyou think about it--that the press would like to quiet the voices of \nothers.\n  First, they would like to quiet the voices of the parties by \neliminating so-called soft money. Mr. President, ``soft money'' is a \npejorative term for non-Federal money. This is a Federal system. There \nare State elections, there are local elections; the two great national \nparties frequently care who gets elected Governor of Arizona or who \ngets elected to the city council in Phoenix. The notion that the \nFederal Government should federalize the two great national parties is \nabsurd, inappropriate, and unwise.\n  In addition to that, it would provide for the Federal Election \nCommission the power to supervise every election in America. In other \nwords, we would federalize the entire American political system. This \nkind of notion of Federal power grabs and the quieting of voices also \napplies to what the McCain-Feingold bill seeks to do to individuals and \ngroups.\n  Under this bill, it would be very difficult if not impossible for \nindividuals to express themselves, or groups to express themselves, \nwithin 60 days of an election. ``Quiet those voices, too,'' the \npoliticians say. So we will quiet the parties by making it impossible \nfor them to involve themselves in State and local elections, and make \nit impossible for them to engage in issue advocacy, constitutionally \nprotected speech, and we will also reach over to the issue advocacy of \neverybody else and we will make it impossible for them to criticize any \nof us within 60 days of an election.\n  This is a great idea for incumbents. We all would like to control our \nelections, and this would sure give us a way to do it. We would not \nhave to worry any longer about those nasty interest groups that don't \nlike our voting records going out there in the last 2 months before an \nelection and saying bad things about us; we would shut them up. We \nwouldn't have our political party coming in to defend us or, for that \nmatter, the other political party coming in to attack us; we would shut \nthem up.\n  In short, we would just sort of hermetically seal the environment for \n60 days before an election, with the exception of the New York Times, \nthe Washington Post, USA Today, and all the other folks who would still \nbe free--as they should be free--under the first amendment to have \ntheir say at any point in the course of a year, including the last 60 \ndays before an election.\n  Mr. President, this is terrible public policy--terrible public \npolicy--disguised as some kind of positive reform. The good news is, we \nare not going to pass this bill, but if we had passed it, the issue \nadvocacy restrictions on outside groups would certainly not survive the \nfirst Federal district court in which it landed, and I guarantee you, \nit would land there very, very quickly. When something is so clearly \nand obviously unconstitutional, it seems to me that the Senate ought \nnot to pass it.\n  With regard to the political parties, why in the world, Mr. \nPresident, should we prevent the political parties from engaging in \nissue advocacy? Everybody else in America will be able to do it, \nbecause I guarantee you, the restrictions on independent groups in this \nbill would be struck down. There is not a serious constitutional lawyer \nin the country who doubts that.\n  Everybody would be free to have their say in the last 60 days before \nan election: Outside groups, because the restrictions on them would \ncertainly fall as unconstitutional; the newspapers, because no one \nreally wants to shut them up. We don't frequently like what they have \nto say, but they have a right to say it. But the political parties are \nconceivably taken off the playing field--the one entity in American \npolitics that, for example, is willing to support challengers, those \ntrying to come from nowhere to get elected. It is not easy to be a \nchallenger. The one entity out there willing to support challengers is \nthe political parties. We ought not to be making them weaker, we ought \nto be encouraging them to be strengthened.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes, 50 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Sometimes the wrong debate happens at the wrong time, and the debate \nthat we have heard on this floor for the last several days, in my \nopinion, is the wrong debate for a lot of reasons. We shouldn't be \ntalking about changing laws, but enforcing the very laws we have.\n  I think all of us watched as the Congress decided to change campaign \nlaws a good number of years ago to make them much tougher and tighter, \nto create reporting thresholds, and to make sure that the public was \nwell aware what went on in the campaign business of our country and in \nthe fundraising business of our country.\n  Several of our colleagues have already spoken today about the ongoing \ninvestigations into campaign finance abuses. Those abuses didn't happen \nbecause the laws were inadequate. It doesn't mean that you are going to \nget character change all of a sudden because of a myriad of new laws \nthat this Congress might pass.\n  Now the spin machines are using the issue of campaign finance reform \nto suggest that the entire system is crooked and corrupt. Mr. \nPresident, and American citizens, that just ``ain't'' so. There are \nsome people in the system who have chosen to corrupt it, but the \ncampaign system we have today is alive and well, as it should be. Most \nof us play by the rules, and the rules are tough, and they are \nexacting. The reason they ought to be is to assure the right of all \npolitical candidates to speak out and to make sure that the American \npublic can have, as they should have, the proper access to the \npolitical process.\n  The votes that are going to occur on this floor in the next few \nmoments are absolutely critical. I am frustrated by many of my \ncolleagues who stand up and suggest that the political system that we \nhave today is a corrupt system. It has been corrupted by some, and \nthose who are corrupting it are under investigation today. But clearly \nit is a system that works--it works very well--reporting to the public, \nas we should, what is the right and responsible thing to do, \nparticularly at a time in our history when confidence has been shaken \nin some of our institutions.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we do not put new restrictions into \nthe ability of the politician, the public person, to communicate with \nhis or her\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\nconstituents in an open and frank manner. Existing law allows that. I \ndon't think we need to be tampering with our first amendment or \nsuggesting in some way that we can make it a lot better. We just simply \nneed those few who corrupt the system to abide by the laws as they are \ncurrently written and currently administered.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho for his contribution to this debate and the other Senators who \nspoke on our behalf during this discussion. This is a very important \nissue affecting the first amendment and the rights of all Americans to \nspeak in the political process. I am confident that the motion to \ninvoke cloture will not succeed.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin controls the time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nArizona requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, let me begin by thanking all those \nwho have fought so very hard to pass campaign finance reform, both \nwithin this body and without. I specifically mention by name the \nmeasure's cosponsors: Senator Thompson, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, \nSenator Levin, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Jeffords. All have \nexpended great energy to keep this issue before the Senate.\n  Also, I again thank my colleagues in the House, Congressman Shays and \nCongressman Meehan. We would not be doing what we are doing today if it \nhad not been for their signal and unpredicted victory.\n  Most importantly, I thank my partner on this 4-year journey, the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Russ Feingold. His work on this issue has been \noutdone by none. His efforts are tireless, and he deserves great praise \nfor bringing us to this point today. Together we have worked to do the \nbidding of the majority of the American people. We worked to pass \nlegislation that is supported by majorities in both Houses, although a \nminority has continued to thwart our efforts. But time is on our side.\n  Yesterday and today, I have quoted previous debates on this subject. \nOne fact that is clear in every one of these debates is that, with \npersistence, we will prevail. I hope we prevail today. If we do not, I \nwill be back to offer campaign finance reform legislation again and \nagain and again. Neither I nor the Senator from Wisconsin will relent. \nThe will of the American people, their desire to see what they perceive \nas a corrupt election system cleaned up, cannot be perpetually ignored. \nThe public wants us to act.\n  Low voter turnout--and we will perhaps see the lowest voter turnout \nthis century, this November--is ample proof of the growing cynicism of \nthe electorate. That cynicism, if left unchecked, will grow to contempt \nand shake the foundations of this great Nation. Let us not \nprocrastinate further. Let us confound public cynicism and accede to \nthe country's wishes today.\n  The Senate was conceived by our Founding Fathers as an institution \nthat acts deliberatively. Certainly we have seen this occur on this \nmatter. But it was not conceived to block indefinitely the will of the \npeople. Many significant matters have been slowed or stalled in this \nbody. Many have taken years to pass. Campaign finance is undoubtedly \none of those subjects. But to repeat myself yet again, this body will \nact and pass campaign finance reform. If not today, then soon. It will \nhappen. Delay is not resolution, merely postponement of the inevitable \nand thus pointless.\n\n  Until we recognize the futility of procrastination, the money chase \nin this hallowed Capitol, the debasement of the White House, the \nselling of trade missions, the never-ending series of fundraising \nscandals that leads the public more and more to believe that elected \nofficials only represent monied special interests will not end.\n  Congress can and must and will change this system. If we do not act, \nthere will be more scandals, both parties will be further tainted by \nthis system, no one will be left unscathed, and that fact will force \nthis body to do what is right.\n  When do we as a body come to realize that something must be done? And \nto my Republican colleagues: When will we realize it was our ideas, not \nour fundraising prowess, that got us to power? The American public \ngranted us the majorities in both Houses because, I would argue, our \nideas were superior to those of the opposition. Our ideas represented \nwhat a majority of Americans felt and believed. We do not need to fear \na new campaign finance regime so long as we continue to best represent \nthe public interests. And because I so strongly believe that fact, I \nappeal to my Republican colleagues to support cloture and allow us to \nmove forward on this matter.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me close by again putting my colleagues \non notice. If we cannot move forward today, we will soon. To those who \nwill proclaim the issue dead, nothing--I repeat, nothing--is further \nfrom the truth. As long as I am privileged to serve in this great \ninstitution, we will revisit campaign finance reform again and again. \nWe will revisit the subject until it becomes the law of the land. We \nwill revisit it because the will of the majority over time always \nprevails. And we will revisit it because it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me take this opportunity to thank all of the cosponsors and all \nthe supporters of this bill, especially the senior Senator from Arizona \nwho came here with the idea for this legislation I guess it is now 4 \nyears ago.\n  I thank everyone for their efforts in the past but, more importantly, \nfor their continued efforts in the future, including this year, on \ntrying to finish the job. So I have a feeling of gratitude, not only \nfor what we have done but for what we will accomplish before we are \ndone.\n  Let me take the very brief time I have just to refer to a statement \nby the Senator from Idaho which I think really sums up this whole \nissue. He just got done saying on the floor that the current campaign \nsystem is ``a system that works very well.'' He said, ``The campaign \nfinance system is alive and well, as it should be.'' That is what the \nSenator from Idaho said.\n  Well, if you agree with that statement, I guess you will want to vote \nagainst cloture. But that is not what the American people believe. They \nthink this system is broken. And it is not just a few people who are \ncorrupting the system, it is the system that is corrupt, and we have to \ndo something about it now.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. The time \nhas come for the additional eight Senators to allow the majority of \nboth Houses of the Congress to send this bill on to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining. Does he \nwish to yield the time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I reserve the time.\n  I yield the remaining time I have to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the struggle for life for campaign finance \nreform is going to be determined by a test of wills between the \nbipartisan majority that believes in it, reflecting the will of the \nAmerican people, and the minority that will attempt to filibuster this \nbill to death.\n  The supporters of campaign finance reform need not withdraw, should \nnot withdraw, and I believe and hope will not withdraw the bill if the \nfilibuster survives this cloture vote. It will then be up to the \nfilibusterers to continue the filibuster. Hopefully, over time they \nwill see that the American people are determined to change a system \nwhich is not only corrupt but has a corruption which permeates and \nundermines public confidence in our democratic electoral process.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\nthe pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provision of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     campaign finance reform amendment:\n         Trent Lott, Connie Mack, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Thad \n           Cochran, Wayne Allard, Rod Grams, Larry E.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor Hispanic Americans.\n  National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated every year from \nSeptember 15 to October 15.\n  This month-long observation, established in 1968, is now a \ncelebration of the history and achievements of Hispanic Americans.\n  During the August recess, among the many visits I made throughout my \nstate, I had the opportunity to once again visit the historic city of \nSt. Augustine.\n  A visit to St. Augustine is always very special but this time it was \nmore so because accompanying me on this trip were my triplet \ngranddaughters. I took advantage of this occasion to teach my \ngranddaughters about the rich and wonderful history of St. Augustine, \nof Florida and of our Nation. And they taught me something about the \nthrill of seeing castles and historic sites for the first time through \nthe fresh eyes of a 3-year old.\n\n  Hispanic presence in what is now the United States began long before \nour Nation existed.\n  In 1513, Juan Ponce de Leon sailed from Puerto Rico to the east coast \nof Florida.\n  A Spanish explorer, Ponce de Leon is best remembered as the \ndiscoverer of Florida and for his early attempts to colonize in 1521.\n  He was also the first Governor of Puerto Rico which today is home to \n3.8 million U.S. citizens.\n  In 1565, Pedro Menendez de Aviles, another Spanish explorer, \nestablished St. Augustine, the first permanent European settlement in \nwhat is now the United States. This settlement predated the Jamestown \ncolony in Virginia by more than 40 years.\n  When he reached the shores of La Florida, Menendez de Aviles and his \ncrew celebrated with a feast with the Native American Indians of the \nregion, by bringing red wine, roast pig and garbanzo beans. Thus began \nanother part of our rich Hispanic heritage.\n  Nearly 300 years later, the United States was rapidly developing and \nexperiencing its first 50 years of democracy. Hispanic Americans played \ntheir role in that development.\n  The first Hispanic American to serve in the Congress was Joseph \nMarion Hernandez, who was elected in 1822 as a Delegate to the U.S. \nCongress from the territory of Florida. Today there are 5,170 Hispanic \nelected officials nationwide, 81 of them proudly serving in my State of \nFlorida.\n  Of the 18 Hispanic Members of the 105th Congress, two are from \nFlorida, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who in 1989 became the \nfirst Hispanic woman Member of Congress and her fellow Cuban-American \nCongressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart.\n  Today Florida is an example of the rich diversity of this country, as \nwe have residents from all the Spanish speaking countries of the world.\n  Sadly, many of these residents came to this country from countries \nsuch as Cuba and Nicaragua seeking refuge from persecution and denial \nof basic human rights which they were denied in their homeland.\n  These residents hold a strong patriotic fervor for their new land in \nthe United States equally with their hopes of restoring liberty and \ndemocracy to their former home in Cuba. They will return to a \ndemocratic Cuba with their experience in the United States being a \nsignificant contribution, whether they are there on a permanent or a \ntemporary basis, to the restoration of that island nation, which has \nsuffered so long under autocratic rule.\n  The latest Census Bureau figures now estimate that the U.S. Hispanic \npopulation nears 30 million, representing 11 percent of the total \npopulation of the United States.\n  The Bureau also estimates that by the year 2005 Hispanics will be the \nsingle largest minority group in this country.\n  Hispanic Americans have achieved notable success in every aspect of \nour society.\n  It is important to highlight the level of entrepreneurial spirit that \nHispanic Americans bring to the work force, leading to economic growth \nfor all Americans. According to the Small Business Administration, the \nlargest growing sector of small businesses are owned by Hispanic women.\n  Hispanic owned businesses have grown three times faster than the \naverage of all business growth in the United States.\n  Hispanic Americans have played, and will continue to play, a key role \nin our country's future.\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\n  The commitment of Hispanic Americans to this country's ideal of \nfreedom and democracy have never faltered.\n  Hispanic Americans have volunteered and served this country with \ndistinction in every branch of our nation's armed services and their \nsacrifices on the field of combat are ample evidence of their patriotic \ncommitment.\n  The fact that there are forty-two Hispanic Congressional Medal of \nHonor winners is a most eloquent testimony of this commitment to \nfreedom and democracy.\n  In March 1997 Senator Larry Craig and I, along with a bi-partisan \ncolaition of our colleagues introduced S. 472 to provide the nearly 4 \nmillion U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico with a congressionally sanctioned \nplebescite to democratically vote on their future political status.\n  On more than one occasion I have spoken of our moral commitment to \nanswer the legitimate request for self-determination by our fellow \ncitizens who are residents of Puerto Rico.\n  On July 25 of this year, Puerto Rico commemorated the 100th \nanniversary of the arrival of U.S. Major General Nelson Miles and his \ntroops on Puerto Rico's shores. On that historic occasion 100 years \nago, General Miles declared that the United States came, to use his \nwords, ``bearing the banner of freedom * * * the fostering arm of a \nnation of free people, whose greatest power is in justice and humanity \nto all those living within its fold.''\n  One hundred years after those valiant actions and eloquent words, the \nU.S. citizens of Puerto Rico continue to wait for the fulfillment of \nthat promise of justice and humanity. For the last century, they have \nbeen denied the most fundamental right of a free people, the right to \nchoose their own political destiny.\n  One of the most fundamental principles of our nationhood was \nexpressed in the Declaration of Independence when our forefathers \nwrote:\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these \n     Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is what our Founding Fathers wrote over 200 \nyears ago. Now the challenge we face in 1998 is whether we are prepared \nto live by those principles of consent of the governed.\n  Today I am here to ask, what better way to honor all Hispanic \nAmericans, to commemorate their sacrifices and contributions to our \ngreat Nation, than to provide the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico with \ntheir long frustrated dream of political self-determination?\n  Earlier this year, our colleagues in the House passed a bill \nauthorizing a plebiscite, a plebiscite to initiate self-determination. \nThe Senate has closely examined this issue through a series of hearings \nand workshops conducted by Energy Committee Chairman Murkowski. After \ncareful and exhaustive deliberations, Senator Murkowski has drafted a \nbill which simply authorizes a self-determination process for Puerto \nRico. Senator Murkowski's bill is straightforward; it is fair; it \nrecognizes and respects Puerto Rico's local political dynamics and \ndelivers the much-needed congressional endorsement of this process.\n  We have before us a rare opportunity, an opportunity to support \ndemocracy in action. Senator Murkowski's bill should be given full \nconsideration before the adjournment of this Congress. This is an issue \nthat will not go away. The historic significance of the U.S. Congress \nacting to give the people of Puerto Rico the reality of what General \nMiles spoke in his eloquent words of justice and humanity 100 years ago \nis an opportunity that we should not let pass. It is our historic \nopportunity and responsibility to our fellow citizens to honor \nHispanic-Americans by providing self-determination to the U.S. citizens \nof Puerto Rico. Let us make 1998 memorable not because it is the 100th \nanniversary of U.S. troops landing in Puerto Rico but, rather, because \nthis is the year and this is the Congress which commemorated Hispanic \nHeritage Month and honored all Hispanic-Americans by keeping its \npromise of democracy to the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na series of newspaper editorials in support of self-determination for \nthe U.S. citizens who are residents of Puerto Rico.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          It's Undemocratic To Deny American Citizens a Voice\n\n       One hundred years ago, during the Spanish-American war, the \n     U.S. troops who took over the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico \n     were enthusiastically greeted by most of the islanders. After \n     all, the United States of America represented liberty and \n     democracy to the world; the future of Puerto Rico looked \n     bright, indeed.\n       A century later, Puerto Rico are American citizens, but \n     they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections or to \n     elect voting representatives to Congress.\n       Puerto Ricans have fought and died under the American flag \n     in every war since 1917 and are eligible for the military \n     draft, yet they have no voice in selecting the president or \n     the Congress that could send them to war.\n       Under a government of the people, by the people and for the \n     people, it seems unfitting that the United States has never \n     formally consulted the 3.8 million American citizens of \n     Puerto Rico on their future. Oh, a few elections have been \n     held within the commonwealth, but the voting process, the \n     wording of the ballots and the results have never been \n     recognized by Congress.\n       For years, Puerto Rico has requested that Congress at least \n     sanction a vote to officially gauge the opinion of the \n     people: Do they wish to remain a commonwealth, become a \n     state, or achieve separate sovereignty? For years Congress \n     has given no answer.\n       This year, such legislation has been approved in the House \n     of Representatives, and its life or death resides in the \n     Senate, specifically in the hands of Senate Majority Leader \n     Trent Lott.\n       If the majority of Puerto Ricans wish to continue their \n     island's status as a commonwealth, with limited rights and \n     limited responsibilities, so be it.\n       But, if a majority selects statehood as a goal--after \n     weighing the positives against the negatives of federal \n     income taxes and stiffer industrial regulation and taxation--\n     then Congress should also weigh the positives and negatives \n     and make a decision. Only Congress can decide; a territory \n     cannot make itself a state.\n       Under the bill, if most Puerto Ricans favor statehood, a \n     lengthy period of negotiations--spanning a period of up to 10 \n     years--on possible statehood would begin. Only after all \n     terms are agreed upon could Congress even consider \n     legislation to admit Puerto Rico as a state.\n       Lott has shown little interest in bringing the bill to the \n     Senate floor. He seems to think that Americans have little \n     interest in it. But 3.8 million American citizens are vitally \n     interested. After 100 years, they deserve to have their \n     voices heard.\n\n\n                  Literacy Unlocks the World of Words\n\n       Tucked inside The Sun Herald today is a Newspaper in \n     Education publication celebrating International Literacy Day. \n     To that end, the special section contains tips for teachers \n     and parents.\n       Among the tips for teachers, we would like to stress the \n     second one: Teach children where they can find readily \n     available reading materials. That goes hand-in-hand with the \n     second tip for parents: Get a library card and use it with \n     your child.\n       For a child to think that reading is worth the effort--and \n     in the beginning, reading can be an effort--that child should \n     have something he or she thinks is worth reading. Since \n     preferences will vary from child to child, a library is the \n     best place to take a child to unlock the world of words.\n       When a child picks out what he or she wants to read, the \n     odds are considerably greater that it will get read.\n       Certainly a parent can and should build on a child's \n     selections by reading to the child. But if a child isn't \n     curling up with a book, it may be because he or she doesn't \n     have a book of his or her own choosing.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, Sept. 7, 1998]\n\n            Puerto Rico Should Be Allowed Self-Determination\n\n       Proposals to allow Puerto Rico to pursue statehood may not \n     be a high priority with most Americans, but it should be.\n       There is no more American an issue than that of allowing a \n     group of American citizens--yes, Puerto Ricans are U.S. \n     citizens--the right of self-determination to pursue statehood \n     or whatever they may wish.\n       Bills soon will be before Congress to do just that. The \n     bills are ``process'' bills, not statehood bills. The bills \n     would provide a process to ask Puerto Rican voters their \n     preferences. They could choose to be a commonwealth, a \n     process that would lead to statehood or independence.\n       If statehood is selected, there would be lengthy period of \n     negotiations, up to 10 years, when terms and conditions would \n     be decided.\n       There are many reasons why it would be good for Puerto Rico \n     to enter the union. As for economics, Puerto Rico's economy \n     is about $42 billion, slightly ahead of New Mexico. The U.S. \n     spends some $10 billion a year in economic subsidies there. \n     That would be reduced some $3 billion. But the potential \n     growth is there, too.\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\n       If admitted, there would be no reason for other states to \n     lose representation. Seats in Congress could be expanded.\n       But the reasons transcend economies and politics.\n       Puerto Ricans have fought in every U.S. war this century, \n     and have died in greater percentage according to population. \n     The ``blood tax'' has been paid.\n       As many as 80 percent participate in elections there \n     (compare that to American's lazy attitude about their ballot \n     rights), but cannot vote for the commander and chief who may \n     send their sons and daughters to war.\n       Americans should cheer at the prospect of a new state \n     because it reminds everyone of the importance of the American \n     ideals of freedom and self-determination.\n       Puerto Rico has earned that precious right.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 9, 1998]\n\n                        A Choice for Puerto Rico\n\n       In a historic move, the House narrowly passed a bill last \n     week to give 3.8 million Puerto Ricans the right to vote on \n     whether the island should retain its current commonwealth \n     status, seek statehood or become independent. The United \n     States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, sponsored by \n     Representative Don Young of Alaska, requires that a vote be \n     held on the three options by the end of this year. If either \n     statehood or independence receives a majority, the President \n     and Congress would be asked to develop a transition plan, and \n     give final approval to a status change within 10 years. If \n     none of the options receive a majority vote, the current \n     status would be unchanged and another referendum would be \n     held within 10 years.\n       Both the Republican and Democratic platforms have long \n     supported Puerto Rican self-determination. Yet Congress has \n     repeatedly failed to give islanders a say on their political \n     status. With House passage of the bill, its future now \n     depends on Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who has \n     been unenthusiastic about the issue. The Senate would \n     dishonor democratic values by shelving this bill.\n       Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States 100 years ago \n     as part of the spoils from the Spanish-American War. Its \n     residents are American citizens who have been subject to the \n     draft and Federal laws. But they do not pay Federal income \n     taxes, do not elect members of Congress and cannot vote for \n     President. This diminished status does have support among \n     islanders who worry that statehood would jeopardize the \n     island's distinctive heritage.\n       But language issues and other important questions can be \n     addressed when Puerto Ricans debate their choices. The \n     proposed bill would allow them to decide their future with \n     the assurance that Congress would not ignore the result. In a \n     1993 nonbinding plebiscite, 48 percent of Puerto Ricans voted \n     for commonwealth status, 46 percent for statehood and 4 \n     percent for independence. A majority may still prefer \n     commonwealth status, and even if islanders vote for statehood \n     or independence, Congress would be able to manage the \n     transition. In any case, the Senate would be wrong to prevent \n     political self-determination for American citizens when it \n     supports that right for people elsewhere in the world.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 1998]\n\n                     Americans Without Full Rights\n\n       Congress is getting serious about Puerto Rico's political \n     future for the first time since the United States picked up \n     the island territory in an imperial war with Spain 100 years \n     ago. By a carefully launched bill that may reach the floor \n     early in March, the House would set up a process to let \n     Puerto Ricans choose their future status from among the \n     current ``commonwealth'' statehood and independence options. \n     This would not be no straw poll. The bill would define the \n     details--financial, political, linguistic--of the statehood \n     option favored in Puerto Rico. It would lock the United \n     States into a 10-year transition to put statehood, or another \n     choice, into effect.\n       The bill, sponsored by House Resources Chairman Don Young \n     (R-Alaska), cleared his committee 44 to 1. He anticipates \n     serious debate and substantial approval. It could be a great \n     day for democracy. But it also could be a difficult day. \n     There is concern over the polticial lineup of the two \n     senators and six congressmen who would go to a new state and \n     over which states would have to forfeit six seats in the \n     House. There is argument over whether new tax revenues would, \n     as sponsors claim, wash out new social-program costs.\n       But the hot issue is language. There is support among \n     Puerto Ricans to retain their Spanish-language heritage. Some \n     in Congress, however, would make Puerto Rico the battleground \n     for an attempt to legislate English as the official language \n     of the United States. The Young bill undertakes to deal with \n     this question chiefly by providing for use of English in the \n     courts and other official venues, while increasing and \n     improving English-language training in the schools. This \n     seems sensible. A strict official-English policy ignores that \n     Washington never asked Puerto Rico to embrace English when it \n     took over the island and when it sent its sons to fight in \n     American wars. Such a policy also ignores the extent to which \n     the United States by practice and culture is already a \n     considerably bilingual nation. Alarms of creating an \n     ``American Quebec'' are a spillover from the official English \n     debate.\n       Puerto Ricans always could get the language of their \n     preference by independence. But that option has never risen \n     above a few percentage points. This makes Congress's \n     definition of statehood crucial. To put statehood on the \n     three successive referendums the bill calls for but then to \n     burden the option with a provocative English requirement is \n     unfair. It thrusts upon the island's 3.8 million residents a \n     choice between political empowerment and cultural identity. \n     For decades American political leaders have held out Puerto \n     Rican statehood as an option. It would be a mockery to load \n     it up with unneeded political accessories the first time it \n     began to look real.\n       A commitment to common rights, responsibilities and \n     ideals--not a dominant language--bonds Americans. A \n     commitment to democracy should drive Americans to ensure \n     Puerto Ricans full and equal rights as American citizens. It \n     has been, after all, 100 years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Orlando Sentinel, July 19, 1998]\n\n   Clarify Puerto Rico's Status; Citizens of The Island Deserve The \n     Opportunity to Make a Choice, Whether They Decide To Remain a \n         Commonwealth, Embrace Statehood Or Seek Independence.\n\n       U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says there's not \n     enough time to consider the issue of Puerto Rico's status \n     before senators head home in October.\n       That's not persuasive. After all, the U.S. House of \n     Representatives managed to do that in a matter of days, \n     approving it in March.\n       But even more important would be the symbolism of giving \n     Puerto Ricans a voice in determining their own form of \n     government. One hundred years ago this month, the United \n     States occupied that island during the Spanish-American War.\n       Puerto Rico now holds U.S. commonwealth status, which \n     allows it self-government but with obligations to the United \n     States. That means, for instance, that Puerto Ricans pay \n     taxes to their government but not to the U.S. Treasury. At \n     the same time, they hold U.S. citizenship.\n       It's time that Puerto Rico's status is clarified \n     definitively, whether the choice is to remain a commonwealth, \n     embrace statehood or seek independence.\n       Thus the Clinton administration was right last week to push \n     for swift action in the Senate.\n       Self-determination stands as one of this nation's most \n     important ideals, stemming from the America people's struggle \n     to chart their own political course more than 200 years ago.\n       Puerto Ricans also deserve that right.\n       A plebiscite in Puerto Rico five years ago merely whetted \n     the appetite of people for a substantive vote. The \n     plebiscite--a glorfied opinion poll--underscored the \n     intensity of the debate over Puerto Rico's future. Voters \n     mostly sided with two options--commonwealth and statehood--\n     with commonwealth receiving slightly more support.\n       The House bill would allow an official plebiscite, \n     presenting Puerto Ricans with the three choices mentioned \n     above.\n       If the option of commonwealth were chose, of course, it \n     would be automatic because it would mean keeping things as \n     theya re now.\n       Much more work would be required if voters were to choose \n     independence or statehood. Statehood would be the most \n     complicated, with the United States having the final say.\n       The job of working out the details of transition plan would \n     fall to President Bill Clinton and the Congress. That plan \n     then would be presented to Puerto Rican voters. The series of \n     negotiations and votes could take years to unfold.\n       The process will take even longer, though, if the Senate \n     doesn't get off the dime. Florida Sen. Bob Graham, who \n     supports the plebiscite, argues that the votes are there, \n     that it's just a matter of getting the Senate to vote.\n       But that means overcoming a big obstacle--Mr. Lott. He \n     appears not terribly interested in Puerto Rico, which is \n     probably the real reason it is being crowded off the Senate's \n     agenda.\n       Mr. Lott should reconsider. His position, which places him \n     between Puerto Ricans and self-determination, creates ill \n     will and delays an overdue decision.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield such time as is to be utilized by \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend, the \nSenator from Florida, Senator Graham.\n  I, too, rise in observance of Hispanic Heritage Month, noting that \nthere could be no better way to note the importance of our Hispanic \nheritage and this month of observance than to deal with the reality of \nthe political status of Puerto Rico.\n  In 1841, President Harrison said, ``The only legitimate right to \ngovern is an express grant of power from the governed.''\n  Those words were deemed so important to our Republic, so basic to our \nsystem of government, they became a part of the architecture of the \nCapitol itself. The history of our country is about the expansion of \ndemocracy and\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\nthe enfranchisement of people. The very purpose for founding this \nNation was to ensure that our people would have control over their own \ndestiny and choose their own Government. Through the generations, this \nmaturation process has included the enfranchisement of women, African-\nAmericans, and eventually to all people over the age of 18.\n  The democratic process was probably never better exercised or no \nfirmer commitment made than when this Congress established an orderly \nprocedure to admit new States. That process committed to the people of \nour country that the process of enfranchisement and of self-government \nwas not simply for themselves but other people who share our ideals, \nculture, and our geography.\n  Ever since 1898, the end of the Spanish-American War, we have shared \na culture, a history, and a geography with the people of Puerto Rico. \nThe people of the island of Puerto Rico have been subject to our laws \nand regulations, but they have been unable to vote for the very \nlegislators who would govern them through their actions.\n  Puerto Rico is the unfinished business of American democracy. Having \nlong since enfranchised all of our population, having extended our \nsovereignty into the Pacific Ocean and the Northwest, all that remains \nis the people of these few islands including Puerto Rico, the first and \nmost important case that remains to be dealt with.\n  This is important not only to the 29 million Hispanic-Americans, it \nis important to all of our people, because it involves justice and \nfairness.\n  Earlier this year, Senators Craig and Graham introduced the Puerto \nRican Political Status Act. I was very proud to follow their leadership \nand be part of its drafting and its introduction. That legislation in \nsimilar form passed the House of Representatives in March. It would \nfully and clearly allow the people of Puerto Rico to follow the path of \nfull democracy if they so chose. Unfortunately, the legislation remains \nin the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. While we are all \ngrateful that the chairman has scheduled consideration of the \nlegislation, in truth it is very late in the life of the 105th \nCongress. Each day that passes, every week that goes by, we increase \nthe chance that the people of Puerto Rico will not have an expression \nfrom this Congress about the chance they may possess to enfranchise \nthemselves and be heard through a recognized plebiscite this year.\n  Regardless of individual opinion of Members of this body as to what \nthe judgment of the people of Puerto Rico might or should be, whether \nMembers of the Senate support statehood or commonwealth or \nindependence, the one thing I believe upon which we can all agree is \nthat we have a responsibility, consistent with our own ideas, our \nideals, our culture--a mandate of history to ensure that the people of \nPuerto Rico are heard.\n  What decision the people of Puerto Rico might make is their choice. \nWhether or not they have a choice is our obligation. There are 3.8 \nmillion people on Puerto Rico, with too long an association with our \ncountry to pretend this is not a historic problem. They are too many in \nnumber to conclude that it does not really matter. I urge the \nleadership of this Senate to ensure that this legislation dealing with \nthe political status of Puerto Rico and its opportunity for a \nplebiscite come before this Senate before it expires.\n  I urge the people of Puerto Rico to proceed with their plebiscite and \nmake a final and lasting judgment about their political status. The \nUnited States cannot allow itself to enter the 21st century in a great \nirony of history--that the product of the world's most important \ndemocratic revolution, the first people on the face of this Earth to \nrise up against colonialism and demand the right of the governed to \nexpress themselves, be a party to what is by any measure a \npostcolonialist political arrangement.\n  It is not simply that it is unfair to the people of Puerto Rico, it \nis wrong for the people of the United States. It is inconsistent with \nour history and it cannot endure.\n  I compliment Senator Craig and Senator Graham for their leadership, \nand say how grateful I am to be a part of this truly historic effort.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for yielding time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Torricelli. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me join my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Jersey in thanking our distinguished colleague from Florida, \nSenator Graham, for bringing this issue to the floor today for \ncomments. In addition, let me thank Senator Craig and Senator Graham \nfor their sponsorship of this bill. I wanted to add a few words, \nbecause this has been said so eloquently by these two Senators before \nme, but I would only add just a few thoughts.\n  We celebrate many things in America. We have many special days to \ncommemorate many special individuals and events. We have many months \nthat we set aside to celebrate all sorts of things that are important. \nThis particular 30-day period from September 15 to October 15 is \nimportant because it recognizes the Hispanic community and allows us to \ncelebrate together the great contributions that Hispanic-Americans have \nmade to our country as a group and as individuals. They have made \nvaluable contributions decade after decade and century after century, \nfrom explorers to pioneers to inventors to entrepreneurs to statesmen \nand stateswomen who have served our country so admirably. It would take \nme all day--all year--to stand up and enumerate all the many \ncontributions. But that is what this month is about, to take a moment \nto recognize the great strengths that the Hispanic community brings to \nAmerica. It's also to recognize that is in fact what makes our country \nso different, what makes it uniquely admirable, what makes it the \nstrongest country in the world. It is our diversity and our respect for \ndiversity that makes us so different.\n  In that light, we could give many emotional and moving speeches about \nthese individuals and communities. But I frankly think, as one Senator, \nthat actions speak louder than words.\n  One thing that we could do to take specific action that could express \nin no uncertain terms our acknowledgment of these contributions, our \ngratitude toward the Hispanic community, our acknowledgment that we all \nshare responsibilities, obligations and duties equally to make this \ncountry strong and also to equally enjoy the protections of our \nConstitution and what our flag represents than to let Puerto Rico \ndecide it's own political future. There would be no greater, or better, \nor more appropriate action than to pass the Craig-Graham bill for the \nstatus of Puerto Rico, to allow the people to make a choice between \neither commonwealth or statehood or independence; but, Mr. President, \nto allow them, when they make that choice, to know the details of what \neach of those choices will actually mean, to not be unclear.\n  So this is something we have to do together. The people of Puerto \nRico have to vote. But this Congress--and the House has already \nrecognized this by a vote of only one, but still a decisive victory, a \nvictory in the House--must recognize that only those efforts are not \nenough for the people of Puerto Rico, but we have to act to have a bill \nwith the definitions of commonwealth and statehood and independence, so \nthe consequences of their choices would be clear to them and to us and \nto all the people that we represent. That is why it is important for \nthis bill to pass, regardless of individual Members' feelings about \nwhat the outcome should be. Passing this bill would be the best action \nwe could take.\n  I know my constituents are well aware that the 4 million citizens in \nPuerto Rico do not enjoy the right to vote in Presidential elections, \nalthough they do share the obligation of military service and the \ndraft. They do not pay income tax, but they do pay other obligations. \nThe situation needs to be clarified. We can do that by passing this \nbill and giving them a chance to vote so their responsibilities and \nduties and protections can become more equal in their alignment.\n  Finally, I reiterate that this group of patriots from Puerto Rico \nhave fought and died for the United States in wars beginning, not just \na few years ago, but since the Revolutionary War. For Louisiana it is \nespecially significant, for our first Governor, Bernardo de Galvez,\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\nled soldiers that included men from Puerto Rico in an effort to thwart \nthe British in the territory of Florida, which extended from the State \nof my distinguished colleague, Senator Graham of Florida, all the way \nto what is now Louisiana and the territory and State which we know in \npresent day as Louisiana. So for our State there is a particular, \nemotional, long-standing attachment to this issue.\n  With all of what my colleagues have said--and I reiterate, we can \ngive all the great speeches we want, but actions speak louder than \nwords--in light of that, the truth of that, in the light of fairness \nand what is appropriate, I urge my colleagues to take this month to do \nsomething meaningful and real, something more than words, that could \nhave a lasting effect on millions of Puerto Ricans and Americans, and \nthe strength of our country.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \ncalling attention to the celebration of National Hispanic Heritage \nMonth.\n  The Hispanic community in my home state of Washington is the youngest \nand fastest growing of any ethnic minority group, yet its history is a \nlong one. indeed, Washington was a part of Mexico until 1819. The many \nSpanish place names that dot the landscape are only part of the legacy \nof the early Hispanic explorers and settlers. Early Hispanic pioneers \nhelped lay the economic infrastructure of the region, bringing \ncommodities such as wheat and apples and livestock.\n  Today Hispanic Americans continue to play a pivotal role in our \nstate's economy. The contributions of Mexican immigrants has been vital \nin the growth and continued success of our state's agricultural \nindustry. Hispanic-owned businesses range from the mom-and-pop small \nbusiness to large corporate concerns. Hispanic citizens, taking \nadvantage of their many ties to Mexico and other Latin American \nnations, have helped to expand trade, our state's economic lifeblood.\n  The contributions of Hispanic Americans are not limited to economic \nones. Hispanic Americans have risen to positions of leadership \nthroughout the state. They occupy elected offices at all levels of \ngovernment, including our state legislature and judiciary. Hispanic \ncommunity activists have led the fight for social equality. The \nHispanic community has also enhanced our state's cultural life. Spanish \nlanguage newspaper and radio, Latin American cuisine and Hispanic \ncustoms and ceremonies are an integral part of our state's landscape.\n  The Hispanic community has mobilized to meet the challenges facing \nit. Community-based organizations throughout the state are working to \ncreate educational and economic opportunities and meet the need for \nhousing, health and social services. Their efforts benefit not only the \nHispanic community but the state as a whole.\n  Washington State's Hispanic community is a dynamic and vibrant one. I \nsalute their many accomplishments and contributions. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in celebrating the diversity that makes our \ncountry so rich by commemorating National Hispanic Heritage Month.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Hispanic Heritage Month presents a unique \nopportunity to celebrate the history and achievements of nearly 30 \nmillion people of Hispanic descent living in the United States and \nPuerto Rico. Today, as we stand on the threshold of a new century, we \nlook to the outstanding contributions of Hispanic Americans for \ninspiration and leadership.\n  We should also acknowledge Puerto Rico's 100 years of Social, \nPolitical and Economic Union with the United States. I strongly support \nthe right of self-determination for U.S. citizens living in Puerto \nRico. Citizens in Puerto Rico should have the opportunity to decide \ntheir political future, and have a right to political, social and \neconomic equality.\n  America has always drawn strength from the extraordinary diversity of \nits people. Throughout our nation's history, immigrants from around the \nworld have been drawn to America's promise of hope, freedom, and \nopportunity. These newcomers have shared their cultural traditions and \nvalues, contributed to our nation's economy, strengthened our shared \nbelief in democracy and helped create a more fair and just society.\n  Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed the ``United \nStates-Puerto Rico Political Status Act,'' H.R. 856. The Senate \nversion, S. 472, provides a congressionally recognized framework for \nU.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico to freely decide statehood, \nindependence, or the continuance of the commonwealth under U.S. \njurisdiction.\n  Hispanic Heritage Month provides us with a unique opportunity to \nagain raise the debate of the Puerto Rico plebiscite. I cannot think of \na better time to push this issue forward.\n  That is why I am joining today as a cosponsor of S. 472. This year, \nthe Senate has an opportunity to grant the 3.8 million American \ncitizens of Puerto Rico an opportunity to decide their own future. Such \nan election would be the first step in allowing these U.S. citizens an \nopportunity to exercise one of the most fundamental principles of a \ndemocracy--a government chosen by the people.\n  In recognition of this historic opportunity, I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues will join with me as cosponsors of S. 472, and that the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources will mark up the bill \nquickly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  There are others of my colleagues who have indicated a desire to \nspeak during this period for morning business. Unfortunately, none of \nthem are here at this time. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremainder of the time for these presentations on ``Hispanic Heritage \nMonth'' be reserved until our colleagues who wish to speak are present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I say to my friend from Wisconsin, I am not going to make \nany motion at this time. I just want to assure my friend from Wisconsin \nand others that we will not give up on this fight. We will continue \nthis fight. But I also think it is important to point out that we got \n52 votes, which was the same as the last time. I intend to work with \nfriends on both sides of the aisle to try to get additional votes so we \ncan make progress on this issue. Since that is not the case, it is my \nunderstanding that the majority leader will move off of this bill \nprobably at this time.\n  I want to make sure that again we are not giving up this fight. We \nwill continue. And sooner or later I am convinced that we will have the \nopportunity to prevail.\n  Mr. President, I yield----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have not yielded the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his willingness to continue this important fight. I \nunderstand that we may well be moving now to another piece of \nlegislation, but I want to indicate that we will continue to move this \namendment, to try to adopt this amendment. As I understand it, it will \nbe the pending business on the Interior bill when it comes back, and we \nwill certainly proceed accordingly.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have not been involved in the debate over the last 2 \ndays, but I want to say that we have had this debate and we have had \nthis vote again because Senator McCain felt it was important that it be \nconsidered further, especially in view of the House vote. But we have \nhad that debate and we have had the vote, and the vote is the same. \nNothing has changed. There is no consensus.\n  I still maintain that before we start changing the laws we ought to \ntry to find out who broke the laws, how did they break the laws, why \ndid they break the laws. We now have not one, not two, but three 90-day \npreliminary investigations of whether or not to go forward with the \nindependent counsel on whether the President, the Vice President, and a \nDeputy Chief of Staff were involved in 1996 campaign violations.\n  It seems to me it would be wise to see what is going to happen there, \nfind out what happened. I still don't understand why, if people broke \nthe law, there are those who say, ``Oh, geez, what we need to do is \nchange the law.''\n  Do we have some areas where we are going to have to take a look at \nthe campaign laws as far as contributions, and where money can be \nraised, or how, what kind of money on Federal property? Yes, we are \ngoing to have to take a look at that, and I am going to work with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who really want to have something \ndone that is balanced and fair.\n  This is not the solution. This is not the time. Here we are 60 days \nbefore an election, 30 days before the end of the session. We are \ntrying to do the Interior appropriations bill. We spent 2 days on \ncampaign finance reform, and now we have threats that it is going to \ncontinue. I have been patient. I have tried to be cooperative. I \nappreciate the cooperation I have received. I do think now the time is \nright for us to move on to Interior, bankruptcy reform, and child \ncustody, very important issues that need to be addressed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before I make \na motion to withdraw my amendment, the Senator from Wisconsin be \nrecognized for 2 minutes and then I regain the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. For debate only.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD, Mr. President, I do understand that Senator McCain \nintends to withdraw the amendment momentarily which he has been \ncourteous enough to indicate to me. I just want to reiterate that we \nare going to continue with this effort, that the amendment will be \noffered again on this bill and, if necessary, other bills until the job \nis done.\n  The fact is we have not really had a real process in the last 2 days \nthat we would expect on a bill like this. We have had talk \nintermittently, but each time this has come up, in September, October \nof 1997, in February and March of this year, and on this occasion, we \nhave never been allowed the right to have the normal amending process \nthat allows a consensus to be achieved. That is what was allowed in the \nHouse, and that is what lead to the passing of the Shays-Meehan bill. \nUntil that kind of process, rather than the mere permission to speak, \nis granted, this is not the kind of process that we are entitled on an \nissue of this importance, so this will continue. It must continue. And \nour effort has bipartisan support of the majority of both Houses of the \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me just make a couple of comments before I withdraw \nmy amendment. As I said, we will not give up the fight. We need to have \nprogress. We need to pick up a couple of additional votes, and it is \nimportant we make every effort to do so.\n  There would at least have been a vote at noon today on this issue, \nbecause a tabling motion was in order by the Senator from Wisconsin. \nThe Senator from Wisconsin, for very legitimate reasons, chose not to \nhave that vote. So we could have had everybody on record at least on \nthe tabling motion.\n  I insisted the night before last that we have 2 full days of debate. \nI had rather harsh words exchanged between myself and the majority \nleader--which is very uncustomary for me to have, except on \napproximately a daily basis. But the fact is the majority leader agreed \nthat we would have 2 full days of debate. Then I came in today to find \nthat, for the convenience of a Senator or Senators on that side of the \naisle, we had to have a vote at 1:45. There were many on both sides who \nwanted to debate this particular amendment, but we had to curtail it. \nLast night there were Members on this side as well as the other side \nwho wanted to speak on this issue. Instead, the Senator from \nMassachusetts had to speak for 2 or 3 hours on minimum wage.\n  So, if we are really serious about this, I want to tell my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, then we ought to go ahead and debate it, \nand debate it fully. We reached the point before the vote at 1:45 that, \neven on this side, the seven Republicans who wanted to debate did not \nhave sufficient time to do so, because rather than go late into this \nevening as I had envisioned, for the convenience of Senators on that \nside of the aisle we had to curtail the debate and have a vote at 1:45 \ntoday.\n  So I think it is important to point out that I do not believe the \nissue was debated as fully as it should have been, even though it has \nbeen done several times in the past. I urge, again, my colleagues to \nrecognize there is one way we are going to get true, meaningful \ncampaign finance reform, and that is on a bipartisan basis. My opening \nstatement yesterday articulated three principles as to what brings \nabout meaningful campaign finance reform, and one is bipartisanship. So \nI am reluctant--I am reluctant, without progress on this issue, to \nengage in a debate which could divert the Senate from other important \nissues of the day.\n  I want to point out one other reality, much to the sadness of almost \neveryone I know. Tomorrow's newspapers will probably not highlight the \nfact that we failed again on campaign finance reform. They will \nhighlight the issue which has consumed all the oxygen throughout this \ntown, and that is the firestorm concerning the scandal that is \naffecting the Presidency of the United States and the institution of \nthe Presidency today.\n  So I hope we can move forward. I will never give up on this fight as \nlong as I am a Member of this body. And I hope that we can make \nprogress together. But let's do it in a meaningful way and\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\nin a bipartisan way so we can make genuine progress.\n  Finally, I thank all the people who worked so hard to get this back \nup before this body. I thank Senator Feingold. I thank all our friends \non the outside. I thank everybody who has worked so hard in this \neffort. And we will prevail over time. But we will prevail, I believe, \nin a bipartisan fashion and not in one that exacerbates emotions on the \nfloor of the Senate rather than working towards a common goal of \nbettering the electoral progress.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10181-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10183-S10190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to \nthe bankruptcy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1301) to amend title 11, United States Code, to \n     provide for consumer protection, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Grassley/Hatch) amendment No. 3559, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the subject of the \nbankruptcy bill. The managers of the legislation will be here \nmomentarily.\n  I should note that we did call this issue up last Thursday, I believe \nit was, but we had difficulty in getting to the substance because the \nSenator from Massachusetts did not want us to get to the substance. He \nhad an amendment he wanted to talk about.\n  But Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin did make some small \nstatements at the end of the day on Thursday. I thought it was \nappropriate that we go back to the bankruptcy bill and that they be \nable to come to the floor and lay out the outline of this legislation \nand begin to get Members' attention focused on the bankruptcy bill \nitself.\n  Before I go to my own discussion about the importance of this bill, I \nwant to report to the Senate that we did just have a bicameral majority \nleadership meeting, House and Senate leaders sitting down, talking \nabout the people's business. We met for an hour. And while there are \nmany in this city who are talking about the Starr report and how it is \nto be dealt with and how can it be done in a fair and bipartisan way, \nwe met for an hour and we talked only about those issues that we need \nto address in the Congress this year.\n  We talked about the appropriations bills, and it is important that we \nget them through the process. We have now had 11 appropriations bills \npass the House, 10 pass the Senate. We are trying desperately to get \nthe 11th appropriations bill to begin to move here in the Senate; that \nis the Interior appropriations bill. So we will only have left in the \nSenate after Interior, the D.C. appropriations bill, and the Labor, \nHHS, Education, and other agencies and departments' appropriations \nbills--only two. I have urged the appropriators on both sides of the \naisle, both sides of the Capitol, to work expeditiously. If we have \nissues that we just cannot agree on between the two bodies or between \nthe Congress and the White House, set them aside. The important thing \nis to get the job done.\n  We also then talked about the importance of preserving Social \nSecurity, but allowing the people to get some of their hard-earned \ntaxes back. Absolutely, before we leave this year, we should pass \nlegislation to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. We should allow for \nthe self-employed deduction. The American people don't really realize \nit, although I am sure they feel the pinch, the American people are \nbeing taxed now at the highest levels in years and years and years. \nThey need some relief. Some of the money that is coming up here now, \ngoing into the surplus, certainly should go back to the people.\n  The administration cannot come up here and say: We want all this \nextra spending for what we consider emergencies, and that will not \ncount against Social Security, but, by the way, if you allow for some \ntax cuts for the people who earned it in the first place, oh, by the \nway, you are taking that out of Social Security. That kind of argument, \nI don't believe, in this atmosphere, is going to sell this year.\n  But we talked about the fair way to do tax cuts. We talked about what \nwe might want to do next year in terms of more tax cuts, across-the-\nboard rate cuts next year, and how we can begin to make progress in \npreserving Social Security.\n  We also talked about the importance of keeping our commitment on the \nbalanced budget last year, sticking to the caps. Yes, there may be some \nreal emergencies we will have to address, but other than that, we need \nto stick to the caps we agreed to. We gave our word 1 year ago, and we \nought to stick to it.\n  Then we talked about other issues. Higher education--we have a \nconference committee meeting this week. Hopefully, they will complete \nagreement on the conference report on higher education this week--\ncertainly within the next few days--so that our children will have \naccess to the colleges--community colleges and universities all across \nthis country. We will get that done.\n  Mr. President, we talked about the importance of this bankruptcy \nreform. That brings me to this particular issue. This legislation is \nlong overdue. We have a system now in America which encourages people \nto take bankruptcy and get out of their debts. We have a system that \ndoes not take into consideration that small businessman or woman, that \nfurniture store that is run by the husband and the wife. They are \ntrying to make ends meet. They are selling furniture on credit, and \npeople who are supposedly buying that furniture are declaring \nbankruptcy or just walking away from what they owe and getting out of \ntheir debts. We need reform. This is bipartisan. It came out of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction by a wide margin.\n  I know Senator Durbin, Senator Daschle, Senator Grassley on this \nside, Senator Hatch--a number of Senators have worked on this \nlegislation. We need to get it done. We are this close to having it go \ndown because Senator Kennedy wants to offer the minimum wage increase \nto bankruptcy reform. It is not related to bankruptcy reform, but he \ninsists on it being added to this bill.\n  It is curious to me, why this bill? It could be to any other bill. \nOh, no; he wants this one. I suspect it is because he knows that this \nis a bill that the leadership on both sides would really like to have. \nBut he is willing to take down this very important legislation to be \nable to offer his minimum wage increase, even though we have had \nminimum wage increases the last 2 years in a row and I have had store \nowners, restaurant owners, self-employed individuals who have little \nsmall businesses who have come to me and said:\n\n       OK, we made it the last time, but we are at the limit. We \n     have had to let people go so we can make a living. We are \n     working more hours. But if we have to go through two more, or \n     three more, minimum wage increases, we are going to go out of \n     business. At a minimum, we are going to have to lay people \n     off.\n\n  But here is my attitude. If Senator Kennedy will be reasonable and \nwill agree to a time limit, he can offer his amendment and we will have \na vote. But then I think we ought to be able to go on to the bankruptcy \nbill itself and complete the work with a reasonable time limit and \namendments on that.\n  Some folks say you always want to limit amendments. If you limit a \nbill to 15 amendments, that is not what I would call a big limit. And I \nam not saying 15, but something reasonable so we can get bankruptcy \ndone, so we can come back to Interior appropriations, let the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin come back again, you know, have something to say, have \nanother vote on Interior appropriations involving campaign finance \nreform. But at what point are we going to say, ``OK, we played our \ngames''? You have had your votes. We have had our votes on campaign \nfinance reform. We have had votes on bankruptcy reform. We have had \nvotes on national missile defense. We have had all these other votes. \nBut at some point we have to say, ``OK, we have dealt with it, we made \nour point, and we are going to move on the people's business,'' whether \nit is the Interior appropriations bill or the next appropriations bill. \nI understand the plan on the D.C. appropriations bill is to offer a \nwhole series of nonrelevant amendments on that bill.\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\n  When does it end? If we can come to some reasonable agreement on \ntime--Senator Daschle and I talked last night; Senator Durbin and I \ntalked this morning, Senator Grassley. I said, let's work out something \non bankruptcy so that everybody gets a fair shot but we can get this \nbill done.\n  I will yield to the Senator if he has a question or comment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I appreciate the comment. Let me indicate, as I \nindicated before, if the process of debating campaign finance reform \nwould ever be permitted to involve the normal amending process, without \neven insisting on giving up the right to filibuster, that that is the \ncritical element, because without that, we are not in a position here \nto do what was done in the House where there was a lot of debate over \nmany months, but they were able to offer amendments. Here, as soon as \nwe won on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, it was over, there were no more \namendments. This has happened three times now.\n  Mr. LOTT. I had an amendment on paycheck equity. If we add paycheck \nequity to the bill----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Which we debated.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be much more inclined to favorably consider this \nlegislation. For labor union members to have their dues taken from them \nand used for political purposes without their permission, I think that \nis a very, very critical point. That is part of what I am talking \nabout. This bill is not balanced. It tilts the scale very definitely to \nyour side of the aisle. Where is the fairness?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I say to the leader, that is what the amendment process \nis for. Your amendment came up and, quite frankly, didn't prevail. Our \namendment came up and did prevail, and there were many other amendments \nand we just stopped. I recognize there may be another version of the \nPaycheck Protection Act that may prevail. My problem is that it stopped \nat that point, and that is not the normal procedure. That is what I am \nasking for, that everybody do their amendments, and at the end of the \nday, I know, unless you change your mind--and I recognize you don't \nneed to--that we still need 60 votes, but to have the amendments, to \nhave everybody's ideas presented and voted on, is what we are asking \nfor here.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I might say, the Senator from Wisconsin \nsaid, ``Well, we realize in the end we may not have 60 votes.'' In \nfact, some of the amendments that I would offer you would likely wind \nup being filibustered. You would. I have a long list of really \ninteresting amendments that I don't think you would particularly like, \nbut I like them a whole lot. So here is my point.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I say to the leader, I would be happy to \ntry that process. We tried the poison pill, and it didn't work.\n  Mr. LOTT. Poison pill. These are not poison pills. They are very \nlegitimate amendments. But here is the point: You acknowledge that at \nsome point you have to have 60 votes. We went through this last year. \nIt derailed the highway bill. We didn't get 60 votes. It came back this \nyear, in an effort to be fair, to see if something had changed. We had \nvotes. It got 52 votes. Then the argument was made, ``Well, gee, the \nHouse voted on a different bill, by the way, and things maybe have \nchanged.'' We voted again. Things haven't changed.\n  How many times do we have to go through that exercise? The day will \ncome when maybe really we can work in a bipartisan way on a bill that \nis fair to all concerned and we will maybe be able to bring it to a \nconclusion. I won't say that day won't come. I think it will, actually. \nThe question is, When will that be and what will it be? And I am going \nto work on that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I say to the leader, you have been enormously \ncourteous. I want to make one more remark.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield for one more comment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think it is essential for the country that this \nprocess--and I realize it is a difficult one--be completed this year \nbecause of the danger of what will happen in the year 2000 election. We \ncannot let another 2-year cycle begin with the corruption that already \nexisted in the 1996 elections and the problems with this year's \nelections to not finish the job in whatever form it is, however we can \nreach a consensus. You and I know we reached a consensus on the gift \nban. We sat down in a room, and we worked it out.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will recall, you were in the room, Senator \nLevin and I were in the room, and we made it work.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is what I just indicated. When we sat down, we \nmade it work. I suggest and make my plea to you: Let's sit down and try \nto work out something so that we can accomplish something in this \nregard to make the year 2000 elections look something better and \ndifferent than the mess in 1996. That is my plea.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, I \nappreciate your courtesy. You have always been courteous. You have \nalways been very reasonable in the way you have approached everything \naround here. Maybe the day will come when we will be able to sit down \nand agree on something. I don't see it at this point. I think the \ntiming is wrong. After all, 2000 is still 2 years off. You have 1999. \nWe will see where we can wind up.\n  For now, I want to focus our attention on the bankruptcy bill itself. \nI see that Senator Daschle is here. I noted in his absence that we have \nSenators on both sides now trying to work out an agreement. I hope we \ncan make some progress on that this afternoon or tonight and that we \nwill go forward with the substance. I understand Senator Grassley and \nSenator Durbin will be coming over to, in effect, do their opening \nstatements which they didn't really get to do last Thursday night. We \nwill let them begin the bankruptcy bill while we see if we can work \nsomething out.\n  For Senators who may not be aware of it, I said last night while we \nfiled cloture, it is my hope that we can work out an agreement, and we \ncan vitiate that cloture vote tomorrow. But we do need to get something \nworked out so we won't have to go to cloture, because I think if we do \nhave another cloture vote and it doesn't prevail, we really have to go \non. I can't stand up here and say we need to go to Interior \nappropriations and then stay on bankruptcy beyond a reasonable period \nof time. But I think it is possible, because I know there is a lot of \nsupport on both sides of the aisle.\n  With that, Mr. President, I just want to say I will be working with \nSenator Daschle to see if we can work this out, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold that for one moment so I can add \none comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask the quorum call be withheld, and I yield to the \nSenator from Michigan for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, just for one brief comment, if I might, to the \nmajority leader. I thank him for his comments. When the proponents of \ncivil rights legislation were faced with a filibuster, they didn't \nsucceed the first time to get the necessary votes, which I think then \nwas two-thirds. They didn't withdraw the civil rights bill. Because \nthey felt it was so important to the Nation that we pass that \nlegislation, they decided that the filibuster, which is their right \nunder the rules--it is not required that people who offer a bill or an \namendment withdraw their amendment or their bill just because they are \nbeing filibustered.\n  The situation here is that there is a bipartisan group, a majority, \nwho feel very, very strongly that this is a transcendent issue, that \nthis is an issue which cuts across so many other issues, that the soft \nmoney loophole has undermined public confidence in a significant way in \nour elections.\n  I think it is important that everybody be straight with each other, \nand I think you have been straight with us and we have been straight \nwith you. Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have worked on a \nbipartisan basis in a way which is really important for the Nation.\n  It is important that everybody understand that this amendment will be \nreoffered on the next appropriations bill because of the seriousness \nwith which it is held on a bipartisan basis, and then folks who want to \nfilibuster have that right, but folks who don't want to help that \nfilibuster succeed also have rights to reoffer it. Those are the rights \nwhich will clash. That is why we are here to do this in a civil way. \nThe majority leader has always\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\nbeen civil in his dealings on this issue, as on all other issues.\n  I want to add both the statement that I have made and also to be very \nclear and be very straight with the leadership as to what the intent \nis, which is to reoffer this amendment on the next appropriations bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might just respond briefly, obviously, \nSenators are entitled to offer amendments, and then other Senators are \nentitled to offer second-degree amendments. The Senator knows very well \nthat cloture votes and filibusters are an important part of this \ninstitution. You may not like it, depending on which end you are on on \nthat subject, whether you are on the receiving end, but it is there and \nit is an honored and a time-preserved process we use around here.\n  Also, the Senate sometimes works on an issue for years--years--before \nyou get a consensus. I worked on telecommunications for 10 years. This \nyear, and we got very little credit for it, but this year we passed the \nWorkplace Development Act, a consolidation of job training programs. We \nworked on it for 3 years. We failed at the end of the last Congress to \npull it out. We finally got it done, sent it over to the President, and \nbecause everything else was going on, it didn't even receive any \nnotice. Sometimes consensus takes time.\n  Also, I have watched the Senate over a period of years on a number of \nissues, sometimes when Republicans were pushing them; sometimes when \nDemocrats were pushing them. You reach a point where you say, ``I made \nmy point for now; I'll be back, but now we are going to go on and do \nour business.''\n  We have 19 days left, assuming we are going to try to go out October \n9, 19 days left in this session.\n  We still have important work to do, including a lot of bills on the \nissues that we agree on in a bipartisan way, and with only 19 days to \naccomplish them.\n  The Senator has his rights, but as majority leader and in the \nleadership we have to try to find a way to have those votes, but then \nto move on. So I am sure you understand. I understand where you might \nhave to come from, and I hope you will understand what I would have to \ndo under those conditions to try to keep the focus.\n  But the next 19 days are not going to be easy under the best of \nconditions. The Senate is expected to show decorum and restraint and \ndignity, and I know we are going to do that. We also have to reach out \nacross the aisle and say, ``Can we find a way to work through these \nbills?''\n  I think the people will be watching us. We have to do a little \npreening. You have to make your positions clear, we have to make our \npositions clear, and then at some point we have to come together. We \nwill not necessarily agree at the beginning on what the solution is to \nagriculture in America. But it is very important in South Dakota and in \nOhio and Mississippi and all over this country. But at some point we \nare going to come together because this is a problem, a real problem, \nand we can find a solution.\n  So I hope that is the way that we will proceed. Make your points, on \nboth sides of the issue--on both sides of the aisle--and then let us \nsit down and see if we can find a way to come to an agreement to do the \nbest we can. It may not be all we want to do, or it may be too much in \nsome cases, but I am prepared to work in that vein. And I am hoping, \nagain, in spite of all the other distractions, that we can keep our \nattention focused. And I will try to help to do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed with debate only on the bill before us, the bankruptcy \nbill, until 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I think that we need to consider once \nagain the very important issue of bankruptcy. Senator Durbin has \ncooperated very well in the subcommittee's work and the committee's \nwork to bring the bill this far.\n  Why are we introducing a bankruptcy bill? Why do we need major \nbankruptcy reform? I think it is pretty simple that under the current \nsystem an individual can avoid paying the debts that he has incurred \nwith few, if any, questions asked even if that individual has some \nability to repay all or a portion of those debts.\n  This much too easy bankruptcy system encourages irresponsible \nbehavior and costs businesses and ultimately consumers they serve \nmillions of dollars a year, adding up to $40 billion a year in added \ncost to product and service.\n  They have to raise their prices to cover this. You, as a consumer, \npay this. That is $400 for the average family--a hidden tax. You can \nsee this being possible because individuals can declare bankruptcy \nunder chapter 7 where debts are rarely repaid. Or there is the choice \nof chapter 13 which requires debtors to repay a discounted portion of \ntheir debts. And obviously--and this bill does that--Congress should \nencourage the use of chapter 13 where creditors will at least receive \nsomething, whereas under chapter 7 rarely anything.\n  Our bill imposes a means test for people who declare bankruptcy. If a \nperson can repay all or some of their debts now, or even over an \nextended period of time, they will either have to file under chapter 13 \nor stay out of the bankruptcy system entirely. This will mean that the \nbusinesses which extended credit in good faith will not be left with \nabsolutely nothing.\n  Our bankruptcy reform bill imposes a means test by letting creditors \nfile motions under section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. These motions \nwould raise evidence concerning a debtor's ability to repay debt.\n  Under current law, creditors--the people with the most to gain or \nlose--are expressly forbidden from doing this. By opening the doors to \ncreditor involvement, businesses can become masters of their own \ndestiny.\n  Of course, in order to prevent abusive court filings--we don't deny \nthat there can be some abuse of this privilege, but we have included \npenalties if a court dismisses a creditor's motion and determines that \nthe motion was not substantially justified.\n  Our bankruptcy reform bill contains a unique feature which will \nprovide important assistance to small businesses which may not be able \nto afford to press their case in bankruptcy court. The chapter 7 public \ntrustees--these are the private individuals who administer bankruptcy \ncases and who are in the best position to know whether debtors can \nrepay their debts--are allowed to bring evidence and motions to the \nbankruptcy judge. If the judge grants a motion to dismiss a bankruptcy \npetition or to transfer the case to chapter 13, the attorney for the \ndebtor will be fined and the fine will be paid to the chapter 7 trustee \nas a reward, as an incentive for detecting an abuse of the bankruptcy \nsystem by a debtor and by the counsel for that person that owes money.\n  Thus, a well-informed cadre of bankruptcy trustees with a meaningful \nfinancial incentive will be empowered under this legislation to find \ndebtors who could repay and get them into chapter 13 or out of the \nbankruptcy system entirely.\n  A recent survey of chapter 7 trustees indicated that over 80 percent \nof the trustees would use this power if it were given to them. \nEmpowering chapter 7 trustees will help small businesses since the \neffect of transferring or dismissing a case will be that creditors will \ncollect more and bills will be paid. There will be less of an incentive \nto go into chapter 7 willy-nilly if there is somebody looking over the \nshoulder to see that it has been done right. We then avoid those people \nwho might be shady, those people who might be using bankruptcy as part \nof personal financial planning. Under this procedure, small businesses \nwould need only to sit back and let the trustee seek his reward and \nwould not have to spend a dime to litigate the case.\n  This is important legislation. It will help all consumers because it \nwill help businesses collect debts that will otherwise remain unpaid \nand be passed on to the people who pay their debts and never declare \nbankruptcy. This bill is\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\nabout basic fairness. It is about time that Congress provides fairness \nfor all consumers.\n  Madam President, I think it is very important that we consider on \nthis latter point that I made about the trustees being able to review \nthese bankruptcy cases, that we make very clear that this ought to \nencourage the bankruptcy bar, to some extent, to be very careful, \nwhereas we feel some are not so careful now in its present environment \nof the last 20 years of counseling people into bankruptcy in the first \nplace or into chapter 7 as opposed to chapter 13. I don't think a \nlawyer is going to want to take a chance on being penalized for putting \nsomebody in chapter 7 that should have been in chapter 13; or even \nputting somebody in bankruptcy that shouldn't have been there in the \nfirst place. We feel that we need to get the bankruptcy bar back to the \npoint where they are advising people; that in every instance a person \nmight feel that they want to go into bankruptcy, that it might not be \njustified.\n  I yield the floor. I want to give my good friend, the Senator from \nIllinois, an opportunity to speak on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  During the course of this debate on the bankruptcy bill, we will be \ntalking about a number of aspects of this procedure. When you consider \na nation of 260 million Americans, and I guess about 1.3 or 1.4 million \neach year file bankruptcy, the vast majority of people who may be \nwatching this debate have no personal knowledge of the subject. Of \ncourse, some lawyers and people who are involved in credit counseling \ndo, but, unfortunately for a lot of unsuspecting people, bankruptcy \nbecomes a critical part of their lives. Senator Grassley and I are \nattempting to change the bankruptcy code in a way that is fair, that \nwill reduce abusive bankruptcies, but still allow the procedure to be \navailable to those who truly need it.\n  Let me give an example of one of the amendments which I have offered, \nor will offer if given the opportunity, which I think tells an \nimportant story about bankruptcy; that is, the whole question about \nretirement funds. Creditors want those who file for bankruptcy to pay \ntheir creditors every penny they have, often including retirement \nsavings. If you are 54 years old and you have some IRAs, some 401(k) \nplans that you are putting aside for your own retirement and then lose \nyour job after 30 years due to a merger or downsizing, or if someone in \nyour family--a spouse or a child--incurs major medical bills and you \nfind yourself facing literally tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in debt and find you can't pay your bills, you may \nbe forced into bankruptcy. What may be at stake is not only the money \nyou have on hand, but the money you have saved for your retirement.\n  Under current law, if you filed for bankruptcy, they go after \neverything except the 401(k) plan. So if you put aside these individual \nretirement accounts or Roth IRAs thinking, ``Someday I will need this \nto supplement Social Security,'' you will be shocked to learn that the \ncreditors--the hospitals and doctors or whoever it might be--are going \nto say, ``I'm sorry, but that IRA is now something that I can take away \nfrom you to pay off your bills.''\n  That is why I think this amendment which I am going to introduce is \nso necessary. Current law puts Americans with financial problems in a \nCatch 22 situation: Either declare bankruptcy and go into poverty in \nold age, or don't declare bankruptcy and live in poverty now with \ncreditors harassing you because your current bills and health care \ncosts sap your entire income.\n  This amendment that I want to offer to the bill, one of several, \nensures that retirement savings survive a bankruptcy proceeding intact. \nThe funds will be preserved to provide for your care and expenses in \nold age, rather than being paid to creditors who are unwilling to \ncompromise when meeting this financial setback. It also provides that \nif you took a loan from your retirement savings, for example, to fund a \ndownpayment on your house, you will have to pay yourself back by \npayroll deduction, uninterrupted by the bankruptcy.\n  I think there are reasons to support this amendment. It is a good \nindication of why some amendments are needed on this bill. Think about \nthe gravity of this situation and challenge. The retirement savings of \nhundreds of thousands of elderly Americans are at risk in bankruptcy \nproceedings. In 1997, an estimated 280,000 older Americans--that is, \nage 50 and older; and I am included in that group--filed bankruptcy; \nthough I didn't file bankruptcy. Almost one in five bankruptcy cases, \n18.5 percent, involve one or both petitioners coming to court who are \n50 years of age or older.\n  What are the top three reasons Americans give for filing for \nbankruptcy? Job loss, overwhelming medical expenses, and a creditor's \nrefusal to work out repayment plans. Nearly 50 percent of older \nAmericans declare bankruptcy because they lost their job at or about \nthe age of 50. At this age, it is a tough situation to find another job \nthat pays as well. It can be catastrophic to an entire family.\n  Parents may have kids in college, elderly parents to care for, a \nhouse that may need a new roof, and a family that may have overwhelming \nmedical expenses. About 30 percent of older Americans filing bankruptcy \ndue to family medical bills that are completely beyond their capacity \nto pay. You should not have to choose between your family's health and \nyour financial security in your old age. One in ten older Americans \nfiles bankruptcy because their creditors have refused to work with them \nto pay their bills. One in fifteen older Americans files bankruptcy to \nsave a home they are about to lose.\n  Young people really are protected by this amendment, as well, when \nretirement funds are set aside over a person's working career to \nprovide them with privately funded care in their old age. My mother \nlived to the age of 87, and she always said time and time again, for \nyears and years, ``I just don't want to be a burden on you and your \nbrothers.'' She never was, but she was always worried about it. She \nsaved carefully, so that there was money set aside, so that if \nsomething happened, she would be able to take care of herself and would \nnot have to turn to us.\n  I think that is the feeling of many senior citizens who put aside \nsavings in IRAs and 401(k) plans, so they can be independent and live a \nlife that doesn't take away from their children.\n  But think about it. If something comes along, like a catastrophic \nillness, you have reached the limit on your health insurance policy, \nand all of a sudden debts are cascading around you and bankruptcy is \nthe only option, you lose everything you saved--and independence is \nimportant to all of us, and particularly to those in their senior \nyears.\n  Security in retirement can only be achieved through the accumulation \nof assets over a working lifetime. Retirement funds should not be at \nrisk simply because of an unexpected layoff or medical problems, \nsending a debt-strapped family over the financial edge. I don't think \nthis amendment is subject to abuse, because debtors can't really sock \naway money in a retirement account just before filing for bankruptcy. \nRetirement plan contributions are heavily regulated and limited by law \nand not subject to bankruptcy planning abuse. Debtors have been \ncriticized for poor management skills, but they should be rewarded, not \npenalized, for making rational economic decisions, like preparing for \nretirement.\n  Who supports this amendment? The AARP, American Association for \nRetired Persons, National Council of Senior Citizens, the Profit \nSharing 401(k) Council of America, the National Council on Teacher \nRetirement, and the New York State Teachers Retirement System, just to \nname a few.\n  My reason for explaining this amendment is that there is debate \nunderway here as to whether we will allow amendments to the bankruptcy \nbill. This is an illustration of the type of amendment that I think is \nimportant, so that we make certain that this reform of the bankruptcy \ncode recognizes the reality of life in America. We want to protect the \nretirement funds of those who have been careful enough to save, who \ncould never even have anticipated an economic calamity such as I have \ndescribed. We want to make certain that they are given a chance to come \nthrough bankruptcy not only\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\nwith dignity but with a chance to lead a good life.\n  There are other elements to be considered as well. I would like to \naddress one or two of them before giving the floor back to Senator \nGrassley of Iowa.\n  We have talked a lot about those who file for bankruptcy. I think it \nis important that this be a balanced discussion, so that we talk about \nthose who, frankly, are using the credit system in this country to make \na great deal of money. Credit cards are one of the most profitable \nareas of financial endeavor in America. Those who have taken a close \nlook at the interest rates they pay on credit cards understand why. If \nyou happen to be late in making a monthly payment and the balance is \nheld over another month, sometimes the interest rates can be dramatic \nin comparison to what we pay for mortgages and other loans, like \nautomobile loans. The interest rates, many times, on unsecured debt, \nlike credit card debt, can be substantial.\n  Unfortunately, I don't believe many credit card companies or other \nfinancial institutions are as honest as they should be with American \nconsumers. I will bet most of the people who are listening to this \ndebate will open their mailboxes up today and find a preapproved \napplication for a credit card. We know we are going to find them \nwhenever we go home. If you look at it, you will understand that nobody \nhas analyzed your credit situation. They have basically said: Here is \nanother $100,000 in debt that you can run up if you like, at an \ninterest rate that you may be able to pick out in the fine print on the \nback of the solicitation.\n  I visited a football game in Illinois last year where they were \npassing out free T-shirts to any student at the University of Illinois, \nChampaign-Urbana, who would take an official University of Illinois \ncredit card. They ran out of T-shirts because the students could not \nwait to get them. Most of these students ended up with credits cards, \nmost without much income. We don't want to limit opportunities, but we \ndo want honest disclosure. At that particular football game, the credit \ncard company offering this credit card had posted on a banner behind \nthe little booth, ``Permanent introductory rate, 5.9 percent.'' Think \nabout that for a minute. ``Permanent introductory rate''? How does that \nwork? Clearly, at some point in time you are through the introductory \nperiod and into a new rate.\n\n  I think it is important that there be an honest disclosure of the \ninterest rate people will be charged on credit cards, so that on the \nmyriad--perhaps dozens--of credit card solicitations you receive, you \ncan make the right choice, not just the come-on rate, the attractive 6 \npercent or something on the envelope. What are you really going to be \ncharged as an interest rate?\n  I think the credit card companies owe it to us as well to send us, \nalong with the credit card application, a worksheet so that people can \nsay: Let me see, exactly where am I? How many debts do I owe? How much \nincome do I have? Does this worksheet give me an indication as to \nwhether I should go further in debt? I don't think that is \nunreasonable.\n  I also think the monthly billings we receive from many of the credit \ncard companies are a mystery to try to figure out, what they mean and \nwhat it means if we make certain payments. For example, there will be \nan amendment offered here, I believe, by the Senator from Rhode Island, \nSenator Reed, which will say that you cannot have your credit card \ncanceled if you pay off the entire balance each month. Many people are \nsurprised to learn that. They make the payment and say, ``I am a good \ncustomer.'' Obviously, they got their bill and paid it. But then the \ncompany says: ``We are not interested in your business anymore. If you \nare not going to carry a debt and pay us interest from time to time, or \nregularly, then we don't want you as a customer.'' They don't disclose \nthat when you get the card. But you may find that out later on.\n  Also, if you look at the monthly statement, it says ``minimum monthly \npayment.'' Well, I think there are some obvious questions that should \nbe answered when they say ``minimum monthly payment.'' If I make that \nminimum monthly payment, how many months will it take me to pay off the \nbalance if I don't add another penny of debt? How much will I be paying \nin interest? Those are not unreasonable questions. I think the average \nconsumer should have the answer right there on the monthly statement.\n  I looked at my own credit card recently just to see what the minimum \nmonthly payment might result in. It resulted in my paying off the \nbalance in a mere 60 months--5 years. That is paying off the current \nbalance with a minimum monthly payment.\n  The time may come when an individual can't pay off the credit card on \na regular basis. They may have a problem and fall behind. That is \nunderstandable where the minimum monthly payment may be the only thing \nthey can come up with. I think we have to educate consumers so they \ndon't fall into this trap.\n  There is another element here that I have learned during the course \nof this debate. Some people are surprised to know that once they have \nthe credit card in hand and make a purchase, if you have a debt that \nthey are trying to pursue in bankruptcy, the credit card company not \nonly has recourse against you personally but has recourse against \nwhatever items you purchased with the credit card. Surprise, surprise. \nYou turned around and bought a television or a stereo with the credit \ncard, thinking that that was the way you were going to own it, and you \nget into bankruptcy court and they say that the fine print in the \ncontract says, ``We now own the television.'' I think that should be \ndisclosed. People ought to know that going in. That is another example, \nin my mind, of the kind of activity that would lead to a more level \nplaying field.\n  Those critical of the increases in filings for bankruptcy, I think, \nhave some good cause for alarm. There are too many. If we can reduce \nabusive filings, we should. The average person filing for bankruptcy in \nAmerica has an income of less than $18,000 a year and average debts of \n$28,000. So the people we find in bankruptcy court are not the wheelers \nand dealers and high rollers; they are folks in lower- to middle-income \nsituations who have run into a mountain of debt that they can't cope \nwith. I don't want to see this bill penalize those people. I want to \nmake certain that we are careful that whatever we do does not stop them \nfrom coming to court and trying to finally discharge their debts and \nstart again.\n  There is another element in this bill which I think deserves some \nconsideration and discussion. It is called the homestead exemption.\n  Under a curiosity in the law, each State can determine how much we \ncan have in a homestead exemption, which means if I go into bankruptcy \ncourt in my home State of Illinois and file for bankruptcy, they have \ndecided by statute in that State that the maximum amount which I can \nclaim as the value of my home--I can't recall the exact figure in \nIllinois, but it is relatively modest. Some States have gone off the \ncharts. That is why we had a couple of instances where noteworthy \nfigures--one a former commissioner of baseball, another a former \nGovernor of one of our States--before filing for bankruptcy, moved to, \nin this case Florida, and in the other case Texas, and bought million-\ndollar homes which were exempt under State law. They took everything \nthat they had and plowed it into the home and filed for bankruptcy. The \ncreditors ended up with little or nothing. Thank goodness this bill, \nbecause of the amendment offered by Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, is \ngoing to eliminate what I consider to be a clever loophole and an abuse \nin the law.\n  Should this bill that Senator Grassley and I are working on pass the \nSenate, we will face a battle in conference because the House of \nRepresentatives eliminated that provision and allows each State to set \nwhatever standard they want. I don't think that is fair. I think we \nought to have a national standard. We shouldn't have people racing off \nto establish residency in some State to take advantage of a very \ngenerous homestead exemption. That is not fair to creditors. I hope \nthat as a part of this debate we will preserve that important element \nin the law.\n  At this time, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, about a month ago, the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts released figures on nationwide bankruptcy \nfilings for the\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\n12-month period ending June 30. The figures clearly illustrate what has \nso many of us concerned--that is, that bankruptcy filings are becoming \nepidemic.\n  Filings for the 12-month period ending on June 30 totaled 1,429,451--\nan all-time high. Personal bankruptcy filings increased 9.2 percent \nfrom the same period in 1997.\n  Unlike other kinds of epidemics, this is one that can be avoided in \nmany instances if credit is used wisely and people do not overextend \nthemselves in the first place.\n  Certainly, extraordinary circumstances can strike any family, which \nis why it is important to preserve access to bankruptcy relief. No one \ndisputes that there should be an opportunity to seek relief and a fresh \nstart when truly extraordinary circumstances strike--for example, when \nfamilies are torn apart by divorce or ill health. I suspect that \ncreditors are more than willing to work with someone when such tragedy \nstrikes to help them through tough times.\n  But there is growing evidence, Madam President, that more and more \npeople who file for relief under Chapter 7 actually have the ability to \npay back some, or even all, of what they owe. It is cases like that, \nwhere bankruptcy is becoming the option of first resort, rather than \nlast resort, that led to the drafting of the bill before us today.\n  The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 1301, is the product of a \nnumber of hearings and months of deliberations. I would note that it \nenjoys broad bipartisan support, having been approved overwhelmingly by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee on a vote of 15 to 2. Similar bipartisan \nlegislation in the House passed on June 10 by the lopsided vote of 306 \nto 118.\n  So what does this legislation do? Those with low incomes would \ncontinue to choose between Chapter 13 payment plans and Chapter 7 \ndischarges, just as they do today. But to ensure that some people are \nnot abusing the system, the bill requires bankruptcy courts to consider \nwhether people who have higher incomes and the ability to pay a portion \nof their debt should be required to repay what they can under Chapter \n13.\n  As it stands today, people with more modest incomes who live within \ntheir means are forced to subsidize wealthier individuals who abuse the \nbankruptcy laws. That is just not fair.\n  When people run up debts they have no intention of paying, they shift \na greater financial burden onto honest, hard-working families in \nAmerica. Estimates are that bankruptcy costs every American family an \nextra $400 a year.\n  Madam President, I want to stop at this point and single out three \nprovisions of the bill for comment--provisions that were added in \ncommittee as a result of the adoption of amendments I offered. They \nrepresent what, in my view, are very modest, common-sense reforms of \nthe bankruptcy system.\n  The first appears in Section 314 of the bill and provides that debts \nthat are fraudulently incurred could no longer be discharged in Chapter \n13, the same as in Chapter 7. Currently, at the conclusion of a Chapter \n13 plan, the debtor is eligible for a broader discharge than is \navailable in Chapter 7, and this superdischarge can result in several \ntypes of debts, including those for fraud and intentional torts, being \ndischarged whereas they could not be discharged in Chapter 7. My \namendment would simply add fraudulent debts to the list of debts that \nare nondischargeable under Chapter 13. It is as simple as that.\n  Let me take a few moments to share some of the comments that others \nhave made on the subject. Here is what the Deputy Associate Attorney \nGeneral, Francis M. Allegra, said about the dischargeability of \nfraudulent debts in a letter dated June 19, 1997: ``We are unconvinced \nthat providing a (fresh start) under Chapter 13 superdischarge to those \nwho commit fraud or whose debts result from other forms of misconduct \nis desirable as a policy matter.''\n  Here is what Judge Edith Jones of Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said \nin a dissenting opinion to the report of the Bankruptcy Review \nCommission: ``The superdischarge satisfies no justifiable social policy \nand only encourages the use of Chapter 13 by embezzlers, felons, and \ntax dodgers.''\n  Judith Starr, the Assistant Chief of the Litigation Counsel Division \nof Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission, testified \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee on March 18, 1998. Speaking about \nthe fraud issue, she said: ``We believe that, in enacting the \nBankruptcy Code, Congress never intended to extend the privilege of the \n`fresh start' to those who lie, cheat, and steal from the public.'' She \ngoes on to say:\n\n       A fair consumer bankruptcy system should help honest but \n     unfortunate debtors get their financial affairs back in order \n     by providing benefits and protections that will help the \n     honest to the exclusion of the dishonest, and not vice versa. \n     It is an anomaly of the current system that bankruptcy is \n     often more attractive to persons who commit fraud than to \n     their innocent victims. Bankruptcy should not be a refuge for \n     those who have committed intentional wrongs, nor should it \n     encourage gamesmanship by failing to provide real \n     consequences for abuse of its protections.\n\n  And she concludes:\n\n       We support [the provision of the House bill] which makes \n     fraud debts nondischargeable in Chapter 13 cases. Inducements \n     to file under Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 should be \n     aimed at honest debtors, not at those who have committed \n     fraud.\n\n  A final quotation: The Honorable Heidi Heitkamp, the Attorney General \nof North Dakota, testified to the following before the House Committee \non March 10:\n\n       When a true ``bad actor'' is in the picture--a scam artist, \n     a fraudulent telemarketer, a polluter who stubbornly refuses \n     to clean up the mess he has created there is a real potential \n     for bankruptcy to become a serious impediment to protecting \n     our citizenry.\n\n  Furthermore, she says:\n\n       We must all be concerned because bankruptcy is, in many \n     ways, a challenge to the normal structure of a civilized \n     society. The economy functions based on the assumption that \n     debts will be paid, that laws will be obeyed, that order to \n     incur costs to comply with statutory obligations will be \n     complied with, and that monetary penalties for failure to \n     comply will apply and will ``sting.'' If those norms can be \n     ignored with impunity, and with little or no future \n     consequences for the debtor, this bodes poorly for the \n     ability of society to continue to enforce those requirements.\n\n  Madam President, I hope there will be no dissent to these anti-fraud \nprovisions. Certainly, there should not be. Bankruptcy relief should be \navailable to people who work hard and play by rules, yet fall \nunexpectedly upon hard times. Perpetrators of fraud should not be \nallowed to find safe haven in the bankruptcy law.\n  The second amendment I offered, and which has been incorporated into \nthis bill, is found in Section 315. It, too, is simple and straight-\nforward. It says that debts that are incurred to pay non-dischargeable \ndebts are themselves non-dischargeable. In other words, if someone \nborrows money to pay a debt that cannot be erased in bankruptcy, that \nnew debt could not be erased either. The idea is to prevent \nunscrupulous individuals from gaming the system and obtaining a \ndischarge of debt that would otherwise be non-dischargeable.\n  I want to emphasize that we have taken special care to ensure that \ndebts incurred to pay non-dischargeable debts will not compete with \nnon-dischargeable child- or family-support in a post-bankruptcy \nenvironment.\n  The third amendment of mine adopted in committee is reflected in \nSection 316 of the bill, and it is intended to discourage people from \nrunning up large debts on the eve of bankruptcy, particularly when they \nhave no ability or intention of making good on their obligations.\n  Current law effectively gives unscrupulous individuals a green light \nto run their credit cards just before filing for bankruptcy, knowing \nthey will never be liable for the charges they are incurring. That is \nwrong, and it has got to stop.\n  The provision would establish a presumption that consumer debt run up \non the eve of bankruptcy would be non-dischargeable. The provision is \nnot self-executing. In other words, it would still require that a \nlawsuit be brought by the creditor against the debtor. Many valid \nclaims for nondischargeability are never filed, because the creditors \ndo not have enough money at stake to justify the litigation costs. But \nif this provision achieves the intended purpose, debtors will not only \nminimize the run-up of additional debt, they will have more money \navailable after bankruptcy to pay priority obligations, including \nalimony and child support.\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\n  Again, special care has been taken to ensure that we are only talking \nabout debts incurred within 90 days of bankruptcy for goods or services \nthat are not necessary for the maintenance or support of the debtor or \ndependent child. We want to be sure that family obligations are met.\n  Madam President, I want to discuss one other aspect of the bill \nbefore closing, and that relates to the many provisions that Senators \nHatch, Grassley, and I crafted to protect the interests of women and \nchildren.\n  Nothing in the original version of the bill changed the priority of, \nor any of the other protections that are accorded to, child-support and \nalimony under current law. If members of the Senate have not seen the \nrelevant analysis done by Judge Edith Jones of the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, I will submit it for the Record now. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                                Fifth Circuit,\n\n                                      Houston, TX, April 30, 1998.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Congressman Henry J. Hyde,\n     Congressman George W. Gekas.\n       Dear Sirs: To say that I am disappointed by recent public \n     statements criticizing the Gekas and Grassley bankruptcy \n     reform bills is not strong enough. The quotations attributed \n     to Professors Elizabeth Warren and Ken Klee in U.S.A. Today, \n     April 30, 1998, p. 1, are a blatant misrepresentation of the \n     bills and current bankruptcy law. I think we all have a right \n     to expect more expertise and candor from tenured professors \n     at two of our nation's outstanding law schools than are \n     displayed in these statements.\n       Let me explain the obvious errors and inconsistencies in \n     their remarks.\n       First, neither of the pending reform bills would weaken \n     current bankruptcy law's attempts to protect the interests of \n     ex-wives and children of divorce. Current law protects them \n     in the following ways. Section 507(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy \n     Code, U.S.C. Title 11, denominates alimony and child support \n     payments as priority debts, payable before ordinary debts of \n     the debtor. Sections 553(c)(1) and 522(f)(1)(A) prohibit the \n     use of exemptions or lien-stripping otherwise permitted by \n     section 522(f) to 523(a)(5), (15), and (18) make alimony, \n     child support, some property settlement payments, and some \n     debts owed to public entities for those payments non-\n     dischargeable in Chapter 7. Section 1328(a)(2) renders \n     alimony and child support payment non-dischargeable in \n     Chapter 13. Thus, current bankruptcy law affords special \n     protection for marriage-dissolution claims.\n       Second, the Gekas/Moran Bill, H.R. 3150, would actually \n     enhance these protections. One would think that Professors \n     Warren and Klee would endorse these proposals if they are \n     seriously concerned about ex-spouses and children. H.R. 3150 \n     amends section 523(a)(5) to more broadly exempt from \n     discharge divorce-related property settlements and attorney's \n     fees. The bill also eliminates section 523(c), a provision \n     which costs ex-wives a great deal of money by requiring \n     them to litigate in bankruptcy court as well as family \n     court over support and alimony payments. Finally, the \n     needs-based requirement of H.R. 3150 does not kick in \n     until priority debts, which as previously stated include \n     those for alimony and child support payments, have been \n     excluded from the debtor's income.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ These descriptions of H.R. 3150 are based on the most \n     recent version I have.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Third, under current bankruptcy law, debts owed for \n     purchases of ``luxury goods'' or certain cash advances \n     obtained within 60 days of bankruptcy are presumed non-\n     dischargeable if a creditor contends the debts were \n     fraudulently incurred. Section 523(a)(2)(c). The House and \n     Senate bankruptcy reform bills modestly extend the non-\n     dischargeability presumption--and it is no more than that--to \n     consumer purchases within 90 days of bankruptcy. The bills \n     hope to discourage debtors from running up large debts while \n     knowing that they are on the verge of bankruptcy. If the \n     debtors take the hint from these bills, they will not run up \n     their debts and will have more money available after \n     bankruptcy to pay alimony and support obligations. Indeed, \n     any ethical attorney rendering bankruptcy advice after the \n     passage of this section would counsel his clients not to run \n     up extraordinary consumer debts within 90 days of bankruptcy. \n     Professors Warren and Klee must either think that this \n     provision would not influence the conduct of ethical \n     attorneys and debtors or that many or most debtors routinely \n     run up debt just before they file bankruptcy.\n       Fourth, after this provision is enacted, consumer debts \n     incurred within ninety days of bankruptcy will become non-\n     dischargeable only if (a) debtors don't take the hint from \n     the statute, (b) debtors run up consumer debts within 90 days \n     pre-bankruptcy under circumstances that are fraudulent, (c) \n     the amount thus run up on a particular creditor is large \n     enough to make it worthwhile for that creditor to sue in \n     bankruptcy court under Sec. 523(c)(1), and (d) a final \n     judgment of non-dischargeability is actually entered. \n     Professors Warren and Klee know very well that this non-\n     dischargeability provision is not self-executing and requires \n     a lawsuit by the creditor against the debtor. They are also \n     aware that many valid claims for non-dischargeability are \n     never filed, because the creditors do not have enough money \n     at stake to justify the litigation costs.\n       Fifth, Professor Warren's criticism of the family-\n     friendliness of these reform bills puzzles me. As a member of \n     the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. I proposed to \n     strengthen section 523(a)(5) to enhance the protections of \n     former spouses and children in relation to property \n     settlements, and Professor Warren offered no assistance or \n     encouragement whatsoever. As Reporter to the Commission, \n     moreover, Professor Warren set the agenda for the five \n     Commission members who rejected my proposal.\n       Sixth, Professors Warren and Klee are apparently harping on \n     one provision of comprehensive bankruptcy bills in hopes of \n     defeating the entire reform effort. Surely, while that \n     approach might be effective politics, it is not \n     intellectually defensible for bankruptcy specialists who are \n     members of the academic community. This complex, multi-\n     faceted and much-needed bankruptcy legislation clarifies the \n     bankruptcy law, makes it more uniform nationally, and will \n     streamline the process. But Professors Klee and Warren are \n     not attempting to be precise, only to be obstructionist.\n       I hope that the important debate over bankruptcy reform \n     will proceed on an intellectual, not an emotional level.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Edith H. Jones.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Even though current law is clear--and even though the \noriginal version of the bill made no change in the protections that it \nprovides--concerns were expressed that provisions of the legislation \nmight indirectly or even inadvertently affect ex-spouses and children \nof divorce. Assuming that critics were operating in good faith--and \nbecause our intent was always to ensure that family obligations were \nmet first--Senators Hatch, Grassley, and I crafted an amendment to \nremove any doubt whatsoever about whether women and children come \nfirst.\n  The Hatch-Grassley-Kyl amendment elevates the priority of child-\nsupport from its current number seven on the priority list for purposes \nof payment to number one--ahead of six other items, including lawyer's \nfees that are now afforded higher priority. Our amendment mandates--\nmandates--that all child support and alimony be paid before all other \nobligations in a Chapter 13 plan. It conditions both confirmation and \ndischarge of a Chapter 13 plan upon complete payment of all child \nsupport and alimony that is due before and after the bankruptcy \npetition is filed. It helps women and children reach exempt property \nand collect support payments notwithstanding contrary federal or state \nlaw. It exempts state child-support collection authority from the \nautomatic stay under bankruptcy law to ensure prompt collection of \nchild-support payments. And it extends the protection accorded an ex-\nspouse by making almost all obligations one ex-spouse owes to the other \nnon-dischargeable.\n  Despite the various protections we have laid out, I know that some \nwill still contend that child-support and alimony could be placed in \ncompetition with other debts that are made non-dischargeable by other \nprovisions of the bill. But if placing more debt into the non-\ndischargeable category were really harmful to the interests of women \nand children, critics would also object to an amendment that Senator \nTorricelli offered in the Judiciary Committee--an amendment that added \ntort judgments for intentional torts causing personal injury or death \nto the list of non-dischargeable debts. But the Torricelli amendment \npassed without objection in committee. As a society, we have decided \nthat people who do harm to others should be held accountable for their \nactions. Senator Torricelli's amendment will do that, and I support it.\n  Let us keep several points in mind about the debts that are made non-\ndischargeable by the bill. First, even though they are made non-\ndischargeable, they are given a lower priority for payment than child \nsupport and alimony. The Hatch-Grassley-Kyl amendment makes that \ncrystal clear.\n  Second, the debts made newly non-dischargeable by the bill include \ndebts incurred by fraud, debts run up on the eve of bankruptcy by those \nwith no intention or no ability of paying, and debts that are incurred \nto pay otherwise non-dischargeable debts. We are\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\ntalking about abusive use of credit. Are those who still contend we \nhave not gone far enough really suggesting that individuals who engage \nin fraud and other abusive credit practices should be allowed to have \nthose debts erased or otherwise sanctioned by the bankruptcy code? I \nhope not.\n  When people run up debts they have no intention of paying--when \npeople are allowed to walk away from fraud and other harm caused to \nothers--they shift a greater financial burden onto honest, hard-working \nfamilies in America, including those that depend on child support to \nmake ends meet. As I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, \nestimates are that bankruptcy costs every American family an extra $400 \na year. Bankruptcy reform can reduce that burden.\n  Former Senator Lloyd Bentsen, who served as President Clinton's \noriginal Treasury Secretary, wrote an excellent column about abuse of \nthe bankruptcy code, and ask it be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Madam President, failure to pass bankruptcy reform this year would be \nunfair to the millions of Americans who play by the rules, work hard \nevery day, and struggle to pay their bills.\n  This bill does not go as far as I would like, but in the interest of \nmoving it to final passage in the relatively short amount of time \nbefore adjournment, I will support the bill in its current form. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in voting in favor of the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by former Senator Bentsen be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Get Tough on Bankruptcy Laws\n\n                           (By Lloyd Bentsen)\n\n       One of the most troubling financial contradictions of this \n     decade of solid economic expansion is that while inflation \n     has been low, unemployment down and personal income up, \n     personal bankruptcies have been skyrocketing. Real per capita \n     disposable income grew by 13 percent from 1986 to 1996, while \n     personal bankruptcies more than doubled, hitting a record \n     high of 1.2 million last year. This divergence between a \n     healthy economy and rapidly rising bankruptcy filings is due \n     to a relatively new phenomenon--the ``bankruptcy of \n     convenience.''\n       This dramatic increase in personal bankruptcies has come \n     with no corresponding growth in the traditional factors that \n     correlate with bankruptcy--divorce, catastrophic health \n     crises and job loss: The increase is driven largely by a \n     federal bankruptcy system that discourages personal \n     responsibility by encouraging people who can afford to pay \n     down their debts to simply walk away from them through \n     bankruptcy.\n       With growing frequency, bankruptcy is being treated as a \n     first choice rather than a last resort, a matter of \n     convenience rather than necessity. According to a Purdue \n     University study, nearly half of the people who file for \n     bankruptcy could repay a significant amount of their \n     outstanding obligations, but instead choose to renege. \n     Bankruptcies of convenience now constitute a significant and \n     rising percentage of personal bankruptcy filings, and the \n     cost to consumers from this trend is enormous.\n       When irresponsible spenders who can afford to pay all or \n     part of their debt declare bankruptcy, consumers and other \n     borrowers get stuck with the tab. It has been conservatively \n     estimated that personal bankruptcies amount to a hidden tax \n     of $408 per household personally, and it takes 15 responsible \n     borrowers to cover the cost of one bankruptcy of convenience.\n       The ease with which a bankruptcy can currently be obtained \n     irrespective of need is captured in a recent advertisement: \n     ``Financial problems? Get instant relief. You may be able to \n     keep everything--Payback nothing!'' The brazenness of this \n     advertisement is indicative of how far bankruptcy laws \n     have traveled from their original intent.\n       My former colleague Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat \n     of New York, coined an apt phrase for describing this and \n     other similar lapses in societal responsibility. He called it \n     ``defining deviancy down.'' To a growing number of middle \n     class and fairly wealthy Americans, it is perfectly \n     acceptable to treat bankruptcy as a financial planning tool, \n     and to expect others to pay the price for debts that they \n     choose not to honor--even if these obligations can reasonably \n     be repaid over time. While, there is nothing wrong in \n     legitimately admitting financial defeat by filing bankruptcy \n     when one cannot repay debts, many people seem to be losing \n     the justifiable sense of embarrassment Americans once felt in \n     asking others to shoulder their burden.\n       Congress and the administration should act to stem the \n     expensive and corrosive spread of bankruptcy abuse, while \n     taking care to protect the ability of people with legitimate \n     financial problems to enter into bankruptcy. The first step \n     toward reversing this trend is a bill that Reps. Bill \n     McCollum, Florida Republican, and Rick Boucher, Virginia \n     Democrat, introduced Wednesday that would shield consumers \n     and responsible borrowers from the costs forced on them by \n     bankruptcy abusers in the form of higher costs or tighter \n     credit.\n       The aim of the McCollum-Boucher bill is simple. It would \n     reestablish the link between bankruptcy and the ability to \n     pay one's debts. This is simply a matter of equity and \n     responsibility, and this bipartisan bill should enjoy broad \n     support. Over the course of the past two decades, the \n     connection between financial means and bankruptcy has been \n     severed by federal legislation, and by a change in social \n     mores removing the stigma from filing bankruptcy. In 1978, \n     Congress loosened bankruptcy standards to such an extent that \n     one's financial condition is hardly a consideration anymore. \n     At the same time, our society ``defined down'' the personal \n     responsibility of borrowers to make good on their debts.\n       Now, it is the responsibility of the Congress to act to \n     rectify this problem, it inadvertently helped to create two \n     decades ago. In the Senate and as secretary of the Treasury, \n     I worked with legislators from both parties to pass \n     legislation that promotes habits that lead to financial self-\n     sufficiency. Failure to legislatively stem the rising tide \n     of bankruptcies of convenience, however, could endanger \n     the progress made through these incentives for saving and \n     investment. In addition to raising questions of fairness, \n     imprudent use of bankruptcy laws could also produce an \n     undesirable market response.\n       Both Democratic and Republican members of Congress, and the \n     administration, have a duty to safeguard our growing economy. \n     As an article in the August 4 issue of Fortune magazine \n     noted: ``Eventually, a rising bankruptcy rate leads to \n     tighter credit. Today's default rate is beginning to eat into \n     some national lenders' profits, and some of them are already \n     starting to pull back....Some restraint may be beneficial, \n     but too much could mean a major credit squeeze.'' Our current \n     level of economic growth cannot continue without sufficient \n     investment and available credit. A rising tide of \n     bankruptcies will sink all ships--and most hurt those who \n     need credit most.\n       I am optimistic that Congress will address this burgeoning \n     problem and firmly believe that the public supports change. \n     Public opinion is running strongly in favor of tighter \n     bankruptcy laws. Seventy-six percent of respondents to a poll \n     conducted for the National Consumers League said that \n     individuals should not be allowed to erase all their debts in \n     bankruptcy if they are able to repay a portion of what they \n     owe, and 71 percent said it is too easy to declare personal \n     bankruptcy.\n       In the United States, we believe that through hard work \n     anyone can become a success. America's bankruptcy laws \n     reflect a fundamental element of our nation's entrepreneurial \n     spirit. Their intent is to ensure a fresh start for those who \n     try and fail, and they form an important thread in our social \n     safety net. But when some people systematically abuse a \n     system at great expense to the rest of the population, \n     twisting the fresh start into a free ride, Congress must step \n     in and tighten up the law to protect those who unfairly bear \n     the cost. When it comes to bankruptcies of convenience, that \n     time has come.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--I have the \nimpression that this is all right with the majority and minority--that \nI be able to proceed as in morning business to speak on the situation \nin Russia for up to 30 minutes, or shorter if anyone comes to the floor \nand wishes to resume the business of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss the political and \neconomic crisis in Russia, which poses, to state the obvious, a grave \nthreat to the security of the United States and the entire \ninternational order. The situation in Moscow is rapidly changing, so by \nthe time I finish these statements today, Lord only knows, something \nmay have happened in the meantime. Things are that fluid.\n  Although the situation is rapidly changing, in the wake of last \nweek's summit, five basic trends seem to be clear. First, the Yeltsin \nera is about to end. Second, because of structural problems in Russia's \npolitical and economic system, there is no short-term fix to Russia's \neconomic crisis. Third, an even greater danger than an economic \nmeltdown is the total collapse of\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\nthe Russian political system, which would have catastrophic \nramifications for the international security system. Fourth, in order \nto forestall such a collapse, the Yeltsin administration--or perhaps \neven a transition regime--will almost certainly take some immediate \neconomic measures that will, at least temporarily, set back Russia's \nprogress toward a free market economy. And, fifth, there is very little \nthat the United States can do to affect this grim situation. It is \nfundamentally a Russian problem with deep cultural roots.\n  Madam President, President Clinton, in my view, was correct in going \nthrough with last week's Moscow summit. If he had canceled or postponed \nthe meeting, I think it would have sent signals to the world that the \nUnited States had written off the reform effort in Russia which, \ndespite the very serious recent setbacks, has nonetheless achieved a \ngreat deal over the past 6\\1/2\\ years. I might note, parenthetically, \nthat it may have achieved enough to prevent a total reversion to \ndespotism in Russia. But that remains to be seen.\n\n  Moreover, for all its built-in problems, the summit did produce a few \nmodest agreements. Most important among them, as mentioned by others, \nwas the agreement whereby the United States and Russia will each \nconvert approximately 50 tons of plutonium withdrawn in stages from \nnuclear military programs into forms unusable for nuclear weapons.\n  The plutonium management and disposition effort will require several \nbillion dollars, but I can think of no joint effort between our two \ncountries that is more worthy of support.\n  As you know, Madam President, because you are well schooled in \ninternational relations and have spent a career in the House and the \nSenate dealing with these issues, the reason that an economy only the \nsize of Holland is having such a profound impact on the rest of the \nworld is because of the military danger that its collapse would cause. \nIf the Russian economy collapses and causes societal and political \ninstability, there are 15,000 nuclear weapons there that could fall \ninto the hands of unreliable and perhaps unstable leaders in a \nfractured country. So the effort to deal with, for example, taking 50 \ntons of nuclear-grade material and rendering it incapable of being used \nin a military context seems to me to be well worth the buy, well worth \nthe effort along the lines of the Nunn-Lugar bill in the destruction of \nnuclear capacity.\n  Despite this and a few other achievements, though, the summit could \nnot, I regret to say, conceal the terminal condition of the Yeltsin \nPresidency. Watching film of the summit press conference was a painful \nexercise, for the Russian President clearly showed his infirmity. This \nmedical condition, together with the nearly total absence of popular \nsupport for President Yeltsin and his government, makes a change in the \nnear future seem inevitable.\n  Boris Berezovsky, the most prominent leader of Russia's new \nindustrial tycoons--the power behind the throne--has already indicated \nin an interview that President Yeltsin's days in office may be \nnumbered.\n  The structural problems in Russia's economy are simply too serious to \nlend themselves to an easy solution. Many factors have contributed to \nthe sorry state in which the economy now finds itself.\n  The Asian financial crisis forced a general reappraisal of \ninternational lending in emerging economies. As investors retreated to \nsafety, doubts about Russia's ability to protect the ruble became a \nself-fulfilling prophecy.\n  The 50-percent drop in worldwide crude oil prices within the last 18 \nmonths severely harmed Russia's hard currency earning capacity, \nweakening an important support for its currency and its ability to pay \ninternational debts.\n  But more fundamentally, Russia has been hamstrung by an inability to \ncreate the necessary preconditions for being a player in the \ninternational economic system. President Clinton outlined them in his \nusual lucid way in a speech to students in Moscow.\n  Russia must create a full-fledged rule of law with fair enforcement \nmechanisms. It must put into place modern taxation and banking systems. \nInvestors, domestic and foreign, must have confidence that they will \nnot have the rules changed in the middle of the game.\n  In return, Russians, especially the large Russian corporations, must \npay their taxes so that the Government can get its fiscal house in \norder and will not have to resort to the printing press to cover its \ndeficits. The Russian ``kleptocracy'' must end.\n  Madam President, I was speaking by telephone with one of the more \nprominent businessmen in my State about an hour before I came over to \nthe floor. He is in the poultry business. He called to ask me what I \nthought about the current situation in Russia. He has several million \ndollars' worth of product in Kaliningrad. They have a rule there that \nif, in fact, it is not purchased within 90 days, it can be confiscated. \nSo he has to decide whether to keep it there and run the risk of \nconfiscation or get it out of there and try to market it someplace \nelse. In his factory in Delaware he has an equal amount of product with \nRussian labels, which is poultry to be sent to Russia. He wanted to \nknow what I thought was likely to happen, and so on and so forth.\n  As I talked to him--he is a very bright guy who has been doing \nbusiness in Russia in earnest now for the last 4 or 5 years--I asked, \n``What do they need most?''\n  He replied, ``I never thought I would say this as a conservative \nbusinessman. What they need most is the IRS over there.''\n  I said, ``Say that again?''\n  He repeated, ``What they need is the IRS over there.''\n  The truth of the matter is, one of the reasons their economy is in \nsuch horrible shape is that no one is paying their taxes. These are \nprecisely the measures the International Monetary Fund has been urging \non the Yeltsin government, but they remain largely unfulfilled.\n  The only thing worse than the Yeltsin government paralyzed by an \neconomic meltdown would be a coup d'etat that installed an \nauthoritarian government. It takes little imagination to contemplate \nthe horrible dangers of a resentful, extremist regime that still \npossesses thousands of missiles armed with nuclear warheads.\n  Such a scenario, while still unlikely, is not beyond the realm of \npossibility, especially if Yeltsin's new candidate for Prime Minister, \nYevgenii Primakov--who is almost certain to be confirmed by the Duma--\nis unable to rapidly stabilize the situation.\n  By tomorrow afternoon, I think Primakov will be confirmed by the \nDuma. In order to forestall a political catastrophe, I believe the \nRussian Government in the coming days will take economic steps that \nmay, in the short run, avoid a revolutionary situation but in the long \nrun will make it a heck of a lot harder for them to ever get their \neconomic house in order.\n  These steps will probably include putting an infusion of currency \ninto the economy through a large-scale increase in Government spending \nto pay the back wages of state employees, including the military, a \nprocess which, in fact, seems already to have begun.\n  Moreover, there will likely be some form of wage and price controls, \nforeign currency restrictions, and renationalization of some \nindustries--all the wrong things to do. But in fairness to the \nRussians, I wonder if any of us were taking over that Government at \nthis point, we would do anything short of that to avert a civil \ncatastrophe. Such moves, we must realize, would likely doom Russia's \nchances of receiving the next payment of the $22 billion of the \ninternational support package negotiated just a month ago.\n  I believe in the long run Russia's march toward a free-market economy \nis inevitable, notwithstanding what I said, but some emergency measures \nmay be a necessary short-term detour to avoid the kind of complete \ncalamity that a coup d'etat or popular uprising would bring. I am not \npredicting either a coup or an uprising, but I believe that the Russian \nleadership will conclude that is a risk they wish not to take.\n  Unfortunately, there is very little the United States can do right \nnow to influence events in Russia.\n  Despite the deteriorating international economic enviroment and the \ninevitable mistakes that have occurred as part of well-intentioned \nassistance efforts, I do not believe that the United States or the West \nin general should feel that they are responsible for the Russian \ncollapse.\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\n  As I said on the floor last spring in the course of the Senate debate \non NATO enlargement, we have wisely not repeated the mistakes made \nafter World War I with respect to Germany. There is no parallel with \nWeimar.\n  Rather than imposing staggering reparations on a defeated enemy, the \ncapitalist world has pumped $100 billion in aid, loans, and investments \ninto Russia.\n  Rather than isolating Russia internationally as the victorious allies \ndid with Germany well into the 1920s, we encouraged Moscow and welcomed \nher into a variety of international organizations.\n  We must confront the inescapable fact that the root causes of \nRussia's stunning descent into chaos lie in her own history and \nculture.\n  Centuries of serfdom and submission to foreign conquerors and \nautocratic tsars hampered the development of political democracy and a \ncivic culture in Russia.\n  Then at the beginning of the 20th century, just when both--that is, a \ncivic culture and a political democracy--were nonetheless beginning to \nemerge Russia was hit first by World War I and then by the Bolshevik \nRevolution and civil war.\n  I believe the 7 decades of communism that followed offer the best \nexplanation of the current disarray in Russia.\n  The tangible devastating legacies of communism are well known: \nmillions killed by Stalin's mad collectivization and purges, \nenvironmental degradation, and a massive deterioration in public health \nand life expectancy.\n  There is also a philosophical legacy that bears directly upon today's \nimpasse. Marxism's basic tenet, the class struggle. Some scholars may \ndisagree with me, and I am sure I will hear from them when I say this.\n  The entire political class now vying for power in Russia was taught \nto believe that economic class determines one's interest, that life is, \nin essence, a zero-sum game. If you, my opponent, win, that must mean \nthat I lose.\n  Such a mindset stifles mutual trust and makes compromise in the \npolitical arena extremely difficult. The result is that democratic \nRussia has developed relatively few individuals who in the West would \nbe called or could be called a ``loyal opposition.''\n  Last year on a visit to Moscow, I held lengthy discussions with \nseveral of the leaders who have been in the forefront of the opposition \nto Chernomyrdin.\n  The Communist Party leader Gennadii Zyuganov and the nationalist \nleader, former general Aleksandr Lebed, both struck me as intelligent, \nthoughtful men, but distrustful and conniving ones who put self before \ncountry.\n  Only Grigorii Yavlinsky, the leader of the Yabloko Party, seemed to \nbe one who might fit into our category of the ``loyal opposition.'' I \nam told that he may be named First Deputy Prime Minister if Primakov is \nconfirmed as Prime Minister by the Duma. That would be an encouraging \nsign. We will know by tomorrow or the next day whether that is true.\n  One can argue endlessly about what the United States might or might \nnot have done to avert the current catastrophe.\n  But before we indulge in ``who lost Russia?'' finger-pointing, it is \nwell to look at Poland, where western-style economic shock-therapy was \napplied, the population suffered but endured, and the country emerged \nimmeasurably strengthened.\n  Lest one thinks this is a communist-era comparison of a giant and a \nmidget, I would point out that Poland's nearly 40 million population is \nnow in the same general league as Russia's, which is down to 147 \nmillion from the Soviet Union's 270 million.\n  More importantly, Poland's gross domestic product is approximately \none-third of Russia's, so a fair contrast, I believe, can be drawn.\n  Poland's political culture and sense of nationhood were solid enough \nto support the wrenching, but necessary, economic reforms. Neither was \npresent in Russia.\n  Perhaps the shorter period of communist rule in Poland than in Russia \nand the sense that communism had been an alien creed imposed upon the \ncountry were factors that mitigated the corrosive ideological effects \nof Marxism.\n  Whatever the ultimate explanation, the sad fact is that Russia's \npolitical culture, unlike Poland's, proved unable to provide the \nunderpinning for successful economic reform thus far.\n  The fundamental problem, is not that Russia carried out too many \ndemocratic and capitalistic reforms too soon, but rather that it did \nnot carry them out fully.\n  The Russians now bear the principal responsibility for sorting out \ntheir colossal problems. The United States should continue to offer \nencouragement and support.\n  Most importantly, we must keep our eye on the first priority of \npreventing the collapse of Russian democracy along with their economy.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. President, you come from an agricultural State, larger but not \nunlike mine. I suspect in the coming days and weeks, there are going to \nbe people who will agree with me, and maybe others already do, that one \nof the ways in which we can deal with Russia's problems in a positive \nway in the near term is by providing significant food aid, because \nshortly we may see significant shortages of food in Russia on the \nshelves.\n  The EU is already considering a significant food aid program. Maybe \nthat is one of the things we can do in the short term to help stem the \nerosion of civic support for democracy in Russia. The point that has to \nbe kept in mind is that we have a clear interest in Russian democracy, \nalong with the emerging prospect of a Russian market economy. But it \nultimately rests with the Russians, and they have some very, very tough \ndecisions to make.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just a short while ago I was informed \nthat the majority leader was looking for amendments to the bankruptcy \nlegislation and also mentioned my name during that discussion. I am \nquite prepared to call up our amendment at the present time, Amendment \nNumber 3540, and move for consideration of that amendment.\n  The majority leader indicated--I am getting the transcript--that he \nwas prepared to enter in a time agreement on this amendment, and that \nhe was inviting amendments to the bankruptcy bill. I am here on the \nfloor now prepared to move ahead, and I am also willing to enter into a \nreasonable time limit. Therefore I am constrained to object given what \nthe majority leader has stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Chair, in its capacity as a Senator from the State of Indiana, \nsuggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope to have an opportunity to talk \nabout the economy and agriculture and what is happening in my State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Indiana, reluctantly objects to the Senator's request and \nasks the clerk to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say, Mr. President, I indicated to the Senator from \nMassachusetts that I think we have an agreement worked out in a fair \nway to handle his amendment with regard to minimum wage, but we are \nstill having to work to see if we can get something agreed to on the \nbankruptcy reform bill. I understand that may take some considerable \ntime yet, but Senator Grassley is working on it, as well as Senator \nDurbin and others who have been in contact with the White House.\n  I think a good-faith effort is underway. If it can be worked out in 3 \nhours, that would be magnificent. We would have the vote on Senator \nKennedy's amendment and we could go to the bankruptcy issue and have \nvotes and get this issue completed. If we can't get the agreement \nworked out on bankruptcy reform, then we would have a cloture vote \ntomorrow as is scheduled, and we would go on to other issues. I am sure \nSenator Kennedy will then offer his amendment on something else. That \nis where we are now. Everybody is working in good faith. We will hope \nfor the best.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                         Minimum Wage Amendment\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his explanation. \nAs I mentioned earlier, I am prepared to enter into a reasonable time \nagreement for this amendment. But I do want to give the Senate the \nopportunity to express itself on this amendment because it is of such \nvital importance for so many millions of Americans who depend upon the \nminimum wage for their survival, and who have seen, over the past \nseveral years, a decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage.\n  I will just take a few moments now to continue some of the thoughts \nthat I expressed last evening. I see that Senator Wellstone wants to \naddress some of the needs of his own State. I will not take much of the \nSenate's time now. But I will either take additional time this evening \nwhen the Senate concludes its business, or at other opportunities, \nbecause this is an issue of great importance.\n  Mr. President, I pointed out last night what has happened to the \npurchasing power of those who earn the minimum wage. Even with the \nincrease I propose, which is 50 cents in January of next year and 50 \ncents the following year--even if we are successful, the purchasing \npower of those at the lower economic levels will still be substantially \nlower than it was during the 1960s, 1970s, and the early 1980s.\n  This is at a time of extraordinary economic prosperity--the greatest \nprosperity we have had in this country, with great economic growth, and \nlow inflation, a budget that is balanced, and an increasing surplus. \nThe real issue is: Are we going to reward work? Are we going to say to \nmen and women who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that they are \ngoing to be out of poverty in the most powerful Nation in the world, \nwith the strongest economy in the world? That is something that I \nbelieve is very basic, very fundamental. It is an issue of fairness, \nand an issue that will not go away. That is why those of us who support \nit are going to be persistent in insisting that we are going to have a \nvote on the issue in these next several days. Because we are not \npermitted to have a freestanding bill, we have to use an amendment \nstrategy so the Senate can address this issue. But address it the \nSenate will.\n  Last evening, Mr. President, I pointed out and responded to 2 of the \narguments that are constantly made in opposition to an increase in the \nminimum wage. The first argument is that it adds to the rate of \ninflation. I also pointed out last night that we have the lowest rate \nof inflation of any time when the Senate has considered an increase in \nthe minimum wage since the end of World War II.\n  The second argument is that raising the minimum wage increases \nunemployment. Last night I pointed out that we have the lowest \nunemployment rate of any time we have considered an increase in the \nminimum wage since the end of World War II.\n  These two claims are continually offered by opponents of an increase \nin the minimum wage. But they do not hold water. The facts belie those \nclaims.\n  Other issues have been raised, Mr. President. One was, what will be \nthe impact on small businesses? A recent survey by the Jerome Levy \nInstitute for Economics shows that 90 percent of small businesses said \nthe last increase in the minimum wage had no impact on their hiring or \nemployment decisions. Only one-third of 1 percent said they laid off \nworkers. If the minimum wage were increased to $6 an hour, fewer than 3 \npercent said they would hire fewer employees or lay off existing \nworkers. Over 90 percent said they anticipated no ill effects from such \nincreases.\n  That data has been substantiated by the Small Business \nAdministration, which pointed out that, in 1997 alone, industries \ndominated by small business created 60 percent more jobs than did \nindustries dominated by the large firms. Last year, over 1.2 million \nnew jobs were created in the sectors dominated by small businesses, \nwhich often are those that pay minimum wage to their workers.\n  This data contrasts starkly with the rhetoric from the National \nRestaurant Association, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, and other naysayers. Those groups continue to cry ``wolf'' \nabout the impact of raising the minimum wage. They should ask their \nmembers what really happened after the last increase, before they try \nto feed Senators the same empty arguments.\n  These interest groups do not speak for all small businesses in the \ncountry. 115 small businesses from across the country have joined the \nCampaign for a Fair Minimum Wage. They come from 16 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, and they include restaurants, retail stores, \nbanks, investment firms, publishers and communications companies.\n  These firms understand that raising the minimum wage is good for \nemployers as well as employees. Fair pay for workers improves \nproductivity and reduces turnover. That is extremely important.\n  Another point I want to mention, Mr. President, is what is happening \nto living standards for low-income Americans, including minimum wage \nworkers. Many low wage workers are desperate for this kind of \nassistance. Nationwide, soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless \nshelters are increasingly serving the working poor--not just the \nunemployed. According to a U.S. Conference of Mayors study in 1997, \nrequests for emergency food aid increased in 86 percent of the cities \nsurveyed, and 67 percent of cities cited low-paying jobs as one of the \nmain causes for hunger.\n  Here we have individuals who are making the minimum wage and don't \nearn enough to keep themselves and their children out of soup kitchens. \nThis is powerful evidence about what is happening to the working poor. \nThe purchasing power of these workers has declined, as I discussed last \nnight. This is more dramatic evidence about the significant increase in \nworking poor families who are forced to rely on soup kitchens and \ncharities. This is something that the mayors understand. This is \nsomething the mayors have indicated is of increasing concern to all of \nthem. We have an opportunity to do something about that for families \nwho are making the minimum wage, and that is an additional reason for \nthis increase.\n  Mr. President, we can also look at the effect of the increase that I \nam proposing--the two 50-cent increases that will bring the minimum \nwage to $6.15 in the year 2000. But that amount translates to just \n$5.74 in purchasing power in the year 2000, even if we go ahead.\n  Now, what else is happening to wages in our country? Salaries and \nbonuses paid to executives have never been higher, Mr. President. In \nApril, the Wall Street Journal surveyed executive\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\npay at 350 of the country's largest firms. The median CEO salary and \nbonus in 1997 was $1.6 million, or $770 an hour. The CEO takes less \nthan 2 days to earn what a minimum wage worker earns in a full year.\n  The same groups that complain about an increase in the minimum wage \nare the ones that have made dramatic increases in the payment of their \nofficials, Mr. President. On the one hand, they say, ``We can't afford \nto pay a 50 cent or $1 increase in the minimum wage''; yet, they are \nable to afford millions more in salaries and stock options to their \nexecutives.\n  Over 170 groups have joined the Campaign for a Fair Minimum Wage. \nThey include religious groups, such as the American Friends Service \nCommittee, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the United \nMethodist Board of Church and Society, the United States Catholic \nConference--and dozens more.\n  Women's organizations are also represented: the American Association \nof University Women, the National Committee on Pay Equity, the National \nPartnership for Women & Families, the National Women's Political \nCaucus, the Older Women's League, and many others.\n  Civil rights groups also support the Campaign. These groups and \nothers understand that the minimum wage is a civil rights issue--a \npartial list includes the American-Arab Anti-discrimination Committee, \nthe Asian American Legal Defense Fund, the NAACP, the National Council \nof La Raza, the Rainbow Coalition, the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, and many more.\n  Trade unions have joined the Campaign, too. Virtually every union \nmember earns more than the minimum wage, thanks to union representation \nat the bargaining table. But that hasn't stopped the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, \nthe Communications Workers, the Steel Workers, the Service Employees \nand other unions from strongly supporting this increase. They believe \nthat every working American deserves a decent wage, and they are \nworking hard to achieve that result.\n  Mr. President, we will continue to consider the issues that have been \nraised in past debates on the minimum wage. We are eager to debate \nthese issues on the floor of the U.S. Senate and give the membership an \nopportunity to vote on this issue.\n  As I have mentioned, and will continue to say time in and time out, \nthis is an issue of fundamental fairness and decency. It is a real \nreflection of the kind of values which this institution has.\n  This is a women's issue because the majority of minimum wage workers \nare women.

Mr. President, let me, first of all, say that as we go \ninto this debate--and I am pleased to be joined with Senator Kennedy; I \nhave spoken about the importance of raising the minimum wage--I look \nforward to having the opportunity to debate this with colleagues.\n  I guess I have reached the conclusion--I think this is sort of the \ncommon ground with the Chair--that the best single thing we can do in \nthe Congress, in the House and the Senate, is to do everything we can \nto enable parents to do the best by their kids, or a single parent to \ndo her or his best by children. I really do believe that this means \nmany different kinds of things. But one of them certainly is to try to \nmake sure that people have a living wage. I think it is terribly \nimportant.\n  I think it is a value question. I look forward to the debate. I will \nbe out on the floor with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, and others as \nwell.\n\n\n                         CRISIS IN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment, or for a \nlittle while here, about what is happening in the Midwest. I had \nthought that perhaps this afternoon I would have an opportunity as a \nSenator from Minnesota to join my colleagues from other Midwestern \nStates with an amendment that would speak to the crisis in agriculture. \nThat didn't happen this afternoon.\n  For those who are watching this debate, now that there is an attempt \nto work out an agreement on this bankruptcy bill with a potential \ncloture vote tomorrow, it doesn't look like we will be able to \nintroduce this amendment, at least today. But I do want to just say to \ncolleagues--I know that a number of us will be on the floor tomorrow--\nthat my top priority as a Senator from Minnesota is to bring to the \nfloor of the Senate, with other colleagues, an amendment that would \nreally make a difference in the lives of family farmers in my State.\n  Mr. President, we have an economic convulsion in agriculture. There \nis tremendous economic pain in our rural communities.\n  Many farmers and their families are just leaving their farms now. \nThey are doing it quietly. It is not so much like the mid-1980s where \nyou really saw a lot of farm rallies and marches and whatnot. That may \nhappen. That may not happen. I don't know.\n  I know that when I go to farm gatherings--whether it be in Fulda, MN, \nor in Granite Falls, MN, or Crookston, MN, it is quite unbelievable \nwith the number of people that come.\n  The fact of the matter is that with farmers now receiving somewhere \nlike $1.42 for a bushel of corn, there is just simply no way--or $2.15 \nfor a bushel of wheat--they can't cash-flow.\n  My friend, the Presiding Officer, is from the State of Indiana. And \nhe knows something about this issue.\n  You can be the best manager in the world. You can't make it. If you \nare not a huge conglomerate, then you have more of a family farm \noperation, which really ranges in terms of numbers of acres of land. \nBut the important part of it is that it is entrepreneurship. The people \nthat work the land live there. These are the people that are in the \nmost trouble.\n  For those of us who are from the Midwest--in a way, I approach this \ndebate with a sense of history, because I think in many ways this is \nsort of one of the last regions of the country where you have a family \nfarm structure in agriculture.\n  Mr. President, what I want to say to colleagues, understanding full \nwell that we will not be able to do this on the bankruptcy bill, though \nI must say to my colleague from Iowa, a very good friend, that there is \nunfortunately a very direct correlation between what is happening, as \nhe well knows, to family farms in our State and bankruptcy.\n  If we can't do this amendment that will speak to the farm crisis on \nthe bankruptcy bill, then the very next vehicle that comes to the \nfloor--the very next bill--we absolutely have to have an amendment out \nhere.\n  We may have some different views about what needs to happen. But I \nwill tell you that the amendment that I see which must be brought to \nthe floor first and foremost is we are going to have to remove the caps \non the market assistance loans. We can do other things as well and \nallow a 6-month loan extension. Corn right now is capped at $1.89 a \nbushel. This would get it up to $2.00, $2.20, $2.25. Wheat is capped at \n$2.58. This would get it up to $3.20. This would be the single most \nimportant thing we can do, along with providing indemnity payments that \nwe have all been talking about.\n  We passed this before we went on recess. It is going to have to be \nmore by way of financial assistance, given what is happening to a lot \nof farmers in the South as well, because of weather conditions. And in \nour State, in northwest\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\nMinnesota, it is also scab disease. But we have to do those two things.\n  Mr. President, I want to say to colleagues that I don't feel like \ntime is neutral. In many ways, I feel like as a Senator from Minnesota \nthat I am confronted with the urgency of now. I am trying to say to \nmyself, ``You are here as a Senator. What is the best thing you can \ndo?''\n  We have a bankruptcy bill. We can't put this amendment on the \nbankruptcy bill. But the next bill that comes to the floor next week, \nor the end of this week, we are going to be out here with an amendment \nthat speaks directly to this farm crisis. We have to. It would be like \nnot being a Senator from your State not to do this. I think every \nSenator on this floor, Democrat and Republican, understands this. I \nhope that we will have this amendment in the Chamber no later than the \nbeginning of next week, if not tomorrow, although I am not quite sure \nhow we are going to proceed on this bankruptcy bill. And if not that, \nthere will come a point in time where probably the best thing I can do, \nif we are completely shut out--and I hope this won't happen--will be to \ncome to the floor and filibuster, just basically stop everything.\n\n  I don't think that will happen, but there is no way, there is no \npossible way, that I can go back home to the State of Minnesota and \nlook in the eyes of a lot of people I really love and believe in \nwithout having made an all-out fight. We have only, what, 3 weeks left.\n  So my appeal to colleagues is, look, it is getting hard to find the \ntime to do some of what we think are our priorities. I wanted to see us \nout on the floor with this amendment today. That is not going to be \npossible as we try to work out something on the bankruptcy bill.\n  It is a bitter irony for me to see ``bankruptcy bill.'' My gosh, that \nis what is happening in my State. That is what is happening all across \ngreater Minnesota right now. People cannot make it. We cannot do the \namendment on the bankruptcy bill. But whatever the next bill is, I \nguess at the beginning of next week we will have this amendment out \nhere. I know how strongly Senator Daschle from South Dakota feels about \nthis. This is his State, agriculture. There are other Senators from the \nMidwest who believe just as strongly, Democrats and Republicans.\n  But I just want to say to Minnesota and to my colleagues, there is no \nway in the world that I can see us adjourning without taking action. \nThere is just no way. It would be just impossible to go back into \ngreater Minnesota to meet with people in communities and say, ``Well, \nwe had too busy a schedule. It was too difficult to find a `vehicle'.'' \nNo one knows what you are talking about--vehicles. I said it 5 minutes \nago: ``We are looking for a vehicle.'' No one knows what that means. \nBut just to try to say to people in Minnesota, ``We only had a few \nweeks, and there was too busy a schedule; there were many important \nappropriation bills that we had to pass; there was no way to find the \ntime,'' people would say, ``Aren't we a priority?'' They would say, \n``Paul, aren't we a priority?--$1.40 for a bushel of corn, $2.50, $2.60 \nfor a bushel of wheat. What about us? What about our children? What \nabout our families? What about our communities?''\n  So, again, move the caps on the market assisted loans and allow a 6-\nmonth extension. You have to get the price up. It is price, price, \nprice. There is no substitute for getting the price up. If we can \ndebate this, I don't even want to have an acrimonious debate. Those who \nthought that the Freedom to Farm --which I always called the ``Freedom \nto Fail''--bill was an important piece of legislation, call it a \nmodification, just a modification. We still have a loan rate. We just \ncap it at a very low level. Call it part of what we do by way of \ndisaster relief, by way of emergency assistance, because this is an \nemergency. This is a disaster. The record low prices are a disaster. It \nis an emergency because people are not going to be able to continue to \nstay on their farms.\n  What people are asking for in Minnesota, in my State, is not anything \nmore than a fair shake. They are just saying give us an opportunity to \nhave a decent price in the marketplace.\n  Let me tell you, the grain companies will do just fine, but these \nfamily farmers will not. This ``Freedom to Fail'' bill has been a \ndisaster in and of itself. We have to at least come back and have some \nkind of modification, some kind of safety net, some kind of way that \nfarmers can get a better price. We also have to make sure that we get \nthese indemnity payments out to people. People need the cash assistance \nso they can keep going.\n  Mr. President, those are the two major provisions. There will be \nother provisions as well in an amendment we will bring to the floor, \nbut I cannot see any way to postpone action on an agriculture farm \ncrisis relief amendment any longer.\n  We have been talking about this. Everybody is trying to figure out \nwhat are going to be the electoral connections, how is this going to \nfit into the elections, and so on and so forth. I will tell you, I \nthink those of us from these States don't feel that way; we have to get \nsomething done. I do not think any proposal is credible unless you can \nget the price up. It all starts with getting the price up for family \nfarmers.\n  There is a whole lot going on in Washington right now, I guess. None \nof it should make anybody here, regardless of party, all that happy or \nall that pleased. But I can say without any exaggeration whatsoever, \nbelieve it or not, that in Fulda, MN, or Granite Falls, MN, or \nCrookston, MN, or in all sorts of communities in Minnesota where a lot \nof wonderful people who work so hard live, for them the focus is on \nbeing able to stay on their farm.\n  The focus is whether or not the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives are going to respond to their pain, whether or not we \nare going to provide them with some relief, whether or not we are going \nto do anything about this crisis. It cannot be done in Indiana or \nMinnesota at the State level. You cannot affect price at the State \nlevel. You could put together at the State level some different credit \nrelief packages and all the rest, but you cannot affect the price. You \nhave to remove the cap on the loan rate. You have to get the price up. \nYou have to give these people a chance to get a decent price in the \nmarketplace. You have to do that. First and foremost, you have to do \nthat. We cannot wait any longer.\n  So I don't know whether my words tonight are so much sort of talking \nabout substantively what any number of us are going to bring out as an \namendment--there are a lot of my colleagues in the Midwest I know who \nare going to be out here with this amendment led by Senator Daschle--or \nwhether what I am trying to say is, look, I don't want to have people \nangry at me next week or the week afterwards, but I tell you, if we \ndon't get an opportunity to put this amendment on a piece of \nlegislation, then I am just going to come out here and talk for hours \nand hours and hours. I will just start talking about families, and I \nwill start translating this into terms. I have done it before on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  There is no issue I feel more strongly about. I don't really care how \nmuch is swirling around Washington, DC, and all the other stuff that \npeople are going to be talking about, all of which I know has to be \ndiscussed and talked about, I guess, up to a point, although I think it \nought to be proved. I think ultimately we are all going to have to make \nsome decision about this, so we ought to wait and see what the facts \nare.\n  But I tell you, right now, for me, this is the issue. This is the \nissue for a lot of people all across Minnesota. And I am not just \nsaying it to give a speech. It is just true. They do not have any \nfuture for themselves and their families unless we take some action. We \nare going to have to do that. I feel stymied that we cannot do it on \nthe bankruptcy bill. It seems that there is a very logical connection \nto record low farm prices and bankruptcy. But if not this bill, if not \ntonight, if not Friday, then next week we will bring this amendment to \nthe floor and we will have a debate and we are going to pass a farm \ncrisis relief amendment. And then we are going to get it through the \nHouse. And the House and the Senate are going to agree, and there is \ngoing to be credible, substantive farm crisis relief legislation that \nwill make a difference.\n  If we keep getting shut out and there is just no way to do it by way \nof bills, then I am just going to come out and filibuster.\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10194-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at present, it is our expectation \ntomorrow morning to be voting on cloture on a motion to proceed forward \non S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act. It is my hope that \ntomorrow we will find 60 votes so we might proceed to debate that \nissue. The fact is, we have not had an opportunity here on the floor to \nhave much debate about this motion to proceed, or about the issue \nitself, so I would like to take the time today to begin to acquaint our \ncolleagues with this very vital piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Child Custody Protection Act would protect State \nlaws requiring parental involvement in a minor's important decision \nwhether or not to undergo an abortion.\n  If the minor's home State has a parental involvement law this \nlegislation would make it a Federal offense to transport that minor \nacross State lines to obtain an abortion, unless the parents have been \ninvolved as that law requires, or the requirement has been waived by a \ncourt.\n  By protecting existing State laws this legislation would help protect \nparents' rights and the health and well-being of teen-age girls facing \nunexpected pregnancy.\n  I know, Mr. President, that the abortion issue has been strongly \ndebated in this Chamber and, indeed, throughout our country. But I \nbelieve we all should be able to agree on the need for this \nlegislation. Whatever one's position on the underlying issue of \nabortion, the protection of parental rights, of valid State laws, and \nof our daughters' health and emotional well-being demand that we \nprevent non-parents and non-guardians from circumventing State parental \ninvolvement laws.\n  The rationale behind this legislation is simple, Mr. President: \nStates that choose to institute parental involvement requirements \ndeserve to have those requirements respected.\n  Mr. President, 85 percent of Americans surveyed in a 1996 Gallup poll \nfavored requiring minors to get parental consent for an abortion. \nAmericans quite reasonably believe that no teen should be left to face \nan unexpected pregnancy alone. As the Supreme Court noted in H.L. \nversus Matheson, ``the medical, emotional, and psychological \nconsequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting; this is \nparticularly so when the patient is immature.''\n  I believe the American people share this realization, and also \nrealize that parents are almost always the ones most willing and able \nto provide their daughters with the guidance and support they need in \nmaking the life-changing decision whether or not to undergo an \nabortion.\n  Thus it is not surprising that more than 20 States have instituted \nparental involvement requirements.\n  These laws are on the books. They have been held constitutional, and \nthey have the support of a strong majority of the American people.\n  Unfortunately, parental involvement laws are being circumvented and \nundermined by non-parents and non-guardians taking pregnant, minor \nteens across State lines for secret abortions.\n  This is a significant problem. The abortion rights Center for \nReproductive Law & Policy reports that thousands of pregnant girls are \ntaken across State lines by adults to obtain secret abortions.\n  Indeed, a veritable interstate abortion industry seems to have grown \nup.\n  Abortion clinics in States without parental involvement laws are \nadvertising in States that do have these requirements. The \nadvertisements inform anyone who cares to know that the clinics will \nperform abortions on minors without parental notification or consent.\n  Many people are attracted by these advertisements, and the results \ncan be tragic.\n  During the hearing on this bill, the Judiciary Committee heard from \nJoyce Farley. Mrs. Farley told us how her 12-year-old daughter was \ngiven alcohol, raped, then taken across the State lines, by the \nrapist's mother, for a secret abortion. Understandably, Mrs. Farley was \nof the view that the abortion was undertaken to destroy evidence of her \ndaughter's rape by a 17-year-old neighbor, who committed the act.\n  Mrs. Farley's daughter was understandably frightened and embarrassed. \nShe did not immediately tell her mother of either her rape or her \npregnancy.\n  Her rapist's mother took advantage of this situation. Without telling \nMrs. Farley, she drove the girl from her home in Pennsylvania, which \nhas a parental notification law, to New York, which does not. She took \nthe girl to an abortion clinic, lied on the forms, claiming to be the \ngirl's mother, and waited while the girl underwent an abortion. The \nrapist's mother then dropped Mrs. Farley's daughter off 30 miles from \nher home.\n  This poor girl was bleeding and in pain. When she got home, Mrs. \nFarley asked her what was wrong and eventually was told about the \nabortion. She then called the New York abortion clinic and was told \nthat the pain and bleeding were normal--to be expected. She was told to \nincrease her daughter's medication.\n  Luckily for her daughter, Mrs. Farley is a nurse, so she knew that \nthis advice was dangerously wrong. As it turned out, the abortion was \nincomplete and this young girl, now just 13, had to undergo another \nprocedure to complete the abortion.\n  Mrs. Farley was understandably very upset at what had happened to her \ndaughter. She also was upset at what had, and what had not, been done \nabout it.\n  The man who had gotten her daughter pregnant eventually pleaded \nguilty to statutory rape. But the rapist's mother, who claimed she was \njust ``helping out'' by taking a by-then-13-year-old rape victim across \nState lines for a secret abortion, may receive no punishment at all.\n  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has just accepted for review her \nchallenge of Pennsylvania's prosecution of her under State law. She \ncharges that Pennsylvania exceeded its constitutional authority. \nMoreover, courts, legislators and prosecutors face great difficulty in \nsituations like this because it is unclear which State's laws should \napply.\n  The actions of the rapist's mother were arguably legal in New York, \neven though Pennsylvania has made them illegal within that State. It is \nthis classic conflict of laws problem that the Child Custody Protection \nAct would address.\n  Mr. President, Mrs. Farley deserves better protection than she \ncurrently receives. Her daughter certainly deserves better protection, \nand parents and teens all across America deserve better protection \nagainst this kind of interference in the most important and most \nprivate decisions people can make.\n  Any parent with minor daughters--and I have two of my own--should be \nconcerned about what happened to Mrs. Farley, and especially what \nhappened to her daughter.\n  State parental notification and consent laws exist to protect girls \nfrom predators. They also exist to protect families.\n  Today, any child is at significantly increased risk of drug abuse, \ncrime,\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\npoverty and even suicide. That is why it is crucial that we help States \nthat want to protect the rights of American parents to be involved in \nimportant decisions affecting their children. Only by being a part of \ntheir lives can parents provide their children with the guidance they \nneed and maintain the mutual trust necessary to teach them how to lead \ngood, productive lives.\n  Parents also are almost always the people best able to support their \ndaughters in facing an unexpected pregnancy. Bruce Lucero, a physician \nwho has performed over 45,000 abortions and who also supports this \nlegislation, explains the situation this way:\n\n       Parents are usually the ones who can best help their teen-\n     ager consider her options. And whatever the girls' decision, \n     parents can provide the necessary emotional support and \n     financial assistance.\n\n  What is more, Lucero argues, a girl who avoids telling her parents \nabout her pregnancy too often will wait too long, then have to:\n\n       Turn to her parents to help to pay for a . . . riskier \n     second-trimester abortion. Also, patients who receive \n     abortions at out-of-state clinics frequently do not return \n     for follow-up care, which can lead to dangerous \n     complications. And a teen-ager who has an abortion across \n     state lines without her parents' knowledge is even more \n     unlikely to tell them that she is having complications.\n  This is why we must help States that want to protect families from \nthe consequences of secret abortions. Children must receive parental \nconsent for even minor surgical procedures. Indeed, Mr. President, many \nschools now require parental permission before they will dispense \naspirin to a child.\n  The profound, lasting physical and psychological effects of abortion \ndemand that we protect States that guarantee parental involvement in \nthe abortion decision, and that means seeing to it that outside parties \ncannot circumvent State parental notification and consent laws with \nimpunity.\n  Our families deserve this protection, our State laws deserve this \nprotection, and most especially our daughters deserve the protection \nprovided by the Child Custody Protection Act.\n  I would like at this point to simply outline the provisions of the \nbill.\n  To begin with, the legislation adopts each relevant State's \ndefinition of a minor. It would deem transportation of a minor across \nState lines in order for that minor to obtain an abortion, in \nabridgement of parental rights under a State's parental involvement \nlaw, to be a misdemeanor Federal offense.\n  The legislation defines this abridgement of parental rights as the \nperformance of an abortion on the minor without the parental \ninvolvement that would have been required if that minor had stayed in \nState.\n  The Federal offense applies only to the non-parental, non-guardian \nadult who so transported the minor. The minor who obtained the abortion \nand her parents are specifically exempted from civil and criminal \nliabilities.\n  Further, in this legislation ``parent or legal guardian'' includes an \nindividual standing in loco parentis who has care and control of the \nminor, and with whom the minor regularly resides. In this way the bill \naddresses the situation of children living in the care of their \nrelatives and other unique situations.\n  The legislation also includes as an affirmative defense to the \nmisdemeanor prosecution or civil action, that the defendant reasonably \nbelieved, based on information the defendant obtained directly from a \nparent of the individual or other compelling facts, that the minor had \nobtained appropriate consent or notification.\n  Anyone convicted under this legislation would be subject to a fine or \nimprisonment not to exceed one year, or both.\n  As I have said, Mr. President, this is a narrowly crafted law, \nintended specifically to aid in the enforcement of already existing, \nconstitutionally valid State laws requiring parental involvement, or \njudicial waiver of that requirement, in any minor's decision whether or \nnot to undergo an abortion. It is a modest law that does not seek to \nchange States' underlying laws regarding abortion. It simply seeks to \nsee to it that existing State parental involvement laws are protected \nfrom improper evasion and circumvention.\n  I am aware, however, that there are a number of arguments floating \naround this Chamber and elsewhere against this legislation. It is to \nthese arguments, each and every one of which I believe is clearly \ninaccurate or irrelevant that I would like to turn.\n  First, some people have argued that this legislation is not \nconstitutional on the grounds that it puts an improper, undue burden on \nthe constitutional right to abortion.\n  This is simply not true. The Supreme Court has long upheld most State \nlaws requiring parental involvement in minors' abortions against \nchallenges of this type. The Child Custody Protection Act would only \napply where the State has in place such a constitutional State law. A \nFederal law that simply helps enforce State laws that themselves do not \nviolate the right to an abortion cannot itself violate that right.\n  Continuing on the issue of constitutionality, it has been argued that \nthe Child Custody Protection Act violates the constitutional right to \ntravel.\n  But this argument misconstrues this legislation, the Constitution, \nand the constitutional right to travel. The courts have never held that \nthe right to travel limits Congress's power to regulate interstate \ncommerce.\n  The right to travel limits States' powers to discriminate against \nnewcomers and out-of-State residents.\n  It does not limit Congress' power to protect State laws by \nprohibiting people who would circumvent them from using the channels of \ninterstate commerce or travel.\n  Presumably that is why nobody has doubted the constitutionality of \nthe recently enacted Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, which makes it a \nfelony for anyone to travel in interstate or foreign commerce with \nintent to evade a support obligation to a child or spouse. Like the \nChild Custody Protection Act, it is constitutional because Congress is \nfree to withdraw the channels of interstate travel from those seeking \nto evade valid State laws.\n  Next, at a level only one step removed from constitutional issues, \nsome have put forward the argument that this legislation would \nundermine the ability of States to serve as ``laboratories of \ndemocracy'' in our Federal system.\n  What this argument overlooks is that in a Federal system there will \nalways be conflicts between the laws of different States.\n  And Congress has a responsibility to help resolve these conflicts in \nthe interests of interstate commerce, and in the interest of \nmaintaining fair and full application of the laws.\n  What is more, it makes sense to handle the problem in this way \nbecause these conflicts are frequently resolved in favor of application \nof the law of the State of residence over the law of the State where \nsome part of the conduct at issue has occurred.\n  In particular, it has long been an accepted tenet of our Federal \nsystem that the State with primary policy making authority with respect \nto parent-child relations is the State where the parent and child \nreside. The Child Custody Protection Act essentially simply reinforces \nthis well-established rule.\n  Finally, I have heard from a number of sources the complaint that \nthis legislation is unfair because it would not allow grandparents or \nother close relatives to stand-in for absent or abusive parents.\n  Frankly, I find this complaint somewhat puzzling because there is \nnothing in the Child Custody Protection Act that in any way interferes \nwith the proper role of grandparents and other close relatives in any \nchild's upbringing.\n  Parents, close relatives and, I might add, close friends, can and \nshould play a role in helping minor girls face an event as important as \nan unexpected pregnancy.\n  If the pregnant girl for some reason, including abuse, cannot talk to \nher parents on her own, her other relative or friend should help her go \nthrough her State's procedure for bypassing parental notification, or, \nif it is possible, intervene on her behalf with the parents.\n  In this way, caring relatives can make a positive difference in a \ngirl's life.\n  Like most Americans, I firmly believe that most children would be \nlucky to have grandparents and other close relatives involved in their \nlives. But I do not believe that most parents would want other \nrelatives to unilaterally take over their primary role in raising their \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\n  In my view, States with parental involvement laws were wise to have \nenacted them, for the sake of parental rights, and especially for the \nsake of our daughters' health. The legislation before us fulfills the \nFederal Government's duty to protect these State laws from widespread \ncircumvention through interstate travel. Far from undermining our \nFederal system, it upholds it in a manner fully consistent with the \nconstitutional rights of everyone involved.\n  A number of politicians, including President Clinton, have promised \nthe American people that they would work to make abortions ``safe, \nlegal and rare.''\n  The Child Custody Protection Act addresses an important question of \nlegality. It will protect State laws from those who would break them. \nIt would uphold the rule of law and the important role States and State \nlaws play in our Federal system.\n  But an abortion conducted in violation of parental notification laws \nis not legal, even if performed in another State.\n  Earlier I quoted Bruce Lucero, a doctor who once owned an abortion \nclinic, in which he performed some 45,000 abortions over the course of \n15 years.\n  Dr. Lucero remains, in his words ``staunchly pro-choice.'' Dr. Lucero \nalso supports this legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the abortion issue will \nheed the warning he gave recently when he said:\n\n       Too often, pro-choice advocates oppose laws that make \n     common sense simply because the opposition supports or \n     promotes them. The only way we can and should keep abortions \n     legal is to keep them safe. To fight laws that would achieve \n     this end does no one any good--not the pregnant teen-agers, \n     the parents or the pro-choice movement.\n\n  Mr. President, this laws does make common sense. It will protect the \nhealth of pregnant teen-agers, and it should have the full support of \nthe Members of this body, whatever their views on the underlying issue \nof abortion. It was passed in the other Chamber by an overwhelming \nmargin. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and, in my view, it \ndeserves to pass by a similar margin in the full Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote tomorrow in support of cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to debate this issue.\n  In closing, let me just say this, Mr. President. As I looked through \nthe Congressional Record at the summation and discussion between the \nmajority leader and Democratic leader yesterday, I was a little bit \nconfused. I at least read the Democratic leader's statement to suggest \nhe is of the opinion that the vote tomorrow might in some way shut off \nconsideration of amendments and debate on this issue, but that is not \nthe case, and I want to make sure our colleagues are aware that \ntomorrow's vote is simply on the motion to proceed, to permit us to \nbegin discussing this legislation.\n  It is not a motion for cloture on the substantive underlying bill \nand, indeed, virtually all of the amendments to this legislation that \nwere brought in committee will still survive a motion for cloture on \nthe underlying bill because they were germane amendments at that time \nand would, according to the Parliamentarian, remain germane, even if we \nwere to have cloture invoked on the substantive legislation.\n  For that reason, I hope our colleagues will think this issue--the \nquestion of whether or not we will allow strangers to circumvent State \nparental notification and consent laws and take children across State \nlines for the purpose of secretive abortions--that we should at least \nallow this issue to be debated here in the Senate.\n  For that reason, I hope we will be able to invoke cloture on the \nlegislation. And once we do that, we can have a good and thorough \ndebate and discussion, and then pass this legislation so that families \nlike the Farley family can be protected in the future and so that the \nchildren of America can be protected in the future and so that the \nfamilies who live in States that have taken the action of passing \nparental involvement laws can be confident that those laws do mean \nsomething and that we in Washington are willing to support those laws \nand make sure that those laws are in fact enforceable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10196-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10198-S10201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        STATUS OF OPERATIONAL READINESS OF U.S. MILITARY FORCES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, only 8 years ago we went to war in the \nPersian Gulf as the most combat-ready force in the world. The value of \nthat preparedness was clear. We won a massive victory in a few weeks \nover one of the largest armies in the world and we did so with \nremarkably few American and allied casualties. We were able to end \naggression with minimum losses of civilian life and were even able to \ngreatly reduce the casualties of our enemy. Today, our enormous \npreparedness, impressive military force, is beginning to evaporate.\n  In spite of the efforts of our services, armed services, we are \nhaving significant problems again that remind me of the very difficult \nperiod during the 1970s when the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army came \nbefore the Congress and said we had a ``hollow army.'' We are losing \nthe combat readiness and edge that is an essential aspect of \ndeterrence, defense, and the ability to repel aggression.\n  It is true that we have heard many reassuring words to the contrary \nfrom the administration. The fact is, however, that we are ``going \nhollow.'' We are losing our ability to get there ``fastest with the \nmostest,'' and the indicators are all too clear the moment we look \nbeyond superficial indicators and the normal rhetoric of budget \ntestimony.\n  Mr. President, I have heard firsthand accounts from commanders in the \nfield and in the fleet on the deteriorating status of the operational \nreadiness of the U.S. military forces, including the availability of \nresources and training opportunities necessary to meet our national \nsecurity requirements. Although the upcoming year's budget makes some \nstrides to reverse 5 straight years of underfunding for both short-term \nand long-term modernization, I have serious concerns about the future \nstate of preparedness of our units and our men and women in the \nmilitary.\n  The tangible evidence of this trend is contained in the words of \nnearly all the military witnesses who have testified this past year \nbefore the Senate Committee on Armed Services as well as before our \nHouse counterparts. Their statements do not reveal a single reason why \nwe are going hollow or a single set of answers as to how these problems \ncan be solved.\n  Each service has a unique mix of readiness problems and has made \ndifferent tradeoffs. At its core, however, is an alarming lack of \nconcern on the part of the administration that repeatedly acts without \nregard for the most basic requirements for maintaining Armed Forces \nessential for our national security and promoting our national \ninterests. The repeated and deliberate failure to match requirements, \nas set forth by the National Command Authority, with resources adequate \nto the task, compounded by the White House's unwillingness to budget \nfor ongoing contingency peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, has \nover time clearly degraded military preparedness.\n  Not to be ignored is the role of Congress in exacerbating this \nsituation through its exceedingly damaging practice of wasting scarce \nfinancial resources on programs for strictly parochial reasons. That \npractice was harmful when we were adding to the administration's budget \nrequest in the context of the 1997 balanced budget agreement. And that \nharm is magnified manyfold.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken many times of the wasteful spending \npractices embodied in the defense appropriations bill, and I will not \ngo through the details again now. But the fact is that a lack of a Base \nClosing Commission commitment, the lack of a commitment to a balanced \nforce, the continued unnecessary and unneeded funding for especially \nour Guard resources, and our inability to somehow make the transition \nto the post-cold-war requirements of a military that is ready to move \nanyplace in the world on short notice, is absolutely deplorable. And as \nI indict the administration, Mr. President, the Congress also bears \nenormous responsibility for our failure as well.\n  In spite of the highest readiness funding in our history, we are \nhaving preparedness and readiness difficulties. Some recent examples \nnoted by experts\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\nare--and I quote a memorandum dated August 20, 1998, from General \nBramlett, Commander-in-Chief of Forces Command, to Army Chief of Staff \nGeneral Reimer. General Bramlett wrote:\n\n       . . . we can no longer train and sustain the force, stop \n     infrastructure degradation, and provide our soldiers the \n     quality of life programs critical to long term readiness of \n     the force . . . we cannot operate within current funding \n     levels and have the viable fighting force we want to project \n     into the next century. Operation and maintenance funding \n     levels are no longer sufficient to ``make it happen'' and \n     avoid serious long-term negative impacts to the force. \n     Commanders of Fort Lewis, Stewart, and Bragg [all \n     installations home to major contingency ``first-to-deploy'' \n     units] report units will drop below authorized training \n     levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. This \n     threatens our ability to mobilize, deploy, fight, and win. \n     Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability to accomplish \n     its mission at an unacceptable risk.\n\n  Mr. President, let me repeat: ``Current funding levels place \nFORSCOM's ability to accomplish its mission at an unacceptable risk.'' \nMr. President, I want to remind you, these are not my words but the \nwords of General Bramlett who is the Commander-in-Chief of Forces \nCommand and contained in a memorandum to the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy.\n\n       Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability to \n     accomplish its mission at an unacceptable risk.\n       We must have additional funding for FY 99 and beyond.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire memorandum \nfrom General Bramlett to General Reimer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Army, Headquarters United States Army \n           Forces Command,\n\n                  Fort McPherson, GA, August 20, 1998.\n\n Memorandum for Chief of Staff, United States Army, 200 Army Pentagon, \n                             Washington, DC\n\n\n                   subject: fy 99 funding assessment\n\n       1. The FORSCOM commanders have recently completed their \n     review of resource requirements against their FY 99 funding \n     distribution. My guidance was to maintain training (go-to-\n     war) readiness at the expense of infrastructure and Quality \n     of Life (QOL) if they could not balance the requirements of \n     all three. They have done their best to implement this \n     guidance, but we can no longer train and sustain the force, \n     stop infrastructure degradation, and provide our soldiers the \n     QOL programs critical to long term readiness of the force. \n     Commanders remain fully committed to supporting force \n     readiness, but we cannot operate within current funding \n     levels and have the viable fighting force we want to project \n     into the next century.\n       2. We can provide trained and ready units in FY 99, but we \n     anticipate some drop in reported readiness levels as the year \n     progresses. Our BASOPS accounts have only marginal funding \n     levels, and Real Property Maintenance (RPM) accounts are \n     nearly depleted at many of our installations. The OMA funding \n     levels are no longer sufficient to ``make it happen'' and \n     avoid serious long-term negative impacts to the force. These \n     insufficient funding levels are further degraded by refined \n     TRM cost factors, by the inability to achieve the programmed \n     efficiencies, and by the increased funding for contracting \n     support. Our flexibility is further hampered by stovepipe \n     funding for specific programs that have become a larger \n     percentage or our total budget.\n       3. Despite considerable efforts to conserve scarce training \n     resources at the expense of QOL and infrastructure, unit \n     readiness will be degraded. Commanders at Forts Lewis, \n     Stewart, and Bragg report units will drop below ALO in the \n     fourth quarter of FY 99. This threatens our ability to \n     mobilize, deploy, fight, and win.\n       4. In FY 98, we mortgaged infrastructure and QOL to \n     maintain training readiness. BASOPS and RPM were underfunded \n     again, but with little migration ($18M) as we needed every \n     dollar for training. Infrastructure maintenance and repair \n     are now funded below survival levels. FY 99 marks the second \n     consecutive year in which FORSCOM could not fund installation \n     infrastructure repair beyond ``break and fix.'' The most \n     critical unfunded repairs totaling $215M are: sewer and \n     utility systems--$49M; barracks roofing/heading/and air \n     conditioning repair--$59M; roofs on maintenance and ammo \n     facilities--$10M; bridges and roads--$29M; training and \n     operations facilities repairs--$7M; and other general \n     facility repair projects--$60M. Of immediate concern is our \n     inability to resource food service contracts which drives us \n     to the associated alternative of possibly returning our \n     soldiers to perform kitchen and dining facility attendant \n     duties. Base Information management operations, the DOIMs, \n     were hit especially hard. This account is down more than 30 \n     percent from FY 98, severely affecting base automation, \n     printing, and automation equipment accounts. Commanders state \n     that shortfalls will ``render infrastructure, QOL, and \n     BASOPS(-) non-mission capable.''\n       5. We fully understand that many of our unfunded \n     requirements can only be realized with an increase in the \n     overall funding level for the Department, and we continue to \n     advocate that goal. As part of our assessment, we have \n     identified those UFRs requiring funding by way of Funding \n     Letter inserts as well as other critical UFRs to be worked \n     through the year of execution. Those items requiring \n     additional funds within our funding letter include: Food \n     Services and Dining Facility Operations--$10.1M; AC/RC \n     Support--$15.6M; AC/ARNG Integrated Divisions--$4.1M; Digital \n     Training--$18.5M; Force Modernization--$18.6M; and Commercial \n     Activities Studies--$3.2M.\n       6. Our Executive Agent role in the DCSC4 areas demands \n     intense management as we act on the Army's behalf. To \n     resource the requirements of these missions in FY 99 will \n     require: an additional $26.3M in funding letter inserts for \n     Long Haul Commo; $14.1M for sustainment of the new Command \n     and Control Protect mission; and $1.7M for support of the \n     Defense Red Switch Network. In addition, we request that \n     Europe's portion be provided to them as was done in the POM.\n       7. AC/RC Support (Training Support XXI) continues to be \n     significantly underfunded as we transition into the new \n     Support to Operational Training Functional Area Assessment \n     (SOT-AA) Integrated alternative structure. This structure \n     will be fully staffed in FY 99 after a ramp-up year in FY 98. \n     The funding requirement is inherently heavy in TDY, as \n     observer/controllers/evaluators and other training \n     assistance personnel must travel to the associated RC \n     units and training sites. We are concerned about our \n     ability to fully perform this growing mission. In \n     addition, the new AC/ARNG Integrated Divisions that will \n     begin to stand up provisionally on 1 October 1998 are \n     unfunded in FY99. These shortages are particularly acute \n     in the context of our stated commitment to the Total Army.\n       8. As we move toward fielding a digitized force, we need \n     resources for robust digital training events and associated \n     training infrastructure upgrades. Funding tails become major \n     cost drivers as the Army moves from Advanced Warfighting \n     Experiments (AWE) and applique to equipping and training the \n     digitized force. Insufficient funding continues to delay \n     modernization of many training support facilities. The TRM \n     process needs to better resource training support \n     infrastructure such as ranges, simulation facilities, \n     transportation networks to/from/in and around ranges, \n     targetry, and maneuver boxes.\n       9. My assessment is not good news. Funding has fallen below \n     the survival level in FY 99. The commanders are concerned \n     that they can not meet the daily challenges of the three \n     imperatives of readiness: training, QOL, and infrastructure. \n     Our commitment to doing our part in reengineering, creative \n     training strategies, and best business practices has never \n     been stronger. Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability \n     to accomplish its mission at an unacceptable risk. We must \n     have additional funding for FY 99 and beyond.\n\n                                            David A. Bramlett,\n\n                                                     General, USA,\n                                                       Commanding.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. He ends up by saying:\n\n       My assessment is not good news. Funding has fallen below \n     the survival level in FY 99. The commanders are concerned \n     that they cannot meet the daily challenges of the three \n     imperatives of readiness: Training, QOL [meaning quality of \n     life], and infrastructure. Our commitment to doing our part \n     in reengineering, creative training strategies, and best \n     business practices has never been stronger. Current funding \n     levels place FORSCOM's ability to accomplish its mission at \n     an unacceptable risk.\n\n  It is a very, very strong statement, Mr. President. I have been \nassociated with the military all my life, and I have not seen quite \nthat strong a statement or a stronger statement than that from one of \nour commanders in the field.\n  The Air Force's 1st Fighter Wing, with primary responsibility for the \nMiddle East, has experienced a prolonged period of declining \npreparedness, as squadrons are forced to deploy at physically and \nmentally exhausting rates while spare parts shortages result in the \ncannibalization of fighters from one squadron to ensure another can \ndeploy on schedule.\n  Naval aviators have stated to Armed Services Committee members and \nstaff that the frequency of deployments has placed excessive stress on \ntheir personal lives, with the result that many are leaving the service \nfor higher paying, less stressful jobs with the commercial airlines. \nThat operational tempo is a direct result of the convergence of \nshrinking force structure and increased deployments to overseas \ncontingencies.\n  The commander of the 3rd Fleet, Vice Adm. Herbert Browne, testified \nbefore the Readiness Subcommittee that the shortage of skilled \npersonnel has resulted in crossdecking, which places enormous \nadditional stress on those\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\npersonnel remaining in the service. ``Crossdecking,'' Mr. President, \nmeans when a ship comes back from a deployment, the personnel of that \nship, rather than being allowed to come home, then move to another ship \nthat is headed out on another deployment--an absolutely unacceptable \npractice.\n  During the same hearing, the commander of an Air Force fighter wing \noperations group testified that his unit's full mission capable rates \nhave consistently dropped from 90 percent in 1993, to 80 percent in the \n1995 time frame, down to 70 percent for the present.\n  Radar and jet engine mechanics told ABC News reporters of their \ngrowing frustration with shortages of spare parts to repair aircraft \nand of the exodus from the service of skilled mid-level maintenance \npeople, with the result that aircraft sit idle and less skilled \npersonnel are assigned vital maintenance and repair work. On the same \nbroadcast, the commander of Air Combat Command stated that his command \nhas ``suffered about a 10 percent to 12 percent decline in the average \nreadiness of our fleet from day-to-day.''\n  In a June 1998 letter from Admiral M.G. Mullen, Director of Surface \nWarfare Division on the Chief of Naval Operations staff wrote to every \nsurface warfare commanding officer soliciting ideas to turn around \nretention amongst surface warfare junior officers. In his letter he \nwrote, ``I can also tell you we are only retaining about 1 in 4 and we \nmust keep 1 in 3 to develop the leaders our Navy needs.''\n  In a San Diego Union-Tribune article on September 2, 1998 during an \ninterview with Admiral Clemins, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific \nFleet, it was reported that the Navy is short 18,000 sailors, forcing \nthe Navy to send many warships including carriers to the Persian Gulf \nat a reduced level of readiness, specifically a C-2 rating, only the \nsecond highest level of readiness.\n  According to a 1998 article in the Army Times, the mission of the \nArmy has increased by 300 percent since 1989, yet its active duty force \nhas declined by 36 percent and its budget by 40 percent. These facts \nhave resulted in a severe decrease in the level of operational \nreadiness for the service and led former Assistant Vice-Army Chief of \nStaff of the Army Lieutenant General Jay Garner to describe divisions \nas ``hollow.''\n  Colonel Stephen E. Bozarth, Commander of the 388th Operations Group, \ntestified before the Readiness Subcommittee that although the current \nexperience level of the pilots of the Wing is 77 percent, it is \nexpected to degrade over the next 18 months to approximately 50 \npercent. Such a loss in experience results in not only untrained \npersonnel fulfilling necessary pilot positions but also an inadequate \nnumber of people to train these individuals. Moreover these losses \nnecessitate that pilots who choose to remain in the service work longer \nand harder hours, thus creating a serious strain on morale.\n  Vice Admiral Browne also testified this year that inadequate fuel \nsupplies are depriving pilots of strike fighter jets the flight hour \ntraining necessary for familiarization of the aircraft. Lack of such \ntraining will result in the substandard performance of these men and \nwomen in the multi-threat environment in which they currently operate.\n  The commander of the Air Warfare Center (AWFC), Major General Marvin \nEsmond, testified before the Readiness Subcommittee that those under \nhis command have experienced a six month slip in skill improvement due \nto delays in specialized training. Such delays are a direct consequence \nof a lack of manpower. This loss in personnel has also required that \nthe servicemen and women work 60-65 hours per week as well as 12 hour \nduty shifts.\n  Major General Ronald Richard, Commanding General of the Marine Corps \nAir Ground Combat Center, voiced concerns over equipment readiness to \nthe Readiness Subcommittee. According to the general, a majority of his \nequipment is ``getting exceedingly old,'' a fact which has led to \nincreased maintenance as well as excessive expenditure.\n  In order to understand the issues involved, it is necessary to \nunderstand just how difficult it is to achieve the level of military \npreparedness we enjoyed during Desert Storm. Military preparedness is \nthe product of readiness and sustainability, the former referring to \nthe ability of forces to go to war on short notice, the latter the \nability to support them in the field. Preparedness is not just a matter \nof funding operations and maintenance at the proper level. It is not \nonly a matter of funding adequate numbers of high quality personnel. It \nis not simply a matter of funding superior weapons and munitions, \nstrategic mobility and prepositioning, high operating tempos, realistic \nlevels of training at every level of combat, or logistics and support \ncapabilities.\n  Military preparedness is all these things and more. A force begins to \ngo hollow the moment it loses its overall mix of combat capabilities in \nany one critical area. Our technological edge in Desert Storm would \nhave been meaningless if we did not have properly trained men and \nwomen. Having the best weapons system platforms in the world would not \nhave given us our victory if we had not had the right command and \ncontrol facilities, maintenance capabilities, and munitions.\n  The preparedness problem within the military is compounded by both \nthe ``can do'' attitude of the military and the history of military \nreadiness reporting. On the one hand, our men and women in uniform have \na history of making do, of adjusting to civilian decisions, and working \nout potential solutions even at the cost of assuming higher risks. An \nexample of this is the continued practice of the Marine Corps to \nretread the tires of the humvees (HMMVV's) and five-ton trucks of the \nFirst and Second Marine Expeditionary Forces.\n  On the other, we have been very slow to modernize and integrate our \nvarious measures of effectiveness, to independently audit command \nreporting, and to adopt modern management information systems. Time and \nagain, we have learned that our readiness measures are unrealistic or \nfail to anticipate real-world demands on readiness funds and budget \ncuts. Time and again, we have seen peacetime claims of ``can do'' turn \ninto wartime realities of ``can't fight.''\n  Mr. President, in mid-July I sent letters to each of the Service \nChiefs expressing my concern about the military's overall state of \nreadiness. In order that I might gain a better understanding of current \nreadiness and readiness trends in the military, I asked each Service \nChief to provide detailed answers to questions by September 30, 1998, \nfrom all levels within the military and not just the typical Pentagon \ntalk that we have become used to during the multitude of hearings that \nsurround the defense budget cycle. In addition, I requested that the \nresponses to the questions also include an assessment of National Guard \nand Reserve readiness. Mr. President, I intend to share these answers \nwith my colleagues and make them widely available to the public. It is \ncritical that not only Members of Congress, but all Americans should be \nfully informed on the state of our military so that they can \nparticipate in any discussions in the near future to add money to the \ndefense budget and reprioritize critical resources within the military.\n  Very often, those who question the Administration's commitment to \nmaintaining proper levels of military preparedness are accused of \nexaggerating the scale of the problem through the random marshaling of \nanecdotal information. These criticms, to say the least, are without \nmerit. If a pattern of evidence cannot be seen as leading to a logical \nconclusion, then the basis for rational, objective intellectual \ndiscourse is thoroughly discredited. This ``anecdotal evidence'' \nincreases every year, is discovered through visits to the field to meet \nwith military personnel of all ranks, through congressional hearings, \nmedia reports and scholarly studies, and is beyond dispute.\n  My President, this will be as true in the future as it was during \nDesert Storm, and it has been true throughout the history of warfare. \nAs Sun Tzu pointed out over 2,000 years ago, ``It is a doctrine of war \nnot to assume the enemy will not come, but rather to rely on one's \nreadiness to meet him. It is a doctrine of war not to presume that he \nwill not attack, but rather to make one's self invincible.''\n  I make those statements concerning military readiness in the context \nof what is happening in the world today.\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\n When you glance around the globe you find that there is a potential \ntrouble spot in literally every continent of the world with the \nexception of the two poles and perhaps Australia. We find this \nsituation in Kosovo with ethnic cleansing where our Secretary of State, \nseveral months ago said, and I believe the quote is accurate, ``We will \nnot allow the Serbs to do in Kosovo what we prevented them from doing \nin Bosnia.'' The last time I checked, Mr. President, they were doing \nquite a bit of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and the situation continues \nto worsen.\n  In Iraq, we have gone from a position where our Secretary of State \nsaid we would respond with military force if Saddam Hussein refused to \nallow our U.N. inspectors access to any installation that they \ndesired--would be met with military force. Now, according to Scott \nRitter and other reports, the administration has been encouraging \nUNSCOM not to inspect.\n  The situation in Asia is serious. Riots are taking place in Indonesia \nas we speak. The nation that the World Bank a year and a half ago did a \nstudy on as a model nation for economic development, now had the \nprivilege of seeing its President go on nationwide television in \nIndonesia and recommended that the Indonesian people not eat 2 days a \nweek because of food shortages.\n  We have seen the administration surprised by the nuclear tests \nconducted by both India and Pakistan.\n  We have now apparently circumstantial evidence that technology was \ntransferred to China, which either marginally or substantially, \ndepending on which expert you talk to, increased the precision \ntargeting capability of Russian ICBMs until recently, 12 of which were \ntargeted on the United States of America--now are not--but in a matter \nof seconds could be retargeted.\n  Mr. President, I could go on. But the fact is that the world is a \nvery tough neighborhood and requires a tough cop. The cop is now not on \nthe beat and bad things are happening all over the world, which makes \nit even more likely that we may have to call upon the United States of \nAmerica to again expend its blood and treasure somewhere in the world. \nThe very least we can do is make sure that those men and women who we \nhave to send somewhere are the best equipped and trained as we possibly \ncan make them. What I greatly fear is that we may have to send them \nless than well prepared, less than ready, and less than well equipped, \nwhich then leads to the inevitable consequence of casualties that are \nunnecessary and tragic.\n  Mr. President, I intend to talk more on this issue. I think it is an \nimportant one. I also remind my colleagues that we--the traditional \nprotectors of the military--have an obligation to address this issue as \nwell as the administration. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his \npatience and for presiding at this late hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of Senator \nMcCain from Arizona. He is a true American patriot, an academy \ngraduate, a former fighter pilot, a prisoner of war, a person who has \nbeen a leader in this body in matters of defense.

He \nhas said some things, as a conscience of this body, on defense matters \nthat we ought to listen to, and I am hearing it repeatedly from people \nI know in the military services who are concerned about the erosion of \nour national defense. I join with him in those concerns. I appreciate \nhim sharing it with us, and I hope he will continue to speak out in \nthis body as eloquently as he does on these important issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10201-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10201-S10202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Child \nCustody Protection Act. Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan has \npreviously spoken on this matter, just a few minutes ago. I have been \nhonored to be a cosponsor of that legislation with him from the \nbeginning and to participate in a number of different activities that \nhe has led to try to call this legislation to the attention of the \npeople of America, and to do what we can to see that it is brought up \nfor a vote in this body, and to pass this legislation.\n  It appears to me that this legislation would be difficult for most \nanybody to oppose. The issue of abortion has divided our country for \nmany years now. But the issue we are considering today is not whether \nabortion should be legal or not. The Supreme Court, in my opinion, \nerroneously took that issue away from the people, ripped it out as a \nmatter for the democratic process, and decided and declared that the \nConstitution prohibits the limiting of abortions, except in certain \ncircumstances.\n  But even the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is proper for a \nState to declare that an abortion should not be performed on a minor \nchild unless the parents are consulted. Certainly, they have to be \nconsulted about minor surgery--and they are consulted by their school \nprincipals and teachers if they are even given Tylenol. To perform an \nabortion without parental consent is a very dramatic interference in \nfamily and parental relationships that many States have decided to \nprotect. Even our Supreme Court, which has ruled erroneously, in my \nopinion, in a number of different ways on this issue, has approved \nthat.\n  We have now discovered that there is a problem. We have discovered \nthat people are taking children across State lines, from one State \nwhere parents have to be notified--third parties are intervening in the \nfamily relationship and are taking children across to another State \nthat doesn't have that law, for the purpose of having an abortion \nperformed on them.\n  In my view, the right of parents to be involved in these major \ndecisions affecting their minor children is a fundamental thing and \nought not to be lightly transgressed. State parental consent and \nnotification statutes are an important protection for fundamental \nparental rights. Let me say that the issue before us today is not \nwhether States should have such laws--some do, some don't--the issue \nbefore us today is whether we will allow these important and clearly \nconstitutional State laws to be circumvented.\n  The purpose of this bill is simply to preclude some third party from \ntrampling on the rights of parents by advising a minor child to have an \nabortion, and then assisting them by taking them across a State line to \na State where they can have one.\n  This legislation before us today would forbid a third party from \ntransporting a minor child across the State line for the purpose of an \nabortion, without the parent's knowledge or consent, in order to evade \ncompliance with the law of the State where the parent and child reside. \nThis is hardly a radical or extreme proposal, and the bill is \nnecessary. It is constitutional and it is carefully and narrowly drawn.\n  Senator Abraham has done a superb job in drafting this legislation. \nHe has listened to those who have expressed concerns about it, and he \nhas constantly revised and improved it. It is an exceptionally fine \npiece of legislation, in my opinion.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I believe this bill is necessary. In \nthe Judiciary Committee hearing we had, we heard horrible stories. One \ninvolved Joyce Farley's 13-year-old daughter and one involved Eileen \nRoberts' 14-year-old daughter. In both cases, these young girls were \nsecretly transported across the State line by adults seeking to hide \nthe fact of the pregnancy from the children's parents. In both of these \ncases, these young girls were taken from a State that had a parental \nconsent statute to one that did not. In both of these cases, the young \ngirls suffered serious complications from these legal, but botched, \nabortions.\n  Parenthetically, Mr. President, let me state that recently in the New \nYork Times there was an op-ed piece by a former abortion doctor who, \naccording to the first paragraph in the article,\n\n[[Page S10202]]\n\nhad performed 45,000 abortions. He said that, for a number of reasons, \nparents ought to be involved in these decisions, and that parental \nnotification laws are correct, and that the pro-abortion forces \nundermine their own efforts and their credibility when they oppose \nthem. He pointed out that children should be consulting with their \nfamilies for these kinds of situations.\n  And from a medical point of view, he pointed out that when a child is \ntransported a long distance to a medical center to have an abortion, \nperhaps she has not had good adult advice as to whether or not that is \na good doctor or clinic. When she goes there, she is then returned at a \nlong distance to the home of her parents. Many times, he noted, there \nare complications. Parents need to be aware and to be watching the \nchild to help her if complications occur. And he said return visits to \nthe abortion clinic for checkups are little done when a child has a \nlong distance to go back to the clinic. So for health and medical \nreasons, he believes that children ought to consult with and have the \napproval of their parents before they obtain abortions. Of course the \nlaws of each of those States--and the Supreme Court rulings--require \nthat there be an option for a child who is pregnant to go to court and \nget an order for an abortion without notifying a parent. So there is an \noption, required by the Supreme Court decisions.\n\n  Mrs. Farley testified that her daughter was taken out of state for an \nabortion by one Rosa Marie Hartford. Ms. Hartford was actually the \nmother of the 18-year-old young man whose statutory rape of the then-\n12-year-old girl is what caused the pregnancy. In other words, the \nwoman was trying to cover up the criminal activity of her son. The son \nlater pled guilty to statutory rape.\n  The attorney general for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania testified \nconcerning his efforts to prosecute Mrs. Hartford under state law for \ninterfering with the custody of a minor. Those efforts may or may not \nultimately prove successful. Attorney General Fischer testified \nconcerning the difficulties of pursuing such a case under state law, \nand strongly recommended passage of this bill.\n  This issue does not involve a few isolated cases. An attorney for the \nCenter for Reproductive Law and Policy, has acknowledged this. Attorney \nKathryn Kolbert stated, and I quote: ``There are thousands of minors \nwho cross state liens for an abortion every year and who need \nassistance from adults to do that.'' We have seen several examples of \nabortion clinics which openly place advertisements in the yellow pages \nin nearby states that have parental consent statutes. These \nadvertisements proudly proclaim: ``No parental consent.''\n  Thus, these clinics are openly encouraging the evasion of state laws, \nand something needs to be done about it. Because of the interstate \nnature of this problem, a Federal solution is required.\n  This bill is constitutional. As I have stated earlier, the Supreme \nCourt has upheld the types of state parental notification and consent \nlaws that this bill would help to bolster. It is specious to suggest \nthat this bill would unduly burden the right to an abortion. The bill \ndoes nothing more than prohibit the evasion of constitutional state \nstatutes.\n  This bill is a valid and appropriate exercise of Congress's authority \nunder the Commerce Clause.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor, Mr. President, for nearly 15 years. A \nlong-term Federal statute is the Mann Act. It has for many years--many \nyears back, I think, since 1913--prohibited the interstate \ntransportation of women or girls across State lines for prostitution or \nother immoral purposes. That is a Federal law. The constitutionality of \nthe Mann Act has been upheld by the Supreme Court since the early \n1900s. It is a very close analogy to the Child Custody Protection Act, \nwhich would preclude the transporting of minor girls across State lines \nto evade State parental involvement laws. Any constitutional objections \nto this bill, in my opinion, would be without merit and would certainly \nfail.\n  Also, this bill is very narrow in its scope. It does not prohibit \ninterstate abortions. It does not invalidate any state laws. It does \nnot establish a right to parental consent for residents of any state \nthat does not already have a parental consent law. It doesn't even \nattempt to regulate the activities of the pregnant minor herself. It \nonly reaches the conduct of outside parties who wrongfully usurp the \nrights of parents that are guaranteed by state law.\n  Some suggest that the bill should be narrowed further, to exempt the \ninterference with parental rights, if the adult is a relative of the \nchild, they could interfere with the parents' rights. I would disagree \nwith that.\n  This bill would not prevent the minor from seeking counsel from an \naunt or grandmother or anyone else. It would prohibit aunts and \ngrandmothers from violating the rights of the child's parents by \nsecretly driving the youngster to another state for an abortion without \ntelling the parents. I personally wonder whether it might be worse to \nhave a grandmother or an aunt interjecting themselves in between the \nparent and the child, than to have some stranger do it. The result is \nthe same. It is the same. It is the parent who has the responsibility, \nwho brought the child into the world, and who has raised the child. The \ndestructive impact on the family could be greater in that case.\n  In any event, the grandmother isn't the parent, and the aunt isn't \nthe parent; and neither relative nor stranger should have the right to \ncircumvent parental involvement statutes.\n  If a well-meaning grandmother wants to be helpful, in most situations \nshe should encourage the child to confide in her parents. In the rare \ncircumstances where that would not be appropriate, and the child is \nintent on obtaining an abortion, the judicial by-pass procedure could \nbe used.\n  That is, a child could go to a court, and the abortion could be \nauthorized by the judge. The child could go to court in those \ncircumstances.\n  In summary, this bill is narrowly crated, it is well written, it is \nnecessary, and it is constitutional. The House of Representatives \npassed this bill with a strong bipartisan majority of 276 to 150. I \nurge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  We need to ensure this bill receives a vote on the merits. We are \napparently going to have to invoke cloture to even get it up for a \nvote. There is a strong determination--I consider it an extreme \ncommitment--to support anything that favors abortion by too many \nMembers of this body.\n  This is a reasonable bill. This is a fair bill. It is an appropriate \naction by the Congress of the United States involving interstate \ncommerce. As a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted those who transported \nstolen motor vehicles--ITSMV, Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor \nVehicles, stolen property, lots of those kinds of cases. This is one \ntype of case that is quite appropriate for us to legislate on.\n  I hope that every Member of this body will vote for it. It ought to \npass overwhelmingly. It is good public policy.\n  I, again, congratulate Senator Abraham for his determined and skilled \nlegislative leadership in crafting and presenting this outstanding \npiece of legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10201-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10202-S10203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the Majority Leader has told us that \nthere is no time left in this session to work on legislation which can \nimprove the quality of life for most Americans. But there is time. As \nthe Minority Leader has noted several times, there is time every \nevening after the day's work is completed when we can work a second \nshift.\n  The so-called ``two-track'' system has not been an uncommon practice \nin the Senate. More than a dozen times in the last 13 years, this body \nhas worked well into the evening on legislation separate from that \nwhich it worked on during the day in an effort to get the job done. I \nask unanimous consent that the 14 excerpts from floor speeches which \nrefer to this practice be printed in the Record. These are examples \ninitiated by Republicans and Democrats, majority and minority.\n  We have the opportunity to pass legislation which will make a \npositive impact on the lives of millions of Americans. We should not \nlet this chance pass us by.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [144 Cong Rec S 5400, *S5400; May 22, 1998]\n\n       Mr. Lott. I do want to emphasize, the nuclear waste issue \n     we intend to double track. That is one where we can take an \n     action and then come off of that and go, then, to other \n     legislation, the tobacco legislation. And it will take a \n     period of days to get through the process we have to go on, \n     on nuclear waste. But that is not intended to take the place \n     of either the tobacco bill or the Department of Defense \n     authorization bill. It will be double tracking as we go \n     forward.\n\n[141 Cong Rec S 12676, *S12677; Sept. 6, 1995 (Legislative day of Sept. \n                               5, 1995)]\n\n       Mr. Dole. I think we have now completed action on seven \n     appropriations bills. There are no other appropriations bills \n     now ready for consideration. We may try a two-track system--I \n     will discuss that with the Democratic leader--so we can keep \n     abreast of the House on appropriations bills and have all \n     appropriations bills in the President's hands by October 1.\n       So it may mean some late, late, late evenings. But we will \n     try to accommodate major concerns that many Senators have \n     from time to time.\n\n [141 Cong Rec S 5303, *S5303; April 6, 1995 (Legislative day of April \n                                  5)]\n\n       Mr. Daschle. What I hope we might be able to do, perhaps, \n     is to maybe run two tracks, get some debate and offer some of \n     these amendments. We could maybe work out some short time \n     agreements and have a good debate, rather than just putting \n     the Senate in a quorum call, and then work simultaneously to \n     see if [*S5304] we might not be able to address some of these \n     concerns.\n\n [135 Cong Rec S 13040, *S13040; October 12, 1989 (Legislative day of \n                               Sept. 18)]\n\n       Mr. Mitchell. That is precisely my intention; that if we \n     reach 2 p.m. Wednesday without having completed action on the \n     flag amendment, we will return to that following the \n     presentation of arguments by the impeachment managers and \n     Judge Hastings and his counsel on Wednesday, back to it on \n     Thursday and continue on a double track, so to speak, until \n     such time as we do complete action on that.\n\n[134 Cong Rec S 5258, *S5258; April 29, 1988 (Legislative day of April \n                                  28)]\n\n       Mr. Byrd. So, at least until next Wednesday, I will say \n     that the Senate will be on other very important business, the \n     DOD authorization bill. If that bill is not finished by the \n     conclusion of business on Tuesday, and by that time it \n     appears that the Senate is ready to go forward on the treaty, \n     then Senator Nunn has indicated a willingness to either set \n     the DOD authorization bill aside and take it up following the \n     action on the treaty or, as I suggested to Senator Dole, \n     Senator Nunn, Senator Boren, and Senator Pell, perhaps for a \n     day or two we could proceed on a two-track basis, get work \n     started on the treaty, and finish the work on the DOD \n     authorization bill. We can make that decision as of next \n     Wednesday.\n\n[134 Cong Rec S 2818, *S2833; March 23, 1988 (Legislative day of March \n                                  21)]\n\n       Mr. Simpson. Mr. President, there has been discussion in \n     the past, and it was certainly the majority leader's duty to \n     move legislation, when it was felt several times that there \n     would be a filibuster unless the majority leader felt it \n     necessary to file a motion for cloture on the first day that \n     the bill came up. This is not a criticism. That happened \n     several times. We did our business. When that came up, we had \n     a double track. We handled the immigration bill and we \n     handled the oversight legislation on intelligence. We did our \n     business. There was nothing inappropriate about that. But \n     finally there were those who said we are unable to put in \n     nongermane amendments.\n\n              [134 Cong Rec S 1678, *S1679; March 2, 1988]\n\n       Mr. Simpson. Mr. President, I would inform the majority \n     leader that I think the aspect of the cloture vote does impel \n     us to do our work, and we are going to do that. I think it \n     would be good if the majority leader and I visited about what \n     we visited about last night. I think perhaps we might be in a \n     position to utilize the services of the new committee, the ad \n     hoc committee, for the referral of a sense-of-the-Senate \n     resolution which could be discussed today, and I would like \n     to visit with the majority leader about that. We have been \n     asked to appoint one new member. I am ready to do that. That \n     group would then deal with the rules issues that we \n     discussed. Then we could go on a double track for the \n     intelligence authorization and then get to Price-Anderson and \n     be dealing with it and have it as the pending item of \n     business when we return, because it is a very important piece \n     of legislation.\n\n                  [133 Cong Rec S 8426; June 23, 1987]\n\n       Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, later this afternoon I hope to \n     offer the omnibus trade bill. I would like to get it before \n     the Senate later today for opening statements. On tomorrow, \n     then, following the conference report on the budget action, \n     the Senate would return, probably, to the trade legislation. \n     I remind all Senators that I indicated last week that we will \n     be operating on at least a two-track system here for the next \n     few days. The campaign finance reform bill will still be \n     around. The trade legislation will be up. We will have to \n     take action on the conference report on the budget.\n\n                  [133 Cong Rec S 8493; June 23, 1987]\n\n       Mr. Byrd. The Senate will operate on a two-track system, \n     under the consent order that was entered. It gives the \n     majority leader at any time the consent to go to the trade \n     legislation--the omnibus bill, or the bill that was reported \n     out of the Finance Committee. I have chosen to proceed with \n     the omnibus approach. That was the approach that was \n     discussed for months, and committee chairmen have acted \n     accordingly. They have been dutiful in reporting out the \n     legislation.\n       So, beginning on tomorrow, there will be longer days and \n     shorter nights, in contrast to the natural seasons of the \n     year.\n\n                  [133 Cong Rec S 8363; June 19, 1987]\n\n       Mr. Byrd. So by the middle of next week, certainly, I \n     expect us to be on the trade legislation. We will have a two-\n     track system. We will work on trade during the early part of \n     the day up into the midafternoon or a little later than \n     midafternoon. Then we will go to campaign financing reform. I \n     would like to retain the flexibility to switch that mode, but \n     that is my present plan, to go with trade first, then \n     campaign financing reform. We can shift that, of course.\n\n[131 Cong Rec S 14042; October 24, 1985 (Legislative day of October 24, \n                                 1985)]\n\n       Mr. Heflin. Mr. President, if the majority leader will \n     yield, is it the majority leader's intention to stay with the \n     farm bill until it is disposed of or to lay it aside, double \n     track it with other measures? I do not mean to ask for a hard \n     and fast answer. But is it the overall intention to dispose \n     of the farm bill on a priority basis over other pending \n     legislation which we have half done or partially done.\n       Mr. Dole. The Senator is correct. It might be, if we can \n     reach an agreement on reconciliation, we might have to \n     interrupt discussion of the farm bill, say, Wednesday or \n     Thursday of next week, and it could result if we cannot get \n     an agreement, we could have 100 and some votes under the \n     reconciliation process, but I do believe that with that one \n     caveat, and again there is always a possibility that the \n     textile amendment should come off reconciliation, there might \n     be some agreement to offer it to some other bill, but the \n     general intention is to finish the farm bill, and I know it \n     is very important to farmers just as it was in July when we \n     tried to bring it up.\n\n [131 Cong Rec S 13169; October 10, 1985 (Legislative day of Sept. 30, \n                                 1985)]\n\n       Mr. Dole. Mr. President, as I have indicated, we will have \n     a pro forma session tomorrow, convening at 9:30 a.m.\n       On Tuesday, October 15, 1985, the Senate will convene at 10 \n     a.m. Under the standing order, the two leaders will be \n     recognized for 10 minutes each. There is a special order in \n     favor of the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Proxmire] for 15 \n     minutes. That will be followed by morning business, not to \n     extend beyond the hour of 11 a.m.\n       Mr. President, following morning business, the Senate will \n     turn to any appropriations bills which have been cleared. No \n     votes will occur during the Tuesday session.\n       Mr. President, if we can work it out between the majority \n     leader and the minority leader, I hope we can double track \n     with appropriations bills in the morning and reconciliation \n     in the afternoon. We have gotten behind, not just because of \n     the debt limit but other internal controversies over \n     appropriations bills.\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\n                  [131 Cong Rec S 9060; July 8, 1985]\n\n       Mr. Dole. We will double track, if necessary, to complete \n     the farm bill that week. We will consider the immigration \n     bill, if it is ready for floor consideration, and if we can \n     work out some agreement, that will not take the entire week. \n     In fact, I hope none of these will take the entire week. In \n     addition to that, hopefully the budget resolution will have \n     been resolved. We have a number of nominations that we hope \n     to dispose of by agreement. If not, we hope to move on some \n     of those nominations because there are a number of very \n     important nominations. It is my understanding that the \n     administration is quite concerned, and hopes that we can \n     approve all of the nominations quickly. But as you can see, \n     July is not too heavy of a schedule. [Laughter.] I hope we \n     can work out some other things in the interim.

A bill to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to \nprevent the canceling of annuities to certain divorced spouses of \nworkers whose widows elect to receive lump sum payments; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              RAILROAD RETIREMENT AMENDMENT ACT OF 1998''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of Valoris Carlson of Aberdeen, SD, and the handful of others \nlike her whose lives have been terribly disrupted. This legislation \nwill right a wrong that was not due to any error or deception on \nValoris' part, but due to an administrative error by the Railroad \nRetirement Board [RRB]. In addition, the majority of the Board supports \nthe amendment.\n  In 1984 Valoris, as the divorced spouse of a deceased railroad \nemployee, applied for a tier I survivor's annuity. The RRB failed to \ncheck if a lump sum withdrawal had previously been made on the account \nat the time of her former spouse's death--even though Valoris clearly \nstated on her application that there was a surviving widow. In fact, a \nlump sum payment had been made, but not identified. The RRB began \npaying Valoris $587 per month in 1984 and continued to pay her benefits \nfor 11 years. In 1994 the RRB discovered that an error had been made \nover a decade ago.\n  Subsequently, Valoris was told she was not eligible for the pension \nshe was awarded in 1984. Had the RRB thoroughly reviewed their records, \nthey would have seen that a lump-sum payment had been made on that \naccount. Valoris, who was married for 26 years, lost her eligibility to \nthe widow of the railroad worker who had been married to him for only 3 \nyears. Valoris made an honest application for benefits. The RRB made an \nerror, resulting in 11 years of ``overpayments'' to Valoris.\n  These payments affected Valoris' planning for the future. Valoris \nplanned her retirement on that modest sum of $587. Had she been told \nshe was not eligible for benefits, she would have worked longer to \nbuild up her own Social Security benefits. Her railroad divorced \nwidow's benefit has been her only steady income. She has picked up a \nfew dollars here and there by renting out rooms in her home, but \nwithout her monthly benefit income, Valoris has had a terrible time \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  The bill I am introducing today will address the errors made by the \nRRB that have disrupted the life of Valoris Carlson and others like \nher. The RRB advises that 15 other widows are similarly situated, and \ntheir pensions would also be restored by this bill.\n  The bill, which was developed with technical assistance from the RRB, \nwould allow the 16 women impacted by the RRB's administrative error to \nbegin receiving their monthly benefits again. It requires them to repay \nthe lump sum, but they are allowed to do so through a modest \nwithholding from their monthly benefit. The RRB could waive the monthly \nwithholding if it would cause excessive hardship for a widow.\n  According to the RRB, the costs of this legislation would be \nnegligible for scoring purposes.\n  Mr. President, I will work to enact this legislation as quickly as \npossible to restore the benefits to those women who are now suffering \nas a result of the Government's mistakes. It has been four years since \nthese women have lost their retirement income. There is no excuse for \nfurther delay in providing these Americans with benefits they were led \nto expect by the RRB.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2455\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Railroad Retirement \n     Amendment Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF DIVORCED SPOUSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6(c) of the Railroad Retirement \n     Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. 231e(c)) is amended--\n       (1) in the last sentence of paragraph (1), by inserting \n     ``(other than to a survivor in the circumstances described in \n     paragraph (3))'' after ``no further benefits shall be paid''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Notwithstanding the last sentence of paragraph (1), \n     benefits shall be paid to a survivor who--\n       ``(A) is a divorced wife; and\n       ``(B) through administrative error received benefits \n     otherwise precluded by the making of a lump sum payment under \n     this section to a widow;\n     if that divorced wife makes an election to repay to the Board \n     the lump sum payment. The Board may withhold up to 10 percent \n     of each benefit amount paid after the date of the enactment \n     of this paragraph toward such reimbursement. The Board may \n     waive such repayment to the extent the Board determines it \n     would cause an unjust financial hardship for the \n     beneficiary.''.\n       (b) Application of Amendment.--The amendment made by this \n     section shall apply with respect to any benefits paid before \n     the date of enactment of this Act as well as to benefits \n     payable on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2457. A bill to make technical correction to the Columbia River \nGorge National Scenic Area Act of 1986; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n              columbia river gorge boundary adjustment act\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to \nintroduce legislation which will correct a longstanding technical error \nto the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area Act of 1986.\n  As those who were around this body over a decade ago remember, the \nColumbia Gorge Act was a highly complicated and contentious piece of \nlegislation. A great number of impacted citizens made substantial \nsacrifices to see that this Act which was intended to protect one of \nthe most pristine and magnificent natural resources anywhere in America \ncould become law. Because of the detailed nature and the sometimes \nconvoluted process established under this Act, it is not surprising \nthat a mistake along the lines of what my bill today intends to correct \ncould happen. My legislation simply makes a technical correction to the \nGorge Act by excluding approximately 29 acres of land owned by the Port \nof Camas-Washougal. This area was inadvertently included within the \nsouthwestern boundary of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area \n12 years ago.\n  Mr. President, ever since the establishment of the National Scenic \nArea, the Port of Camas-Washougal has been diligent in its efforts to \nprove that a small portion of its property was unintentionally included \nin the Scenic Area. In fact, even before the Gorge Act became law, the \nPort was successful in getting legislation passed that established the \nSteigerwald Lake National Wildlife Refuge and reserved 80 acres of this \narea for its own purposes.\n  Unfortunately, two years later, Congress in its infinite wisdom \nlocated the\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\nsouthwest boundary of the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area so that \napproximately 19 of the 80 reserved acres and 10 acres of Port-owned \nland were included in the National Scenic Area. The legislation I am \noffering today would exclude these 29 acres under question as Congress \nhad originally intended.\n\n  I touched earlier on the Port's diligence in seeing this process \nthrough to its completion. Whether it be working with the Washington \nState Congressional delegation, getting approval from the Columbia \nGorge Commission, or convincing originally skeptical segments of the \nlocal community, the Port's efforts are proof positive that persistence \npays off when it comes to resolving complicated and contentious \nproblems. It also helps to have the facts on your side. And clearly \nthat is what the Port has been demonstrating over the past 12 years.\n  One concern that was raised in discussions with representatives of a \nnumber of interested parties throughout the local southwestern \nWashington community was the possibility that legislation making a \ntechnical boundary change might set a dangerous precedent in which \nother less deserving boundary change proposals are cavalierly enacted \ninto law. Because of these concerns, I have included a provision in my \nbill stating in no uncertain terms that is not the intent of this \nlegislation to set a precedent regarding adjustment or amendment of any \nboundaries of the National Scenic Area or any other provisions of the \nColumbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act.\n  While the Gorge Act remains controversial within some sectors of my \nstate and is by no means perfect, this legislation represents a special \ncase where it has been clearly proven that the intent of Congress was \nnot being carried out and the enabling statute needed correction. Any \nfurther proposals to change boundaries or revisions to the '86 Act will \nhave to stand on their own merits and pass a similar test.\n  In addition to the Port of Camas-Washougal, I also want to commend \nrepresentatives of the Columbia Gorge Commission and the Friends of the \nGorge for working together with the Port to develop a reasonable \nsolution to this mistake. I also want to thank my two colleagues, \nSenator Murray and Congresswomen Smith, both of whom also have the \npleasure of representing this beautiful area, for their support in this \neffort. While my legislation is not intended to set any legislative \nprecedents, I do hope the positive process by which it was developed \nwill foster further consensus building efforts throughout the local \ncommunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2458. A bill to amend the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the \ncreation of the Morristown National Historical Park in the State of New \nJersey, and for other purposes'' to authorize the acquisition of \nproperty known as the ``Warren Property''; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n            morristown national historical park legislation\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today with Senator Lautenberg I \nintroduce legislation to preserve land on which our nation was forged. \nDuring the harsh winter of 1779-1780 the Continental Army, and its \nleader, General George Washington camped at Morristown, New Jersey.\n  Washington chose Morristown for its logistical, geographical, and \ntopographical advantages and also because of its close proximity to \nBritish-occupied New York City. Washington and his men encountered \ngreat hardships here, as the winter of 1779 was the worst winter here \nin over 100 years.\n  When soldiers first arrived at Morristown, they had no choice but to \nsleep out in the open snow as it took most about two to three weeks to \nbuild wooden huts to hold groups of a dozen men. The last of the \nContinental Army, however, did not move into the huts until the middle \nof February, and conditions were so bad that many soldiers stole \nregularly to eat, deserted, or mutinied. Only the leadership of General \nWashington held the Continental Army intact, enabling him to plot the \nstrategy for the coming spring that would turn the tide of the war.\n  Through the preservation of this site, we honor the men who served at \nMorristown and fought for our independence. And more than that, we \npreserve the best classroom imaginable to understand how our nation was \nborn.\n  Recognizing the importance of this site, Congress created the \nMorristown National Historical Park in 1933, the first historical \nnational park in the National Park System.\n  In the years since the establishment of the park, however, New Jersey \nhas undergone a revolution of another sort: from Garden State to \nSuburban State. In 1959, there were 15,000 farms in New Jersey covering \n1.4 million acres. Today, there are 9,000 farms on 847,000 acres, a 40% \ndecrease. In New Jersey, as much as 10,000 acres of rural land is being \ndeveloped every year.\n  North-central New Jersey and the area around the park has not been \nspared from this development. Much of the private land adjacent to the \npark has been subdivided and developed for residential use. Many of \nthese residences are visible from park areas, altering the rural \ncharacter of the park and diminishing the visitor's experience of the \npark's historic landscape.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help preserve the \nnatural environment of the Park by authorizing the Park Service to \nexpand the boundary of the park to include the 15-acre Warren property \non Mt. Kemble Ridge. Specifically, our legislation authorizes the \nSecretary of the Interior to acquire through purchase, purchase with \nappropriated funds, or donation, the Warren Property. This acquisition \nwill prevent this land, where patriots made their camp during the \nwinter of 1779-1780, from being re-zoned and subdivided for residential \ndevelopment.\n  The National Park Service strongly supports this legislation. NPS \nDeputy Director, Denis Galvin, recently testified in support of \nlegislation to acquire the Warren Property before a House National \nParks and Public Lands Subcommittee hearing on March 26, 1998. This \nimportant parcel of land has been classified as ``desirable for \nacquisition'' by the National Park Service since 1976.\n  In addition, the property's owner, Jim Warren, is a willing seller \nand interested in seeing the property preserved as part of Morristown \nNational Historical Park. Acquisition of the Warren Property for \ninclusion in the park would ensure that the character of the park's \nhistoric landscape is not further degraded.\n  Unfortunately, there are historic sites in my home state of New \nJersey and across our country that need to be preserved. It is my hope \nthat through this effort, the Morristown National Historical Park and \nsites like it across the country will be preserved for generations to \ncome so that the history of our country and its guiding principles will \nremain alive in the hearts of all Americans.\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I wanted to announce that \nI am cosponsoring legislation authorizing the National Park Service to \nacquire and add lands to the Morristown National Historical Park. The \nMorristown National Historical Park is an important Revolutionary War \nsite and this bill would authorize the Park Service to acquire lands \nfrom a willing seller to prevent the encroachment of modern residential \nand commercial development in an effort to preserve the visitor's \nexperience of the park's historic landscape and enable the park to \nretain its rural character.\n  The Morristown National Historical Park was established in 1933 and \nhosts approximately 550,000 visitors a year. The park preserves the \nsites that were occupied by General George Washington and the \nContinental Army during this critical period where he held together, \nduring desperate times, the small, ragged army that represented the \ncountry's main hope for independence. General Washington chose the area \nfor its logistical, geographical, and topographical military \nadvantages, in addition to its proximity to New York City, which was \noccupied by the British in 1779. The site proposed for acquisition \nwould be a 15 acre parcel near the Jockey Hollow Encampment Area of the \npark and prevent further degradation of the parks vistas.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation \nwhich will ensure that an important historical site for New Jersey and \nthe nation is protected.\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2459. A bill for the relief of Paul G. Finnerty and Nancy Finnerty \nof Scranton, Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, although it is late in the \nsession, I am introducing legislation to rectify a problem facing one \nof my constituents, Mr. Paul Finnerty of Scranton, and his wife \nconcerning his federal retirement benefits. It is necessary for \nCongress to become involved in this case because Mr. Finnerty has \nexhausted administrative relief and lost an estoppel claim in the 3rd \nCircuit Federal Court of Appeals, which ruled that ``regardless of the \npossibility of agency error in this case, we have no authority over the \ndisbursement of funds that has been assigned by the Constitution to \nCongress alone.''\n  I am advised that Mr. Finnerty and his wife are entitled to employee \nand spousal annuities based on his more than 30 years in the railroad \nindustry. They were misinformed by federal employees as to the actual \nretirement benefits they would receive and relied to their detriment on \nthe higher figure in deciding that Mr. Finnerty should retire in 1993. \nSpecifically, there is documentation which reflects the failure of the \nScranton Field Office of the Railroad Retirement Board to advise Mr. \nFinnerty appropriately regarding the impact of a statutory maximum of \n$1200/month in retirement benefits if he remained in the federal CSRS \npension system instead of switching into the FERS system. I have \nenclosed an example of such documentation for the Record.\n  While the private relief legislation is a last resort used sparingly \nby the Congress, the Finnertys have provided enough documentation to \nsuggest that their request merits careful review by the Labor \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over such bills. Accordingly, I am \nintroducing this bill today to begin that review process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Railroad Retirement \nBoard letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         United States of America,\n\n\n                                    Railroad Retirement Board,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 26, 1994.\n     Hon. Joseph M. McDade,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman McDade: Your letter on behalf of Mr. Paul \n     G. Finnerty has been forwarded to me for reply.\n       Upon investigation of the circumstances described by Mr. \n     Finnerty in his letter dated August 20, 1994, to you, I have \n     determined that our Scranton field office repeatedly \n     overestimated the amount of railroad retirement benefits that \n     Mr. Finnerty could expect to receive upon his retirement. I \n     regret this mistake.\n       The Scranton field office failed to consider the effect of \n     the railroad retirement maximum provision of the Railroad \n     Retirement Act of 1974 each time they furnished an estimate \n     to Mr. Finnerty.\n       The railroad retirement maximum provision limits the total \n     amount of railroad retirement benefits payable to an employee \n     and spouse at the time the employee's annuity begins to a \n     maximum based on the highest 2 years of creditable railroad \n     retirement or social security covered earnings in the 10-year \n     period ending with the year the employee's annuity begins. \n     Since Mr. Finnerty's Federal employment for the previous 10 \n     years was covered under the Civil Service Retirement System, \n     his railroad retirement maximum amount could not be based on \n     the highest 2 years of creditable railroad retirement or \n     social security covered earnings. Therefore, Mr. Finnerty's \n     railroad retirement maximum amount is set at the statutory \n     limit of $1,200 in accordance with section 4(c) of the \n     Railroad Retirement Act.\n       Unfortunately, the effect of the railroad retirement \n     maximum in Mr. Finnerty's case is the reduction of the tier \n     II component to zero in both the employee and spouse annuity. \n     Since the Scranton field office included a tier II amount in \n     the employee and spouse annuity computation, an overestimate \n     of benefits resulted.\n       I sincerely regret any problems we have caused Mr. \n     Finnerty. We strive to furnish the best service possible to \n     our beneficiaries. When seeking our assistance during the \n     important time of planning for retirement, our beneficiaries \n     certainly have a right to expect that accurate annuity \n     estimates are provided. Although we have failed Mr. Finnerty \n     in that regard, the Scranton field manager has counseled his \n     staff to consider the effect of the railroad retirement \n     maximum provision when calculating estimates in the future. \n     We will continue to stress the importance of accurate service \n     to the public and, in an effort to prevent future mistakes, \n     will issue a reminder to all field employees on this issue.\n       I am sorry a more favorable response cannot be made in \n     regard to your constituent as we are required to pay benefits \n     according to the law. If you need further information, please \n     do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kenneth P. Boehne,\n                Director of Administration and Operations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2460. A bill to curb deceptive and misleading games of chance \nmailings, to provide Federal agencies with additional investigative \ntools to police such mailings, to establish additional penalties for \nsuch mailings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n             the deceptive mailing elimination act of 1998\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that, \nif enacted, will go a long way toward eliminating deceptive practices \nin mailings that use games of chance like sweepstakes to induce \nconsumers to purchase a product or waste their money by paying to play \na game they will not win. The use of gimmicks in these contests, such \nas a large notice declaring the recipient a winner--oftentimes a \n``guaranteed'' winner or one of two final competitors for a large cash \nprize--has proliferated to the point that American consumers are being \nduped into purchasing products they don't want or need because they \nthink they have won or will win a big prize if they do so. Complaints \nabout these mailings are one of the top ten consumer complaints in the \nnation. I have received numerous complaints from my constituents in \nMichigan asking that something be done to provide relief from these \nmailings.\n  Earlier this month we held a hearing in our Governmental Affairs \nCommittee federal services subcommittee on the problem of deceptive \nsweepstakes and other mailings involving games of chance. We learned \nfrom three of our witnesses, the Florida Attorney General, the Michigan \nAssistant Attorney General and the Postal Inspection Service, that \nsenior citizens are particular targets of these deceptive \nsolicitations, because they are the most vulnerable. State Attorneys \nGeneral have taken action against many of the companies that use \ndeceptive mailings. The states have entered into agreements to stop the \nmost egregious practices, but the agreements apply only to the states \nthat enter into the agreements. This allows companies to continue their \ndeceptive practices in other states. That's why federal legislation in \nthis area is needed. The bill I'm introducing today will eliminate \ndeceptive practices by prohibiting misleading statements, requiring \nmore disclosure, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty for each deceptive \nmailing and providing the Postal Service with additional tools to \npursue deceptive and fraudulent offenders.\n  Sweepstakes solicitations are put together by teams of clever \nmarketers who package their sweepstakes offers in such a way so as to \nget people to purchase a product by implying that the chances of \nwinning are enhanced if the product being offered is purchased. Rules \nand important disclaimers are written in fine print and hidden away in \nobscure sections of the solicitation or on the back of the envelope \nthat is frequently tossed away. Even when one reads the rules, it \nfrequently takes a law degree to understand them.\n  The bill I am introducing will protect consumers from deceptive \npractices by directing the Postal Service to develop and issue \nregulations that restrict the use of language and symbols on direct \nmail game of chance solicitations, including sweepstakes, that mislead \nthe receiver into believing they have won, or will win a prize. The \nbill also requires additional disclosure about chances of winning and \nthe statement that no purchase is necessary. Any mail that is \ndesignated by the Postal Service as being deceptive will not be \ndelivered. This will significantly reduce if not eliminate the \ndeceptive practices being used in the direct mail industry to dupe \nunsuspecting consumers into thinking they are grand prize winners. The \ndirect mail industry should benefit as a result. The adverse publicity \nrecently aimed at the industry because of ``You Have Won a Prize'' \ncampaigns has malign the industry as a whole. Cleaning up deceptive \nadvertising will certainly improve the industry's image.\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\n  For those entities that continue to use deceptive mailings, my bill \nimposes a civil penalty of $10,000 for each offense that violates \nPostal Service regulations. Currently the Postal Service can impose a \n$10,000 daily fine for evading or not complying with a Postal Service \norder. My bill imposes a fine concurrent with issuing an order. This \nhas the effect of applying the penalty to the deceptive offense, not \nfor noncompliance of the order.\n  My bill allows the Postal Service to quickly respond to changes in \ndeceptive marketing practices by tasking them to draft regulations and \nlanguage that will be effective against the ``scheme du jour.'' A \ndeceptive practice used today, may not be used tomorrow. As soon as \nauthorities learn about one scheme, it's changes. If legislation is \npassed that requires a specific notice, it won't be too long before \nanother deceptive practice will pop up to by-pass the legislation. The \nPostal Service, who is in the business of knowing what is going on with \nthe mails, will be able to evaluate what regulatory changes will be \nrequired to keep pace with deceptive practices. This will ensure that \ndeceptive practices are weeded out in a timely manner by keeping \nregulations current.\n  The bill also gives the Postal Service administrative subpoena power \nto respond more quickly to deceptive and fraudulent mail schemes. \nCurrently the Postal Service must go through a lengthy administrative \nprocedure before it can get evidence to shut down illegal operations. \nBy the time they get through all the administrative hoops, the crook \nhas folded up operations and disappeared, or has destroyed all the \nevidence. By granting the Postal Service limited subpoena authority to \nobtain relevant or material records for an investigation, the Postal \nService will be able to act more efficiently against illegal \nactivities. Subpoena authority will make the Postal Service more \neffective and efficient in its pursuit of justice.\n  The Deceptive Sweepstakes Mailings Elimination Act of 1998 takes a \ntough approach to dealing with sweepstakes solicitations and other \ngames of chance offerings that are sent through the mail. If you use \nsweepstakes or a game of chance to promote the sale of a product and \nprovide adequate disclosure and abide with Postal Service regulations, \nthen the Postal Service will deliver that solicitation. If deceptive \npractices are used in a sweepstakes or a game of chance solicitation, \nthen the Postal Service will be able to stop the solicitation, and \nimpose a significant penalty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2460\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                          HOSTAGE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 116\n\n       Whereas Mark Rich, David Mankins, and Rick Tenenoff of the \n     Sanford, Florida, based New Tribes Mission were abducted on \n     January 31, 1993, from the Kuna Indian village of Pucuro in \n     the Darien Province of Panama;\n       Whereas the wives and children of these American citizens, \n     Tania Rich (daughters--Tamra and Jessica), Nancy Mankins \n     (son--Chad, daughter--Sarah), and Patti Tenenoff (son--\n     Richard Lee III, daughters--Dora and Connie), have lived the \n     past 5 years without knowledge of the safety of these 3 men;\n       Whereas Mark Rich, David Mankins, and Rick Tenenoff \n     presently are believed to be the longest held United States \n     hostages;\n       Whereas this kidnapping represents a gross violation of the \n     3 missionaries' human rights and is not an isolated incident \n     in Colombia where, since 1980, 83 innocent Americans have \n     been held hostage by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \n     Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN);\n       Whereas the FARC and the ELN guerrilla groups in Colombia \n     have both been designated terrorist organizations by the \n     Department of State;\n       Whereas Colombia is engaged in a high-level conflict with \n     these guerrilla insurgency groups, a number of whom are \n     protectorates of the deadly drug trade;\n       Whereas the FARC has recently threatened officials of the \n     United States Government and kidnapped additional United \n     States citizens in Colombia;\n       Whereas the region of Colombia where the 3 American \n     missionaries are believed to be held is controlled not by the \n     Colombian Government, but rather by the FARC;\n       Whereas on December 9, 1997, the President of Colombia \n     stated on an internationally televised episode of Larry King \n     Live that the FARC ``in some ways have admitted indirectly \n     that they have the missionaries'';\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch has stated that ``The FARC has \n     an obligation to unconditionally free the 3 missionaries, \n     with all necessary guarantees'' and Amnesty International has \n     declared their ``request that the FARC respect international \n     humanitarian norms, guarantee the life and physical safety of \n     the missionaries and unconditionally free them and all other \n     hostages'';\n       Whereas congressional inquiries regarding the 3 \n     missionaries have been made to United States Government \n     entities, including, the White House, the Department of \n     State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, \n     and the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       Whereas congressional inquiries regarding the 3 \n     missionaries have been made to Amnesty International, Pax \n     Christi, His Holiness the Pope John Paul II, and the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross, which has provided \n     assurances that their Colombian delegation ``is still \n     actively working in favor of the missing members of the New \n     Tribes Mission'';\n       Whereas 58 Members of Congress and Senators signed letters \n     to 8 different heads of state, including Costa Rica, Mexico, \n     Panama, Spain, Venezuela, Guatemala, Colombia, and Portugal, \n     in attendance at the Iberian-American Conference in Venezuela \n     in November of 1997, requesting any and all assistance in \n     order to bring about a favorable outcome to this unfortunate \n     event;\n       Whereas no official confirmation of life or death has been \n     made by any United States Government entity, nongovernmental \n     organization, foreign government, or religious institution;\n       Whereas the distinction between a ``terrorist activity'' \n     and a ``criminal activity'' perpetrated on an American \n     citizen traveling abroad should not be a limiting factor in \n     terms of United States governmental investigation; and\n       Whereas every consideration to safety and prudence \n     regarding action by the United States Government, foreign \n     governments, nongovernmental organizations, international \n     institutions, and other groups in this matter should be of \n     the highest priority: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the President of the United States and his emissaries \n     should raise the kidnapping of Mark Rich, David Mankins, and \n     Rick Tenenoff of the New Tribes Mission and other American \n     victims in Colombia to all relevant foreign governments, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and religious institutions at \n     every opportunity until a favorable outcome is achieved;\n       (2) the President of the United States and the Secretary of \n     State should offer reward money for information leading to \n     the release of the named hostages;\n       (3) the President of the United States and his emissaries \n     should urge the cooperation of the new President of Colombia \n     to assist in the publication of the reward information;\n       (4) the international community should encourage any and \n     all groups believed to have information on this case to come \n     forward to help the families of the kidnapped missionaries;\n       (5) all appropriate information obtained by the United \n     States Government, foreign governments, international \n     institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and religious \n     institutions should be turned over in a timely basis to the \n     New Tribes Mission crisis response team;\n       (6) a copy of this resolution shall be transmitted to the \n     President, the Secretary of State, the National Security \n     Advisor, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, the President of the Republic of Costa Rica, \n     the President of the United Mexican States, the President of \n     the Republic of Panama, the King of Spain, the President of \n     the Republic of Venezuela, the President of the Republic of \n     Guatemala, the President of the Republic of Colombia, the \n     President of the Republic of Portugal, and His Holiness Pope \n     John Paul II; and\n       (7) a copy of this resolution shall be transmitted to the \n     New Tribes Mission, Amnesty International, Pax Christi, and \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nsubmit a Resolution that seeks the President's assistance in recovering \nthree Americans--Mark Rich, David Mankins, and Rick Tenenoff--who were \nabducted by the Colombian terrorists known as the Revolutionary Armed \nForces of Colombia (FARC) on January 31, 1993, from the Kuna Indian \nvillage of Pucuro in the Darien Province of Panama.\n  I first became aware of this situation at a Lancaster County open \nhouse town meeting at the Lancaster City Council Chambers on February \n9, 1998. At the meeting, Ms. Peggie Miller urged me to get involved in \nthe situation. Also present at the meeting were Chester and Mary \nBitterman. Mr. Bitterman stood and spoke passionately about his son, \nChet Bitterman, III, who was a missionary translator with Wycliffe \nBible. Chet Bitterman, III, was kidnapped in Bogota, Colombia, in \nJanuary, 1981, held hostage for 48 days and then found brutally \nmurdered by Colombian terrorists on march 7, 1981. Not only did Mr. and \nMrs. Bitterman lose a son, but Chet left a wife and two very young \ndaughters. A book entitled ``Called to Die'' written by Steve Estes \ndescribes the horrible situation. Upon the urging of these \nconstituents, I met with New Tribes Mission, the State Department, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency to \nsee what we could do about recovering these kidnapped men.\n  This resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that the \nPresident and his representatives should raise the issue of the \nkidnapping of Mark Rich, David Mankins, and Rick Tenenoff of the New \nTribes Mission and other American victims in Colombia to all relevant \nforeign governments, non-governmental organizations, and religious \ninstitutions at every opportunity until a favorable outcome is \nachieved. The international community should encourage groups believed \nto have information on this case to come forward. The legislation urges \nthat all the appropriate information obtained should be turned over in \na timely basis to the New Tribes Mission crisis response team.\n  Most importantly, the resolution proposes that the President of the \nUnited States and the Secretary of State offer reward money for \ninformation leading to the release of Mark, David and Rick. President \nClinton should also encourage the cooperation of newly-elected \nColombian President Pastrana to assist in the publication of the reward \ninformation. Without cooperation between our two governments, we may \nnever see the return of these men to their families in the United \nStates.\n  There are indications that Mr. Rich, Mr. Mankins, and Mr. Tenenoff \nhave been held in Colombia for over five years; therefore, they would \nbe the longest held American hostages in Colombia.

Today the college offers more \nthan thirty areas of study, night programs for working adults, eight \nintercollegiate sports teams and four traveling performance groups.\n  I commend Hannibal-LaGrange College staff and students for their \ndedication and perseverance throughout the college's many years of \nexistence and hope they continue to enrich the Hannibal community for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10216-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE SECOND ANNUAL CHICAGO FOOTBALL CLASSIC\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes today to bring to the attention of the Senate an event that \nwill take place this weekend in my hometown of Chicago. That event, the \nSecond Annual Chicago Football Classic, celebrates the rich academic, \ncultural and athletic tradition of historically Black colleges and \nuniversities.\n  The Chicago Football Classic will take place this year at Chicago's \nSoldier Field on Saturday, September 12, 1998. This year's competition \npits Alcorn State University against Virginia State University in what \npromises to be an exciting and hard-fought gridiron battle.\n  Although the football game is the centerpiece of the event, the \nChicago Football Classic is about so much more. Begun last year, the \nChicago Football Classic was created by Chicago area businessmen to \nspread the word within the African-American community about the \ntremendous opportunities available at historically Black colleges and \nuniversities. Aside from the game, the Classic features a spectacular \nhalftime battle of the bands; a luncheon honoring Dr. Clinton Bristow, \nJr. and Dr. Eddie N. Moore, presidents of Alcorn State University and \nVirginia State University, respectively; and a parade in historic Grant \nPark featuring the Virginia State Marching Marauders and the Alcorn \nState Sounds of Dynomite.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that the members of this body are well aware \nof the proud legacy and stunning achievements of our nation's \nhistorically Black colleges. Nonetheless, I would be remiss if in \ntalking about the Chicago Football Classic, I failed to mention that \nour nation's historically Black colleges and universities have promoted \nacademic excellence for over 130 years. Although they represent only 3 \npercent of all U.S. institutions of higher learning, historically Black \ncolleges and universities graduate fully 33 percent of all African-\nAmericans with bachelor's degrees and 43 percent of all African-\nAmericans who go on to earn their Ph.D.'s.\n  As so eloquently stated in Fisk University's original charter, \nhistorically Black colleges and universities have measured themselves \n``by the highest standards, not of Negro education, but of American \neducation at its best.''\n  Throughout their history, historically Black colleges and \nuniversities have produced some of our nation's most distinguished \nleaders, including the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the late \nSupreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and several current U.S \nRepresentatives. These institutions have distinguished themselves in \nthe field of higher education over the years by maintaining the highest \nacademic standards while increasing educational opportunities for \neconomically and socially disadvantaged Americans, including tens of \nthousands of African-Americans.\n  In Virginia State University and Alcorn State University, the Chicago \nFootball has chosen two exceptional universities to participate in this \nyears festivities. Alcorn State, located in Loman, Mississippi, arose \nfrom the ashes of the Civil War in 1871 with eight faculty members and \n179 mostly male local students. Today, Alcorn State has grown to a \npopulation of 3,000 students from all over the world and 500 faculty \nand staff members. Virginia State University was founded in 1882 in \nPetersburg, Virginia with 126 students and seven faculty members. One \nhundred years later in 1982, the University was fully integrated, with \na student body of nearly 5,000 and a full-time faculty of about 250.\n  Mr. President, both of these schools have a historical connection to \nthe United States Congress. The first president of Virginia State, John \nMercer Langston, was the only African-American ever elected to the \nUnited States Congress from Virginia until the election of Congressman \nRobert Scott in 1992. Former Senator Hiram Revels of Mississippi, the \nfirst African-American elected to the United States Senate, resigned \nhis seat in this body to become the first president of Alcorn State.\n  Certainly, in mentioning these few facts about Alcorn State and \nVirginia State Universities, I have only scratched the surface of the \nproud history, academic excellence, and abundant opportunities that \nhistorically Black colleges and universities have to offer.\n  I salute the organizers, participants, and fans of the Chicago \nFootball Classic for coming together to celebrate historically Black \ncolleges and universities. In the words of Tim Rand, the Executive \nDirector of the Chicago Football Classic: ``It offers young people an \nopportunity to witness the rich cultural heritage of Black colleges and \nuniversities.'' I am proud that Chicago has been chosen as the venue \nfor this important and exciting event.\n  In closing, I would like to welcome the students, athletes, fans and \nalumni of Virginia State and Alcorn State to Illinois, and wish both \nteams good luck in Saturday's game. I know my colleagues here in the \nSenate join me in my praise of the Chicago Football Classic and in my \ngratitude and respect for our nation's historically Black colleges and \nuniversities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10216-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10216-S10217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LEROY ``LEE'' LOCHMANN\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Leroy \n``Lee'' Lochmann, the recently retired President and CEO of ConAgra's \nRefrigerated Foods Companies. Over a forty-five-year career in the meat \nand poultry industry, Lee's leadership skills have made him a pioneer \nin the food business.\n  In 1953, Lee joined Swift and Company directly out of high school, \nworking on the line in an East St. Louis meat packing plant. From these \nearly years, Lee moved through numerous management positions, finally \nascending to key executive ranks. He ultimately became President of \nSwift and Company, the first of many--and increasingly large--meat and \npoultry companies that Lee would eventually run.\n  In addition, along the way, Lee accumulated two university degrees \nand served his country in the military for three years.\n  Lee's hardworking beginnings have given him a unique perspective as a \nfood industry leader and have allowed him to effectively manage his \nemployees, from the most junior line worker to the most senior \ncorporate manager.\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\n  At ConAgra, one of the world's largest food companies, Lee used his \nexperience to expand its diversified Refrigerated Foods Companies. As \npresident, CEO and member of the Office of the Chairman, Lee oversaw \nmultibillion dollar businesses, provided a secure place of employment \nfor thousands of hard-working employees and wonderful food products for \nAmerican consumers. While consumers would not recognize the name of \nLochmann, the products that he produced are an integral part of our \ndaily diets: Armour hot dogs, Healthy Choice luncheon meats, Butterball \nturkeys, Swift Premium bacon and Eckrich sausages.\n  Mr. President, many ConAgra employees are constituents of mine in \nIndiana, and we know first-hand the significant role the company plays \nin my state's economy and our country's agricultural industries.\n  Lee was not only a leader at ConAgra, he was an industry trader, as \nwell. A long term Director of the American Meat Institute, Lee's peers \npaid this fine gentleman a well-deserved tribute by electing him \nChairman of the industry's National Trade Association in 1992.\n  Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute to Lee \nLochmann, and I wish him, his wife Agnes and their family the best in \nall of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10216-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO SEARCHLIGHT'S WOMAN OF THE DECADE, MRS. VERLIE DOING\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. \nVerlie Doing, an outstanding woman who will receive a distinguished \nhonor when she is named Searchlight, Nevada's, Woman of the Decade in \nOctober. This particular tribute is one I hold especially dear, as it \nis being given to a woman who has helped make my hometown the unique \ncommunity it is today.\n  Founded by those in search of gold, Searchlight began as a mining \ntown. It is a strangely quiet place, not really mentioned in the tales \nof Nevada history. However, this is my home, and Verlie Doing has \nhelped to establish it as a beating heart in the once silent land found \nsouth of Las Vegas.\n  Mrs. Doing relocated to Searchlight with her husband, Warren, in \n1967. Since that time, she has been active in organizing community \nactivities as well as providing employment for the majority of families \nliving in the area. Upon settling in Searchlight, Mrs. Doing assumed a \nposition on the Searchlight Town Advisory Board and began her legacy of \nwork. She is an original member of the town's Emergency Medical \nTreatment team, as well as the Searchlight Museum Guild. She has served \non the Clark County Parks and Recreation Board since 1970, establishing \nareas for children and adults alike to not only enjoy the many \nsplendors of Nevada's scenery, but to partake of beneficial recreation \nprograms.\n  As a member of the Parks and Recreation Board, Verlie has seen first \nhand the need for centers where people can participate in community \nactivities. For this reason, she and her husband donated to the city \nthe land for the Searchlight Senior Citizen Center. Currently, this \ncenter offers seniors an opportunity to socialize and continue their \neducation through arts and crafts and exercise. Day care and food \nprograms are among the most important offered at the center and provide \nassistance to those seniors who may otherwise be institutionalized.\n  Not only has Mrs. Doing been energetically involved in community \nactivities, she has also helped to foster Searchlight's business \ncommunity. Currently, Mrs. Doing is serving as the sole owner of the \nSearchlight Nugget Casino, the largest employer in the city. \nEstablished in 1979, the Nugget has increased not only employment, but \nhas aided in boosting the economy. She has employed hundreds of \nSearchlight residents, providing many families with incomes where, \nwithout the casino, there would be none. It is this entrepreneurial \nspirit that has brought vitality into both the business community and \nthe entire town.\n  Most of all, my family and I have been friends of Verlie, her late \nhusband, Warren, and their son, Riley, for more than thirty years. The \nDoings have made not only Searchlight a better place, but Nevada and \nour great country as well.\n  I commend Verlie on her significant contributions to my hometown. \nWithout her enthusiasm, energy and love for her home, Searchlight would \nbe much less. It is for these reasons that I proudly support the \ndecision of the Searchlight Celebration Committee in their selection of \nMrs. Verlie Doing as Searchlight's Woman of the Decade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10217-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10217-S10218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GREAT MINDS, SMART GIVING\"\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

LeFrak is chairman of the Lefrak Organization \nand has been honored for his many years of philanthropic giving.\n  Recently, through the LeFrak Foundation, Dr. LeFrak has done \nsomething incredible for the state of Michigan. Concerned that an \nemphasis on traditional liberal education at America's colleges and \nuniversities is diminishing, LeFrak chose to endow the LeFrak Forum at \nMichigan State University. This program focuses on political philosophy \nand public policy, helping professors to teach with an emphasis on \ntraditional Western ideas. The Forum will accomplish this through \nlectures, conferences, research, publications and fellowships. The \nstudents of Michigan State University are very fortunate to have such a \nwonderful program and will undoubtedly benefit from it.\n  As we continue our efforts as a nation to raise our children to be \ntruly educated adults, imbued with the values of our traditions and the \nbases of well-ordered liberty, I feel we can look to the LeFrak Forum \nas an excellent model. I ask that the text of ``Great Minds, Smart \nGiving'' be printed in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n\nGreat Minds, Smart Giving--A Noted Philanthropist On Reclaiming Academe\n\n                           (By Samuel LeFrak\n\n       When my wife Ethel and I began discussing a major gift to \n     an academic institution, we wanted to do something new and \n     off the beaten track of bricks-and-mortar, scholarships, and \n     endowed chairs. We also talked at length about the problems \n     of higher education and how we might help to solve them. Our \n     grandsons, Harrison and James, were just finishing college \n     and from them we had a pretty clear idea of the dismal state \n     of today's campus landscape. Both reported that the news \n     about political correctness and multiculturalism is largely \n     true. While it is surely an exaggeration to say that the \n     traditional liberal arts curriculum is gone, it is true that \n     an entire generation of graduate and undergraduate students \n     is being trained to a drumbeat critical of the Western \n     tradition as racist, sexist, homophobic, hegemonic, Euro-\n     centric, and rationalistic (a vice, it now seems!). The path \n     to academic success is definitely smoother for those who \n     adhere to this fashionable view. The graduate students are, \n     of course, the professorate of the future and the teachers of \n     the coming generation of leaders in politics and business. \n     What happens in the seminar room, no matter how bizarre or \n     arcane, eventually makes its way to the boardroom.\n\n       Now, Ethel and I have the deepest respect for the great \n     books and ideas of the Western tradition. If that tradition \n     is so bad, how is it that we have from it--and only from it--\n     democracy, capitalism, the ideals of freedom, equality of \n     opportunity, and the dignity of the individual? To us it \n     would be nothing short of a catastrophe for this great \n     tradition to disappear as the focal point of a liberal \n     education. Yet the traditional curriculum definitely is on \n     the defensive these days: we hear of English departments \n     where Shakespeare is no longer required and history \n     departments that teach nothing about America. The faculty at \n     Yale could not bring itself to live up to the terms of a \n     generous gift intended for new courses on the Western \n     tradition, and had to return the money--with interest. So it \n     seemed appropriate that we use a LeFrak Foundation gift to \n     help assure the survival and vitality of traditional liberal \n     education.\n       Ethel and I had been to Michigan State University a few \n     years earlier, when I had been awarded an honorary degree. \n     While there, we met a group of scholars of political \n     philosophy in the political science department. These \n     professors are very accomplished: they have fine graduate \n     degrees, are good and popular teachers, and have impressive \n     records of research and publication. But they are also \n     steeped in and respectful of the Western tradition and, \n     unlike many professors in the social sciences and humanities, \n     respectful of entrepreneurial capitalism and free-market \n     solutions to social problems. After prolonged discussions \n     involving these professors, Ethel and me, and my grandson, \n     Harrison, we decided to endow a program: the LeFrak Forum at \n     Michigan State University. Endowing a program--rather than a \n     building or a chair--met the criterion of establishing a new \n     and vital entity. The aims and activities of the Forum met \n     the criterion of doing something to help traditional scholars \n     hold their own against the current academic tides.\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\n       The LeFrak Forum's theme is political philosophy and public \n     policy. The word ``philosophy'' often signifies airy \n     abstraction unconnected with the real world. But at the \n     LeFrak Forum, the idea is that much of what people think \n     about practical affairs is determined ultimately by deeply \n     embedded and barely conscious beliefs about what is good and \n     bad, just and unjust. The LeFrak Forum will approach pressing \n     and concrete issues by exposing the underlying and \n     philosophical foundations of conflict. The Forum will always \n     remind us that these foundations are not just derived out of \n     nowhere, even though most people--and increasingly more \n     scholars and students--don't know where they come from. We \n     get them--and hence the very terms of our debates and \n     differences--from the historical tradition of Western \n     thought. The Forum will not insist on agreement. Rather, it \n     will strive to expose the real grounds upon which we disagree \n     about such practical matters as how big government should be, \n     whether a person is first an individual or a member of a \n     group, and whether America should mind its own business or \n     police the world.\n       The Forum pursues its mission by sponsoring an array of \n     activities: lecture series and international conferences, \n     research and publication, post-doctoral research fellowships, \n     and enriched graduate and undergraduate education. The aim is \n     to enliven, deepen, and diversify debate on campus and to \n     provide fresh views on public policy to those who lead in \n     politics and society and to those who form or influence \n     public opinion. But most important, the LeFrak Forum ensures \n     that at Michigan State the Western tradition will always be \n     studied and that free-market points of view toward the \n     solutions to social problems will always get a fair hearing. \n     But what about this ``always''? It is one thing to help \n     scholars or a curriculum one knows. In fact, it's important \n     to know the people involved so the gift gets used for the \n     purpose you intend. But it's quite another thing to have \n     confidence that the program one endows will continue long \n     after the people one knows are gone. This has to be a serious \n     concern for any donor who gives a permanent endowment to a \n     program or particular curriculum. Buildings and endowed \n     chairs are pretty stable. But programs can easily change over \n     time and even become the opposite of what they were at the \n     outset. Solving this problem was very important to us. The \n     solution was unique and, we hope, a model for what others can \n     and should do. The terms of the endowment agreement were \n     tailored to ensure that the purposes and spirit of the LeFrak \n     Forum would always be maintained. There were two crucial \n     issues.\n       First, it was important to spell out the meaning of the \n     LeFrak Forum's goals in concrete detail. To this end the \n     agreement stipulates that free-market points of view must \n     always get a fair hearing in LeFrak Forum activities. The \n     agreement says that the Forum must always provide a venue for \n     arguments in favor of ``liberty and free enterprise \n     capitalism and the study of the Western philosophic and \n     intellectual tradition, especially as it establishes the \n     moral and conceptual basis for constitutional democracy, \n     limited government, the American Founding, individualism, \n     freedom of expression and economic enterprise, and \n     entrepreneurial and market based approaches to national and \n     global political and social problems.'' And lest there be any \n     uncertainty about what the ``Western tradition'' really is, \n     the agreement actually lists the specific authors on whose \n     works LeFrak Forum teaching and research must focus. They \n     are: ``such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, \n     Machiavelli, Bacon, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Adam \n     Smith, Burke, the American Founders (Jefferson, Hamilton, \n     Madison, Jay, Adams), de Tocqueville, Hegel, Mill, Nietzsche, \n     Weber, Heidegger, and Strauss.'' This list is of course not \n     exhaustive; but no one could mistake who must always matter \n     the most at the LeFrak Forum.\n       Second, it was essential to assure full academic freedom \n     and autonomy as those values are understood by the relevant \n     university officials. Donors to programs must understand this \n     concern. It does no good to exert positive influence on the \n     university curriculum by threatening academic freedom. Such \n     attempts will not and should not succeed. Furthermore, it \n     does no good to one's own cause to set up programs in which \n     the converted speak only to their respective choirs. That's \n     the very problem on campus these days: not enough real \n     intellectual diversity, not enough respect for all points of \n     view, too much lemming-like adherence to fads. The agreement \n     therefore specifies explicitly that ``all points of view can \n     and will be presented at the LeFrak Forum.'' Critics of the \n     Western tradition and capitalism will have their say. They \n     just won't go unchallenged. And finally, it should be noted \n     that while the agreement provides for our advice, it makes \n     absolutely clear that appointment and review of LeFrak Forum \n     personnel is determined by appropriate academic officers of \n     the University. Donors must never try to appoint professors \n     to their programs. That would violate institutional autonomy.\n       Ethel and I are proud of the Forum, which is now in \n     business and off to a wonderful start. We're sure that it \n     will prosper and grow, make a real contribution to education \n     at Michigan State, and be a significant voice in national and \n     international policy debates. We hope that other \n     philanthropists will follow our lead and the model of the \n     LeFrak Forum. We hope they will endow programs that support \n     education in our precious Western tradition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10217-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10218-S10219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING MONSIGNOR HENRY J. DZIADOSZ\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I come \nto the Senate floor to pay tribute to a man of uncommon character and \nfaith, whom I am fortunate to call a friend: Monsignor Henry J. \nDziadosz. For almost three decades, Monsignor Dziadosz has served as \nthe Pastor at St. Bridget's of Kildare Church in Moodus, Connecticut, \nof which I am a member. And for half a century, he has inspired \ncountless people through his works as a Catholic Priest in Connecticut. \nAfter his many years of service and guidance, Monsignor Dziadosz is \nretiring, and I wish to offer my praise for the Monsignor on this \nspecial occasion.\n  Monsignor Dziadosz is a spiritual father for the parishioners of St. \nBridget's, and he has overseen the transformation of the church--both \nphysically and spiritually.\n  On Easter Sunday, 1971, two years after being named the Pastor, he \nannounced the proposed restoration and renovation of the congregation's \noriginal church: Old St. Bridget's on North Moodus Road. The church had \nbeen the home of Catholic worshipers from 1867 to 1958, and Monsignor \nbelieved that its preservation would serve as a monument to the \nperseverance of its parishioners. With the help of many volunteers, the \nold church was dedicated on Memorial Day 1971, and the renovation was \nknown as the ``Miracle of Moodus.''\n  He also oversaw the construction of an outdoor pavilion at the church \nin 1976. And in a show of the Monsignor's dedication to the improvement \nof religious education, the church opened its Religious Education \nCenter in 1983.\n  But the true impact that Monsignor Dziadosz had on St. Bridget's \nparish is not measured in mortar and brick, it is measured in the \nspirit of the congregation.\n  Monsignor has always said that one of his goals at the church was to \ncreate a spirit of community where no member of the parish would ever \nfeel alone, either in times of despair or happiness. He knows that we \nall face challenges in our life, and when we support one another we can \nwork through our difficulties and overcome them. Through his hard work \nand dedication, he was able to create such a spirit of togetherness at \nSt. Bridget's, and for that, I and many others are thankful.\n  He brought an energetic approach to the church, and he was not afraid \nto challenge convention in order to do what he felt was best for the \ncongregation. He always taught the virtues of tolerance and worked to \nbreak down barriers and bring people together. He also challenged \npeople to ask more from themselves and to show more concern and \ncompassion for those persons in the community and the world who are \nless fortunate.\n  He also felt that St. Bridget's should not only serve the parish, but \nthe community at large. He opened the doors of the church for members \nof local protestant delegations to hold their worship services. He also \nallowed senior groups and other organizations to use church facilities. \nHe even had a generator installed on the church premises so that the \nchurch may serve as a haven in case of emergencies or natural \ndisasters. In addition, he singlehandedly raised $50,000 for the \nconstruction of a chapel and convent for the cloistered Carmelite \nsisters of Roxas City, the Philippines, proving that his compassion and \nconcern for others extends far beyond any physical borders.\n  On the occasion of his retirement, I think it is appropriate to look \nback at\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nsome of the words that Monsignor Dziadosz spoke at the time that the \nparish celebrated his 25th year at St. Bridget's. He said, ``We can \nnever say we've done it, we've reached our goal.''\n  In certain respects he's right, because life is an ongoing process, \nand our goals are constantly changing. But, in the end, I think that \nanyone who knows Monsignor Dziadosz would say that he's wrong. \nMonsignor Dziadosz not only reached his goals, he exceeded them.\n  His retirement is a time of great loss for the parish, but more \nimportant, it is a time for celebration. His words and actions have \nbeen a source of inspiration and strength for countless individuals \nthrough the years, and his guidance will be dearly missed. On behalf of \nthe people of St. Bridget's and the people of Connecticut, I say thank \nyou Monsignor, and may God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10218-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10219-S10220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KIRK O'DONNELL\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this morning I joined Senator \nKennedy and hundreds of mourners from Massachusetts and around the \ncountry, to pay our last respects to our friend Kirk O'Donnell and to \noffer our sincere condolences to Kirk's wife, Kathy, and their two \nchildren, Holly and Brendan. For all of us who knew and admired Kirk, \nthis was a difficult morning at the Holy Name Church in West Roxbury, \ndifficult to say goodbye to a special friend who left us too soon. But \nMr. President, I believe everyone in attendance this morning at the \nfuneral services took some comfort in the way that friends and family \nalike--and Kirk had both many friends and a tight-knit family--came \ntogether to share our personal recollections of Kirk. It was striking \nto see just how deeply everyone respected Kirk O'Donnell, the many ways \nin which he touched so many lives.\n  Kirk O'Donnell made a deep impact on those who knew him, certainly, \nbut he also made a difference for millions of people in this country \nwho never met him, but whose lives are better because of his life of \ncommitted service. Three articles in today's newspapers, one by Al Hunt \nof the Wall Street Journal, another by Tom Oliphant of the Boston Globe \nand yet another by Susan Estrich of the Boston Herald, stood out in my \nmind as testimony to the legacy Kirk O'Donnell left behind in this \ncountry. Al Hunt, Tom Oliphant, and Susan Estrich knew Kirk O'Donnell \nas a friend and they performed a great service in capturing Kirk's \nessence, the depth of a man who never stopped fighting for those causes \nin which he believed. I know that, as we all say goodbye to Kirk \nO'Donnell this week, those articles provide both comfort for those who \nknew Kirk, and inspiration for those who, even in these troubled \npolitical times in the United States, still believe in the dignity of \npublic service.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that these articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The articles follow:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 10, 1998]\n\n            The Loss of a Talented, Decent and Honorable Man\n\n                          (By Albert R. Hunt)\n\n       Kirk O'Donnell, one of the ablest and most honorable people \n     in American politics, died suddenly last weekend at the \n     altogether too young age of 52. Even in grieving, it's \n     somehow hard not to think how different the Clinton \n     presidency might have been if Kirk O'Donnell had been a top \n     White House adviser starting in 1993.\n       He combined the best virtues of the old and the new \n     politics. Raised in the rough-and-tumble environs of Boston \n     tribal warfare, he never saw politics as anything but a \n     contact sport. But he always practiced it with decency and \n     civility.\n       He was a great student of political history, which better \n     enabled him to appreciate contemporary changes. There was a \n     pragmatism to Kirk O'Donnell that never conflicted with his \n     commitment and total integrity.\n       Success never changed him. He founded the influential \n     Center for National Policy (his successor as its chair was \n     Madeleine Albright) and then became a partner in the high-\n     powered law firm of Vernon Jordan and Bob Strauss. But his \n     values and devotion to family, friends and country were \n     remarkably constant.\n       ``He was a big oak tree of a friend,'' notes Stanley Brand, \n     a Washington lawyer, of the former Brown University football \n     star, a description which Mr. O'Donnell used to joke, was an \n     ``oxymoron.''\n       He cut his political teeth working for Mayor Kevin White in \n     Boston in the mid-70s, running the neighborhood city halls, \n     developing an appreciation of the relationships between \n     common folks and government that would serve him well for the \n     next quarter century. Then there were more than seven years \n     as chief counsel to House Speaker Tip O'Neill.\n       There was an exceptional triumvirate of top aides to the \n     speaker: Leo Diehl, his longtime colleague who was the link \n     to the past and the gatekeeper who kept away the hangers-on; \n     Ari Weiss, although only in his twenties, unrivaled as a \n     policy expert; and Kirk O'Donnell, in his early thirties, who \n     brought political, legal and foreign policy expertise to the \n     table, always with superb judgment.\n       Through it may seem strange in today's Congress, he \n     commanded real respect across the aisle. ``Kirk was really a \n     tough, bright opponent; he was a great strategist because he \n     didn't let his emotions cloud his judgment,'' recalls Billy \n     Pitts, who was Mr. O'Donnell's Republican counterpart working \n     with GOP House Leader Bob Michel. ``But he always was a \n     delight to be around and his word was gold.''\n       When the Democrats were down, routed by the Reagan \n     revolution in 1981, it was Kirk O'Donnell who put together a \n     strategy memorandum advising the party to lay off esoteric \n     issues and not to refight the tax issues but to focus on \n     social security and jobs. It was the blueprint for a big \n     Democratic comeback the next year. When then Republican \n     Congressman Dick Cheney criticized the speaker for tough \n     partisanship, Mr. O'Donnell immediately turned it around by \n     citing a book that Rep. Cheney and his wife had written on \n     House leaders that praised the same qualities that he now was \n     criticizing.\n       For operated as well at that intersection of substance and \n     politics, or understood both as well. He played a major role \n     in orchestrating a powerful contingent of Irish-American \n     politicians, including the speaker, to oppose pro-Irish \n     groups espousing violence. ``Kirk put the whole Irish thing \n     together,'' the speaker said.\n       He was staunchly liberal on the responsibility of \n     government to care for those in need or equal rights. But he \n     cringed when Democrats veered off onto fringe issues, and \n     never forgot the lessons learned running neighborhood city \n     halls in his 20's. Family values to Kirk O'Donnell wasn't a \n     political buzzword or cliche, but a reality of life; there \n     never has been a more loving family than Kirk and Kathy \n     O'Donnell and their kids, Holly and Brendan.\n       The Clinton administration made job overtures to Kirk \n     O'Donnell several times but they were never commensurate with \n     his talents. He should have been either Chief of Staff or \n     legal counsel from the very start of this administration. He \n     would have brought experience, expertise, maturity, judgment, \n     toughness--intimate knowledge of the way Washington works--\n     that nobody else in that White House possessed.\n       But sadly, that's not what this president sought. For Kirk \n     O'Donnell wouldn't have tolerated dissembling. He never was \n     unfaithful to those he worked for but ``spinning''--as in \n     situational truths--was foreign to him. When working for the \n     speaker of Michael Dukakis in 1988, he would dodge, bob, \n     sometimes talk gibberish but never, in hundreds of interviews \n     with me, did he ever dissemble.\n       The contrast between this and someone like Dick Morris, who \n     Mr. Clinton continuously turned to, is striking. This was \n     brought home anew when Mr. Morris, the former top Clinton \n     aide, wrote a letter seeming to take issue with a column I \n     wrote a few weeks ago.\n       For starters, he erroneously denied that he suggested \n     Hillary Clinton is a lesbian. More substantively, Mr. Morris \n     says that Mr. Clinton called him when the Lewinsky story \n     broke and had him do a poll to gauge reaction. He did that \n     and told Mr. Clinton the public wouldn't accept the truth. \n     Although Mr. Morris turned over what he says is that poll to \n     Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, some of us question \n     whether the survey was genuine.\n       The infamous political consultant swears he sampled 500 \n     people, asked 25 to 30 questions and did it all out of own \n     pocket for $2,000. If true, it was a slipshod survey upon \n     which the president reportedly decided to stake his word. \n     (Only days later, Mr. Clinton swore at a private White Hose \n     meeting that he hadn't spoken to Mr. Morris in ages.)\n       There was no more an astute analyst of polls than Kirk \n     O'Donnell. He would pepper political conversations with \n     survey data. But because he understood history and had such \n     personal honor he always understood a poll was a snapshot, \n     often valuable. But it never could be a substitute for \n     principle or morality or integrity.\n       There were currencies of his professional and personal \n     life. These no longer are commonplace commodities in \n     politics, which is one of many reasons that the passing of \n     this very good man is such a loss.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Boston Globe, Sept. 10, 1998]\n\n                   He Stood for Politics at its Best\n\n                          (By Thomas Oliphant)\n\n       He was arguably the best mayor Boston never had, among a \n     handful of people who mattered most to the turbulent city of \n     the 1970's.\n       No one did more for the House of Representatives over the \n     last generation who was never elected to it, no history of \n     national affairs in the 1980s is complete without his large \n     thumbprint.\n       The last four presidents have known all about his special \n     gifts and felt their impact;\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\n     the two Democrats (the completely different Jimmy Carter and \n     Bill Clinton) had more than one occasion to depend on them \n     big time.\n       On an average day he could get your brother a fair shot at \n     the police force, help repair Social Security, broker the \n     biggest tax bill of modern times, keep the Big Dig's cash \n     coming, and still make it home for supper.\n       All across the intersections where politics and government \n     meet in the interests of real people, the shock and pain at \n     Kirk O'Donnell's death over the Labor Day weekend is the only \n     recent event to unite Republicans, congressional Democrats, \n     and Clintonities in this season of shame and ugliness.\n       You'd think all this emotion concerned a senior statesman \n     passing on after a long lifetime of service, the occasion for \n     a proud-sad moment to celebrate a life lived magnificently.\n       But the shock and pain arrived like a rusty blade in the \n     gut because O'Donnell was only 52; he did things in his 30s \n     and 40s that big shots in their 60s never accomplished. But \n     the best was still ahead of him, and the sky was the limit; \n     if the Democrats ever elect another president, a Cabinet post \n     or chief of the White House staff would have been lateral \n     movements for him.\n       This is the kind of death that shakes your faith, making it \n     all the more important to reaffirm it. And the fact is this \n     blend of Dorchester and D.C., of Boston Latin and Brown was a \n     walking reaffirmation of faith in the potential of public \n     service, a shining example of the silent majority who don't \n     broker votes for cash, check their principles at the front \n     desk, ignore their families, welsh on their commitments, \n     indulge their whims and their urges, lie, and shirk. His life \n     demonstrates that at the end only two things matter--whether \n     your word's any good and how you treat others.\n       Two stories: Kevin Hagen White gets the credit for \n     discovering him in the early years of decentralized \n     innovation and leadership and hope for the racially polarized \n     town. By 1975, the young political junkie who could explain \n     Boston by precinct or by parish was entrusted with White's \n     third-term reelection campaign.\n       It was the roughest, ugliest, closest fight in modern \n     Boston times. The people involved, despite all they've done \n     since, still get together to tell the old stories and refight \n     the old shouting matches. The one reputation that was \n     enhanced by the bruising experience was O'Donnell's, for \n     focusing like a laser beam on organizing the White vote and \n     focusing on Joe Timilty's lack of a clear alternative.\n       After it was over and he was down in Washington with Tip \n     O'Neill, it was increasingly clear that his former boss had \n     lost his fastball. Again and again, from the shadows of the \n     speaker's rooms in the Capitol, O'Donnell saw to Boston's \n     interests. He would happily recount to me the stories of \n     program formulas rejiggered to benefit the cities, of special \n     items in appropriations bills (worth billions of dollars over \n     time) as long as I understood that if I used his name in \n     public he would rip my lungs out.\n       Just for the record, O'Donnell was more than enough of a \n     city lover and urban scholar to know about subway analogies \n     in politics. But he was the guy, in 1981, who called Social \n     Security the third rail of American politics; few lines have \n     been ripped off more. But he did it to make a point--that \n     Ronald Reagan had touched it by reaching beyond his mandate \n     to try to slash future benefits in a partisan initiative. \n     With the help of the worst recession in 50 years, he and \n     Speaker O'Neill pounced on that goof to effectively end the \n     Reagan Revolution.\n       But that same skill was then put to use on the speaker's \n     behalf to help broker a bipartisan repair job that has lasted \n     15 years and made the next stage of generational common sense \n     possible. He was to Congress in the 1980s what Jim Baker was \n     to the Reagan White House.\n       He was a big guy, with a big voice he rarely used except to \n     laugh. Everyone trusted him. There are tears being shed today \n     in saloons and salons, in boardrooms and in back rooms. Kirk \n     O'Donnell's life demonstrates the power of the haunting \n     challenge made famous by the Kennedys, that all of us can \n     make a difference and that each of us should try.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Boston Herald, Sept. 10, 1998]\n\n                      O'Donnell, Best of the Breed\n\n                           (By Susan Estrich)\n\n       A good man died on Saturday. He had a big smile, a big \n     laugh and a great deal of power over the years. He used it \n     well.\n       Ask people what they think of politics today, and the \n     answer is generally not suitable for children to hear. The \n     only things worse than politicians are the handlers and hacks \n     who try to tell them what to do and us what to think, and \n     then turn around and make money trashing their boss and the \n     business they were in.\n       Kirk O'Donnell wasn't like that. He gave politics a good \n     name.\n       Kirk was 52 when he died, jogging near his summer home in \n     Scituate. He lived in Washington for most of his adult life \n     and advised some of its most powerful men, but he was \n     definitely a boy of Boston, and its politics--the way it \n     should be.\n       He made his name working for Mayor Kevin White, who had \n     promised to bring government to the people, which he did by \n     creating ``little city halls'' in Boston's neighborhoods. \n     Kirk's was a trailer in Fields Corner, where he helped \n     working people who had no contacts or connections to be \n     treated as if they did. He negotiated the system for them; he \n     was their powerful friend and you didn't need a PAC to get \n     his attention.\n       Later, working for Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill (a \n     Cambridge resident), he said he had learned what he needed to \n     know about Congress working at Fields Corner. I'm certain \n     that he didn't just mean the business of politics--of phone \n     calls and favors and chits to be spent--although given \n     Congress, that is the most obvious meaning. For Kirk, the \n     more important part of the lesson had to be about what \n     politics is for.\n       Most people in politics work on either issues or politics, \n     but not both. In this world, issues people tend to be viewed \n     as nerds and wonks, a clear step beneath the gunslingers who \n     do the politics and tell the speechwriters what to write. \n     Kirk played both parts with equal ease; he was as good at one \n     as the other, a rare combination that he used to bring \n     legitimacy to the world of substance and substance to the \n     world of politics. After his stint in the speaker's office, \n     when he could have had any political job in town, he decided \n     to help build a think-tank instead, giving the Center for \n     National Policy a legitimacy that came from the fact that \n     Kirk was heading it.\n       In 1988, I literally begged him to come to Boston to help \n     me in the presidential campaign of Gov. Michael Dukakis. We \n     were still doing well in the polls, but our communications \n     problems were internal as well as external. He could see it \n     when he came to talk to Dukakis and me. I was honest. To \n     some, at the time, it certainly must have looked like a dream \n     position: join the campaign of the nominee, who is heading \n     for the convention and telling you that you are to be his \n     chief political adviser. But Kirk knew better, and so did I. \n     We needed him; he didn't need us.\n       It turned out worse than we anticipated. Kirk could have \n     spent a good deal of time explaining to the press, on \n     background to be sure, how the campaign's biggest gaffes were \n     contrary to his advice, how he had argued for this or that, \n     written the lines himself or never even had the opportunity \n     to--as the president's aides do regularly these days. But he \n     never did. He never would. He grew up in Boston, where \n     loyalty means standing by people when they're wrong and \n     working for someone means being loyal to him.\n       Kirk leaves two children behind. Losing a father is \n     terrible at any age, but when he is young and you need him, \n     and he is a man like Kirk, it is an especially acute pain. I \n     lost my father when he was 54, and I know all the trite \n     sayings about how some people live a lifetime in a few years, \n     and they inspire others and live on through their friends and \n     family.\n       It is all true, but it is still not enough. Time does heal; \n     deaths become part of our history. But the sad truth is that \n     a good man died on Saturday, and he will be much missed, as \n     he was much loved and respected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10219-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10220-S10221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to \nfight for the men of our country. I am referring to the cancer that has \nbeen most frequently diagnosed, in the last decade, in American men--\nprostate cancer. This cancer kills 40,000 American men every year and I \nam shocked we are even hesitating to appropriate the necessary funding \nto enable the Department of Defense to win this battle and find a cure.\n  I realize that I often find myself in this same place, fighting for \nwomen's health. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have \nconsistently fought to provide the necessary funding for breast cancer \nresearch. Just this year, I offered an amendment to the DoD \nauthorization bill that appropriated $175 million for the Breast Cancer \nResearch Program. However, this is a critical time to invest in medical \nresearch, all medical research, including prostate cancer.\n  Mr. President, we need to fight for the lives of our husbands, \nbrothers, sons, fathers, and grandfathers of America, as well as their \nfamilies. Death from cancer is tragic yet even more so knowing that we \nare on the verge of finding a cure. I have been very pleased with the \nresults of breast cancer research and I know that if we gave the DoD \nadequate funding, it would produce equally impressive results saving \nthousands of men who would have otherwise not survived this ravaging \ndisease. I believe we have the science and technology to put an end to \nunnecessary prostate cancer fatalities.\n  I am fully confident that our medical community can step up and find \na cure for prostate cancer. However, it is the duty of my colleagues \nand I to provide medical researchers the resources they need to do so. \nNow is the time to have faith in our scientific community and stand \nbehind the DoD. President Clinton got the ball rolling when he funded\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\nthe first cycle of prostate cancer research grants. However, this is \nnot enough. If the DoD is to maintain its program at its current level, \nit requires an appropriation in FY99 of $80 million. There is no \nquestion in my mind what we need to do.\n  It is a stark reality that one in every six American men will be \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Most victims of \nthis disease are over the age of 65. Upon entering the Senate, I \nrequested to be put on the Veterans Committee to ensure the veterans of \nWashington state were getting the recognition and benefits to which \nthey are entitled. Many of the men suffering from prostate cancer are \nveterans. They fought for our country and our freedom. It is time we \nreturned the favor and find the cure to a disease that threatens them \nall.\n  Now is the time to tackle prostate cancer with equal vigor as breast \ncancer. This is not about decreasing statistics, but is about \npreventing American families from having to deal with this fatal \ndisease. We must act now. To postpone this essential decision is \nunacceptable. We must have faith in our medical community and allow \nthem to find the cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10220-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRUTH IN EMPLOYMENT ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, 7 years ago last month, hard-line and \naging Communist bosses in the Soviet Union made a clumsy attempt at a \ncoup d'etat against then President Gorbachev. The coup accelerated the \nslow-motion implosion of the Soviet empire. By December of that year, \nour old nemesis had collapsed in an overwhelming, decisive and total \nvictory for the United States. This ended 50 years of cold war that had \nexacted a tremendous toll in blood, sweat and treasure from our Nation. \nOur emotions ran the gamut from pride to relief--relief especially that \nthe dark cloud of nuclear annihilation seemed to have passed and, in a \nmore subtle way, relief that the heavy burden of leading the world in a \nbattle for freedom against communism had been lifted from our \nshoulders. We clamored for a peace dividend. We reveled in our newfound \nability to focus the Nation's energy on domestic affairs.\n  But the last few weeks of events in Russia have been a rude wake-up \ncall, a convincing demonstration that neither the danger nor the burden \nhave been lifted. If anything, Mr. President, they are greater. \nRussia's economy and currency have been stressed to the point of \nbreaking. President Yeltsin's government is in grave crisis. The men \nand women who tend Russia's nuclear arsenal--the one remaining threat \non this planet to the instantaneous extinction of the United States--\nhave not been paid, by some reports, inasmuch as a year.\n  The danger is still great, Mr. President, but so is the burden, and \nit is that burden I want to discuss this evening.\n  We may react to these developments with a tinge of surprise. It is an \naxiom of the American tradition--an axiom, incidentally, in which I \nfirmly believe--that democracies do not behave this way. When last most \nof us tuned in to the Russian saga, they had held democratic elections. \nThey had abandoned central planning and other tenets of Communist \nideology and embraced basic precepts of capitalism. They had agreed to \nswallow the magic elixir that we all assumed would cure the disease and \nnow--just when we thought it might be safe to retreat from our global \nresponsibilities--they are sick again. And once again, the burden of \nglobal leadership is thrust upon us.\n  What happened?\n  Let me stipulate, first of all, that I don't believe capitalism and \ndemocracy are magic elixirs that cure all diseases in a single dose. \nBut I do believe that, taken as a rigorous regimen of treatment, they \nare about as good a cure for a whole variety of ills as we will ever \nfind.\n  What we are learning, Mr. President, isn't that democracy and free \nmarkets are bad medicine, but that it is tough medicine that works as \npart of a sustained regimen. We are learning that democracy does not \nexist simply because the first election was called, and that capitalism \ndoes not exist the moment after the central planners are fired. \nInfrastructure must be built to sustain and manage these systems in a \nlawful manner. I believe the true test of the success of Russia will be \ndetermined by our ability to help the Russian people build this \ninfrastructure.\n  The first institution that must undergird capitalism and democracy is \nthe rule of law. The importance of that institution is illustrated by \none of this century's great inventions, the airplane. Five years passed \nfrom the first successful flight at Kitty Hawk to the first public \ndemonstration of the ``Wright Model A'' in France. The reason is that \nthe Wright brothers were busy litigating a patent. It was that \nprotection--the protection of law for their invention--that unleashed \nthe ingenuity of the air age. Without the knowledge that the law \nprotected their right to earn a living off their own ingenuity, the air \nage might never have been born.\n\n  It is exactly this sort of simple institution of law that makes \ncapitalism possible. Such institutions do not yet exist in Russia.\n  There is a joke that in America, when two businessmen agree on \nsomething, put their agreement down on a piece of paper and sign their \nnames to it, they have a contract. In Russia, all they have is a piece \nof paper. Without the rule of law, the simple act of opening a \nbusiness, marketing a new idea or so much as buying a house becomes \nfoolish and risky.\n  What we have learned, and what the Russian people are learning, is \nthat democracy is also hard work, and our challenge now is to help the \nRussian people build the institutions that enable freedom to succeed. \nThat Russia is still struggling to make democracy work should come as \nno surprise to us. For 222 years, we have been struggling with the same \nquestions. On this day we are debating a bill whose goal is to fine-\ntune our own democracy. We helped the Russian people become free; now \nwe must help them do the much harder work of being free. Mr. President, \nthe true test of the success of Russia will be determined by our \nability to help the Russian people build this infrastructure.\n  Despite these tall hurdles, the Russian people deserve credit for the \nlong distance they have traveled.\n  They have created a democratic environment with the guarantee of \nessential freedoms like speech and press.\n  They have a functioning democratic electoral system. Boris Yeltsin is \nthe democratically elected President of Russia. In turn, there is a \ndemocratically elected Duma controlled by an opposition party. As a \nresult, Russia has learned the lesson that we in this body know all too \nwell--democratic politics sometimes means gridlock.\n  Here as I see them are the areas in which Russia has fallen short:\n  Simply put, they have not done enough to establish the rule of law.\n  Because the style of capitalism they have implemented does not rest \non the solid base of the rule of law, economic interactions have become \ndistorted and unstable.\n  The government has not lived up to its responsibilities, and by \nfailing to collect taxes and pay pensions, back wages and so forth, the \ngovernment has lost the faith of the people. Corrupt privatization of \nstate-owned enterprises and the failure to implement reforms, such as \nthe protection of private property, have given the people a distorted \nvision of capitalism.\n  Take just the collection of taxes. We all know in this body that we \njust reformed the laws governing our Internal Revenue Service and \nreformed them because a significant percentage of Americans no longer \ntrusted the tax collector.\n  But what we failed to acknowledge is, as bad as our system is, and as \nmuch as it can be improved--and I hope this legislation will improve \nit--a well functioning tax collector is a critical part, and a trusted \ntax collector is a critical part, of a functioning free market \ndemocratic form of Government.\n  As a result, the Russian people have become discouraged by ``cowboy \ncapitalism'' and do not realize a true market economy should have the \nchecks and balances of the rule of law.\n  Mr. President, we cannot be content to treat these simply as Russia's \nproblems. And I submit there are three reasons why we cannot.\n  First, Russia's problems are our problems. Our own economy is not \nclosely entwined with theirs, but it is not insulated either. \nFurthermore, the\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\npotential consequence of allowing this economic crisis to spread \nthroughout the world poses too great a threat to our own economic \nsecurity to stand idly by and watch the total collapse of the Russian \npolitical and economic system. Much more ominously, political \ninstability and nuclear weapons are a dangerous mix.\n  Second, the Russian people are human beings who are suffering. Our \nhearts and hands of assistance should go out to them.\n  Third, and most important, the United States of America is the \nfirstborn child of democracy in the modern age. We are the oldest and \nmost successful, and when democracy is being born, history has called \nus to the duty of being its midwife, not a disinterested observer in \nthe waiting room. We may wish this burden had been not cast on us, but \nit has. This is our duty.\n  Mr. President, what can we do?\n  First of all, I believe we must look at Russian democracy in terms of \ndecades, not just years. The future is still very bright for them. It \nis a great nation blessed with vast resources and talented people. I \nremain confident that the transition to democracy will be successful. \nNothing will cool their ardor for democratic reforms more than if we \nbecome pessimistic about the possibility of their democracy surviving.\n  We know it is tough. We know it is difficult. All of us have faced \ndifficult moments in a democracy where we have wondered whether or not \nour system itself could work, but we always rise to the task. We always \nmanage to rise to the challenge, to do that little more that is \nnecessary to make our system work. We simply have to say to the Russian \npeople over and over: ``Do not be discouraged. It's far better than \nwhat you had before. The rule of law and the opportunity to govern \nyourself will be frustrating, it will produce disappointments, but do \nnot stop persevering. Your children and your grandchildren will reward \nyou with praise if you do.''\n  Secondly, Mr. President, we have to continue to engage Russia as a \npartner. Not only is it desirable for us to do so as a consequence of \ntheir need, but it is desirable for us to do so as a consequence of \nours. They are a permanent member of the Security Council. They are \nactively involved in many of the most important world issues that we \nface. And it is imperative that we continue to treat them as a full \npartner.\n  Third, we must continue to support the International Monetary Fund. \nWhile imperfect, and certainly demanding reform itself to become more \nopen to our observation to know what they are doing and the decisions \nthat they are making, it is still the only institution that pools the \nworld's resources to address large-scale financial crises. I am pleased \nthat the Senate has once again passed legislation to provide $18 \nbillion to replenish the IMF's capital base.\n  Next, we must continue to work with the Russians on arms control and \nsecurity issues. Instability in Russia is still the greatest foreign \nthreat to our safety. Working to reduce nuclear and conventional arms \nwill help Russia financially and improve the safety of the American \npeople.\n  I do not mean to imply by that that arms control all by itself will \nsolve this problem. We have lived through the tragedy of disarmament \nfrom the Second World War. We watched what happened when this Nation \nsaid in the 1920s: There are no threats out there, and therefore we are \ngoing to disarm. We have an obligation, based upon that memory, to keep \nour military and Armed Forces as strong as necessary, not just to meet \ntoday's threats but to meet tomorrow's threats. Still, it is true that \nthe great amount of effort to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons \nwill produce tremendous benefits not just to the people of the United \nStates but to the people of all of this world.\n  Our most important long-term challenge, though, is working with \nRussia to develop the rule of law. This has to be a hands-on process of \nteaching. I believe the most important effort is likely to be the least \nexpensive, and that is just long-term exchange programs, giving their \npeople a chance to come here to see how democracy works, to understand \nthe importance of having that law there to protect you not only so you \ncan speak but so that you can start your business and enjoy the \nbenefits that come as a consequence of the reward that we provide \npeople in the market system--and it simply isn't there--to show them \nthat we have also faced in the past problems with Government officials \nwho are corrupted, but again the rule of law is there to protect the \npeople, that they cannot tolerate corruption and they need not tolerate \ncorruption in order to have a market system, and that they should not \nbe discouraged as a consequence of the failures and the problems that \nthey experience in the birthing years of their democracy and their \nmarket system.\n  We need to tell them, Mr. President, as we no doubt can, that we \nexperience similar problems, that it is a long voyage, that we on the \nFourth of July, we on Memorial Day, and we on Veterans Day, and we in \ngreat moments in our history stand and pay tribute not to ourselves but \nto our forefathers for the sacrifice of blood, for the sacrifice of \ntreasury, for putting themselves on the line for our freedom.\n  We need to say that the burden on freedom is a great burden, that \nfreedom is not free, that in wartime we must do as John Miller in \n``Saving Private Ryan'' did--put down our chalk and give up our careers \nas teachers and put our lives on the line at the beaches of Normandy.\n  But in peacetime the burden is, we have to put our own selves on the \nline to fight to make our laws give people the protection and the \nfreedom that they deserve, to come together and argue, to come together \nwith our ideas, as we do here, day after day after day.\n  We have, I think, an opportunity, through exchange programs, through \nvery small hands-on efforts, an opportunity to show the people of \nRussia that their great character that enabled them to turn back \nNapoleon, that enabled them to turn back Adolph Hitler, that enabled \nthem to survive so much that it is almost unimaginable that they were \nable to get the job done, that a people that can do that can make \ndemocracy and free markets work not just for them but for their \nfutures.\n  Mr. President, I hope and believe indeed there is reason to have \noptimism, that this Congress will not, on behalf of the American \npeople, shirk our responsibilities and our duties to work with the \npeople of Russia to make this experiment in democracy in their country \nas big a success as it has been for us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/10/senate-section/article/S10222-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
