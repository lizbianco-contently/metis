Mr. President, first I would like to express my thanks to \nthe Chaplain for his recognition and expression of appreciation by the \nSenate for all of those employees who actually make this institution \nwork. The Senators come to the floor and do their jobs legislatively, \nbut without all of our employees who do all the things that make the \ndoors open and the lights come on, we could not get it done.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nfor morning business until 10 a.m. Following that, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1173, the so-called ISTEA legislation, which \nfunds our Nation's surface transportation infrastructure. It is hoped \nthat the Senate will be able to make good progress on this important \nlegislation during today's session of the Senate. Therefore, Members \nwith amendments to the legislation should contact the managers of the \nbill to schedule floor time.\n  In addition, we may consider executive or legislative business \ncleared for floor action. I believe we cleared four items off the \nExecutive Calendar last night. So, rollcall votes are still possible in \ntoday's session, but unless we see more activity than we saw yesterday \nafternoon, I don't know that we will get to a recorded vote. But we \nwill have some announcement on that at the earliest possible time after \nI consult with the managers of the bill and the minority leader.\n  Let me say again, there have been a lot of speeches made on the \nfloor, both last year and earlier this year over the past month, about \nhow important this legislation is, how anxious Senators are to get on \nthis legislation. I have a half dozen to a dozen letters on my desk \nfrom Senators saying, ``Let's get started; this is so important.''\n  Where are you? We need some amendments. Let's throw it up here on the \nwall. Let's get started. We are not going to be able to stay on this \nlegislation indefinitely. At some point we are going to have to say OK, \nwe are going to stay in at night, over the weekend, so we can finish \nthis legislation and move on to NATO enlargement, the budget \nresolution, the Coverdell A-plus education bill, perhaps a supplemental \nwhich would provide funds for Bosnia, Iraq, IMF--in part or in whole. \nSo, we have a lot of work to do. I have been saying that now for about \na month, and class doesn't seem to be ready to go to work and take the \ntests. So, again, I plead with my colleagues, let's get some amendments \nstarted. I am expecting by late afternoon Monday, and certainly on \nTuesday and Wednesday, we are going to be having amendments on a \nregular basis, and votes.\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\n  Let me add this additional encouragement. We are not going to let \nthis just languish. If we have to go to third reading--I have always \nhad this real desire to go to third reading and end it. There are some \n200 amendments pending out here. At some hour, some Thursday night, we \nare going to be scrambling around here trying to get an agreement on a \nlist of 50 amendments which we will then have to vote on after 5 \nminutes of debate, or 2 minutes. That's ridiculous.\n  It has been a nice 3 months, but it's time to go to work. I am going \nto be counting on some amendments very soon. If we do not have them by \nthe middle of next week, I am going to start doing everything I can to \ncut off amendments. Because if they are serious, you will come to the \nfloor and offer them.\n  With that cheery note, Mr. President, observing no Senator anxious to \nspeak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1133-5", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the latest confrontation with Iraq \nshines a harsh light on an important truth. The collapse of the Soviet \nUnion consigned to the ash heap of history has not created a world safe \nfor democracy. The ``Evil Empire'' may have vanished but, alas, the \nworld remains a dangerous and unpredictable place.\n  In Iraq, we are confronted with a dictator as evil as Hitler. Saddam \nhas killed thousands of his own citizens, licensed acts of terrorism, \nand produced and stockpiled weapons of mass destruction. It is a reign \nof terror unmatched in the post-cold war era.\n  And how has this administration responded? Rather than draw a bright \nline in the sand, the President has been relegated to the role of \nspectator.\n  The Commander in Chief has surrendered his moral authority at home \nand found himself ill-equipped to defend American interests abroad.\n  At the moment of truth, America's acting Secretary of State--Kofi \nAnnan--cut a deal with the devil and, tragically, a weakened, uncertain \nPresident endorsed the settlement before the ink had even dried.\n  Today, we hear reports that there is no final consensus on what to do \nif Iraq violates the settlement. Have we known Saddam to keep his \npromises? What if he does not adhere to the agreement as in previous \ncases? The United Nations apparently cannot come to an agreement on \nwhat to do about it.\n  The President's failure to lead has handed America's foreign policy \nto a cast of functionaries at the United Nations. Mr. President, U.S. \nforeign policy should not be subcontracted to Kofi Annan or written at \nthe United Nations. America should not sacrifice one ounce--any other \nounce--of her sovereignty to the architect and acolytes of one world \ngovernment.\n  This ill-conceived transfer of sovereignty has left America and her \nallies with an emboldened Saddam. In Iraq today, Saddam has a firmer \ngrip on power, carries more regional prestige and can sell more oil. \nSome dare call this a triumph of diplomacy.\n  As I indicated to Secretary Albright this week: ``Preservation of the \nstatus quo is not a diplomatic triumph, Madam Secretary, it's a \ntragedy. The clear winner of this round is Saddam Hussein.''\n  Instead of being penalized for his defiance, Saddam is winning bonus \npoints: more oil sales, heightened standing, and new momentum to end \nthe sanctioned regime. Ironically, in agreeing to agree, Saddam has \ncommitted to do nothing more than he was obliged to do all along.\n  Mr. President, by the grace of God, America won the cold war. We \ntriumphed over the ``Evil Empire'' of Lenin and Stalin. It is time for \nus to stand again for liberty and freedom.\n  Saddam is a brutal dictator, a tyrant whose actions at home betray \nhis intentions abroad.\n  Let us sound a certain trumpet for America's vital national \ninterests--in the Middle East and around the world. Let us not be \ngoverned by the whims and the will of Kofi Annan and the United \nNations. Let America lead the world by the force of our principles and \nthe power of our ideas, with the hope that one day the long tug of \nmemory might look favorably upon us as we look approvingly on those who \nanswered freedom's call in decades past.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a column which appeared \nin the Washington Post, Friday, the 27th of February, by Charles \nKrauthammer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      A Deal That's Worse Than Worthless--Peace in Our Time--Again\n\n       Two days before Kofi Annan made his ``breakthrough'' in \n     Baghdad, the U.N. Security Council, with U.S. approval, \n     authorized a huge increase in the amount of oil that Iraq can \n     sell. In a stroke, this ``humanitarian'' gesture doubled \n     Iraq's oil income to $10.5 billion a year. Iraq can now sell \n     nearly 2 million barrels a day--about two-thirds of the oil \n     it was selling when producing at peak capacity before the \n     embargo. And that number does not even count the oil that we \n     know Saddam is illegally smuggling through Iranian coastal \n     waters.\n       At this U.N.- and U.S.-authorized level, Iraq--under \n     sanctions!--becomes the eighth-largest oil exporter in the \n     world.\n       This embargo-buster passed with little fanfare. It barely \n     made the back pages of the newspapers. All hands pretended, \n     moreover, that there was no linkage between this bonanza and \n     the subsequent Saddam-Annan deal in Baghdad.\n       But remember that last November, when the administration \n     was desperately looking for a way out of the last Iraq \n     crisis, the State Department said we'd be willing to offer \n     Saddam a ``carrot'' to get him to be nice. Such as? Such as a \n     sharp increase in the amount of ``humanitarian'' oil that \n     Iraq could sell.\n       So last time, when Saddam broke the Gulf War agreements and \n     kicked out U.S. arms inspectors, the carrot was offered. This \n     time, when Saddam broke the Gulf War agreements and stymied \n     all the arms inspectors, the carrot was delivered.\n       Last time, President Clinton flapped about threateningly, \n     then watched meekly as the Russian foreign minister brokered \n     a ``compromise.'' This time, Clinton flapped about \n     threateningly, then watched meekly as the U.N. secretary \n     general brokered a new ``compromise.''\n       Last time, Clinton's U.N. ambassador crowed that Saddam had \n     ``blinked.'' This time, Madeleine Albright's spokesman deemed \n     the deal ``win-win'' for us.\n       Last time, the deal turned out to be completely worthless, \n     giving Saddam four more months to hide his nasty stuff. This \n     time, the deal is worse than worthless, giving Saddam crucial \n     victories on the two issues he cares most about: economic \n     sanctions and weapons inspections.\n       1. Sanctions. Not only did Saddam incur no penalty for his \n     open defiance of the United Nations and open provocation of \n     the United States, he was treated by Annan with a deference \n     and flattery that bordered on the indecent. Moreover, the \n     Annan-Saddam Memorandum of Understanding breathes not a word \n     of criticism about Iraq's violating previous agreements, nor \n     about its creating this crisis. On the contrary, Annan \n     trashed his own arms inspectors (UNSCOM) as unruly \n     ``cowboys'' and undertook, in writing, to bring Saddam's \n     ultimate objective, the lifting of sanctions, ``to the full \n     attention of the members of the Security Council.''\n       Sure enough, upon his return to New York, Annan began \n     emphasing the need to show Iraq ``the light at the end of the \n     tunnel,'' the Iraqi code phrase for ending sanctions. Like \n     Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who brokered the \n     first nonagreement in November, Annan has become Saddam's \n     sanctions-lifting advocate to the world. Unlike Saddam buddy \n     and ex-KGB biggie Primakow, however, Annan is an effective \n     shill.\n       2. Inspections. The United States had demanded no retreat \n     from free and full access and no tampering by Iraq with the \n     composition and authority of UNSCOM teams. Annan came back \n     with a radical change in the composition of the inspection \n     teams and a serious erosion of their authority. Inspection of \n     ``presidential sites,'' those huge complexes with hundreds of \n     buildings where Saddam could be hiding anything, is taken \n     away from control of UNSCOM, the tough inspectors whose \n     probity we can rely on.\n       These sites are instead entrusted to a new body, headed by \n     an Annan appointee. It will comprise political appointees, \n     including diplomat-spies from Iraq-friendly France, Russia \n     and China, as well as inspectors who presumably possess the \n     requisite delicacy and sensitivity to Iraqi feelings. Iraqis \n     can be so\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\n     touchy about their stores of poison gas and anthrax.\n       How do you carry out a spot inspection--the only kind that \n     has any hope of finding anything--when you first have to \n     notify and await the arrival of, say, the Russian appointee, \n     who has a hot line to the very Iraqi regime he is supposed to \n     inspect? Inspector Clouseau has a better chance of finding \n     concealed nerve gas than this polyglot outfit of compromised \n     politicians and handpicked inspectors.\n       So tote it up. For Saddam: No penalty. Annan shilling for \n     his demand to end all sanctions. UNSCOW undermined. \n     Presidential palaces secure for storing anthrax and such. And \n     his oil output doubled.\n       Another triumph of Clinton diplomacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1134-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1135-S1147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Forests and rangelands, and the resources of forests \n     and rangelands, are of strategic economic and ecological \n     importance to the United States, and the Federal Government \n     has an important and substantial role in ensuring the \n     continued health, productivity, and sustainability of the \n     Nation's forests and rangelands.\n       ``(2) Over 75 percent of the productive commercial forest \n     land in the United States is in private ownership, with some \n     60 percent owned by small nonindustrial private owners. These\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\n     10,000,000 nonindustrial private owners are critical to \n     providing both commodity and noncommodity values to the \n     citizens of the United States.\n       ``(3) The National Forest System manages only 17 percent of \n     the Nation's commercial timberlands, with over half of the \n     standing softwoods inventory located on those lands. Dramatic \n     changes in Federal agency policy during the early 1990's have \n     significantly curtailed the management of this vast timber \n     resource, causing abrupt shifts in the supply of timber from \n     public to private ownership. As a result of these shifts in \n     supply, some 60 percent of total wood production in the \n     United States is now coming from private forest lands in the \n     southern United States.\n       ``(4) At the same time that pressures are building for the \n     removal of even more land from commercial production, the \n     Federal Government is significantly reducing its commitment \n     to productivity-related research regarding forests and \n     rangelands, which is critically needed by the private sector \n     for the sustained management of remaining available timber \n     and forage resources for the benefit of all species.\n       ``(5) Uncertainty over the availability of the United \n     States timber supply, increasing regulatory burdens, and the \n     lack of Federal Government support for research is causing \n     domestic wood and paper producers to move outside the United \n     States to find reliable sources of wood supplies, which in \n     turns results in a worsening of the United States trade \n     balance, the loss of employment and infrastructure \n     investments, and an increased risk of infestations of exotic \n     pests and diseases from imported wood products.\n       ``(6) Wood and paper producers in the United States are \n     being challenged not only by shifts in Government policy, but \n     also by international competition from tropical countries \n     where growth rates of trees far exceed those in the United \n     States. Wood production per acre will need to quadruple from \n     1996 levels for the United States forestry sector to remain \n     internationally competitive on an ever decreasing forest land \n     base.\n       ``(7) Better and more frequent forest inventorying and \n     analysis is necessary to identify productivity-related \n     forestry research needs and to provide forest managers with \n     the current data necessary to make timely and effective \n     management decisions.''.\n       (b) High Priority Forestry Research and Education.--\n     Subsection (d) of section 3 of the Forest and Rangeland \n     Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1642) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) High Priority Forestry and Rangelands Research and \n     Education.--The Secretary may conduct, support, and cooperate \n     in forestry and rangelands research and education that is of \n     the highest priority to the United States and to users of \n     public and private forest lands and rangelands in the United \n     States.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL-\n                   BASED AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture and the Secretary of Education should collaborate \n     and cooperate in providing both instructional and technical \n     support for school-based agricultural education.\n\n     SEC. 511. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DESIGNATION OF \n                   DEPARTMENT CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Department of Agriculture plays a crucial role in \n     ensuring that the United States is a world leader in \n     maintaining the most affordable, abundant, wholesome, and \n     safe food supply for its citizens.\n       (2) It is in the best interest of consumers, producers, \n     processors, retailers, government officials, and other \n     interested parties to ensure that any crisis that may affect \n     the operation of the Department or the production of a safe \n     and wholesome food supply is addressed in an effective \n     manner.\n       (3) Unforeseen circumstances, including natural disaster, \n     personnel management problems, threats to public health, and \n     trade disruptions, have the potential to undermine the \n     operation of the Department and the Nation's ability to \n     efficiently provide a safe, affordable, abundant, and \n     wholesome food supply.\n       (4) Department of Agriculture employees, consumer \n     confidence, and the food production sector have been \n     adversely impacted as a result of the challenges associated \n     with Federal agencies' ability to respond to incidents in a \n     coordinated and timely fashion.\n       (5) An effective response to crises, emergencies, and \n     similar situations depends upon the timely and efficient \n     coordination of Federal, State, and local government \n     agencies.\n       (6) It is in the best interests of the Nation to ensure \n     that whenever a crisis occurs the appropriate Federal \n     agencies coordinate their activities.\n       (7) The Department of Agriculture should take the lead in \n     ensuring a safe and wholesome supply of food for the Nation \n     because of its broad and diverse relationship with consumers \n     and the food production sector.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Agriculture should--\n       (1) designate a Crisis Management Team within the \n     Department of Agriculture, which would be composed of senior \n     departmental personnel with strong subject matter expertise \n     selected from each relevant agency of the Department and \n     would be headed by a team leader with strong management and \n     communications skills;\n       (2) upon establishment of such a Crisis Management Team, \n     direct that the Crisis Management Team--\n       (A) develop a department-wide crisis management plan, \n     taking into account similar plans developed by other \n     government agencies and other large organizations;\n       (B) develop detailed written procedures for implementing \n     the crisis management plan;\n       (C) conduct periodic reviews and revisions of the crisis \n     management plan and procedures;\n       (D) ensure compliance with crisis management procedures by \n     departmental personnel;\n       (E) coordinate the Department's information gathering and \n     dissemination activities concerning issues managed by the \n     Crisis Management Team;\n       (F) ensure that all employees of the Department are \n     familiar with the crisis management plan and procedures and \n     are encouraged to bring information regarding crises or \n     potential crises to the attention of team members;\n       (G) ensure that departmental spokespersons convey accurate, \n     timely, and scientifically sound information that is easily \n     understood by the target audience; and\n       (H) cooperate and coordinate with other Federal agencies, \n     States, local governments, industry, and public interest \n     groups; and\n       (3) seek to enter into cooperative agreements with other \n     Federal departments and agencies that have related programs \n     or activities to help ensure consistent, accurate, and \n     coordinated dissemination of information throughout the \n     executive branch in the event of a crisis.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Hollings and I would like to \nengage the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, \nas well as the ranking member of that Committee, Senator Harkin, in a \ncolloquy on certain provisions of S. 1150, the Agriculture Research, \nExtension, and Education Reform Act of 1997.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would be pleased to join the Senators in a colloquy on \nthis subject.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be happy to participate in the colloquy as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Commerce Committee has expressed serious concerns \nabout sections of the Senate version of S. 1150 which deal with \naquaculture and weather activities. These provisions make changes to \nexisting law relating to marine and estuarine aquaculture as well as \nfederal weather activities, subjects that are within the jurisdiction \nof the Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committee believes that these \nchanges are significant and need to be thoroughly reviewed in the \nCommerce Committee before they are enacted. We have therefore requested \nthat the Senate Agriculture Committee conferees agree to drop these \nprovisions during the conference on S. 1150. I would now like to defer \nto the Commerce Committee's ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings, for his \ncomments on this matter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I concur with the chairman of the Commerce Committee. \nThe provisions on aquaculture and weather activities in the Senate-\npassed version of S. 1150 substantially affect important issues within \nthe Commerce Committee's jurisdiction and we need to examine and \nformally consider the provisions in our committee before we can agree \nto their enactment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, our two committees have discussed this \nmatter and I understand that based on the concern expressed by the \nCommerce Committee Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin have agreed to drop \nthe provisions of concern to our Committee during conference, and to \nsubstitute in place of these provisions straight reauthorizations of \nthe National Aquaculture Act of 1980 and the National Agricultural \nWeather Information System Act of 1990. I understand further that these \nsubstitute provisions will simply extend the authorization of \nappropriations at current levels through fiscal year 2002 for each of \nthe acts, but will otherwise not change existing law.\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\nIs my understanding of the agreement correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Senator McCain is correct in his understanding of the \nagreement reached by our two Committees. While the Agriculture \nCommittee has an interest in both agricultural weather research and \nfreshwater aquaculture, Senator Harkin and I acknowledge the Commerce \nCommittee's concerns and will accommodate them. We will propose during \nthe conference that section 230 and section 211 of the Senate-passed \nversion of S. 1150 be stricken, and that language be inserted in lieu \nof these sections which only extends the authorization of \nappropriations for the two statutes through fiscal year 2002, without \nother changes to the existing laws.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I concur with the foregoing description of our \nunderstanding as well. As Senator Lugar described, we will propose to \ndrop the existing Senate provisions on aquaculture and weather \nactivities, and to substitute in their place straight reauthorizations \nof the two acts that Senator McCain mentioned.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator very much for their cooperation on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I also extend my thanks to Senator Lugar and Senator \nHarkin for addressing our concerns.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ndisagree to the amendment of the House, agree to the request for a \nconference, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Lugar, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nCoverdell, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Leahy conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1135-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1147-S1150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1173, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1173) to authorize funds for construction of \n     highways, for highway safety programs, and for mass transit \n     programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill with a modified \ncommittee amendment in the nature of a substitute (Amendment No. 1676).\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senator from \nMissouri is here. It is my understanding that he has an amendment he is \nprepared to present. I would just use this opportunity, before we start \non the Senator's amendment, to urge all Senators to come with \namendments.\n  We are ready to do business here. There are a host of amendments. As \nwe know, under the ground rules, we are not taking up amendments that \ndeal with financial matters, but there are a whole host of other \namendments that do not deal with those particular subjects. We would \ncertainly like to dispose of them. So I do urge all Senators who have \namendments to come to the floor and bring them up.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Rhode Island. \nLet me begin by saying it is high time. I am anxious for this bill to \nmove forward. I am very pleased to be here today with my colleagues to \ntalk about this very important highway and transportation legislation \nand to offer an amendment which I believe has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  Mr. President, this past October, November, I had the pleasure of \nworking with our distinguished committee chairman, Senator Chafee, and \nthe subcommittee chairman, and my good friend, Senator Warner, and the \nranking member, Senator Baucus, to forge an interim solution that \nproduced a short-term extension for this vital highway and \ntransportation legislation that provided necessary resources to make \ncertain that the orange cones and barrels that signal highway \nconstruction underway would continue to drive drivers nuts and show \nthem that progress is being made.\n\n  But as already has been pointed out on the floor numerous times over \nthe last couple weeks, we only passed an extension, one that does \nexpire. Let me tell my colleagues that getting agreement in passing the \nextension was not easy. However, it did give us an idea of the \ncomplexity of what we have ahead of us.\n  We all know the importance and the role that transportation plays in \nour everyday lives and especially in our economy. We absolutely must \nimprove upon the existing infrastructure--that is, the roads, the \nbridges, the transportation systems--and determine better ways to meet \nour transportation needs. That is why I worked with the distinguished \nchair and ranking member and the subcommittee leaders to produce the \nbill that is now pending.\n  I am very pleased to support and urge the adoption of that measure. \nAs Senator Chafee said yesterday, this bill was reported unanimously \nout of committee--I repeat, unanimously out of committee. This happened \nbecause the bill, called ISTEA II, builds our new policy solidly on our \ncommitment to the concrete and asphalt reality that roads and bridges \nare and will continue to be the foundation of our transportation \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, for me and for the people of my State of Missouri, \nhighways are not an academic debate. They are a matter of life and \ndeath. All of us have heard the statistics about how our inadequate \nhighways contribute to 114 deaths on our Nation's highways each day. \nMissouri's highway fatality rate is above the national average. I am \nreminded of these tragedies every time I go home. Every time I travel \nto a new part of the State, they have lost someone or several people on \nthe highways.\n  Missouri has roads designated as part of the National Highway System \nthat have no shoulders. We have two-lane roads carrying traffic meant \nfor four lanes. These are real death traps, because somebody who is not \nfamiliar with the road, too often an out-of-State visitor to our State, \nmakes a mistake and crosses over the center line with tragic \nconsequences to them and to some other innocent party as well. And our \nbridge needs are perhaps greater than any other State.\n  I drove last Friday over the bridge at Hermann, MO. It is an eerie \nfeeling driving over a highway bridge and looking down at the river \nbelow and seeing it through the bridge that you are driving over. Mr. \nPresident, that is not fun. That gets your attention. The people know \nthat these bridges are not going to last forever.\n  Missouri has too many highways marked with white crosses along the \nside where people have died. The white crosses are in memory of the \nloved ones who will never return because of our inadequate highways.\n  Reauthorization of this measure, this highway transportation measure, \nis imperative. We must move forward. I know that maintaining our \nNation's roads and bridges is not always a glamorous issue or \nundertaking. Too often we hear discussions about priority items that \ntake our attention away. But as with the debate raging in education \ncircles about improving our Nation's crumbling schools, so goes the \nequally important debate about improving our transportation \ninfrastructure, our roads and highways and bridges. Here it is lives we \nare talking about.\n  Mr. President, reasonable people do have passionate differences. We \nsee that every day on the Senate floor. All of us who were here in 1991 \ncan recall that debate can get ugly over those differences, especially \nwhen money is involved. Overall funding has proven to be one of the \ndifficult issues already, and the floor debates have not even started \non formulas yet.\n  We all know there are tremendous challenges in meeting our aim of \nbalancing the budget and our commitment to the American people to do \nso. I am ever mindful of and support achieving this goal. However, I do \nknow the importance of the transportation infrastructure, the roads and \nhighways and bridges and transportation needs of this country and the \ndesire to provide for increased funding to meet those needs.\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, the Appropriations Committee and \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, I am committed and pledge \nmy support in working to find a solution that will provide the \nincreased funding necessary for transportation while maintaining our \ncommitment to a balanced budget.\n  I expressed my appreciation to the majority leader, Senator Lott, and \nto our Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici, who are working \ntogether and working with us to provide the resources we need to put \nthe ``trust'' back in the highway trust fund.\n  I do support the highway money going for highways and transportation \nneeds. My goal has always been to increase the size of the overall pie \nfor highways and transportation and, as well, to increase Missouri's \nshare. I will do everything possible to ensure that the State of \nMissouri gets a full, fair share back.\n  Maybe S. 404, which is known as the Bond-Chafee Highway Trust Fund \nIntegrity Act, introduced with the distinguished chairman a year ago, \nis part of the overall funding solution. It does not take the highway \ntrust fund off budget, but it does ensure that the ``trust'' is put \nback in the trust fund. That is a goal that I believe we all share.\n  I hope that negotiations on the overall funding level continue. If we \ncan get a $28 billion highway program, let us do it. Let us work to \nachieve the allocation and the commitment of the highway trust fund \nmoneys going back to highway trust fund purposes.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, when we talk about Federal money and \nformulas, there are always clear-cut winners and losers. I know \nMissouri has been on both sides, too often on the losing side. But none \nof this goes away if we wait. I thank the majority leader and I thank \nthe chairman and the ranking member for bringing this up.\n  Now, Mr. President, unless the chairman has other matters, I wish to \nintroduce an amendment that I believe has been cleared on both sides.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1677 to amendment no. 1676\n\n   (Purpose: To require that, in funding natural habitat and wetland \n     mitigation efforts related to Federal-aid highway projects, a \n preference be given, to the maximum extent practicable, to the use of \n                       certain mitigation banks)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Breaux, and Senator Lott and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Mr. Lott \n     and Mr. Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered 1677.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reg. 58605 (November 28, 1995)) or \n     other applicable Federal law (including regulations).''; and\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment on wetlands mitigation \nbanking has been cleared by both sides, and has been reviewed by EPA \nand the Corps who have no objection. It is, I believe, consistent with \nadministration policy. It is supported by the Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials and the National Wetlands \nCoalition. I believe this amendment is good for wetlands protection. It \npromotes private sector efforts to protect wetlands, and it saves money \nthat can be used on highways or other authorized uses under this act. \nThis is a win-win-win amendment.\n  Now, let me tell you what the amendment does. It simply provides, \nwhen highway projects result in impact to wetlands that require \ncompensatory mitigation--a big word saying: If you take away a wetland \nhere, you have to restore a wetland there so we do not have any loss of \nwetlands. That is required under current law. Here in this amendment we \nsay that preference can be given, to the extent practical, to private \nsector mitigation banks.\n  The amendment mandates that the banks be approved in accordance with \nthe administration's Federal guidance on mitigation banking issued in \n1993. It requires that the bank be within the service area of the \nimpacted wetlands.\n  Mitigation is usually accomplished by restoring or creating other \nwetlands. Isolated, on-site mitigation projects are expensive and often \ncostly to maintain. Wetlands mitigation banks, on the other hand, are \ntypically large tracts of land that have been restored as wetlands. A \nState department of transportation building a highway project which \nimpacts wetlands near a bank buys ``credits'' generated from the bank \nbased on the acreage quality of restored wetlands in order to satisfy \nits obligation to mitigate the harm to impacted wetlands.\n  The bank sponsor assumes full responsibility for maintaining the \nrestored wetland site, and the State Transportation Department has \nfulfilled its mitigation requirement and can get on with the work on \nmuch-needed projects.\n  The amendment does nothing to change the mitigation requirement. It \nsimply provides that mitigation banking will be the preferred \nalternative, where available, once mitigation requirements are found to \nexist.\n  In 1996, the Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing \nwhere witnesses from the administration, the private sector, the \nenvironmental community, and the scientific community spoke to the \npromise of mitigation banking as being an important instrument to \nprotect wetlands and to do so with less expense and less red tape.\n  Robert Perciasepe, Assistant Administrator in the Office of Water at \nEPA,\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\ntestified to ``EPA's strong support for mitigation banking.''\n  In his testimony, he said, ``It's a unique win-win proposition. It's \ngreat for landowners because it makes the permitting process simpler \nand easier. . . . It's great for the environment because the \nconsolidation of multiple mitigation projects into a single, large \nmitigation bank leads to greater environmental benefit in terms of the \nenhancement of wildlife habitat and the improvement of local water \nquality and flood control.''\n  I will add that as a matter of policy, we have a great opportunity \nwith mitigation banking to protect wetlands by making wetlands \nprotection a profitable private enterprise.\n  This effort is supported by the Missouri and Ohio Departments of \nTransportation and by AASHTO. Let me quote for you a September 1997 \nletter from the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation:\n\n       ODOT's costs for onsite mitigation have ranged as high as \n     $150,000 per acre, when cost of design, real estate, \n     construction and mitigation monitoring are combined. These \n     costs are not out of line with the high-end costs experienced \n     by many other DOTs around the country. Our lowest costs for \n     onsite mitigation have generally exceeded $35,000 per acre. \n     The cost of banking, in our experience, has ranged from \n     around $10,000 to $12,000 per acre and includes all of the \n     above cited cost factors. This equates to about one-quarter \n     the cost of our average onsite mitigation.\n\n  The States of Florida and Illinois, in the Chicago area, have already \nhad a similar experience.\n  This savings is significant and it can be achieved because of \nspecialization and economies of scale. As a result, less federal \nhighway money is spent on mitigating impacts to wetlands, and more \nfederal highway money is made available for highway construction.\n  Many agree that mitigation banks, approved in accordance with \nAdministration guidance, will have a greater long term rate of success \nin protecting wetlands because: (1) they are in the business of \nwetlands protection and have the expertise; (2) banks are easier to \nregulate and be held accountable; and (3) because there is more time \nand flexibility for a bank to identify and procure high quality \nwetlands.\n  I appreciate the assistance of the chairman, Senator Chafee, and \nSenator Baucus with this amendment.\n  Again, this is good for the environment and the efficiencies will \npermit more of our precious highway dollars to be spent on highways. I \nurge the adoption of this bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for an \namendment to the Federal highway bill that is simple and \nstraightforward.\n  The amendment improves the environment and it saves federal highway \ndollars--two worthy goals.\n  The amendment establishes a preference for the use of wetlands \nmitigation banks to offset impacts to wetlands caused by the \nconstruction of highways funded under the federal highway program.\n  The amendment is not a mandate. It provides only that mitigation \nbanking is the preferred alternative for mitigating wetlands impacts \nwhere there is a bank in the area of the highway project.\n  The amendment is an incentive-based strategy for environmental \nprotection that enjoys bipartisan support. Members of Congress on both \nsides of the aisle know that this is the only real way to achieve \ncompliance.\n  The amendment is sponsored by my friends and colleagues Senators \nChristopher ``Kit'' Bond and John Breaux.\n  Mitigation banking refers to a large wetlands restoration effort \nwhere a ``bank'' of wetlands, usually 100 acres or more, is undertaken \nto compensate in advance for future wetlands losses from nearby \ndevelopment. The best sites for restoration of wetlands are often lands \nthat used to be wetlands but were drained in order to plant crops. \nMitigation bankers take a number of steps, such as breaking up drainage \ntiles, in order to reintroduce water to the site. Sometimes mitigation \nbankers replant native species, but often existing seed banks \nrevegetate the land naturally once the water has been restored. Before \nlong, a large, fully functioning wetlands ecosystem has been \nreestablished. Under federal guidelines, ``credits'' are generated \nbased on the acreage and quality of the restored wetlands. The credits \nmay then be sold to those who must restore wetlands to make up for \nthose they have been allowed to disturb in order to build their school, \noffice park, or other nearby project.\n  In the context of highway construction, mitigation banking works as \nfollows: a state department of transportation building a highway \nproject that affects wetlands near a mitigation bank may buy credits \nfrom the mitigation bank. The state DOT fulfills its mitigation \nrequirement by purchasing sufficient credits from the bank to offset \nthe loss of wetlands from the project, and the bank sponsor assumes \nfull responsibility for maintaining the restored wetlands site.\n  Of course, the current federal highway program already allows federal \nfunds to be used to mitigate adverse effects on wetlands caused by \nhighway construction. But small, isolated, on-site mitigation projects \nare expensive and costly to maintain given the many small wetlands \naffected by a typical new highway project. In contrast, mitigation \nbanks consolidate small, isolated wetlands mitigation efforts into \nlarge, high quality, diverse wetlands habitat. As a result, mitigation \nbanks provide greater environmental benefits than piecemeal mitigation.\n  The Bond-Breaux amendment provides simply that mitigation banking \nwill be the preferred alternative for wetlands mitigation efforts paid \nfor with federal highway money where there is a bank in the area of a \nhighway project. Banks must be approved under the federal guidance on \nmitigation banking.\n  In addition to benefiting the environment, use of mitigation banks \nwill save federal highway dollars that can be made available for more \nhighway construction. Experience has clearly demonstrated that private \nmitigation bankers can restore high quality wetlands at significantly \nless cost than state departments of transportation, as my colleague \nfrom Missouri has pointed out.\n  This amendment is supported by the Corps of Engineers, EPA, the \nAmerican Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, and \nnumerous state departments of transportation. Even my own State of \nMississippi believes this is a smart environmental idea and a smart \nhighway idea.\n  It doesn't surprise me that this amendment is sponsored by the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, Senator Bond's creative mind has \nproduced an innovative answer to this thorny environmental policy. All \nAmericans know the value of wetlands and recognize the contributions of \nan effective transportation infrastructure. Mr. Bond has found a way to \nbalance the problems and provide a smart solution.\n  Mr. Bond has provided a win-win solution. His amendment encourages \nthe investment of private sector resources and technology in wetlands \nrestoration. It establishes a policy that rewards doing the right thing \nfor the environment. I congratulate the Senator for his foresight, good \njudgment, and leadership.\n  I am also not surprised to see the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nBreaux, joining Senator Bond in sponsoring this amendment. I citizens \nof Louisiana know what wetlands are because most of their state is \nclassified as one. They know this type of public policy is a smart way \nto do highway business. I also commend my friend from Louisiana for his \nleadership on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, in closing, this is an excellent amendment that will \nsave federal highway dollars, benefit the environment, and allow \nfederal highway projects to go forward more quickly and with more \ncertainty. It has my strong support, and deserves that of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Missouri for \nthis amendment. It is an excellent one. What it will do is have a \nwetland of a larger size than would be under normal conditions. When \nthey do damage to a wetland, they create a new wetland next to the \nhighway. To have it in the so-called mitigation bank is a far superior \nway of operating, and I commend the Senator.\n  The amendment will improve the mitigation that is done to offset the\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nloss and degradation of wetlands as a result of highway projects. We \nhave suffered unacceptable wetlands losses--more than half of the \nestimated 220 million acres that existed when the nation was founded \nhave been lost.\n  Transportation has unintended but negative consequences on the \nnation's wetlands. The original ISTEA recognized this by establishing \nwetlands mitigation as an eligible expense of a State's highway \nconstruction funds. Mitigation banking is an innovative concept that \nallows a person who wishes to fill a wetlands to compensate for that \nloss by obtaining credits representing positive wetlands function \ngenerated at a nearby site. It is the perfect example of a forward-\nlooking environmental policy that offers more bang for the buck.\n  With respect to highway construction, mitigation banking offers \nseveral potential advantages over on-site, individual mitigation. A \nmitigation bank, unlike on-site mitigation, can consolidate wetlands \ncompensation where it is most ecologically beneficial. Moreover, \nmitigation banking helps to achieve the goal of ``no net loss'' of the \nNation's wetlands by providing additional opportunities to compensate \nfor impacted wetlands. So I thank Senators Bond and Breaux again for \ntheir work on this.\n  We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all want to protect wetlands, and we \nknow when highways are constructed that wetlands are often in jeopardy. \nIt is in the law that when a highway is constructed which does \njeopardize a wetland, an offset must be provided for; that is, the \ndeveloper or the contractor has to find some other way to enhance or \nimprove the wetland.\n  This is another step in that direction. It is a step toward greater \nefficiency, namely, where someone may enhance, develop a wetland, get \ncredit for it, and the contractor comes along and goes to the bank \nwhich already has the credit for the wetland. It is a much more \nefficient process for getting the job done. I compliment the Senator \nfrom Missouri for coming up with this idea. We accept the amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1677) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senate for accepting the Bond-\nBreaux amendment to S. 1173. It has been my privilege to cosponsor the \nproposal with the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, and to continue \nour work together on wetlands-related issues.\n  I express my deepest appreciation to the Majority Leader, Senator \nLott, and to the Committee Chairman and Ranking Member, Senator Chafee \nand Senator Baucus, for their support. I also look forward to working \nwith them on this issue as the intermodal surface transportation bill \nadvances through Congress.\n  The Bond-Breaux amendment proposes to establish a reasonable, \nresponsible wetlands and natural habitat mitigation policy as part of \nthe federal aid highway program.\n  Our language says that mitigation banking shall be the preferred \nmeans, to the maximum extent practicable, to mitigate for wetlands or \nnatural habitat which are affected as part of a federal-aid highway \nproject and whose mitigation is paid for with federal funds.\n  The amendment establishes three criteria which are to be met in order \nto use a mitigation bank: first, the affected wetlands or natural \nhabitat are to be in a bank's service area; second, the bank has to \nhave enough credits available to offset the impact; and third, the bank \nhas to meet federally-approved standards.\n  The Bond-Breaux amendment does not mandate the use of mitigation \nbanks nor does it say they shall be the sole means or the only method \nused to mitigate for wetlands or natural habitat affected by a federal-\naid highway project.\n  Mitigation banks can offer advantages when built and operated \nresponsibly, including achieving economies of scale and providing \nlarger, higher-quality diverse habitat.\n  Again, I'm pleased to join with Senator Bond in sponsoring the \namendment, pleased that it has been accepted as part of S. 1173, and \nappreciative of the support extended for it by Senator Lott, Senator \nChafee and Senator Baucus.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from Missouri. \nI see no other individual prepared to offer an amendment. I urge \nSenators to come to the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to speak out of \norder for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1147-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1150-S1152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE IRAQI CRISIS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my hope that the \nagreement reached by Secretary Annan in Iraq results in the end of a \nconflict that has plagued the international community over the past \nseven years--the failure of Saddam Hussein to live up to the terms that \nhe agreed to following the invasion of Kuwait and his defeat in the \nGulf War.\n  If Saddam has truly experienced a change of heart and has decided to \nabandon the production and concealment of weapons of mass destruction, \nthis agreement is a milestone; if this is just one more ploy to evade \nthe destruction of his arsenal, then we remain on course for a showdown \nwith Iraq.\n  We all know Saddam Hussein's record. He invaded the sovereign nation \nof Kuwait. He used chemical weapons against Iran and against his own \npeople. He used women and children as human shields to protect himself \nand his weapons of mass destruction. He is both a coward and a menace--\nand that is a dangerous combination.\n  At this time it is impossible to judge whether this deal will truly \npermit the UN weapons inspectors full and unfettered access. UNSCOM \ninspectors have always insisted that they need to be able to follow a \ntrail wherever it leads them. They are not seeking access to a certain \ncategory of sites--they just need freedom to track the evidence. If \nthis agreement permits them to do this and allows them to use whatever \ntechniques are necessary, then the agreement is a step forward. The \ninspectors do not seal off buildings because they are ``cowboys,'' they \ndo it because the Iraqi's were moving equipment out the back door as \nthey entered the front.\n  It would have been prudent for the Administration to have studied the \nplan, and clarified the details before it offered its support. But, as \nis the case with the lack of information to the Senate on the \nAdministration's plan to bomb Iraq, prudence was apparently too much to \nexpect.\n  While I am reserving judgment on the Secretary General's agreement \nuntil the terms have been thoroughly explained, one positive immediate \neffect is that it has created a pause in the crisis. The Congress has a \nresponsibility to the American people, and especially the men and women \nserving in our armed forces, to ensure that the Administration has \nclear objectives and a coherent policy in regard to Iraq. The use of \nair strikes against Iraq may have been averted in this instance, but \ngiven Saddam's track record of lies and deceit, I do not believe that \nthis is the last time that we will be forced as a nation to confront \nhim.\n  We all witnessed the Administration's public relations offensive with \nCabinet officials holding town hall meetings around the country to \nbuild public support for limited air strikes. Through these forums it \nhas become painfully clear that the Administration\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\nrefuses--or perhaps more disturbingly--cannot consistently answer four \nbasic questions: (1) What are the Administration's goals; (2) how will \nlimited air strikes achieve those objectives; (3) what happens after \nthe bombing stops; and (4) what is our endgame?\n  First the Administration told us that the goal of the United States \nwas to allow UNSCOM inspectors full and unfettered access to suspected \nstorage sites for chemical and biological weapons. Then we were told \nthat it was to make sure that Saddam would not be able to \n``reconstitute'' his nuclear, chemical and biological weapons \nproduction capabilities. But the Administration has failed to explain \nto the American people how air strikes will achieve these objectives.\n  After a round of briefings in the Senate with Administration \nofficials, the only thing that is clear is what US air strikes are not \ngoing to accomplish: they will not eliminate Iraq's stockpiles of \nchemical and biological weapons; they will not eliminate Iraq's \ncapability to produce weapons of mass destruction; and they will not \nremove Iraq's rulers, who persist on a course of action which threatens \ninternational security and the welfare of their own people.\n  The Administration's plan for ``substantial'' air strikes--which I \nsuppose falls somewhere between ``pinprick'' and ``massive'' attacks--\nmay delay Saddam's capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction. \nOf course, many of the buildings where biological weapons are produced \nand stored are dual-use facilities--like hospitals and vaccine \nlaboratories. There is also a danger that uncontrolled explosions of \nstorage facilities could result in the release of toxic substances. So \nit is not a question of whether we are able to destroy these targets, \nbut whether the resulting deaths of Iraqi civilians would prove \ncounterproductive to our goals.\n  In addition, Saddam has been playing a shell-game with chemical and \nbiological weapons stockpiles. As General Zinni, commander-in-chief of \nthe US central command acknowledged in December, ``we do not have a \ngood sense of what he has and where he has it''; and we do not know the \nlocation of mobile missile sites.\n  Unfortunately, Saddam does not need a huge production capacity or \nweapons stockpile to remain a threat. As a February 15 article in \nLondon's Sunday Telegraph noted, recent investigations of a tiny leak \nof anthrax from a Soviet facility in 1979 have documented 77 deaths, \nwith animals killed up to 30 miles away, even though less than a gram \nof anthrax escaped.\n  Even if the Administration allows the military to conduct a \ncomprehensive air campaign which cripples Saddam's ability to produce \nweapons of mass destruction, it is highly unlikely that air strikes \nwill result in UNSCOM inspectors being given unfettered access to \nsuspect sites or will enhance our ability to contain Saddam.\n  This brings us to the question of what happens after the bombing \nstops? The only proven way to effectively eliminate Iraq's chemical and \nbiological weapons capacity is to have inspectors on the ground. As \nPresident Clinton remarked in an address last week to the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, UNSCOM inspectors,\n\n     have uncovered and destroyed more weapons of mass destruction \n     capacity than was destroyed during the Gulf War . . . \n     [including] 40,000 chemical weapons, more than 100,000 \n     gallons of chemical weapons agents, 48 operational missiles, \n     30 warheads specifically fitted for chemical and biological \n     weapons, and a massive biological weapons facility at Al \n     Hakam equipped to produce anthrax and other deadly agents.\n\n  But 17 tons of biological growth agents, 600 tons of VX precursors \nand 4,000 tons of other chemical precursors remain unaccounted for. \nIraq could have produced 200 tons of VX alone with this missing \nmaterial. If, following the air strikes, Saddam denies permission for \nUNSCOM to conduct inspections, or if UNSCOM finds that it is not safe \nto proceed following the air strikes, then US actions will have \njeopardized international security, not enhanced it.\n  Furthermore, limited air strikes may extend rather than contain \nSaddam's power and influence in the region. We only have to look at the \nfact that the states most threatened by Saddam--the Arab nations in \nproximity to Iraq, with the exception of Kuwait--are not supporting US \nmilitary action. Even Saudi Arabia, which we protected against invasion \nduring the Gulf War, and our NATO ally Turkey have refused the use of \nair bases.\n  The Arab nations are acting according to their own self-interest. \nThey realize that Saddam is a threat to their national security, but \nthey also recognize that limited US air strikes which fail to depose \nSaddam could leave them in an even more precarious position. The states \nneighboring Iraq have legitimate concerns that they could be \ndestabilized if their populations rally around Saddam, who would be \nseen as a hero for standing up to the West.\n  Saddam could gain further sympathy from those disaffected populations \nby opting out of the oil-for-food program. The entire sanctions regime \ncould crumble, and Saddam could continue to increase his weapons \nprogram unfettered by multilateral sanctions. Efforts to promote \ndemocracy in the region would be jeopardized. Terrorism could be \nincreased and exported to the United States.\n  President Clinton asked a rhetorical question in his speech last week \nat the Pentagon: ``What if he (Saddam) fails to comply, and we fail to \nact?'' Well, I have a question for President Clinton, what if our air \nstrikes only strengthen Saddam's power and eliminate any chance of \nfinding and destroying his weapons of mass destruction?\n  Administration officials have glibly answered that we will just bomb \nagain. That is not a policy; that is not a strategy. It is a cop-out \nfor poor planning and the lack of a comprehensive policy toward Iraq.\n  How often can we bomb without mobilizing Muslim nations to stand by \nthe people of Iraq? How often can we bomb without some form of \nretaliation from Iraq against our allies in the region, if not against \nthe United States itself? This Administration talks in terms of limited \nstrikes, but in war we must take into account the ``law of unintended \nconsequences,'' and the threat of a regional conflict should not be \ndismissed.\n  Which brings us to the subject of an endgame. When air strikes \nappeared imminent, I called Secretary General Kofi Annan and urged him \nto personally pursue a diplomatic solution. And I asked him at that \ntime whether he had a message he would like to convey to the Senate. He \nresponded that we should think through the endgame--what we will do \nafter a military strike if we proceed to bomb Iraq. That is, I believe, \nsound advice.\n\n  The Administration claims that it has a long-term strategy in Iraq--a \nstrategy of containment. But I fail to see any connection between the \nAdministration's short-term strategy of limited air strikes and its \nstated long-term goal of containing Saddam Hussein. As I said earlier, \nthe best way to contain Saddam is to have weapons inspectors on the \nground. Even when they are being impeded, their very presence makes it \nimpossible for Saddam to engage in large-scale production of weapons of \nmass destruction. The Administration's proposed use of air strikes is \ntherefore inconsistent with its stated long-term strategy of \ncontainment.\n  Now, the Administration has stated that there are no good options for \naction against Iraq--and I agree. However, one of the reasons why there \nare no good options is the failure of this Administration to make an \nall-out effort over the past seven years to remove Saddam from power by \nestablishing a power base for an alternative Iraqi government. Surely, \nthis is an effort which could have secured allies in the region.\n  According to news reports, by the end of 1996, both of the CIA's \ncovert operations programs had been obliterated. One effort to recruit \nIraqi officers, to try to provoke a military coup was apparently \ninfiltrated by Iraqi double agents, and at least 100 officers were \nexecuted by Saddam for cooperating with Americans. Another effort to \nback the Iraqi National Congress in northern Iraq was abandoned by the \nUS government and thousands were slaughtered when they mounted an \noffensive against Saddam Hussein.\n  An article in the February 15 Los Angeles Times noted that the CIA \nteam that was on the ground when the offensive started was recalled to \nthe US when the acting Director of the CIA asked the FBI to conduct a \ncriminal investigation as to whether five CIA officers involved in \ncovert operations in\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\nIraq were plotting to kill Saddam--charges, by the way, that were later \ndropped. Now this had a chilling effect on covert activity in Iraq, \nraising concerns as to whether this Administration is serious about \ngetting rid of Saddam Hussein.\n  I do not support Congressional efforts to overturn the Executive \nOrder forbidding the assassination of foreign leaders. However, there \nis sufficient flexibility for covert operations to succeed in removing \nSaddam from power and those efforts must be promoted.\n  As I stated before, I am pleased that Secretary General Annan \nsucceeded in reaching an agreement with Saddam Hussein. Even if this \nagreement unravels, it has afforded Congress an opportunity to debate \nthe Administration's policy toward Iraq.\n  We must demand that the Administration come forward with a clear \nexplanation of its strategy and tactics. We must condemn the \nAdministration for refusing to give a codeword briefing to Senators on \ntargeting strategy--only later did we read an outline of this strategy \non the front page of The New York Times.\n  As pressure to bomb Iraq was mounting, I remained convinced that \nfurther diplomatic efforts should be explored. There seemed to be a \n``rush to bomb.'' As I said earlier, I called Secretary General Annan \nbefore the Administration agreed to his trip and asked him to go to \nBaghdad and speak to Saddam.\n  I let Ambassador Richardson know that I would support a solution \nallowing representatives of the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil accompany UNSCOM inspectors, as long as UNSCOM was not impeded \nor compromised in any way.\n  While I applaud the Secretary General's initiative, I have been \nappalled by the failure of the UN as an organization, and the Security \nCouncil in particular, to support enforcement of the UN resolutions. It \nis the greatest of ironies that this Administration is sending American \nmen and women to risk their lives to uphold UN Resolution 687. This is \na UN Security Council Resolution, but three out of the five permanent \nmembers oppose the use of force. France is more concerned with being \nable to sell Iraqi oil, China wants to buy the oil, and Russia seeks to \nbe paid the $6 billion it is owed by Iraq. Only Britain is standing by \nthe United States.\n  There may come a time when the United States has to use force against \nIraq to protect our national security. We cannot subcontract our \nnational security policy to the United Nations. When, and if, that time \ncomes, I hope that this Administration will let our armed forces do its \njob without one hand tied behind its back. And we should send a clear \nmessage to the ``Butcher of Baghdad'': If chemical or biological \nweapons are used anywhere in the world, and there is even the most \ntenuous link to Iraq, the full force of the United States will be used \nagainst him.\n  Mr. President, in an excellent speech on the situation in Iraq, \nSenator Roberts of Kansas cited the words uttered 30 years ago by \nSenator Richard Russell, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nduring the Vietnam War. I think that it is appropriate for me to once \nagain repeat those words on the Senate floor. He said:\n\n       I for one am not afraid of the old fashioned term, victory. \n     We hear a great deal about limited wars, but I would point \n     out that there is no such thing as a limit on actual combat \n     in which our men our engaged. While it is a sound policy to \n     have limited objectives, we should not expose our men to \n     unnecessary hazards in pursuing them.\n\n  And Senator Russell also made the following pledge:\n\n       As for me, my fellow Americans, I shall never knowingly \n     support a policy of sending even a single American boy \n     overseas to risk his life in combat unless the entire \n     civilian population and wealth of our country--all that we \n     have and all that we are--is to bear a commensurate \n     responsibility in giving him the fullest support and \n     protection of which we are capable.\n       It is inconsistent with our history, tradition and \n     fundamental principles to commit American boys on far flung \n     battlefields if we are to follow policies that deny them full \n     support because we are afraid of increasing the risk of those \n     who stay at home.\n       It is a confession of moral weakness on the part of this \n     country not to take any steps that are necessary to fully \n     diminish the fighting power of our enemies.'\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues and the Administration to hear \nthose words--they have as much relevance today as when they were first \nuttered in this chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I come to the floor of the Senate to \nvisit with my colleagues about NATO and NATO expansion.\n  Of all the responsibilities the Senate is called upon to exercise \nunder our constitutional system, none is more momentous--and, in most \ncases, as irrevocable--as our advice and consent to the ratification of \ntreaties and treaty revisions. One of the treaty questions the Senate \nwill be facing in the near future is whether the North Atlantic \nTreaty--the NATO alliance--should be modified to include the former \nWarsaw Pact states of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Our \ndecision on this matter will set the structure for security in Europe \nand the American role in it for years, perhaps decades, to come.\n  I would like to commend the distinguished Chairmen of the Committee \non Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations for the \nthorough and thoughtful hearings they have held on this matter. \nHowever, in my discussions with a number of Senators, particularly \nthose who, like myself, are not members of those committees, it is \nclear that many Senators have only begun to focus on the many \ninterrelated issues that touch upon the matter of NATO expansion. \nIndeed, some of the issues--our relations with our allies, relations \nwith the Russians, the implications for weapons proliferation, our \npolicy toward Iraq--are shifting every day.\n  For example, this week the distinguished Majority Leader spoke \nforcefully about his misgivings about the agreement reached between \nU.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Saddam Hussein regime in \nIraq. Our entire policy in the region has been put on hold. It is well \nknown that both France, a key NATO ally, and Russia, the obvious object \nof NATO expansion, strongly welcome this outcome. Will Saddam Hussein \nlive up to this agreement? Many of us consider it unlikely. Will the \nUnited States return to the military option in a few weeks or months? I \ndon't think any of us really yet know that. How will the Iraq crisis, \nwhat ever its outcome, affect our relations with both our allies and \nRussia? We do not yet know the impact of the realities of these events. \nHow will the outcome affect the larger task of stemming the \nproliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and missile \ntechnology? We do not yet know. Not knowing the answers to these \nquestions, are we prepared to make an irreversible decision on NATO \nexpansion? I think not--at least not yet.\n  In considering the implications just of the Iraq crisis, I bring to \nmy colleagues' attention an op-ed by Mr. Thomas L. Friedman that \nappeared in the New York Times on February 17, before the Annan/Hussein \ndeal. Mr. Friedman wrote:\n\n       The U.S. should be doing everything it can to work with \n     Russia, not only on Iraq but to shrink Russia's own nuclear \n     arsenal, which is the greatest proliferation threat in the \n     world today. Attention shoppers: Russia has thousands of \n     weapons of mass destruction. It has hundreds of unemployed or \n     underemployed nuclear scientists. And it has only the loosest \n     controls over its nukes and nuclear materials, and it has a \n     signed nuclear arms reduction treaty with the U.S. that has \n     not been implemented. But instead of dealing with this \n     problem, the Clintonites are making it worse. They are \n     expanding NATO to counter a threat that doesn't exist--a \n     Russian invasion of Europe--and thus undermining America's \n     ability to work with Russia on the threat that does exist--\n     Russia's loose nukes. ``Halting the proliferation of\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\n     nuclear materials, missiles and technology is clearly our \n     number-one foreign policy challenge since the breakup of the \n     Soviet Empire,'' says former Senator Sam Nunn, who was the \n     expert in the Senate on this issue.\n       ``But because it is number one, we should be measuring all \n     other policies by how they affect proliferation. Not only \n     does NATO expansion not help us deal with Russia on the \n     issue, it is counterproductive.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Mr. Friedman's essay \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   Foreign Affairs; Madeleine's Folly\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       With a U.S. bombing of Iraq now increasingly likely, the \n     question being raised by those uneasy with such a strike is: \n     What is the endgame? Is America just throwing its weight \n     around to punish Saddam Hussein?\n       The answer is really very simple. It comes down to two \n     words: weapons proliferation. If Iraq--already a repeat user \n     of poison gas--is able to snub its nose at the U.N. weapons \n     inspectors, then the world's ability to fight the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction elsewhere would \n     be fundamentally compromised. Libya and its friends would all \n     be less afraid to develop germ weapons and nukes. We would \n     all end up in a much more dangerous world. That's why Saddam \n     has to be stopped.\n       But it is precisely because stemming weapons proliferation \n     should be the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy in the post-\n     cold-war era that the Clinton Administration's policy of NATO \n     expansion is so stupid. The U.S. should be doing everything \n     it can to work with Russia, not only on Iraq but to shrink \n     Russia's own nuclear arsenal, which is the greatest \n     proliferation threat in the world today. Attention shoppers: \n     Russia has thousands of weapons of mass destruction. It has \n     hundreds of unemployed or underemployed nuclear scientists. \n     And it has only the loosest controls over its nukes and \n     nuclear materials, and it has a signed nuclear arms reduction \n     treaty with the U.S. that has not been implemented.\n       But instead of dealing with this problem, the Clintonites \n     are making it worse. They are expanding NATO to counter a \n     threat that doesn't exist--a Russian invasion of Europe--and \n     thus undermining America's ability to work with Russia on the \n     threat that does exist--Russia's loose nukes.\n       ``Halting the proliferation of nuclear materials, missiles \n     and technology is clearly our number-one foreign policy \n     challenge since the breakup of the Soviet Empire,'' says \n     former Senator Sam Nunn, who was the expert in the Senate on \n     this issue. ``But because it is number one, we should be \n     measuring all other policies by how they affect \n     proliferation. Not only does NATO expansion not help us deal \n     with Russia on this issue, it is counterproductive.''\n       The Clinton team has never had an integrated foreign \n     policy. It treats Iraq and NATO expansion as if they were \n     totally disconnected. One day Secretary of State Albright \n     gives a speech telling Russia that NATO is moving right up to \n     the Baltic-Russian border. The next day she complains that \n     Russia isn't being helpful on Iraq. Gosh, I wonder why not?\n       ``Thanks to NATO expansion, we have convinced the Russian \n     political elite that they are not our partner and that their \n     security is not as important to us as the security of the \n     Czechs,'' says Jack Matlock, President Reagan's Ambassador to \n     Moscow.\n       We are already paying a price for this. NATO expansion has \n     prompted Russia's Parliament to stall its ratification of the \n     Start 2 nuclear arms reduction treaty, which would shrink \n     Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals from around 7,000 apiece to \n     3,500 apiece. That's 3,500 fewer Russian nukes pointed at us. \n     But the deal has been frozen by NATO expansion. If the \n     Clinton team loses the Start 2 treaty, in order to add the \n     Czechs to NATO, it will go down as one of the greatest \n     blunders in the history of U.S. foreign policy: Madeleine's \n     folly.\n       As Mr. Matlock notes, the more we expand NATO, ``the less \n     willing Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy is to work with us \n     on cooperative measures'' to keep its atomic scientists \n     constructively employed--so they don't end up in Iraq and \n     Iran--and the less willing Russia's military is to let us in \n     to help it better control and destroy its nuclear materials.\n       Moreover, if Ms. Albright is serious about extending NATO \n     to the Baltic States, the only way NATO can possibly defend \n     them is with nukes. Baltic membership in NATO will, \n     therefore, only encourage Russia to continue altering its \n     defense doctrine--moving to a greater reliance on nuclear \n     weapons for defense, on more of a hair trigger, because the \n     closer NATO gets to Russia's border the less warning time \n     Moscow will have. But don't worry, sleep well, Latvia will be \n     in NATO.\n       The Clintonites are rightly ready to go to war with Iraq to \n     halt the spread of weapons in the Middle East. But their \n     expansion of NATO will only increase the threat of \n     proliferation in Russia--where there are a lot more weapons, \n     under a lot less control, and all pointed at us.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the same vein, one of our colleagues, \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, made the same \npoint on the floor February 12, and I thought it was worth noting, \nespecially because it came, again, before the Annan-Hussein agreement:\n\n       But in the area of Russia, for example, this administration \n     appears to think that they can go to the [Russians] and \n     demand that Russia follow our policies in Iraq and insist on \n     their support on Iraq, but at the same time this \n     administration proposes an expansion of NATO. You have to \n     recognize, if you were a Russian leader, you would find a \n     certain irony in a request that was coupled in that \n     terminology. Because, of course, an expansion of NATO, \n     especially to Poland, is an expansion that can only be viewed \n     in Russia with some concern and possibly viewed by some as an \n     outright threat . . . So you can understand that Russia might \n     view a push to expand NATO at the same time as we are asking \n     them to support us in Iraq as being inconsistent and a bit \n     ironic. And it reflects, unfortunately, I think, this \n     administration's failure to understand the linkage--and \n     linkage is the right term--between working with a nation like \n     Russia and our capacity to do things in the Middle East and \n     moving forward with the NATO expansion at the exact same \n     time. Yet, if you were to listen to the leadership of this \n     administration, they will tell you that there is no \n     relationship, they have no overlap on those two issues. Of \n     course, that is just not true, and that is one of the main \n     reasons we are having problems with Russia [today].\n\n  In case anyone in this country has missed it, the Russians have not. \nThey understand the linkage, even if the Clinton administration does \nnot seem to understand it. On February 24, Vladimir Lukin, Moscow's \nformer Ambassador to the United States and now the chairman of the \nDuma's Committee on International Affairs, commented:\n\n       It would be a big mistake if the United States was offended \n     by Russian policy toward Iraq or another country . . . \n     Russia's policy toward Iraq is not only Russia's policy--we \n     coincide with many other countries, including U.S. allies . . \n     . The problem is whether Russia is considered part of the \n     Atlantic community or not.\n\n  Now remember, I am quoting the Russian chairman of the Committee on \nInternational Affairs of the Duma.\n  He says, again:\n\n       The problem is whether Russia is considered part of the \n     Atlantic community or not. Russia will have to decide how it \n     is being considered--as an equal partner or as an outsider. \n     NATO enlargement is isolating Russia. What is the choice for \n     us? Only to be an outsider.\n\n  He also goes on to say:\n\n       Not a hostile outsider, but still an outsider. It is a \n     danger. We will become stronger, and we are still a nuclear \n     power. It is a danger to us and a danger to you--\n\n  Meaning the United States.\n\n       A few years ago there was the idea of partnership, now \n     there is a strong hesitation in the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, that's the linkage you are missing, that's the linkage \nmany of us are concerned about as it relates to current policy.\n  The point here, as I have noted at some length, is just one ongoing \naspect of this very complex issue which we have hardly begun to assess. \nThis is just one aspect, but there are others, no less troublesome, \nwhich I will only mention briefly.\n  The Baltic States: What is the nature of our commitment to admit \nthese States? What are the ramifications?\n  Our European partners: Why are we so passive to our allies' bald \ninsistence that they intend to bear very little of the costs of \nexpansion? As our distinguished former colleagues Howard Baker and Sam \nNunn raised the matter in their recent essay in the New York Times:\n\n       Advocates and skeptics of NATO enlargement alike agree that \n     the transformation of Europe's security structure should be \n     related to the transformation of the economy. As James Baker, \n     the former Secretary of State, has testified, European Union \n     membership ``is just as important as membership in NATO for \n     the countries involved,'' and ``we must make clear that NATO \n     membership for the countries of Central Europe is not a \n     substitute for closer economic ties to the European Union.''\n\n  So then, why are we taking the first step in a reintegration that is \nnot primarily a question of security--since there is no credible \nthreat--while our European allies, who together have greater resources \nto help their neighbors than the United States, continue to play what \ncan only be said to be a secondary role?\n  The ``New NATO'': Republicans, in particular, should be very \nconcerned about the words of President Clinton upon signing of the \nFounding Act in May of 1997. He says:\n\n       We are building a new NATO. It will remain the strongest \n     alliance in history, with smaller, more flexible forces, \n     prepared to provide for our defense, but also trained for \n     peacekeeping.\n\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\n\n  As we know, peacekeeping, in some people's eyes, can be considered \noffensive actions.\n  I go on to quote:\n\n       It will work closely with other nations that share our \n     hopes and values and interests through the Partnership for \n     Peace. It will be an alliance directed no longer against a \n     hostile bloc of nations, but instead designed to advance the \n     security of every democracy in Europe--NATO's old members, \n     new members and nonmembers alike.\n\n  Mr. President, I certainly hope this doesn't mean what it sounds like \nit means--the end of NATO as a defensive alliance and its \ntransformation into a regional peacekeeping organization. Will the \n``new NATO'' exist to protect its members--or to engage in many Bosnia-\nlike missions all over Central and Eastern Europe?\n  Now let me speak briefly of costs. To say the least, there is a great \ndeal of skepticism over the question of how much this is going to cost \nthe American taxpayer and whether the very low estimates now being \ngiven by the administration are, in any way, credible. I note that we \nhave not even begun to discuss how much of the costs accruing to the \nnew allies will end up being billed to the United States. For example, \nin May of 1997, ABC News quoted the American Ambassador to Hungary to \nthe effect that the American share of buying new planes for the \nHungarian Force ``will be perhaps 20 percent to 25 percent'' of the \ncost of that ``at most.''\n  How about 30 percent or how about 40 percent? We don't know. That \nhasn't been negotiated. But what this administration is saying is that \nwe will play a substantial role in the diversity of military equipment \nfor these new partners in NATO.\n  So how much is the real cost? And, again, shouldn't we know before we \nare asked to vote?\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me emphasize that I do not believe we \nare yet ready in this Senate to give this matter the full debate that \nit deserves and that we must hear on this issue. If we had to vote on \nNATO expansion on the basis of the information we now have, I would \nvote no, and I know that there are many others in this body who would \nvote no.\n  I look forward to a full, detailed and lengthy debate on the issue at \nthe appropriate time. The appropriate time is when the Senate is fully \nknowledgeable on the issue of NATO expansion as they take up one of \ntheir most important constitutional responsibilities: the advice and \nconsent on these critical issues. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Chafee addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Idaho for his \nthoughtful comments. He started his comments by saying that this is a \nmatter to which many of the Senators have not given very thorough \nconsideration, and I think that is accurate. I certainly fall into that \ncategory.\n\n  I am not on either of the major committees that deal with the \nexpansion of NATO. Like all Senators, I am busy with this or that. It \nseems to me very wise that we all give this matter some thorough \nconsideration. It is my understanding that the majority leader is \nanxious to bring up the NATO expansion legislation quite soon.\n  I just want to say, speaking for just this Senator, I certainly \nhaven't concentrated on it. I look forward to reading the op-ed piece--\nI believe it was an op-ed piece--that Senator Baker and others worked \non.\n  All I can say is, I am grateful for the comments that the Senator \nfrom Idaho made, because it is wise for all of us--I personally haven't \nmade up my mind on this. I am astonished that I haven't been lobbied, \nnot that my vote is a key vote on it, but on this matter, the former \nSenator from New Hampshire came by to see me. He is very concerned. I \nam speaking of Senator Humphrey, a former Senator from New Hampshire. \nHe is very concerned about the expansion of NATO. I think he presented \nsome good arguments on it. Perhaps he has also spoken with the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his thoughts.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I certainly will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman for those comments. One of the \nmeasurements I always use on issues of this gravity and importance, and \nespecially if I do not know a great deal about them, is when there are \nmen and women on both sides of the issue whom I respect, it demands \nthat I begin to review it in great detail. That is what I am hearing \nfrom the Senator, that when you have the likes of Howard Baker, and a \nformer Secretary of State, and you have Sam Nunn and a good many others \non the other side of the issue who are certainly knowledgeable, I think \nit is time for the Senate to focus and for our colleagues to begin to \ntry to deal with this issue, and that is why I am here. I thank the \nSenator for his comments.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1152-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``American \n     Indian Equal Justice Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a universal principle of simple justice and accountable \n     government requires that all persons be afforded legal \n     remedies for violations of their legal rights;\n       (2) the fifth amendment of the Constitution builds upon \n     that principle by guaranteeing that ``. . . no person shall \n     be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process \n     of law'';\n       (3) sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that has its \n     origins in feudal England when it was policy that the ``King \n     could do no wrong'', affronts that principle and is \n     incompatible with the rule of law in democratic society;\n       (4) for more than a century, the Government of the United \n     States and the States have dramatically scaled back the \n     doctrine of sovereign immunity without impairing their \n     dignity, sovereignty, or ability to conduct valid government \n     policies;\n       (5) the only remaining governments in the United States \n     that maintain and assert the full scope of immunity from \n     lawsuits are Indian tribal governments;\n       (6) according to the 1990 decennial census conducted by the \n     Bureau of the Census, nearly half of the individuals residing \n     on Indian reservations are non-Indian;\n       (7) for the non-Indian individuals referred to in paragraph \n     (6) and the thousands of people of the United States, Indian \n     and non-Indian, who interact with tribal governments \n     everyday, the rights to due process and legal remedy are \n     constantly at risk because of tribal immunity;\n       (8) by providing a complete shield from legal claims, the \n     doctrine of sovereign immunity frustrates justice and \n     provokes social tensions and turmoil inimical to social \n     peace;\n       (9) the Supreme Court has affirmed that Congress has clear \n     and undoubted constitutional authority to define, limit, or \n     waive the immunity of Indian tribes; and\n       (10) it is necessary to address the issue referred to in \n     paragraph (9) in order to--\n       (A) secure the rights provided under the Constitution for \n     all persons; and\n       (B) uphold the principle that no government should be above \n     the law.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist in \n     ensuring due process and legal rights throughout the United \n     States and to strengthen the rule of law by making Indian \n     tribal governments subject to judicial review with respect to \n     certain civil matters.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' means any \n     Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by \n     the Secretary of the Interior.\n       (2) Tribal immunity.--The term ``tribal immunity'' means \n     the immunity of an Indian tribe from jurisdiction of the \n     courts, judicial review of an action of that Indian tribe, \n     and other remedies.\n\n     SEC. 3. COLLECTION OF STATE TAXES.\n\n       Section 1362 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``The district courts'';\n       (2) by inserting ``(referred to in this section as an \n     `Indian tribe')'' after ``Interior''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b)(1) An Indian tribe, tribal corporation, or member of \n     an Indian tribe, shall collect, and remit to a State, any \n     excise, use, or sales tax imposed by the State on nonmembers \n     of the Indian tribe as a consequence of the purchase of goods \n     or services by the nonmember from the Indian tribe, tribal \n     corporation, or member.\n       ``(2) A State may bring an action in a district court of \n     the United States to enforce the requirements under paragraph \n     (1).\n       ``(3) To the extent necessary to enforce this subsection \n     with respect to an Indian tribe, tribal corporation, or \n     member of an Indian tribe, the tribal immunity of that Indian \n     tribe, tribal corporation, or member is waived.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. INDIAN TRIBES AS DEFENDANTS.\n\n       (a) Provisions To Parallel the Provisions That Are \n     Popularly Known as the Tucker Act.--Section 1362 of title 28, \n     United States Code, as amended by section 3, is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c)(1) The district courts of the United States shall \n     have original jurisdiction in any\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\n     civil action or claim against an Indian tribe, with respect \n     to which the matter in controversy arises under the \n     Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\n       ``(2) The district courts shall have jurisdiction of any \n     civil action or claim against an Indian tribe for liquidated \n     or unliquidated damages for cases not sounding in tort that \n     involve any contract made by the governing body of the Indian \n     tribe or on behalf of an Indian tribe.\n       ``(d) Subject to the provisions of chapter 171A, the \n     district courts shall have jurisdiction of civil actions in \n     claims against an Indian tribe for money damages, accruing on \n     or after the date of enactment of the American Indian Equal \n     Justice Act for injury or loss of property, personal injury, \n     or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission \n     of an Indian tribe under circumstances in which the Indian \n     tribe, if a private individual or corporation would be liable \n     to the claimant in accordance with the law of the State where \n     the act or omission occurred.\n       ``(e) To the extent necessary to enforce this section, the \n     tribal immunity (as that term is defined in section 2 of the \n     American Indian Equal Justice Act) of the Indian tribe (as \n     that term is defined in such section 2) involved is \n     waived.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nsoftware trade secrets protection; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 Software Trade Secrets Protection Act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, recent Congressional oversight of the \nInternal Revenue Service has revealed an agency which has virtually \nlimitless power to enforce the tax code. One aspect of this power is \nthe ability of the IRS to use its summons authority to force taxpayers \nto turn over books, papers, records, or other data in the course of an \naudit.\n  Recently, the IRS has started to use its administrative summons power \nto gain access to the source code for computer software products. \nSource code for software is a human-readable form of computer language \nwritten by software programmers, and it contains all the ``tricks of \nthe trade'' which a programmer uses to ultimately make the software \nproduct do its job. After a programmer writes the source code, it is \n``compiled'' into machine-readable form called executable code or \nobject code. If the software is being sold or otherwise distributed to \ncustomers, the executable code is copied onto diskettes or CD-ROM's for \nthe customers' use.\n  The IRS has used its summons power to obtain computer software source \ncode in several different audit situations. The IRS has sought the \nsource code for the software used to produce the tax return from the \nvendor of the software.\n  The IRS has sought the source code for a software product in \nconnection with a Section 482 transfer pricing audit with respect to a \nlicense for the software product to a foreign subsidiary, and the IRS \nhas summoned the source code for software developed by a computer \nservice company in the course of an audit of the firm's research and \nexperimentation credit. The IRS has summoned the executable code of \ntaxpayer's tax preparation software in order to run ``what-if'' \nscenarios based on the taxpayer's records during an audit.\n  The primary problem with complying with these summons is that, in \neach instance the IRS would need to hire an outside consultant in order \nto make any meaningful use of the source code. Such outside consultants \nlikely would be competitors or potential competitors of the software \ncompany. A skilled computer programmer can discern the software \ncompany's trade secrets from an examination of the source code, whereas \ntrade secrets cannot readily be discerned from an examination of the \nexecutable code.\n  Further, problems can also arise when the IRS issues a summons to a \ncomputer software company in connection with an audit of one of their \ncustomers. This requires the software publisher to look through its \nown, not the taxpayer's, voluminous records for the relevant versions \nof the programs in\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\nquestion. This can place an undue burden on the software publisher by \nrequiring their key technical personnel to be diverted from their \nregular work to help with the tax audit of a customer.\n  Finally, if the IRS is allowed to use a taxpayer's tax preparation \nsoftware and records to run ``what-if'' scenarios during an audit, the \ntaxpayer will be forced to justify a tax return they did not file.\n  In several of these situations, Mr. President, the owner of the \ncomputer software source code has objected to the summons in order to \nprotect their trade secrets. Unfortunately, because the IRS summons \nauthority is so broad, the courts have been constrained to side with \nthe IRS in most cases, leaving computer software companies with \ninadequate protection for their trade secrets.\n  Perhaps a better way to explain the issue, Mr. President, is with the \nfollowing analogy. Imagine that during an audit of the Coca-Cola \nCompany, the IRS issues a summons for the secret recipe for Coke. Even \nthough the IRS can see the Coke, taste it, and read the ingredients on \nthe side of the can, they still insist on examining the secret recipe. \nNow, imagine further than the IRS admits that since they employ no one \nwith expertise in this area, they will have to contract with experts \nfrom Pepsi to examine Coke's secret recipe. This is the dilemma facing \nthe computer software industry.\n\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I am introducing the Software Trade \nSecrets Protection Act. This legislation is similar to a bill \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Sam Johnson, \nand the section 344 of H.R. 2676, the House-passed IRS reform bill.\n  The Software Trade Secrets Protection Act provides a general \nprohibition on the IRS using summons authority to obtain computer \nsoftware source code. The bill then sets out three exceptions to the \ngeneral prohibition: (1) cases where the Secretary can demonstrate \nneed, (2) criminal investigations, and (3) internally developed \nsoftware where competitive issues are not implicated.\n  In the first exception, the Secretary has the burden of showing that \nthe need for the source code outweighs the burdens placed on the \nsummoned person and the danger that its trade secrets might be exposed. \nThe bill further provides a series of protections for both source code \nand executable code if it is eventually examined by the IRS, including \nprovisions intended to prevent the IRS from using a taxpayer's software \nand data to run ``what-if'' scenarios during an audit.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. software industry leads the world in the \ndevelopment of innovative products and cutting-edge technology. They \nare one of the fastest growing and most competitive industries in the \nnation, and their products are unique and ofttimes require special \nconsideration. I believe Congressional hearings have shown what the IRS \ncan and will do if its power is unrestrained. The Software Trade \nSecrets Protection Act creates good, common-sense restrictions on that \npower.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee to include this legislation in IRS reform legislation this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The use of the summons \n     power to compel production of computer software source code \n     has come up in three situations. First, in connection with \n     the audit of certain taxpayers under the Coordinated \n     Examination Program, the IRS has sought the source code for \n     the software used to produce the tax return from the vendor \n     of the software. In other cases, IRS has sought the source \n     code for a software production in connection with a Section \n     482 transfer pricing audit. In the third class of cases, IRS \n     has summoned the source code for software developed by a \n     computer service company in the course of an audit of the \n     firm's research and experimentation credit. In each instance, \n     the IRS has signaled its intention to hire outside \n     consultants in order to make any meaningful use of the source \n     code. Such outside consultants likely would be competitors or \n     potential competitors of the software company.\n       The source code for computer software is the human readable \n     form prepared by software programmers. After the source code \n     is prepared, it is then ``compiled'' into machine-readable \n     form called executable code or object code. The executable \n     code is then copied onto diskettes or CD-ROM's for \n     distribution to customers. A skilled computer programmer can \n     discern the software company's trade secrets from an \n     examination of the source code. Trade secrets cannot readily \n     be discerned from an examination of the executable code.\n       The ease of misappropriating software trade secrets and \n     capitalizing on such secrets is unparalleled, especially \n     given advances in computer and communications technology.\n       Computer software products undergo nearly continuous \n     change. Many times, it is not possible to match a particular \n     version of a product in the hands of a customer with a \n     discrete source code version. Software companies continually \n     revise their products and issue new versions. Within a \n     particular version, companies frequently issue updates and \n     corrections after a product is released. These interim \n     changes must first be made to the source code before the \n     machine-readable versions are released. Software companies \n     make such bug-fixes and patches available to their customers, \n     but typically the vendor does not know whether the customer \n     has installed them or not.\n       Summonses issued to third-party record keepers typically \n     require the recordkeeper to identify and turn over to the IRS \n     documents regarding the taxpayer's financial transactions. By \n     contrast, a summons for source code could require a software \n     publisher to look through its own, not the taxpayer's, \n     voluminous records for the relevant versions of the programs \n     in question. Further, this would require programmers to \n     divert attention from programming to search for the summoned \n     code. Merely complying with a summons for source code could \n     cause competitive damage to a software company because key \n     technical personnel will be diverted to help with the tax \n     audit of a customer. This could be especially damaging to \n     small or medium-sized companies.\n\n\n                          2. trade secret law\n\n       The law of trade secrets provides an effective and \n     efficient method to protect commercially sensitive and \n     important business information. For many companies the law of \n     trade secrets is the method of choice for protecting valuable \n     business information. Trade secret law arises from state law. \n     Unlike patent, copyright and trademark law there is no \n     federal scheme for trade secret protection. The law of trade \n     secrets, depending upon the state, derives either from the \n     common law or the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. A slight \n     majority of states use the uniform act. The common law, as \n     set forth in the Restatement of Torts, Sec. 757, defines a \n     trade secret as follows:\n       ``A trade secret may consist of a formula, pattern, device \n     or compilation of information which is used in one's \n     business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an \n     advantage over competitors who do not know it or use it. It \n     may be a formula for a chemical compound, a process of \n     manufacturing, treating or preserving materials, a patter for \n     a machine or other device, or a list of customers.''\n       The Supreme Court has relied upon this definition to \n     require that for information to constitute a trade secret, it \n     must (1) be used in one's business, (2) provide a competitive \n     advantage, and (3) be secret.\n       Under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Sec. 1(4)), a trade \n     secret is defined as follows:\n       ``trade secret means information, including a formula, \n     pattern, compilation, device method, technique, or process \n     that:\n       ``(1) derives independent economic value, actual or \n     potential, from not being generally known to, and not readily \n     ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can \n     obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and\n       ``(2) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under \n     the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.''\n       The cornerstone of both definitions, whether common law or \n     statutory, is that the information must be kept secret. The \n     standard for secrecy for a trade secret comprises a two-\n     pronged test: (1) whether the information alleged to be a \n     trade secret is generally known or available, and (2) whether \n     the trade secret owner takes affirmative steps to safeguard \n     the confidentiality of the information.\n       Trade secret owners may protect information from \n     unauthorized disclosures by entering into contracts with \n     those to whom the confidential information is disclosed. Such \n     contracts typically take two forms. First, a trade secret \n     owner may require such a person to enter into a \n     ``nondisclosure agreement'' under which the individual \n     promises not to disclose or use trade secret information \n     without first obtaining the permission of the owner.\n       The second type of contract is a post-employment ``non-\n     competition agreement.'' Under this type of contract, an \n     employee or outside consultant agrees not to compete with the \n     present employer or client or become employed by a competitor \n     of the employer or client after termination of the current \n     relationship.\n       Both types of agreements are widely used in the software \n     industry to protect trade secrets that might exist in \n     software source code.\n\n\n                          3. IRC Section 6103\n\n       Internal Revenue Code Section 6103 generally prohibits \n     Internal Revenue Service employees from disclosing tax \n     returns and ``tax return information.'' the United States and \n     its agents can be held liable for improper disclosures of tax \n     returns and tax return information. See I.R.C. Sec. 7431. \n     However, Section 6103 does not protect software source code \n     regardless of whether it is owned by the taxpayer or a third-\n     party software vendor. Section 6103 expressly excludes from \n     the definition of ``return information'' ``data which is in a \n     form which cannot be associated with or otherwise identify, \n     directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.'' Generally \n     speaking, source code would not identify, either directly or \n     indirectly, the taxpayer and thus would not qualify as \n     ``return information.''\n       In addition, were computer source code to be treated as \n     ``return information,'' Section 6103 contains numerous \n     provisions that actually authorize disclosure of return \n     information. Section 6103(n) permits disclosure of return \n     information to IRS contractors working on programming IRS \n     computers. Thus, defining computer source code as ``return \n     information'' actually would expose it to disclosure to \n     potential competitors of the software owner.\n\n\n                        4. Overview of the Bill\n\n       The bill reflects the basic premise that the subject matter \n     (computer software) is unique and justifies all relevant \n     provisions being collected in one section. The House bill, on \n     the other hand, attempts to address the problem by amending \n     several code sections in patchwork fashion.\n       The general rule of the bill is a blanket prohibition on \n     the IRS using the summons authority to obtain computer source \n     code and related customer communications. It also prohibits a \n     summons for training materials. It then sets out three \n     significant exceptions to the prohibition: (1) cases where \n     the Secretary can demonstrate need, (2) criminal \n     investigations, and (3) cases involving internally developed \n     software where competitive issues are not implicated.\n       Under the first exception, before a summons can be issued \n     for source code, the Secretary has the burden of \n     demonstrating that the need for the source code outweighs the \n     burdens placed on the summoned person and the danger that its \n     trade secrets might be exposed. The bill also sets out a \n     series of protections for both source code and executable \n     code in the hands of the IRS. These protections are in lieu \n     of whatever protections might be afforded by Section 6103.\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\n                          5. Detailed Analysis\n\n       Section (a)(1):\n       This section establishes the general rule that no summons \n     may be issued, and no enforcement proceeding may be \n     commenced, for computer software source code and related \n     customer communications or training materials. This general \n     rule with respect to source code is subject to three \n     exceptions.\n       Section (a)(2):\n       The first exception is for cases where the Secretary can \n     establish that he cannot perform an accurate audit without a \n     review of computer software source code.\n       The provision for a needs-based test recognizes that \n     questions may arise during an audit that can only be answered \n     with reference to the source code. It is intended that such a \n     summons might be issued only as a last resort and only \n     after traditional audit techniques have been exhausted. In \n     these circumstances, it is contemplated that the audit has \n     become focused on a particular issue or set of issues. The \n     Secretary may have had access to an executable version of \n     the software loaded with the taxpayer's financial data. At \n     some point in the audit, the Secretary and the taxpayer \n     may have been unable to verify the correctness of the \n     computation of an entry on the tax return under audit. \n     Further, in such a case, it is contemplated that the \n     Secretary will have asked the software publisher for \n     assistance in resolving this issue but been unable to \n     obtain a satisfactory answer. After the Secretary has \n     sufficiently identified the specific item on the return \n     for which source code is sought a summons can be issued \n     only for that portion of the source code that relates to \n     the specific entry on the tax return.\n       In deciding whether a summons has been properly issued, a \n     balancing test is established in lieu of the current \n     standard. Under current law, all that the Secretary needs to \n     show is that the summoned material ``might shed some light'' \n     on the accuracy of the tax return. See United States v. \n     Powell, 379 U.S. 48 (1964). This standard was developed well \n     before the computer revolution and the proliferation of \n     software in the United States economy. It provides \n     considerably less protection that the standard applied by \n     most other federal agencies in similar cases. Despite having \n     written administrative policies acknowledging the importance \n     of protecting trade secrets, the Secretary has not, in \n     practice, honored those policies by showing adequate \n     sensitivity to the legitimate concerns of software \n     publishers.\n       The bill replaces the Powell standard with a new balancing \n     test. To meet the balancing test, the Secretary, and any \n     court conducting a review, must determine whether the need \n     for the source code outweighs the burden on the owner of the \n     source code in complying with the summons and the danger that \n     its trade secrets might be exposed to a competitor.\n       The initial threshold requires that the Secretary \n     demonstrate some need for the portion of the source code that \n     is sought. To meet this test, the Secretary must show that he \n     is unable to verify the correctness of the item without a \n     review of the source code. Ordinarily, the audit process \n     focuses on the taxpayer's financial records to determine \n     whether the tax return reflects a proper application of the \n     internal revenue laws to the facts. Importantly, traditional \n     computer audit techniques used to verify data in an efficient \n     manner are a part of this process and are not effected by the \n     bill. Such a process does not require the source code for the \n     software that might have been used to prepare the return. \n     However, in cases involving tax issues related to software \n     products, it is anticipated that very little if any probative \n     evidence could be gleaned from the source code.\n       In assessing the burdens imposed on the owner of software \n     in complying with a summons issued under this section, it is \n     anticipated that the Secretary, and the courts, will focus on \n     a variety of issues. The chief factor to consider is the \n     degree of business interruption that would be caused by \n     compliance with the summons. Other factors to consider \n     include: (1) whether the software was initially developed by \n     the current owner of the software source code, (2) whether \n     the source code was developed by former employees, (3) the \n     degree to which the source code has changed since the \n     software was first developed and (4) whether the software \n     owner itself has put into issue the use or content of the \n     source code.\n       The danger of trade of trade secret disclosure exists \n     anytime non-employees of the trade secret owner are allowed \n     access to confidential information. In weighting the risks of \n     trade secret disclosure, a factor to consider is the ability \n     to impose safeguards on such disclosure, including the \n     statutory protections available under subsection (b) of this \n     section.\n       Section (a)(3), Other Exceptions:\n       The general prohibition on issuing a summons or computer \n     source code does not apply to a summons issued in furtherance \n     of an inquiry into any criminal offense or with respect to \n     software developed by the taxpayer for its own internal use \n     and not for commercial purposes. The exception for internal \n     use software is to be applied to situations where the \n     taxpayer-developed software is used to process the taxpayer's \n     own financial transactions, provide internal accounting \n     functions, or to prepare such taxpayer's own tax return. It \n     is not to be applied to situations where a taxpayer develops \n     software that is used by it to provide a service to its \n     unrelated customers.\n       Section (a)(4), Enforcement proceedings:\n       Currently, the Secretary and the Court handle summons \n     enforcement proceedings in a summary fashion. Because the \n     burden on the Secretary is so low, the Secretary merely files \n     the affidavit of the Revenue Agent conducting the affidavit. \n     This shifts the burden to the summoned person to show cause \n     why the summons should not be enforced. This burden is a \n     heavy one and the summoned person often is not allowed \n     discovery for evidence that bears on such issues.\n       Any time the Secretary brings an action to enforce a \n     summons issued under this section, the Court would be \n     required to conduct a hearing to determine whether the \n     Secretary has met the requirements of paragraph (2). The \n     courts shall allow the summoned party to conduct discovery so \n     that a proper defense can be presented. When a summons is \n     issued under this section for source code in the hands of a \n     third-party software publisher, the summoned person \n     ordinarily will have no independent knowledge of the facts \n     and issues surrounding the audit of the taxpayer. The Court \n     can enter such protective orders that are necessary to \n     prevent widespread disclosures of returns and return \n     information.\n       Section (a)(5), Compliance with Summons for Source Code:\n       A person in receipt of a summons for computer software \n     source code may comply with such a summons by producing a \n     hard copy printout of the portion of the source code \n     identified in the summons. If a person were required to \n     produce a digital copy of source code, the danger of multiple \n     copies being generated and transmitted outside the owner's \n     premises is heightened.\n       Section (b), Other Protections:\n       (1) Court Ordered Protections: Under current law, there is \n     a split among the courts of appeal over the authority of \n     district courts to conditionally enforce IRS summonses. The \n     Fifth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit hold that the court's \n     authority is limited and may issue only two types of orders: \n     (1) an order enforcing the summons in full, or (2) an order \n     quashing the summons in full. In the Eighth Circuit, the \n     courts have discretion to issue orders limiting the scope of \n     the summons and can place restrictions on the Secretary's use \n     of information obtained with a summons. With regard to \n     summonses issued under this section, the district courts are \n     given express statutory authority to issue such orders that \n     are necessary or appropriate to prevent disclosures of trade \n     secrets or other confidential information or to prevent undue \n     hardship on the summoned person. With respect to summonses \n     issued under this section, United States v. Barrett, 837 F.2d \n     1341 (5th Cir. 1988), is overruled. This provision has no \n     effect on the authority of the district courts with regard to \n     other types of summonses.\n       (2) Protection of Computer Software Code: The provisions of \n     this subsection apply to both source code and executable code \n     in the possession of the IRS, and apply whether or not an \n     enforcement proceeding is commenced. The provisions of this \n     section are in lieu of any protections that might be afforded \n     or disclosures that might be permitted under Section 6103. \n     These provisions are designed to: (1) limit the examination \n     of computer software code by the Secretary, (2) limit the \n     number of IRS employees who might be permitted access to such \n     computer code, (3) ensure that no unauthorized copies are \n     made, (4) require that all copies be returned or destroyed at \n     the end of the audit, and (5) bind any person who might be \n     exposed to such computer software code to the same or similar \n     restrictions on disclosure and competition that might be \n     imposed on its employees by the owner of such computer \n     software code. With regard to computer source code, the bill \n     permits the owner of such code to insist that it not be \n     removed from its business premises. Because the software \n     publisher will not be in direct privity of contract with \n     the IRS employee or outside consultant who will have \n     access to such code, the provision treats such owner as if \n     it were a party to the agreement. Thus, the software \n     publisher will have statutory standing to directly enforce \n     the terms of such agreements to prevent disclosures or \n     uses of trade secrets obtained in the course of an \n     examination.\n       The list of protections in the bill is not intended to be \n     exhaustive. The Secretary and the trade secret owner may \n     agree to other protective measures in a particular case. For \n     the avoidance of doubt, a district court in fashioning a \n     protective order is not limited to the list of protective \n     measures set forth in the statute.\n       Sec. (b), Compliance with Summons for Executable Code:\n       This section describes the circumstances under which a \n     taxpayer will be deemed to have complied with a summons \n     issued for certain computer software executable code. This \n     section only applies to commercially available computer \n     software executable code that is used by the taxpayer to \n     produce the tax return under examination or accounting \n     software that is used by the taxpayer to process \n     transactional data. A taxpayer will be deemed to have \n     satisfied a summons for such software upon production to the \n     Secretary of a read-only version of such software or a run-\n     time module containing data files produced by such software. \n     The Secretary shall not be entitled to a fully executable \n     version of such computer software executable code. However, \n     the version of the computer software executable code provided \n     by the taxpayer must allow the Secretary to\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\n     access such interim data files as might be produced by the \n     fully executable software. Such data files must be in a fully \n     readable mode.\n       Section (d), Definitions:\n       The term ``software'' is defined to include both computer \n     software source code and computer software executable code. \n     The general prohibition on issuance of a summons applies only \n     to a summons for computer software source code. The \n     additional protections apply to summons for software which \n     will include both source code and executable code.\n       This section adopts the common definitions of source code \n     and executable or ``object'' code.\n       ``The source code for a computer program is the series of \n     instructions to the computer for carrying out the various \n     tasks that are performed by the program, expressed in a \n     programming language which is easily comprehensible to \n     appropriately trained human beings. The source code serves \n     two functions. First, it can be treated as comparable to text \n     material, and in that respect can be printed out, read and \n     studied, and loaded into a computer's memory, in much the \n     same way that documents are loaded into word processing \n     equipment. Second, the source code can be used to cause the \n     computer to execute the program. To accomplish this, the \n     source code is ``compiled.'' This involves an automatic \n     process performed by the computer under the control of a \n     program called a ``compiler'' which translates the source \n     code into ``object code'' which is very difficult to \n     comprehend by human beings. The object code version of a \n     program is then loaded into the computer's memory and causes \n     the computer to carry out the program function.''--See, SAS \n     Institute, Inc. v. S & H Computer Systems, Inc., 605 F. Supp. \n     816, 818 (M.D. Tenn. 1985).\n       Machine language, on the other hand, which is most commonly \n     referred to as executable code or ``object'' code, is the \n     only language that a computer can actually understand. All \n     computer programs must be converted into machine language if \n     the computer is to be able to execute the instructions in the \n     program. Machine language is usually a binary language using \n     two sybols, 0 and 1, to indicate an open or closed switch. \n     Theoretically, computer programs can be written by \n     programmers in machine language, and at one point, they \n     actually were. But it is extremely difficult for humans to \n     think and write operational instructions in the form of \n     binary code.\n       Section (b), Criminal Actions:\n       This section amends Section 7213 to provide that \n     disclosures of the types of information dealt with under this \n     section would be punishable in the same manner as disclosures \n     of returns and return information.\n       Effective date:\n       The amendments made by this section shall take effect on \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 1693. A bill to renew, reform, reinvigorate, and protect the \nNational Park System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               vision 2020 national parks restoration act\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are many issues in the Congress that \ndivide us. We come from different areas. We come from different \nphilosophies. Today I come to the floor with a bill that is an \nopportunity to come together collectively, introducing a bill on one of \nthe uniquely American priorities that does, in fact, bind us together--\nour national parks.\n  If you have felt the Earth shake and experienced the thunder of Old \nFaithful in Yellowstone or contemplated the patriotic enigma at \nGettysburg, you can well understand my passion for support of these \nareas so important to our national identity. The value of national \nparks is clearly one of the cultural constants for Americans. As the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, I can tell you each and \nevery Senator needs to look at the perilous state of the parks today \nand act with me in developing some long-term solutions.\n  The bill I introduce today, Vision 2020, the National Parks \nRestoration Act, is a result of a quite lengthy process of inquiry and \nof study. Over the last year, the subcommittee has had more than 15 \npark-related hearings. We have spoken to dozens of park experts--\nenvironmental groups and user groups. We have listened to the \nsuggestions as well as the criticisms from our colleagues and have \nattracted activity in the House. Our purpose is and was to carefully \nreview the state of national parks and to evaluate areas for \nimprovement within the agencies.\n  We have found that there is a system of parks tremendously popular \nwith the public but afflicted by problems that the public sometimes \nonly vaguely recognizes. Let me share some of the findings. Our system \nof national parks stands at 376 units, including over 83 million acres \nof the most treasured landscapes and historical sites of our national \npossessions. The National Park Service is charged by law with a \ndistinctly unique mission--to protect its natural and cultural \nresources unimpaired for the enjoyment of current and future \ngenerations. It is a charge and responsibility that is hard to handle \nin the best of times. In times of fiscal constraint, that mandate \nrequires a broad range of innovative approaches to get that job done. \nEach year, over 250 million recreational users enjoy our parks. Our \nhearings revealed that each year 12 million visitors are from foreign \nlands, with their visitations contributing significantly, of course, to \nAmerica's $22 billion international travel trade surplus. This \nexplosive popularity directly stimulates over $10 billion in annual \neconomies locally and supports 230,000 tourism-related jobs.\n  However, the parks face many problems. One of the most pressing \nproblems facing the agency is the ``thinning of the blood,'' explained \nin one of our hearings by previous Park Service Director Jim Ridenour. \nAt the same time, new parks have been added to the system without \nappropriations to care for them. The agency has been saddled with new \nresponsibilities at the same time the resources have not been available \nfor the parks already there. Collectively, the shortfall between where \nthe Park Service is and where it should be in terms of maintenance, \nconstruction, staffing and resource protection is approximately $5 to \n$8 billion in arrears. Another problem is the wear and tear on roads, \nbridges, campgrounds and other facilities, leaving critics to observe \nthat the parks have been ``loved to death.''\n  As visiting populations grow, facilities that were often built \ndecades ago cannot stand the strain. It has become clear through our \noversight process that park managers are hobbled in their ability to \nassess the inventory of natural and cultural resources, probably one of \nthe primary functions of the park and the park management. The funding \nand cooperative cost sharing have simply not existed to catalog the \nresources that the parks must protect. At a time when we need the best \nfrom the Park Service managers, rangers, maintenance, scientific and \nadministrative staff, we find there is less to offer them in terms of \nprofessional development.\n  Probably as serious as any of these conditions is the problem of the \npublic apathy. Don't get me wrong, the Americans truly like their \nparks. They love their parks. But as of yet, that has not really \ntranslated into a definitive call for action from the Congress or the \nadministration.\n  In my local park of Yellowstone, there has been some increase in \nappropriations each year, but the required changes in terms of \nretirement, in terms of staffing and in terms of inflation have been \nmore than eaten up in the increase in the appropriations to where the \nexpendable income has, in fact, gone down.\n  Probably as serious as any of these conditions, as I said, is public \napathy. I can tell you, the day is coming when we will have increasing \nproblems, and I hope that we will be ahead of that game. I propose we \nmobilize ourselves to address these problems before we are in a crisis \nand have to close parks and take more costly measures.\n  I continue to say if we are to have these resources in the future for \nour kids and our future generations, then we are going to have to do \nsomething soon, the sooner the better, in terms of coming to a \nsolution. If we continue to do what we have been doing, we can't expect \nbetter results in the future.\n  So Vision 2020 provides a broad, systematic approach to addressing \nthe needs of the National Park Service. The restoration bill takes a \nbroad approach, with 11 titles covering key areas of concern. Vision \n2020 will enhance resource protection by extending the fee base that \ngoes directly to park programs. This will be accomplished by expanding, \nextending and dedicating to the park increased demonstration projects \nfees that were approved last year and that have been in effect 1 year. \nWe want to put them in all the parks where it is practical and lawful \nto collect those fees. We now have them in about 100 parks out of 376 \nthat can be expanded.\n  We need to harness the enthusiasm of voluntarism, and also \nphilanthropic donations. Voluntarism is alive and well\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\nin many parks. At Golden Gate Recreation Area, 8,400 residents of the \nBay Area donate time each year to support the park in a variety of \nways--volunteer time and philanthropic donations can be improved by \norders of magnitude to add to the solvency and expertise and the work \npower of parks. We need to tap the power of individual donors for local \ncauses.\n  At our hearing in Denver, I learned the charitable contributions are \nmost successfully subscribed from individual donors on a local basis, \nthose that visit or those that live, or those who are familiar with the \npark that is closest to them, where they can help monitor the direct \nresults. As a result, we also ask the National Park Foundation to \ndevelop a formal program of orientation, strengthening, guidance, and \nongoing assistance for park locales interested in developing friends \nand groups that are interested in supporting their local park. There \nare many in almost every park. We were in Gettysburg last week. \nGettysburg has several groups supportive of their own park.\n  We need to find ways to enhance the contribution of concessionaires. \nPark funding levels will be directly enhanced by asking the \nconcessionaire to help to shoulder a more realistic portion of the \npark's expenses through a fee structure that closely tracks their \nearnings in particular parks. At present, fee schedules vary widely. \nFace it, people do travel in parks. They do require lodging, meals and \nfacilities. Remember the purpose of the park? To preserve the resource \nand provide a pleasant and quality visit. That is what these \nconcessions do. Many concessionaires operate in an almost \nnoncompetitive market where the business is virtually assured. We are \nstriving for a fee system that maximizes revenues for these businesses \nprivileged to operate in parks--of course, recognizing the need for \nthem to make a profit in order to be there.\n  We need to improve park concession management performance. In \nfairness to concessionaires and park visitors who rely on their \nservices, a dramatic change is proposed in the way concessions are \nmanaged by the Park Service in this legislation. We think the parks \nshould utilize more of the private sector expertise in these activities \nthat are totally commercial in nature and we would utilize a private \nindustry asset manager to support many aspects of developing, bidding, \ndeveloping prospectus and rewarding management of commercial contracts. \nAn advisory board, made up of the agency and industry experts, would \nguide the director. This would be a board of three agency people, three \nprivate sector people, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, \ncontrolled, obviously, by the agencies, to ensure that whatever is done \nin the commercial sector does not, in fact, damage the resource \nprotection purpose of the park.\n  In addition to that, we are going to ask that our Hollywood friends \nshare some in the cost of maintaining parks. Hollywood will be asked to \ndo their part through a provision that ties filming fees to a small \npercentage of the commercial production costs. You would be surprised \nhow many movies are made in parks. We think that is fine, but there \nought to be some contribution. We are not asking much from Hollywood, \nbut the American public expects some return for the use of those public \nfacilities.\n  We are developing a Passport to Adventure to garner members. A park \n``passport system'' would be created featuring annually issued \ncollectible stamps similar to the successful duck stamp series, raising \nrevenues which would encourage people to contribute something to their \npark; or perhaps a tax refund contribution. We thought we would make it \neasy for people to make a contribution, a unique opportunity for \nAmerican taxpayers who want to not only talk the talk but will, as a \nresult, have an option of dedicating part of their tax refund to the \nNational Park Resource Protection programs by simply checking it off on \ntheir tax form.\n\n  Promoting agency professionalism. One title of the bill concentrates \non the strategy for developing more expertise among National Park \nService employees. By the way, let me say that my experience personally \nwith parks over the last year or two leads me to believe or feel that \nthere is a great deal of loyalty among park agency employees. I don't \nknow of an agency in the Federal Government where people are more \ncommitted or more loyal to what they do than the employees of the Park \nService. Of course, to be able to do that, they do need the additional \nability to have training as well as defining a system of recruitment. \nFuture park superintendents and senior managers need to have an \nopportunity to become as professional as possible.\n  We are interested in making sure that science is there as a \nfoundation for the management of these resources. Vision 2020 directs \nsupport for the science necessary to guide that important work by \nmaking some shifts in the program.\n  The Park Police are important. I guess I didn't realize myself until \nrecently what a significant contribution the Park Police make, \nparticularly here in Washington where there are over 400 Park Police to \ntake care of the parkways, the parks, the rivers, and all of the things \nhere, as well as in New York City. This aspect of the Park Service has \noften been overlooked. We are asking that there be some studies to \nassure that they have the resources to do the kinds of things that they \nare obliged to do.\n  Finally, we are going to talk about an innovative area of park \nresources. Almost all of the large parks have the same kinds of things \nthat small towns have. They have sewers, streets, buildings, all of \nwhich are very difficult to maintain on an annual budget. So we are \ngoing to seek to put into play, at least as a demonstration program, a \nbonding program where large parks like Yosemite could have an \nopportunity to issue bonds of $10 million--and, in fact, that will be \nthe limit for any park--to do some kind of facility restructuring that \ncan't come out of annual budgets, direct a stream of repayment revenue \nfrom the demonstration project so that maybe over 5 or 10 years those \nbonds would be retired--similar to what almost every government agency \ndoes in the whole world when they have facilities to build.\n  This won't be easy. It is not customary for the Federal Government to \nhave bonding programs. It's also, frankly, sometimes uncustomary for \nthe Government to do anything they haven't been doing for a hundred \nyears. So there will be some difficulty in causing that to happen. But \nwe think it's important, and we think it will be useful.\n  Basically, what we are seeking to do, Mr. President, is to recognize \nhow important parks are, to recognize the difficulty parks have had, \nand are continuing to have, in maintaining those resources, to deal \nwith some opportunities to supplement the taxpayers' appropriation \nsupport for parks by having some outside methods of raising funds that \ncan be used in the parks.\n  With those additional funds will go some requirements for additional \nand strengthened management, so that there is accountability for how \nthose dollars are spent. There will be a vision plan over a period of \ntime for the agency, with vision plans coming from each park, with \nmeasurable results in the plan. The GAO, the Government auditing \noffice, says often we have plans and we even have appropriations where \nthe plan is not implemented and we want to cause that to happen. And \nthen, in addition to that, of course, we want to help strengthen the \nmanagement through professionalism and do some things, such as bonding.\n  So, in conclusion, I want to ask you to consider for a moment an \nAmerica without national parks. How would we feel without Yosemite, \nIndependence Hall, or Grand Canyon protected for public enjoyment? How \nmuch of our national identity is reflected in these icons--the Statue \nof Liberty, Yellowstone, the National Capital Mall, or Old Faithful? \nHow much of the rugged, adventurous American spirit is still revisited \nby hiking the back country of Glacier or mountaineering in Alaska's \nDenali? What would America be without protecting habitat for bison, \nmoose, and bighorn sheep? These are the kinds of things we have \navailable. These are the kinds of things that challenge us to protect.\n  As Americans, what would we leave our children and grandchildren if \nnot these wild and historic places to reflect, recreate and pause for \nsome spiritual renewal? It seems to me that we all have an obligation \nto a measure of national service directed at strengthening our proud \nsystem of parks--the\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nfirst such system in the world--the system that over 100 other nations \nhave modeled after around the world.\n  So I am asking for the support of my colleagues for Vision 2020--not \nonly your vote, but also your review and constructive commentary. We \nworked very hard to put together the bill. We don't suggest that it is \nperfect. We will have hearings, and there will be an opportunity to \nevaluate how we achieve success. That is the key. These words are not \nunchangeable, but the goal is to preserve the parks.\n  I believe that together we can accomplish constructive changes. We \nhave an opportunity to bring the National Park Service and our national \nparks into the 21st century, alive, vibrant, effective and efficient. I \nthink the public expects us to seize upon that opportunity so that our \nparks will be healthy and available for them to enjoy for a very long \ntime in the future.\n  So, Mr. President, I will submit this bill. First of all, I will add \nSenator Spencer Abraham as an original sponsor. I submit the bill for \nintroduction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1155-6", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 467\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, the names of the Senator from New \nMexico (Mr. Bingaman) and the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) were added \nas cosponsors of S. 467, a bill to prevent discrimination against \nvictims of abuse in all lines of insurance.\n\n\n                                S. 1422\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1422, a bill to amend the \nCommunications Act of 1934 to promote competition in the market for \ndelivery of multichannel video programming and for other purposes.\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) was withdrawn as a cosponsor of S. 1422, \nsupra.\n\n\n                                S. 1605\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n(Ms. Moseley-Braun) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1605, A bill to \nestablish a matching grant program to help States, units of local \ngovernment, and Indian tribes to purchase armor vests for use by law \nenforcement officers.\n\n\n                                S. 1675\n\n  At the request of Mr. Shelby, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n(Mr. Murkowski) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1675, a bill to \nestablish a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis.\n\n\n                                S. 1677\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the names of the Senator from Oklahoma \n(Mr. Inhofe) and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1677, a bill to reauthorize the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act and the Partnerships for Wildlife Act.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 41\n\n  At the request of Mr. Sarbanes, the name of the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint \nResolution 41, A joint resolution approving the location of a Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Memorial in the Nation's Capital.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 155\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from Wisconsin \n(Mr. Kohl) and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Resolution 155, A resolution designating April 6 \nof each year as ``National Tartan Day'' to recognize the outstanding \nachievements and contributions made by Scottish Americans to the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1162-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1162-S1163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 186--CONCERNING ISRAELI MEMBERSHIP IN A UNITED \n                         NATIONS REGIONAL GROUP\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a \nresolution seeking to right a 50 year wrong. I am joined by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and 37 of my \ncolleagues. Having served as our Ambassador to the United Nations, I am \npainfully aware of the paradox facing Israel at the United Nations. \nIsrael is a state which was created by the United Nations, and yet for \n50 years has been treated as a step-child--or worse--in its dealings at \nthe United Nations.\n  Never was that more apparent than the sad period when the General \nAssembly equated Zionism with racism. It took a long 16 years to \nrepeal, but after great effort it was done. Today, I hope we can begin \na similar effort to end a Cold War anomaly. I speak of the fact that \nIsrael is excluded from a United Nations regional group. Israel is the \nonly one of the 185 member states of the United Nations barred from \nmembership in a regional group. The United Nations member states have \norganized themselves by regional groups since before Israel joined the \nUnited Nations in 1949. Membership in a United Nations regional group \nconfers eligibility to sit on the Security Council, the Economic and \nSocial Council, as well as other United Nations councils, commissions, \nand committees.\n  This effort could mirror that of the effort to repeal the odious \nGeneral Assembly Resolution 3379, equating Zionism with racism. That \neffort was led by Chaim Herzog. He came to Washington in 1987 for the \nfirst state visit by a President of Israel to the United States in \nhistory.\n  I took the floor of the Senate to introduce a Joint Resolution \nfollowing word-for-word an Australian measure calling for the repeal of \nResolution 3379.\n  The Senate and the House of Representatives adopted the resolution \nunanimously, in time for Chaim Herzog to address a Joint Meeting of \nCongress on November 10, 1987--on the 12th anniversary of his defense \nof Israel at the United Nations in opposition to Resolution 3379. \nPresident Reagan signed the resolution on November 17. Finally, there \nwas an American policy. We meant to repeal General Assembly Resolution \n3379.\n  Both the Zionism resolution and the rejectionist Arab Front would \nsoon lose their major support with the collapse of the Soviet Union. \nThe General Assembly overwhelmingly repealed Resolution 3379 on \nDecember 16, 1991. The fight had taken 16 years.\n  We won that battle but one cold war anachronism remains at the United \nNations. One sorry throwback to an era when the institutionalized \nisolation of Israel was a given in international affairs--the ugly \n``gentlemen's agreement'' that excludes Israel and only\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nIsrael from membership in any United Nations Regional Group. Israel--\nand only Israel--can never sit on the United Nations Security Council. \nIsrael--and only Israel--can never serve on the United Nations Economic \nand Social Council, where her expertise is so sorely missed. Israel--\nand only Israel--is less than a full member of the very international \norganization which bravely voted on November 29, 1947, to create the \nState of Israel.\n  A hundred years ago the Zionist Congress first articulated the \nZionist dream.\n  Fifty years ago the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the \nZionist dream.\n  Today, we call for Israel's admission to a United Nations Regional \nGroup. This must be a goal of our government's foreign policy and a \npriority of reform efforts at the United Nations. That such legislation \nis necessary is a reminder that, despite the unparalleled success of \nthe Zionist movement in its first hundred years, the state created half \na century ago as the fruit of this ideal still requires support from \nits friends.\n  I can think of no more fitting congressional tribute to this vision \nthan our country taking its rightful place in the forefront of the \neffort to allow Israel to participate fully in international affairs, \nto be counted as a legitimate member among the nations of the world.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for supporting the measure. In \nparticular I thank Senator Lugar for his strong support in this effort. \nI hope that this will begin an effort which will finally bring Israel \ncompletely within the fold of the United Nations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate regarding Israeli membership in a \nUnited Nations regional group. I am delighted to join Senator Moynihan \nin bringing this resolution to the attention of our colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  Over the years, many in the Congress have risen to comment on the \nUnited Nations. Many have been critical or skeptical about the role the \nUntied Nations can and does play in world affairs. Many have been \nlaudatory as well. There is a division in the Congress about the extent \nto which the United Nations helps to advance U.S. interests and world \npeace. Last year, the Congress devoted an enormous amount of time on \nlegislation to pay our arrears to the U.N. and the conditions and \nreforms which must be met before disbursement of our payments. That \nlegislative effort is still continuing. There are many disagreements \nabout the United Nations and I don't wish to revisit or bridge the gap \nbetween these views.\n  But, Mr. President there is an important United Nations issue on \nwhich all members of the Congress can agree and that is the resolution \nwe are introducing today. Senator Moynihan and I are joined by nearly \nforty members of the Senate who believe that an institutional \ninjustice, based on political reasons, has been perpetrated on the \nstate of Israel because it has been denied membership in a U.N. \n``regional group.'' On the surface, this denial would appear to be a \nminor oversight or slight snub of a long-standing member of the United \nNations. But, it is much more than that.\n  U.N. regional group membership confers eligibility to serve on the \nSecurity Council and other important committees of the United Nations \nsuch as the International Court of Justice and the U.N. Commission on \nHuman Rights. Nominations of members to serve on U.N. committees are \nmade by the regional groups. Israel does not belong to any regional \ngroup. Indeed, Israel is the only country in the United Nations that \ncan not claim membership in any regional group. As such, it is \nineligible for membership in the influential committees in the U.N. \nParadoxically, Iran, Cuba, Syria and Libya enjoy this privilege denied \nIsrael.\n  As with the United States Congress and most every legislative or \ndeliberative body, much of the real work is performed in committees, \ncouncils and other smaller deliberative bodies. To be denied membership \nin these committees is to be denied the opportunity to influence \nimportant decisions and actions of the United Nations. It is unfair and \nunjust and should be rectified as soon as possible.\n  Israel has not been allowed to join its natural regional group of the \nMiddle East and has expressed interest in joining the Western Europe \nand Others Group (WEOG) regional group. The WEOG group includes Western \nEuropean democracies, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and \nTurkey.\n  The resolution we are introducing today urges the President to help \nfacilitate Israel's membership in an appropriate U.N. regional group. \nUnder current circumstances, an appropriate regional group is most \nlikely to be the WEOG. It further urges the administration to report to \nthe Congress on the steps it has taken to assist Israel's membership in \na U.N. regional group and the success or failure of those efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask that all members take note of this resolution. \nIt seeks to bring full equality to Israel's membership in the United \nNations. I am confident that it will be supported by the entire body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1162-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1163-S1164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      THE INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BOND (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1677\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Breaux) proposed an \namendment to amendment No. 1676 proposed by Mr. Chafee to the bill (S. \n1173) to authorize funds for construction of highways, for highway \nsafety programs, and for mass transit programs, and for other purposes; \nas follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 181, strike line 20 and all that follows \n     through page 183, line 23, and insert the following:\n     esses.

Mr. President, I rise in this body to pay tribute \nto the gifted science fiction and fantasy writer Jo Clayton, who died \nFriday, February 13, in Portland, Oregon, two days short of her 59th \nbirthday. Clayton was hospitalized in July 1996 with the multiple \nmyeloma that eventually killed her. Her fight against the cancer of the \nbone marrow (plasma cells), mobilized the science fiction community and \nled to a national fund raising campaign to help her deal with the \nfinancial burden of her illness.\n  Jo Clayton was the author of 35 published novels and many short \nstories. She wrote in both the fantasy and the SF genres. In her best \nknown work, ``The Diadem'' series (1977), she anticipated by many years \nthe current technology which may allow development of computerized \ncomponents that can be integrated with a human mind. Jo Clayton's \nwriting was marked by complex, beautifully realized societies set in \nexotic worlds, lyrical prose, and compelling characters, both male and \nfemale.\n  Not counting sales of her last series, DRUMS OF CHAOS, Clayton's \nworks sold over 1,250,000 copies. While in the hospital, Clayton \nimpressed everyone with her courage by finishing DRUM CALLS, writing a \nnumber of short stories, and completing approximately half of the third \nvolume in the DRUMS trilogy, titled DRUMS OF CHAOS. San Francisco \nwriter Katharine Kerr, who worked with Clayton on a number of writing \nand editing projects, is Clayton's literary executor as well as good \nfriend. Kerr is expected to either finish the third book herself or \nselect a writer who will complete it.\n  Jo Clayton's impact on the science fiction community goes far beyond \nthe numbers of books sold which bear her name. Many people who didn't \nknow her personally were touched by her humor, compassion and zest for \nliving, even some who knew her only through the medium of electronic \ncommunications. It was an unexplained interruption in those \ncommunications which alerted friends to her health problems and led to \nher hospitalization. Those friends and others from afar supported her \nbattle with the illness which took her life 21 months later. Even those \nwith only fleeting contact were stirred by the courage and \ndetermination she displayed during that struggle.\n  Her legacy will live on not only in her books but in the memories of \nher friends and fans. Toward the end of her life, her friends gathered \nin person and on-line to honor her achievements and remember her \nenjoyment of things large and small. One friend, a fellow Portlander, \nJohn C. Bunnell, composed a poem for that evening, which I would like \nto share with you.\n\n                               Au Revoir\n\n     Joy shared with friends is what we'll think of first,\n     Or stories in a book too good to close.\n\n     Comes now a twilight, bringing with it tears;\n     Let no one shed them for her spirit, though,\n     As after evening, morning reappears,\n     Yet where the new day beckons, none here know.\n     Tomorrows without number yet remain\n     On printed page, or on some other plane;\n     No need to weep: her words will be her rose.\n\n  Mr. President, I submit that we all should be fortunate enough to \nhave friends willing to bear witness in ways such as this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1164-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1164-S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BICENTENNIAL OF EASTPORT, MAINE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \ncommunity of Eastport, Maine, which this week celebrated the 200th \nanniversary of its incorporation.\n  When the sun rises over the cities of America, it rises first over \nthe City of Eastport. The city, located on Moose Island, epitomizes the \nrugged beauty of Downeast Maine as well as the hearty and \nindividualistic nature of the region's people. This is a part of Maine \nand America where hard work is more than a virtue, it's a way of life--\nand neighbors look out for each other just as they have done for the \npast two centuries.\n  As the deepest natural harbor on the east coast, the lifeblood of \nEastport has always been the sea. In its earliest days, the city was a \ncenter for trade and ship building. Later, in the 1800's, Eastport \nbecame the birthplace of the American sardine industry, which was a \nmajor source of economic prosperity for the region for many decades, \nand the city's sea captains sailed from Eastport to ports from Boston \nto the West Indies.\n  Today, the city is very much a working port, where traditional \nfishermen and a vibrant and growing shipping industry exist side-by-\nside. In 1981, the first year of operation for the Eastport Port \nAuthority, the Port logged six vessels and 15,000 tons of cargo at its \n420-foot pier. Last year, according to the Authority's director, \nEastport shipped out value-added products to the tune of about $60 \nmillion, with markets ranging from Northern Europe to Taiwan to Italy \nand the Middle East.\n  Eastport also hosts an annual, week-long celebration of our nation's \nindependence every year during 4th of July week that is renowned across \nthe State of Maine. Steeped in tradition, the festival has included an \nalmost yearly visit from U.S. Navy vessels dating back to the days when \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, who summered across Passamaquoddy Bay on \nCampobello Island, was Secretary of the Navy. In fact, during the 4th \nof July celebration Eastport's population of about 2,000 swells six or \nseven times as visitors and former residents as well as the state's \nelected officials flock to the island city. Eastport also pays homage \nto its fishing tradition with its Salmon Festival each September, \ncelebrating an aquaculture industry which has become an important part \nof the local economy.\n  As Eastport celebrates its 200th Birthday, her people can be proud of \nthe community which supports a host of cultural and recreational \nopportunities. And they can be proud of a rich\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\nand unique history, which includes the historic site of the War of 1812 \nera Fort Sullivan--a part of which was relocated and appropriately \nlives on as a home to Eastport's Border Historical Society.\n  I first visited Eastport in 1977, and have returned many times over \nthe years, getting to know many of its residents--in fact, one Eastport \nnative is today my Chief of Staff. I have always been struck not only \nby the beauty of the area but also the hospitality of Eastport's \npeople.\n  Most recently, I was also struck by their strength and compassion in \nthe face of adversity. Last month, in the wake of devastating and \nunprecedented ice storms which left much of Maine without electricity, \nI visited the area to see first-hand how local residents were coping. I \nspent time at the emergency shelter set up at the Eastport Youth \nCenter. While there, I marveled how people in the community, like \nelsewhere in Maine, pulled together to help each other through a most \ndifficult and trying time.\n  I am proud to represent the City of Eastport in the United States \nSenate, particularly at this special time in the life of this great \ncommunity. I congratulate Eastport on this wonderful milestone, and \nwish her people all the best as the city looks ahead toward continued \nsuccess in the next hundred years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1164-4", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF REVEREND ROOSEVELT AUSTIN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with many of \nthe people from Saginaw, Michigan, as they recognize and honor Reverend \nRoosevelt Austin with the Coleman Temple Christian Board of Education \n``Living Legend'' award.\n  Each year, an individual is selected to receive this honor based on \noutstanding community service, achievement in the public and/or private \nsector, and commitment to the cause of political, social and economic \nadvancement for African Americans. Reverend Austin certainly meets the \ncriteria for this award. Recognized as one of the most influential \nleaders in the city of Saginaw, he is the pastor of Zion Missionary \nBaptist Church.\n  Reverend Austin was ordained nearly 35 years ago, and since then he \nhas truly made a difference in the lives of thousands of people. This \nis evidenced by the honors he has received from civic groups throughout \nthe years, from the Citizen of Saginaw Award bestowed upon him by the \ncity of Saginaw, to the Whitney M. Young Award, given to him by the Boy \nScouts of America. He serves on the boards of numerous organizations in \nhis community, including the National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored People, the Commission on Quality Education for all \nChildren, and Second National Bank of Saginaw.\n  Members of Zion Missionary Baptist Church would say that the most \nimportant role Reverend Austin plays is that of a spiritual leader. \nIndeed, from his work in the Saginaw County Jail to the lives he \ntouches each day in his own congregation, Reverend Austin is deeply \ndevoted to his ministry and to the spiritual well-being of so many \npeople in Saginaw.\n  Mr. President, throughout his career, Reverend Roosevelt Austin has \ntruly exemplified the ideals which are the foundation for the Coleman \nTemple Christian Board of Education ``Living Legend'' award. I know my \ncolleagues will join me in recognizing Reverend Austin for his \ncommitment to his community and to equality and justice for all \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1165-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       KJIL--STATION OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the \nsouthwest Kansas radio station KJIL 99.1 FM for being awarded the \n``Station of the Year'' by Focus on the Family radio ministry.\n  KJIL is a 100,000 watt Christian radio station based in Meade, \nKansas. Although it has been on the air for only five years, it has \nplayed a significant and positive role in the community and throughout \nthe western region of Kansas. Last year alone, the station sponsored \nseveral family-oriented concerts, helped organize transportation for \ncommunity members to the Promise-Keepers rally in Washington, and \nexpanded its network for 16 different translator stations.\n  I particularly wish to commend Don Hughes, the station manager of \nKJIL, for his leadership and vision. And I am particularly pleased that \nan organization as worthy as Focus on the Family Radio ministries has \nrecognized the station's achievements. It is a great honor, but no \ngreat surprise, that KJIL has received the ``Station of the Year'' \naward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1165-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1165-S1173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                            U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM OCT. 1 TO DEC. 31, 1997                                            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebra Reed:                                                                                                                                                                                     \n    Japan..................................

For almost a year's time now, I have expressed \npublicly, both in this country and in Europe, my deep reservations \nabout the proposed expansion of this alliance. I listened carefully to \na briefing about the remarks of my colleagues today, and I wish to \nassociate myself with their remarks because I think this body must \nspend whatever time it feels is necessary to carefully analyze this \nquestion.\n  NATO was put in place at a historic moment in our history. I always \ncredit President Harry Truman for his foresight, together with that of \nothers, regarding the importance of this wonderful, absolutely \nmagnificent, military alliance that has exceeded, in every way, the \nexpectations of its founders. Unquestionably, in this Senator's mind, \nand I think in the minds of many, we averted a military confrontation \nwith the former Soviet Union as a consequence of the NATO treaty. I \nthink that the basic tensions that existed in Europe at that time exist \ntoday, although not at the same level of intensity.\n  There has always been a measure of instability between the major \npowers on the continent and indeed with Great Britain. The United \nStates has fulfilled, I think, quietly, nevertheless effectively, a \nstrong, steady hand on those competitive forces amongst those\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\nvery ancient nations--certainly ancient in terms of the 200-plus-year \nhistory of this country--as they have struggled in terms of economic \ncompetition and, indeed, tragically in military confrontations in years \npast.\n  My father served in World War I in France as a doctor. That was the \nfirst time that the United States really responded militarily by going \nto that continent. And then, of course, World War II is very clear in \nthe memories of all. So those are just two examples.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today as in executive session to submit for \nthe Record a condition that I will seek to attach to the Resolution of \nRatification, the U.S. Senate's procedure under the ``advice and \nconsent'' clause of the U.S. Constitution, to facilitate the proposed \nNATO expansion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the condition be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the text of the amendment was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n       (  ) United states policy regarding further expansion of \n     nato.--Prior to the date of ratification of the Protocols by \n     the United States, the President shall certify to the Senate \n     that it is the policy of the United States not to encourage, \n     participate in, or agree to any further expansion in the \n     membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     for a period of at least three years beginning on the date of \n     entry into force of the last of the Protocols to the North \n     Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the \n     Czech Republic to enter into force.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to thank my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, from New York from being my principal co-\nsponsor. Throughout he has been a consistent supporter of this \nobjective and will be the principal Member from the other side of the \naisle as I work this amendment among our body.\n  Let me also say thanks for the very important contributions of \nSenator Bingaman. He serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee with \nme. He is a broad-based thinker on national security issues, and he \nwill be joining us as we seek to get the support of our colleagues.\n  As I stated throughout last year, 1997, and continuing this year, I \npublicly have spoken here and in Europe regarding my deep concerns over \nthe proposed expansion of NATO by admitting Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic, which is the current proposal.\n  I believe these accessions are not in the security interests of the \nNATO alliance. My detailed reasons against are to be found in earlier \nstatements.\n  In the course of the ratification debate, I will work with colleagues \nin opposition to the ratification of these three nations. I view my \namendment, however, as supportive of our shared goals, and in no way \nshould it be viewed as a concession on my part in my opposition or an \nindication that I accept the accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic as a fait accompli. But I have had this amendment in mind, and \nI have spoken about it. I discussed it at length at the Wehrkunde \nconference a few weeks ago when I was privileged to be in the company \nof the Secretary of Defense and the delegation from the Senate that was \nheaded by Senator McCain, one of our most valued Members in areas of \nnational defense. I am not suggesting that either of those persons \nshare my view, but I did at that time express it very clearly to a \nnumber of persons attending that conference.\n  This condition does not affect the three nations currently under \nconsideration for NATO membership--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic. Rather it focuses on the future by requiring a ``strategic \npause'' of 3 years before proceeding with any further expansion of NATO \nmembership.\n  As to my reasons for opposition to NATO expansion, I start from the \nbasic premise that NATO has been the most successful military alliance \nin the history of the United States, perhaps, in the history of the \nworld. NATO has surpassed all of the expectations of its founders, \nkeeping peace in Europe for almost 50 years and emerging victorious in \nthe cold war. In my view, NATO remains a vital, effective military \nalliance which will continue--in its present form--to be the bedrock of \nU.S. security policy in Europe.\n  In his biography, Harry Truman cited NATO, together with the Marshall \nplan, as the greatest achievements of his Presidency. The Senate should \nnot do anything to undermine his legacy or the effectiveness of this \ngreat alliance.\n  The condition I am introducing today is straightforward. It requires \nthe President to certify ``that it is the policy of the United States \nnot to encourage, participate in, or agree to any further expansion in \nthe membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for a \nperiod of at least three years'' beginning on the date of entry into \nforce of the last of the Protocols of Accession of Poland, Hungary and \nthe Czech Republic.\n  Why is this condition necessary? Assuming the Protocols of Accession \nare approved by all 16 nations, this condition would give NATO an \nopportunity to begin to integrate the first three new members and \nassess the impact of this first round of expansion before proceeding to \nany future rounds.\n  There are many unanswered questions concerning this first round of \nexpansion.\n  What will the true costs of expansion be for current and new members? \nEstimates have ranged from a low of $1.5 billion over 10 years to a \nhigh of $125 billion over the same timeframe. What is the U.S. share of \nthis cost and will our current allies fairly share the burdens of \nexpansion?\n  How long will it take for these new nations to modernize their \nmilitaries to the point where they can make a positive contribution to \nthe security of the alliance? NATO's 10-year cost time line indicates \nthat NATO is planning on at least a decade of modernization and \nintegration efforts. Do we really want to add additional burdens to \nthat ambitious plan?\n  On a related issue, Thursday's ``Washington Post'' carried an article \nentitled, ``Poland Unable to Perform All NATO Tasks.'' Citing \n``budgetary shortfalls,'' the Polish Defense Ministry announced that \nPoland would only be able to meet 70% of its expected military roles \nwithin NATO upon accession. What is interesting about this story is not \nthe military shortfalls--which many of us anticipated--but the fact \nthat these shortfalls are being revealed as NATO is currently going \nthrough the process of assessing the military capabilities of these \nthree nations and establishing force goals for them. This is a process \nwhich will not be completed until late spring or early summer--months \nafter the Senate is being asked to act on these Protocols.\n  I am led to the inevitable conclusion that we are being asked to act \non the vital issue of NATO expansion in an information vacuum. In an \nOctober 1997 statement to the Senate Budget Committee, Susan Eisenhower \naddressed this issue with a frightening analogy: ``If ratification is \nto be voted on now or in the next session, it would be as if an air \ntraffic control agent had cleared a plane for take-off, knowing full \nwell that the crew on board had filed several contradictory flight \nplans, didn't know when or if they'd pick up other passengers, and \nweren't even sure that their landing gear worked.''\n  Returning to my series of questions: How will the Russians react to \nthe reality of NATO expansion eastward? While I agree that the Russians \nshould not be placed in a position of dictating United States or NATO \npolicy, we must factor into this equation the reaction of the only \nnation on earth that possesses the military capability to destroy our \nnation.\n  Will the American people support the use of U.S. troops to defend \nPoland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and possibly more nations in \nCentral and Eastern Europe? Or are our security commitments being \nstretched too thin?\n\n  Time alone will answer these questions. We should not rush forward \nwith a follow-on expansion round beginning in April 1999, immediately \nafter these first three new members take their seat at the table. We \nneed to know the impact of this first round on the alliance and not \nallow ourselves to be swayed by political reasons to rush ahead, \nuninformed.\n  I well remember the NATO debates of the 1980's when Senator \nMansfield, former majority leader, led the charge to withdraw our \ntroops from Europe. Other picked up his mantle when he departed the \nSenate. Almost annually, those of us who supported NATO were\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\nsummoned to come to the floor and defend the U.S. troop commitment to \nNATO. I fear that we could see a repeat of those times if we do not \nproceed cautiously with NATO expansion, and ensure that any expansion \nhas the full support of the American people who will ultimately bear \nthe burden for these added security commitments.\n  In a June 1997 report entitled, ``NATO Expansion: A Bridge to the \nNineteenth Century,'' Professor Michael Mandelbaum expressed these \nconcerns in the following way:\n\n       When the American public decides that an international \n     commitment has been extended under false pretenses, or that \n     such a commitment is more expensive than its government has \n     promised, or that whatever the government has promised the \n     cost of the commitment is too high, it tends to withdraw its \n     support, which causes the commitment in question to collapse.\n\n  That is my biggest fear with NATO expansion--that it could undermine \nthe American public's support for NATO itself.\n  I believe the 3-year timeframe contained in this condition is a \nreasonable one. It is long enough for NATO to have made a reasonable \nassessment of the impact of the first round, but it is not so long as \nto remove hope from future aspirants to NATO membership. Many have \nadvocated a longer moratorium. My good friend and former colleague Sam \nNunn, when he was still in the Senate, recommended a 10-year pause \nbetween rounds.\n  Senator Nunn recently joined with Senator Baker, General Scowcroft, \nand Alton Frye in an excellent op-ed regarding NATO expansion entitled, \n``NATO: A Debate Recast.'' They join me in a call for caution on any \nfurther rounds of expansion. According to this article, ``NATO should \nbe the cornerstone of an evolving security order in Europe . . . But a \ncornerstone is not a sponge. The function of a cornerstone is to \nprotect its own integrity to support a wider security structure, not to \ndissipate its cohesion by absorbing members and responsibilities beyond \nprudent limits.'' They recommend a ``definite, if not permanent, \npause'' in the process of expansion.\n  Former Secretaries Perry and Christopher also recently joined the \nranks of those urging caution regarding further expansion of the \nalliance. I do not want to misrepresent their position--they clearly \nstate that the door should remain open to membership for all \nPartnership for Peace nations. However, they argue that ``no additional \nnations should be designated for admission until the three countries \nnow in the NATO queue (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) are \nfully prepared to bear the responsibilities of membership and have been \nfully integrated into the alliance military and political structures.'' \nWhile they do not endorse the idea of a mandated pause, they clearly \nbelieve that the process should be slowed down. I agree.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this endeavor to inject an element \nof caution into U.S. policy on this important issue.\n  I also want to add that in the course of my trip to Europe two weeks \nago with the Secretary of Defense, we visited Russia. We visited with \nthe Defense Minister, Marshall Sergeyev, and the Foreign Minister, and \nwe had a very valuable session with about eight members of the Russian \nDuma. NATO expansion was their No. 1 area of concern regarding the \nrelationship between the United States and Russia today. That \nrelationship, in the minds of many, is deteriorating--deteriorating at \nthe very time when we are making a number of collaborative efforts to \ntry to lessen not only tensions that still remain between our two \nnations but in furtherance of the recognition that the world can become \na more peaceful and a more secure place if Russia and the United States \njoin in many areas to provide that peaceful security.\n  For example, Bosnia. Today there is a contingent of professional \nRussian military serving alongside U.S. forces and those of our allied \nnations. That is a most historic first.\n  While in Russia with the Secretary of Defense, we went to visit \nfacilities which are utilizing moneys authorized and appropriated by \nthe U.S. Senate, and Congress as a whole, again directed towards \nlessening the tensions between these two nations in the area of nuclear \nweapons.\n  We saw, for example, where American taxpayer dollars paid for \nequipment which the Russians are now using to dismantle, in accordance \nwith framework of treaties, nuclear weapons in a safe manner using \ntechnology which originated here in the United States and supplemented \nby technology in Russia. There is only really one major threat to the \nsecurity of this country that always hangs above all others; that is, \nthat Russia still possesses, and for the foreseeable future will \npossess, a nuclear arsenal that could devastate our Nation. I am not \nsuggesting in any way that we are not making progress toward the \nlessening of tensions, but it remains there. Of course, beneath that is \nthe threat of spreading knowledge relating to weapons of mass \ndestruction. Much of that knowledge is leaking out of the former Soviet \nUnion, today Russia, as to how to manufacture those weapons.\n  I think that we should address in the context of the expansion \nargument the concerns of the Russian Duma, or the Russian leadership, \nregarding this expansion and how it might affect our relationship with \nRussia at this critical point in time.\n  This valuable NATO alliance has been with us for over a half a \ncentury. I don't suggest that we spend the next half century \nconsidering this expansion issue, but certainly the several months that \nwe need can be allocated to the important debate that will take place \nin this Chamber, maybe a time less than several months, but certainly \nnot this rush of schedule that we are on now.\n  So I raise these issues today because the distinguished chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, I understand, intends to have a markup \nnext week. I think, in fairness to him and to the colleagues on that \ncommittee and to other Senators, I and others should express these \nconcerns in a timely fashion today.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes, prior to adjournment. \nUnderstanding, therefore, that I am all that stands between the Chamber \nand adjournment, I will try to speak less than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1173-7", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1175-S1176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NYKESHA SALES\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, one of the great opportunities that \ncomes with having been elected a Member of the U.S. Senate is to \nparticipate in deliberations on this great floor. Not just, may I say, \nthe discussions and debates and votes on specific legislation, but to \nparticipate in what we call here morning business, which I have always \nseen as the people's forum, an opportunity to speak on events of the \nday, both public and, in some senses, those that are more personal. I \nwould like to do that this morning.\n  The subject involves athletics, but it also involves, I think, \nvalues. This will not be the first time that any Member of the Senate \nhas spoken on the floor about athletics, particularly about a team in \nhis or her own home State. But the circumstances that lead me to stand \ntoday are somewhat different. In my own home State of Connecticut, and \nit seems in many places across the Nation, there are discussions in \nnewspapers, in diners, on the radio, probably around the water cooler \nat the office, about what happened on the UCONN women's basketball team \nthis week. Our great coach, Geno Auriemma, coach of our No. 2 ranked \nUniversity of Connecticut women's basketball team--and, I may say with \nsome honesty and a certain amount of envy, the occupant of the chair \nhappens to come from the State where the No. 1 team is, Tennessee. But \nCoach Auriemma gave a most unusual gift, as it was put, to his All-\nAmerica forward, Nykesha Sales, who is also a native of the State of \nConnecticut.\n  As is known by most, with the help of the Villanova Wildcats, who \nUCONN\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\nwas playing on this occasion, the coaches, the referees, in fact even \nwith the help and consent of Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese, \nCoach Auriemma gave Nykesha Sales her place as an all-time leading \nscorer in Connecticut women's basketball history.\n  That seems generous enough and positive enough, but, as my colleagues \nprobably know, the record has been called into question. Although the \nbox score lists those two points, they were obtained through an \nuncontested lay-up that required the involvement and consent, if you \nwill, of every player on the floor of that arena and of the coaches as \nwell.\n  Three days prior to that match, that basketball game against \nVillanova, Nykesha Sales ruptured her Achilles' tendon, thus ending her \nseason and, since this is her senior year, her career at the University \nof Connecticut, leaving her just two points short of the record as the \nall-time women's basketball scorer, a record that we all felt, who have \nwatched this wonderful young woman with pride over these last years--we \nall knew she deserved. This was heartbreaking news, not just to her and \nher family but to the entire team, to the coach, to fans throughout the \nState and I would guess fans of college basketball everywhere. So Coach \nAuriemma reacted as a human being with a big heart, which he has; as a \ngreat coach as well. He went to the extra effort to arrange a way for \nhis star player to get that game-time basket that she needed to \nestablish her place in the University of Connecticut record books.\n  Since that moment, Tuesday night of this week, Coach Auriemma has \nbeen criticized by many who say that this gift that he gave, which a \nlot of us feel was not just a gift but something Nykesha Sales earned \nover her extraordinary career at the University of Connecticut, somehow \ncalls into question the integrity of the game, that in some way it is \nanother form of cheating, some have said surprisingly, and that it in \nsome way cheapens the record.\n  I rise today to say to my colleagues here in the Senate that I feel \nquite the opposite. I think in this gesture, in this act, Coach \nAuriemma, the coach of the Villanova team, and all the other players on \nthe field, have reminded us that beneath the thrill of victory and the \nagony of defeat with which they and we all identify, sports can provide \nopportunities for values to be learned and for lessons to be conveyed. \nSports are a passion here in America. I yield to that passion myself. \nWe find a way, over and over, to take personally the things that happen \non courts and in stadiums around the country. The reason I think we are \nso attuned to these events is because of the complex web of individual \ndramas underneath the final score that keeps us riveted throughout the \nseasons and throughout the years.\n  Just as teams become families among themselves when they are at their \nbest, so do our favorite teams, in fact, become our own extended \nfamilies. Former Connecticut women's basketball star, current \nprofessional basketball star Rebecca Lobo perhaps said it best about \nthe events of this week, when she said, ``if the UCONN family''--and I \nstress the family here--``doesn't have a problem with it, why does \neveryone else?'' In fact, this was a University of Connecticut \nbasketball record, a school record.\n  There are obviously unforgettable moments in sports, moments when we \nare all left full of pride, sometimes full of despair, disappointment. \nWe in Connecticut have had our share, like the extraordinary Tate \nGeorge buzzerbeater in the 1990 NCAA tournament, the same NCAA \nchampionship that the same UCONN women's basketball team won in 1995. \nBut I would say that the record that Nykesha Sales established this \nweek joins that kind of high ranking of memorable and historic events \nin Connecticut sports history. It's true that Nykesha's basket may not \nhave been the single greatest moment of her athletic prowess, \nnonetheless it was a remarkably profound moment of sportsmanship, of \nvalues, of team spirit, of a sense of family that these teams at their \nbest exemplify.\n\n  For those who would condemn or criticize a caring coach and a \ngrateful player for doing this, I really ask you to reconsider, again, \nbeneath the box score, the final tally, the thrill of victory or the \nagony of defeat, what these sports, particularly at the college level, \ncan convey to those who participate in them. I think we have a coach \nhere, and a player, who have exemplified the very best in their \ncareers. Coach Auriemma displayed a level of concern and, in fact, a \nkind of courage in doing what he did, and it exemplifies the program \nthat athletic director Lew Perkins has set up at the University of \nConnecticut, and that not only Coach Auriemma and the women's team \nexemplify but Coach Jim Calhoun on the men's team do as well. These are \nfamilies. These two coaches are, in a way, for the sake of those \nfamilies, the fathers. They practice a kind of what some may call \n``tough love.'' They demand a lot of their players, but they also give \na lot back to those players.\n  There are no two more competitive coaches, no two more competitive \nteams; yet, underneath that, extraordinary personal relationships have \ndeveloped. I always take great pride and am moved by the stories of the \nUCONN basketball players, men and women, when they leave the school, \ngraduate and go on--and this, of course, is true throughout the country \nand important to remember--that they have a tendency to call the \ncoaches for advice about personal decisions in their lives. So there \nare lessons learned here and values exemplified. Perhaps these don't \nreceive as much attention as they should in the coverage of sports \ntoday. But, again, particularly at the college level, I think that this \nis ultimately what it is all about.\n  In this unusual act, Coach Auriemma, and everyone else who was \ninvolved in this decision, I think, has not only done the right thing, \nbut have reminded us that as much as we all share in the exultation of \nvictory and the agony of defeat when it affects our team, that \nsomething else is going on which is that individual skills are being \ndeveloped, that relationships are being formed, that a kind of \ncommunity is being formed, that people accept responsibility for one \nanother, and that those values--as we have seen as these players have \nleft the University of Connecticut and so many other college programs \naround the country--those values, those relationships, that trust \ncontinues on beyond and after the competitive days. It leaves us, \nthrilled as we all are to follow our favorite teams, with lessons that \nare ultimately more lasting and certainly are profoundly encouraging. \nSo, perhaps it is only sports. Maybe we all make too much of it. But I \nwanted to rise to the defense of a great coach, a great player, a great \nprogram, a great team, and tell them that I am proud of them.\n  I would say, finally, and with all respect to the occupant of the \nchair, it is going to be hard for this UCONN women's basketball team to \ngo on to the post-season competition without Nykesha Sales, who was \ntheir star. I know they are going to give it their all, and I want to \nsay to them that no matter what happens in this NCAA post-season \ncompetition, that as far as I am concerned--and I am sure I speak for \neverybody in the State of Connecticut, regardless of what the results \nare--this team and this coach, both on the court and off, are winners.\n  I thank the Chair and I believe with that and yielding of the floor, \nthe Senate will be adjourned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/27/senate-section/article/S1175-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
