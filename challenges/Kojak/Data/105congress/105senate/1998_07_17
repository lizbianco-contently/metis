Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2168.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2168) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     for sundry independent agencies, commissions, corporations, \n     and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Wellstone/Murray/McCain amendment No. 3199, to restore \n     veterans tobacco-related benefits as in effect before the \n     enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century.\n       Murkowski amendment No. 3200, to provide land allotments \n     for certain Native Alaskan veterans.\n       Nickles amendment No. 3202, to provide for an increase in \n     FHA single family maximum mortgage amounts and GNMA guaranty \n     fee.\n       Burns amendment No. 3205, to provide for insurance and \n     indemnification with respect to the development of certain \n     experimental aerospace vehicles.\n       Sessions amendment No. 3206, to increase funding for \n     activities of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration concerning science and technology, \n     aeronautics, space transportation, and technology by reducing \n     funding for the AmeriCorps program.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3199\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Wellstone \namendment. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Murray, Senator McCain and myself. This amendment speaks to an \ninjustice. This amendment would restore benefits to veterans for \nsmoking-related diseases. We had a lot of smoke and mirrors, we did a \nlot of things in the budget resolution that we should not have done. We \nhave never had an up-or-down vote.\n  What this amendment essentially says is we should not have used that \noffset for highways, taking benefits that go to veterans. It is that \nclear.\n  Mr. President, let me just be crystal clear. There have been a lot of \nOMB stories that I would question. I believe there will not be that \nmuch that will be required, but this funding ought to go to veterans. \nIn fact, I would argue you will never get the $17 billion for highways, \nand we will ultimately have to go to surplus anyway. I have heard my \ncolleagues talk about the surplus that we are going to have. We can at\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nleast take a little bit of that surplus and give it back to veterans. \nWe never should have taken their benefits away. It was an injustice. \nThis amendment by Senator Murray, Senator McCain, and myself would \nrestore those benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I do strongly support the work of Chairman Bond and Senator \nMikulski. I do not take challenging an appropriations bill lightly. \nHowever, in this instance, I feel strongly that I must join my \ncolleagues Senator Wellstone and Senator McCain in seeking to repeal \nthe veterans grab contained in the recently adopted transportation and \nIRS legislation.\n  The bill before us today is a veterans bill. It funds health care and \nI thank the leaders of this subcommittee for increasing health care \nfunding by more than $200 million. This increase in health care funding \nis my number one veterans priority. I also strongly support the \nsubcommittee's work on VA medical research, the national cemetery \nsystem, and homeless veterans. These are all very important programs.\n  However, I continue to oppose the veterans offset used to fund \nincreases in transportation. These cuts have been attached to \npolitically popular bills. The transportation legislation and the IRS \nreform bill both passed by overwhelming and bipartisan margins. Both \nwere admirable pieces of legislation with the exception of the veterans \ngrab hidden within those bills.\n  I have been fighting this veterans grab all year. It was in the \nPresident's budget and I opposed it. At the Budget Committee, I voted \nagainst Democratic and Republican proposals that included the \ndisastrous cuts to veterans health. And on the Senate floor, I voted \nagainst the Craig/Domenici amendment to validate the $10 billion cut in \nveterans funding and against the budget one final time in opposition to \nthese cuts to veterans.\n  Just last week, I asked the Senate to sustain a point of order on the \nIRS reform bill to support my effort to strike the veterans cuts. That \nmost recent effort failed by one vote. One vote.\n  My colleagues need to know that this issue is not going to go away. \nThis issue has touched a nerve with America's veterans. They are deeply \noffended that the Congress and the Administration would divert money \ntargeted to care for sick veterans to pay for other spending \npriorities. That's why Senator Wellstone, Senator McCain, Senator \nRockefeller, and I will keep coming back.\n  Our efforts to repeal the $17 billion veterans grab have been denied \nthrough procedural maneuvers. Some may think this insulates them from \naccountability. It does not. Veterans know that procedural moves are \nbeing used to block a straight up or down vote on this issue.\n  This amendment is a special opportunity for the Senate. With our \nvotes for Wellstone-Murray-McCain, we can send a very clear message to \nveterans all across our country. Passage says that the United States \nSenate recognizes that using veterans funding for other spending \npriorities is wrong. Passage of this amendment says to veterans that we \nare moving to restore this funding to where it belongs. The $17 billion \nbelongs at the VA.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Wellstone-Murray-McCain amendment \nto repeal the veterans cuts associated with the transportation \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota to restore \nveterans' disability benefits for smoking-related illnesses. Earlier \nthis year, the Senate made a mistake. In order to help pay for the \nhighway bill, it reduced veterans' disability benefits. Specifically, \nit overturned a decision by the General Counsel at the Department of \nVeterans' Affairs that smoking related illnesses were service connected \nand could qualify a veteran for VA disability and health benefits.\n  As I said, the Senate made a mistake when it did this, but I want the \nrecord to show that I strenuously opposed this mistake. Throughout the \nbudget process and deliberations on the highway bill, I consistently \nopposed efforts to pay for the highway bill by reducing VA disability \nbenefits. In fact, during consideration of the Senate Budget Resolution \nfor Fiscal Year 1999, I voted against the Domenici amendment that \ncleared the way for this raid on veterans' benefits. And during \nconsideration of the tobacco bill, I cosponsored the McCain amendment \nto use a portion of tobacco revenues to fund veterans' health benefits.\n  I took those actions and I support this amendment for one very simple \nreason. It's the right thing to do. We all know that the U.S. military \nencouraged the use of tobacco products by young service members. We all \nknow that the tobacco companies provided cigarettes to the Pentagon \nfree of charge. In return, the military for years distributed free \ncigarettes in C-rations and K-rations. Military training included \nsmoking breaks. And until very recently, cigarettes were available on \nmilitary bases at vastly reduced prices.\n  Mr. President, it could not be more clear that the Federal government \nhas a responsibility to our veterans to help them cope with illnesses \nthat they acquired after the government encouraged them to get hooked \non tobacco products in the first place. The Federal government should \nnot walk away from this responsibility. It should not deny veterans' \nbenefits for smoking related illnesses.\n  This amendment rights the wrong we did to veterans earlier this year. \nIt restores benefits to those who put their lives on the line for our \ncountry. When the Senate passed the highway bill, I assured veterans in \nmy State that I would work to correct the injustice that it contained. \nThis amendment does exactly that. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as a veteran, I rise in strong support \nof this amendment to restore funds for service-related medical \nconditions that result from tobacco use. This amendment offers a chance \nto reverse that cut, which the Clinton Administration proposed earlier \nin this process, and to reiterate our commitment to veterans.\n  I voted for the transportation bill that included this cut because \nthe bill increased North Carolina highway funds by more than $1.5 \nbillion. I put a lot of hard work into that highway bill, and, \ncertainly, there is not a member of the Senate more committed to a safe \nand efficient transportation infrastructure than I. However, after \nfurther review in the relevant committees over the past several months, \nthis cut was exposed to some sunlight and revealed as a rush to \njudgment and a disservice to American veterans.\n  Frankly, this episode illustrates that we need to be better attuned \nto veterans issues, and we need to be more cautious about the effects \nof these provisions. As a veteran of the United States Army and the \njunior Senator from North Carolina, a State that is home to some \n700,000 former soldiers, I cherish opportunities to serve our veterans. \nFor example, I set up small constituent services offices across North \nCarolina to best service their needs, because I know that not all \nveterans--certainly not those wounded in the line of duty--are as \nmobile as the general population.\n  I urge the Senate to fulfill our commitment to American veterans. The \nfacts are now clear. This amendment presents a clear choice. Yes or no. \nWe stand with veterans or we do not. I choose to stand with those who \nserved our flag and our nation in her times of need.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I support my colleagues, Senator \nWellstone and Senator Murray, in their efforts to restore the veterans \nbenefit that was unjustly cut to pay for unprecedented increases in the \nhighway bill.\n  Adoption of this amendment would restore the former state of the law, \nby reinstating disability rights for veterans, while still fully \npreserving each and every highway project that was included in the \nhighway bill and in the corrections bill that was covertly attached to \nthe IRS Restructuring bill.\n  Prior to the enactment of the highway bill, the law required the \npayment of disability compensation to veterans who could prove that \nthey became addicted to tobacco use while in military service, if that \naddiction continued without interruption, and resulted in an illness \nand in disability. The conference report on the highway bill rescinded \nthis compensation to disabled veterans, generating $17 billion in \n``paper savings'' to fund an unprecedented increase in ISTEA.\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\n  Of course, anyone familiar with these claims for compensation for \ntobacco-related illnesses knows that OMB's cost estimate is just a \nguess. Since 1993, VA has received less than 8,000 claims, and has only \ngranted between 200-300. In arriving at its $17 billion estimate, the \nAdministration, for some unexplained reason, estimated that 500,000 \nveterans would file tobacco-related claims each year. The actual cost \nto VA for claims filed over the last six years has been a few million \ndollars, not anywhere near the $17 billion estimate.\n  I will again remind my fellow Senators who think that subsequent \nactions have discharged any further responsibility to these veterans, \nthat so far, the Congress has done nothing to undo this wrong. An \namendment was adopted to direct a portion of the proceeds from the \ntobacco bill to VA health care--but it was only for health care, and \nnot for compensation, that is, monthly disability benefits for tobacco-\nrelated illnesses. But now there is no tobacco bill. So that effort is \nmeaningless.\n  There were also some provisions in the highway bill that provided \nenhancements to some very important VA programs--the GI Bill, grants \nfor adaptive automobile equipment, and reinstatement of benefits to \nsurviving spouses, to name a few. But the veterans community was not \nbought off by the spending of only $1.6 billion on veterans programs, \nwith the remaining $15.4 billion going to highway increases.\n  Finally, the text of H.R. 3978, the highway corrections bill, was \ncovertly attached to the IRS Restructuring Conference Report. Although \nthis Report contains some improved language, as it strikes references \nto smoking being ``willful misconduct,'' it still cut off compensation \nfor tobacco-related illnesses for the overwhelming majority of \nveterans. It does not truly help veterans. Instead, it is another nail \nin their benefits coffin.\n  The amendment that Senators Wellstone and Murray put forth today is \nour only real opportunity thus far to right this wrong and correct the \ninjustice done to America's veterans. The issue before the Senate now \nis simply whether we are going to continue to wrongly deny disabled \nveterans the rights they had under law. It is a simple choice--and I \nhope my colleagues will now choose to ``do right'' by veterans.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back 1 minute I have in \nrebuttal.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the No. 3 vote, Nickles-Kohl, \nbe the No. 2 vote--before Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. With the time \nhaving expired, is a point of order in order at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, a point of order is in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to make a point of order that the \npending amendment by Senator Wellstone that would repeal the provisions \nof the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, T21, that pay \nfor the additional highway and transit spending in that bill violates \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Everybody should understand that we have already passed and the \nPresident has signed an ISTEA bill. The moneys that are encapsulated in \nthe amendment by Senator Wellstone would now have to come out of that \nbill, and as a matter of fact this particular VA-HUD bill before us \nwould get charged with $500 million and thus make it break its cap \nbecause we would be spending $500 million in directed spending in this \nbill that does not come within the caps.\n  So here is the practical effect of this amendment. Should this $500 \nmillion in spending come out of the programs in this bill or any other \nbill that has yet to be considered by the Senate--Interior, \nTransportation, Commerce, Justice, Labor-HHS, Foreign Operations--if \nthis additional spending is not ultimately offset in some fashion, the \noverall spending caps would be violated by $500 million and a sequester \nwould be the end result with all nondefense programs being cut $500 \nmillion.\n  Finally, I must alert my colleagues that if this provision stands in \nthe final bill, not only the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill will \nbe charged the cost but the nondefense discretionary spending caps will \nbe reduced by $15 billion for the years 2000-2002. That is the amount \nof the mandatory spending that would occur under T21 and not be paid \nfor by this repeal.\n  The issue has been fully debated. We debated it in the Chamber when \nwe were taking up ISTEA. It has been up in its totality one additional \ntime and partially one other time. I believe we have spoken. We have \nvoted. I particularly urge that the Senate not open this matter at this \nlate date. This is not a technical point of order. This is a serious \npoint of order. If this amendment passes, essentially we will add $15 \nbillion to the expenditures under the caps, meaning that all other \nprograms will bear cuts related to that. And in this particular year, \n$500 million will have to be cut from all of the domestic programs that \nwe have unless we raise the caps by $500 million--break the budget and \nraise the caps by $500 million.\n  Mr. President, I do not choose to debate the substance of this issue. \nI assume it was discussed yesterday by the distinguished prime sponsor \nof this amendment. But I submit that in this bill, veteran spending is \ngoing up, not down. In this bill before us, and in the ISTEA bill, the \nveterans of America have received substantially more money than they \ngot last year. In addition, a $1.5 billion new add-on for the education \nprograms for veterans occurred in the ISTEA bill.\n\n  So we are doing our job in behalf of veterans and we need not visit \nthis once again and cut all the programs of Government by the amounts I \nhave discussed here today.\n  So I raise a point of order, subject to the provisions that I have \nheretofore enumerated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                       Motion To Waive Budget Act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I can have but 30 seconds and then I will move on \nthis. I say to my colleagues, this is an up-or-down vote on whether we \nrestore the benefits. I used the same gimmick that was used with direct \nscoring. There is no sequestration at all in this amendment. None of \nwhat my colleague from New Mexico has just said is going to happen.\n  I move the Budget Act be waived. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Coats, Senator Mack, Senator Allard, Senator \nFaircloth, and Senator Feingold, strikes the increase in the FHA \nguarantee that right now is--last year it was $160,000, and under \npresent law it goes to $170,000. The committee wants to take it up to \n$197,000. This is a Federal guarantee, 100 percent guarantee, saying we \nare going to guarantee mortgages up to $197,000.\n  You have to have income of $75,000 or $80,000 to be able to afford \nthat kind of mortgage. FHA is supposed to be guaranteeing loans for \npeople with low and moderate incomes, not high incomes. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  This program was always intended to aid low- and middle-income home \nbuyers. It was never intended to be of assistance to the high-income \nhome buyer. The high-income home buyer belongs in the private mortgage \ninsurance business. This amendment recognizes that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bond, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Sarbanes, and others in opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator Nickles. This amendment would strike the \nincrease for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan limits in high \ncost areas and double the guaranty fees charged by the Government \nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA). I strongly oppose this amendment \nwhich would unfairly deny homeownership opportunities for moderate-\nincome families in high cost areas and could increase housing costs for \nall FHA and Veterans Affairs (VA) home loan borrowers.\n  I commend Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski, and the Appropriations \nCommittee for including an increase in the FHA loan limits for both \nlow-cost areas, including isolated rural areas, as well as for high \ncost areas, such as Long Island and New York City in my home state of \nNew York. The Committee's inclusion of modest increases in the FHA \nloan-limits will create fairness by allowing Americans in high- and \nlow-cost areas to also have the opportunities for homeownership which \nare provided by FHA to their fellow Americans.\n  Mr. President, the FHA program is a true American success story, \nhaving provided an opportunity for homeownership to approximately 25 \nmillion families since its inception in 1934. It has served as the \npredominant player in the home mortgage market for low-income and \nminority borrowers, first-time home buyers and borrowers with high \nloan-to-value ratios. It operates in all regions, regardless of \neconomic downturns. According to a 1996 Federal Reserve Board study, \nFHA bears about two-thirds of he aggregate credit risk for low-income \nand minority borrowers.\n  FHA loans have made homeownership possible for many Americans who \notherwise could not have qualified for mortgage credit. FHA generally \ndiffers from conventional lenders in the following ways: downpayments \nmay be as low as 3 percent; closing costs may be financed; credit \nrating requirements are more flexible; monetary gifts may be used for \ndownpayments; and a borrower may carry more debt.\n  Mr. President, I acknowledge there are important questions that must \nbe answered regarding FHA's current operations, including instances of \nforeclosures. The General Accounting Office and the HUD Inspector \nGeneral have repeatedly expressed concerns regarding material \nweaknesses affecting the FHA program--such as staffing deficiencies, \nthe lack of Year 2000 compliance, improper monitoring of the single-\nfamily property inventory, and insufficient early warning and loss \npreventions systems.\n  HUD foreclosures have devastating effects on our families and our \nneighborhoods. Rundown properties left to stand vacant for months on \nend often become magnets for vandalism, crime and drug activity. These \nconditions decrease the marketability of the houses, increase HUD's \nholding costs, drive down the costs of surrounding homes, and in some \ncases threaten the health and safety of neighbors.\n  HUD must do more to reduce default risks and mitigate losses. And if \nforeclosure prevention efforts fail, properties must be disposed of \nmore quickly to protect our neighborhoods.\n  The increases provided in this appropriations bill respond to \ninequities in home purchase prices that exist across our nation. \nAmericans in high- and low-cost areas should not be denied the \nopportunity for homeownership simply because of the geographic regions \nin which they live. I strongly support Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski's initiative to right this wrong in high-cost urban and low-\ncost rural areas. The FAA loan-limit increase, for high-cost and low-\ncost areas, will allow more Americans equal access to median purchase \nhomes with the needed help of FHA. FHA will still help to provide new \nand existing entry-level starter homes, not large or luxury homes. In \nfact, in the 32 high-cost areas across America where loan limits would \nbe increased, the median price of a starter home is often twenty to \nthirty percent higher than the current maximum loan limit. In 1996, the \naverage homeownership rate in these areas was approximately fifty eight \npercent, compared to a national rate of approximately sixty five \npercent. Clearly, the American Dream of homeownership is out of reach \nfor too many hardworking moderate income families in these high cost \nareas.\n  Mr. President, FHA's current loan limits do not adequately reflect \nthe reality of housing prices in high cost areas. Portions of 43 \nmetropolitan areas have median home prices at or above the current \n$170,362 high-cost limit. In the Dutchess County area, the median home \nsales price in 1997 was $175,000. In the Nassau-Suffolk area, the \nmedian home sales price was $195,000. And in New York City, the median \nhome sales price was $208,000.\n  Mr. President, 52.5 million people reside in high cost areas-\ncomprising twenty one percent of the nation's population. It is \ninherently unfair that over 50 million Americans should not have the \nsame opportunities through the FHA that other Americans have.\n  American working families would benefit from the proposal, not the \nwealthy. The average FHA borrower has a family income of $40,800. \nAccording to HUD, the limit increases included in this bill would \nbarely raise the average homeowner borrower income level. However, some \nborrowers would need an income of $70,000 to\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\nqualify for a $197,000 mortgage. In New York City or on Long Island, a \nfamily income of $70,000 is a typical two wage-earner family. These are \nmiddle class families--schoolteachers, policemen, and civil servants--\nraising children and struggling to pay their bills. In Nassau and \nSuffolk counties the median income of a family of four is $63,400. \nWages are higher in Long Island because the cost of living is higher. \nAnd home purchase prices are higher--which is why this increased \nadjustment is necessary. The high cost limit increase would simply \ngrant these areas parity--not an underserved advantage.\n  I am very pleased that the increase in the base limit will rural \nAmericans in low-cost counties where existing housing may be \nsubstandard, the opportunity to purchase new homes. New York also has \nmany low-cost areas, such as Buffalo, Elmira, Glens Falls, Jamestown-\nDunkirk, Syracuse and Utica-Rome, which would be helped by the low-cost \nincrease. I urge my colleagues from the states without high-cost areas \nto also be sympathetic to Americans in high-cost cities and suburbs, \nwhere home prices are higher due to high land, material and labor \ncosts.\n  Also, I urge my colleagues to not support doubling the guaranty fee \ncharged by GNMA. There is no actuarial need for this proposal which \nwould affect all regions of the country and could increase consumer \ncosts for FHA and VA loans. This proposal is strongly opposed by \nnumerous veterans' organizations. I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nin opposition to the amendment, signed by AMVETS, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Blinded Veterans' Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, and the Non Commissioned Officers' Association of the USA be \nprinted in the Record. In addition, I ask unanimous consent that a \nmemorandum prepared by the Congressional Research Service for the \nSenate Banking Committee on this subject be entered into the Record.\n  Mr. President, the modest, prudent loan limit increases contained in \nthis bill are a compromise and do not reach the $227,150 national limit \nrequested by the Administration.\n  The proposed changes will assist potential homebuyers--first time \nhomeowners, minorities, urban dwellers and rural Americans--who are not \ncurrently served by FHA or the conventional market--but whom should \nrightly qualify under FHA's existing mission.\n  I respectfully urge the defeat of the amendment proposed by my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. President, let me tell what you is happening now. We have over 50 \nmillion Americans who are being shut out of an opportunity to use FHA \ninsurance, and they are not high income. Three million live in Long \nIsland alone. These high cost areas include Levittown, Long Island, \nwhich saw such rapid expansion of home ownership for the first time for \nworking middle-class families after World War II--where, today you \ncan't buy a home with FHA because the median home price was $195,000 in \n1997--well above the current FHA limit of $170,000. That is the median \nprice for all of Long Island--where over 3 million live; in all, there \nare 11.5 million New Yorkers living in high cost areas, and they are \nnot wealthy. They have incomes of $50,000 to $70,000, they are two-wage \nearner families, raising children, and you are shutting them out of \nhome ownership.\n  We need this increase. It is not for wealthy people. It is for \nworking middle-class families.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the Nickles \namendment. Let me share why I support the FHA loan limit increase \nincluded in the Appropriations Committee bill.\n  FHA is a critical tool for first time home buyers, low and moderate \nincome buyers, and minority buyers.\n  FHA will help us meet new market realities, but in a way that does \nnot expose taxpayers and communities to a big buck liability in the \nevent of FHA foreclosures.\n  Our Senate bill will raise the FHA loan limit in high cost areas from \n$170,000 to $197,000.\n  It will also raise the limit in low cost areas from $86,000 to \n$108,000.\n  Mr. President, home ownership is a critical step in a person or \nfamily's attempt to obtain assets and to becoming a more permanent \nfixture in a community.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I share the concern about the affect that \nforeclosures can have on individuals' credit and the stability of a \ncommunity.\n  My own hometown of Baltimore has been a victim of foreclosures \nharming neighborhoods.\n  But in our bill we have provided a modest increase that does not \nraise the limit too much too quickly.\n  Our objective is clear, for those who FHA serves, ensure that it is a \nuseful tool.\n  The objective is not to put the private mortgage insurance companies \nout of business or to move FHA away from providing for low and moderate \nincome buyers.\n  I believe that the FHA provision included in the Senate bill before \nus is good for Maryland and good for the nation.\n  I believe that this is a positive step in rewarding investment and \nprovides relief to working families.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment and support \nthe Appropriations Committee's attempt to help home buyers across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, what this legislation does is provide an opportunity \nfor first-time home ownership. It does not put private mortgage \ninsurance companies out of business.\n  It is a good thing to do.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) \nhas enabled millions of individuals across the country to purchase \ntheir first home and realize a piece of the American dream.\n  I know this firsthand because my wife and I bought our first home \nwhen we were newly married with an FHA loan.\n  There are many families today who would not own their home if it were \nnot for the Federal Housing Administration's single family insurance \nprogram.\n  The Federal Housing Administration was created to promote home \nownership and stimulate the construction of housing by encouraging \nfinancial institutions to make loans to those who did not have adequate \nresources for a down payment.\n  Since then, FHA has evolved into a program which gives first-time \nhome buyers and under served borrowers greater access to mortgage \ncredit.\n  It is a financially sound system that not only works well, but works \nwell at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  The state of Nevada is the fastest growing state in the country and, \nas in many states, the real estate activity in Nevada is an important \naspect of our economy.\n  As our population grows, the demand for new housing increases.\n  And as we all know, the cost of new homes in many cases is more \nexpensive than existing ones.\n  In Nevada, for example, many first-time home buyers rely on FHA to \npurchase a home.\n  But as new homes are being built and as the cost of housing rapidly \nincreases in my state, more and more families are unable to secure home \nownership.\n  They simply cannot afford the cost of a home under a conventional \nloan.\n  This not only hurts the economy, but it strips away any hope of \nowning a home.\n  The loan limit which Senators Bond and Mikulski agreed to in the VA/\nHUD appropriations bill would give more first-time home buyers the \nopportunity to afford a home who would otherwise not be able to.\n  The FHA loan limit would increase the high limit from $170,362 to \n$197,620 and the lower limit from $86,317 to $109,032.\n  Although the loan limit does not go as far as the President's \nproposal, which I supported, I believe this proposal is a fair \ncompromise that would benefit our society as a whole.\n  Let me be clear about the importance to raise both the floor and the \nceiling of the FHA loan limit:\n  First, raising the FHA loan limit would increase home ownership \nopportunities.\n  Over the years, the new home portion of FHA's activity has diminished \nto roughly 6 percent, and only 5 percent of all new homes are now \nfinanced with FHA-insured mortgages.\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\n  This decrease in FHA's role in the market for new homes is clearly a \nresult of the current mortgage loan limits.\n  HUD estimates that higher loan limits would enable approximately \n60,000 more families--who have been cut out of the market--each year to \npurchase a home.\n  Second, FHA is critical to first-time home buyers.\n  Thousands of families with the ability to make the mortgage payments \non a home cannot make the purchase because they lack the up front \ncapital required. Raising the FHA loan limits would give them the \nchance that they do not have under current home finance options.\n  Third, raising the limit would enhance FHA's ability to spread risk.\n  The FHA insurance fund is a financially healthy program and HUD \nbelieves that the fund will become stronger when the loan limits are \nraised.\n  Both Price Waterhouse and the General Accounting Office note that \nhigher value loans perform better than lower valued loans and that the \nrate of default is lower for larger loans than for smaller loans.\n  OMB estimates that raising the loan limits would create excess \nrevenues of $228 million.\n  Finally, raising the limit would raise revenue for the Treasury and \nwould improve the Government's finances; approximately $225 million in \nannual revenue would be generated.\n  Arguments against raising the loan limits are weak and do not live up \nto the true reality of what is in the best interest of the American \npeople.\n  Some argue that the very group FHA was created to serve will be \npushed along the wayside if loan limits are increased.\n  Let me remind you that raising the loan limit will increase the \naverage FHA loan amount by 4.2 percent--from $85,500 to $89,109 and the \naverage income by 3.8 percent--from $40,800 to $42,350.\n  The increase would enable more families to buy a home.\n  It would not take away from the underserved population.\n  In fact, since 1992, when the FHA loan limits increased from $124,875 \nto $170,362, the share of FHA mortgages to low-income borrowers \nincreased from 15.7 percent to 20.1 percent.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me today \nand support the increase in the FHA loan limit to $197,000 and reject \nany measure that threatens the opportunity for many first-time home \nbuyers across the country to own a home.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment, No. 3202.\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The question is on the motion to table the \nSessions amendment. There are 2 minutes of debate, equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are a Nation of explorers, a Nation \nof discoverers. Our people see ourselves in that light; the world sees \nus in that light.\n  Unfortunately, for the last 5 years, the great agency of this \nGovernment that epitomizes our explorative nature--NASA--has seen a cut \nin its budget--for 5 straight years. They have reduced personnel by 25 \npercent since 1993. This is a tragic event. The President's budget this \nyear had a cut of $180 million. The committee restores most of that, \nbut it still represents a $33 million cut again this year.\n  We need to put an end to that. We need to get back into exploring our \nsolar system and our galaxy. That is who we are as a people. We need to \nincrease the funding. This bill would first have level funding, and \nthen get us on the road next year to increased funding. The money as an \noffset would come from that portion of the AmeriCorps program that pays \npeople to volunteer. It has been zeroed out in the House, and it is a \ngood offset.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment and support the \nmotion to table. Yes, this subcommittee is a strong supporter of space \nand science and technology. We put $150 million more in the NASA \nbudget. But we object to offsetting and cutting national service that \nprovides the opportunity to pay for college education, in which 50,000 \nhave earned their educational awards, a modest amount of money that \ncould be used to help them continue their education. We have worked to \nimprove 100,000 people who have participated in this program.\n  Don't cut the habits of the heart. Don't cut the habits of the heart \nfor space.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of space programs and strongly \nsupport investments in science and technology. That's why I worked with \nSenator Bond  to find a $150 million increase for NASA. But, I must \nstrongly oppose cuts to the Corporation for National Service.\n  The National Service helps to promote the habits of the heart and \nfosters the volunteer spirit that helped make this country great. To \ndate nearly 100,000 people have participated. They have helped to \ngenerate thousands of un-paid volunteers in communities across the \ncountry.\n  The National Service provides assistance to programs like the one run \nby the Sisters of Notre Dame in Baltimore. This is a critical tutoring \nservice of young people.\n  Each year over 400,000 young children are tutored by AmeriCorps \nvolunteers who work to help prepare our children to be literate and \nfunctional in the 21st century.\n  Volunteers also work with well respected organizations like the Red \nCross, Habitat for Humanity and the YMCA, and provide real help to meet \ncompeling human needs.\n  In addition the National Service also provides an opportunity for \nparticipants to pay for their college education. To date 50,000 have \nearned their educational awards. A modest amount of money is used to \nhelp our young adults.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with me as I stand behind our kids. \nVote to table the Sessions amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as already indicated, we support NASA very \nstrongly. We have added $150 million over that which the people who run \nthe\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\nprogram have requested. We risk disrupting the compromise that has been \nmade on this bill. In order to pass this bill and to get it signed, we \nhave reached, I think, a good accommodation with the limited dollars.\n  If this tabling motion does not succeed, I will have to raise the \nBudget Act point of order because the money that is spent out under \nthis will be above our outlay ceiling.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to table the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from \nMissouri to lay on the table the amendment of the Senator from Alabama. \nOn this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, I do \nnot think we are going to require any more votes. There are votes on \ntwo amendments that have been ordered.

Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Burns amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, the Burns amendment is very important. \nThere was a question whether it was going to be included in the NASA \nreauthorization. If the NASA reauthorization does move, if that can \nmove, then we would drop the amendment in conference to allow it to be \nincluded in the overall NASA reauthorization, but we think it is \nvitally important for the development of the X-33 that the \nindemnification be included.\n  Senator Mikulski.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3200), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    . VIETNAM VETERANS ALLOTMENT.\n\n       The Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1600, \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\n     open season for certain native alaskan veterans for allotments\n\n       Sec. 41. (a) In General.--(1) During the eighteen month \n     period following promulgation of implementing rules pursuant \n     to paragraph (6), a person described in subsection (b) shall \n     be eligible for an allotment of not more than 160 acres of \n     land under the Act of May 17, 1906 (chapter 2469; 34 Stat. \n     197), as such Act was in effect before December 18, 1971.\n       (2) Allotments selected under this section shall not be \n     from existing native or non-native campsites, except for \n     campsites used primarily by the person selecting the \n     allotment.\n       (3) Only federal lands shall be eligible for selection and \n     conveyance under this Act.\n       (4) All conveyances shall be subject to valid existing \n     rights, including any right of the United States to income \n     derived, directly or indirectly, from a lease, license, \n     permit, right-of-way or easement.\n       (5) All state selected lands that have not yet been \n     conveyed shall be ineligible for selection under this \n     section.\n       (6) No later than 18 months after enactment of this \n     section, the Secretary of the Interior shall promulgate, \n     after consultation with Alaska Natives groups, rules to carry \n     out this section.\n       (7) The Secretary of the Interior may convey alternative \n     federal lands, including lands within a Conservation System \n     unit, to a person entitled to an allotment located within a \n     Conservation System Unit if--\n       (A) the Secretary determines that the allotment would be \n     incompatible with the purposes for which the Conservation \n     System Unit was established;\n       (B) the alternative lands are of equal acreage to the \n     allotment.\n       (b) Eligible Individuals.--(1) A person is eligible under \n     subsection (a) if that person would have been eligible under \n     the Act of May 17, 1906 (chapter 2469; 34 Stat. 197), as that \n     Act was in effect before December 18, 1971, and that person \n     is a veteran who served during the period between January 1, \n     1968 and December 31, 1971.\n       (c) Study and Report.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     shall--\n       (1) conduct a study to identify and assess the \n     circumstances of veterans of the Vietnam era who were \n     eligible for allotments under the Act of May 17, 1906 but who \n     did not apply under that Act and are not eligible under this \n     section; and\n       (2) within one year of enactment of this section, issue a \n     written report with recommendations to the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources in the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations \n     and the Committee on Resources in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the \n     terms `veteran' and ``Vietnam era'' have the meanings given \n     those terms by paragraphs (2) and (29), respectively, of \n     section 101 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we have conversed with my good \nfriend, the Senator from Arkansas, on this amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that we have worked it out as an accommodation to rectify \na situation where veterans, native Eskimo Indian Aleuts, who were on \nactive duty during\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\nthe time of the Vietnam conflict, were therefore unable to apply for \ntheir allotment. This situation should be rectified. It scores zero \ndollars in the first year and perhaps $1 million each year thereafter.\n  In view of the fact that this is a $93 billion package, I think it \nwarrants consideration to right a wrong for those who served in active \nduty, served their country, and yet were unable to qualify for their \n160-acre allotment because they were on active duty. We have assured \nall parties that none of the acreage would come out of conservation \nunits, and Senator Bumpers has been most accommodating. It is my \nunderstanding the minority will accept the amendment--subject to \nSenator Bumpers' input.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, the administration has raised very \nserious objections to the Murkowski amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, may we have order? I know it is tough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, the administration had previously, and \nmay still have, serious objections to the Murkowski amendment. But he \nand I had a conversation this morning. He has modified his amendment. \nThe modification is at the desk.\n  For the edification of our membership, simply because this may come \nup again in conference or even later on the floor, in 1906 the Congress \npassed a law giving every Native Alaskan the right to claim 160 acres \nof land in Alaska. In 1971, under the Alaskan Native Settlement Claims \nAct, we repealed the old 1906 Act. What Senator Murkowski seeks to do \nis very laudable, in my opinion. He is simply saying those Native \nAlaskans who would have otherwise had a right to claim 160 acres under \nthe old 1906 law, but were in Vietnam and not physically present in \nAlaska so they could file such a claim--he is simply saying under this \nbill that they will be grandfathered in. If they were in Vietnam \nbetween 1969 and 1971, they are entitled to a claim.\n  Some of these claims would be in conservation areas. That was the \nfirst, primary objection by the administration. We have changed that so \nthe administration can select nonconservation lands if a claim within a \npark or wilderness or wildlife refuge is inconsistent with the purposes \nof that conservation area. So that takes care of most of it.\n  They were vitally concerned about the cost which, as I say, should be \nmitigated greatly by this compromise we have entered into.\n  I simply want to say there is one other objection the administration \nhas. They are concerned about allowing people to claim 160 acres if \nthey were not in Vietnam. The amendment does not really say you had to \nhave been in Vietnam, but they had to have been in the military. They \nthink that is a little broad. But in conference, whatever their \nobjection is I feel sure can be worked out.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska. We had a hearing on this, but we had \nnot marked the bill up.\n  So, with those considerations, I think it is well to go ahead and \napprove it. If they still object to something, I think it will be \nsomething we can work out in conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, the Senator from Arkansas has stated \nthe position well. As the ranking member on this bill, I agree we \nshould take this amendment. There is disputed information about cost, \nscoring, the administration's position. But I believe we have assured \neveryone who has a yellow flashing light about this policy that we will \nconsult on the way to conference, and I believe we should accept the \namendment today. We will resolve this in conference, consulting with \nall appropriate people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Maryland for her comments. I also \nappreciate the efforts of the Senators from Arkansas and Alaska to work \nout this situation. It sounds like a very compelling need. Obviously, \nour only question is the means by which it is accomplished. I am \ndelighted we can gain agreement at this stage. We do have further work \nto pursue.\n  I have advised my colleague on the other side of the aisle, if there \nare substantial problems with it then we can deal with those in \nconference. I hope we can remedy this wrong which has occurred to \nNative Americans who fought for their country in Vietnam.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3200), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my side for their accommodation, particularly \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n           EPA Activities Related To CO2 Emissions\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As we debate the provisions of the FY 1999 \nappropriations for the EPA and other agencies I would like to raise an \nissue of concern. During a June 4 hearing before the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, committee members explored the concern \nthat this Administration has no real plan in place to assure that we \nwill meet the nation's substantial and growing energy needs. In \nresponding to this concern, Administration representatives, including a \nrepresentative of the EPA, failed to mention that in addition to \nfailing to plan for our growing energy needs, EPA had recently taken \naction that could further erode our capability to fuel our economic \ngrowth by a ``back-door'' attempt to regulate carbon dioxide.\n  On June 2, only two days before this hearing, the EPA had published a \nnotice in the Federal Register of its intent to modify a consent decree \nbetween EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an organization \nwith very strong views on global climate policy. The proposed \nmodification would require EPA to analyze emissions reductions of \nCO2 through its regulation of other emissions. While this \nseems innocuous enough, it is clear that this is an attempt to bring \nCO2 within the meaning of ``air pollutant'' under the Clean \nAir Act.\n  Although EPA has apparently denied that this is an attempt to \nimplement the Kyoto Protocol prior to its ratification, a spokesman for \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council had a different response. In a \nWashinton Times article on July 8, Mr. Dan Lashoff of the Council \nstates that the consent decree ``is intended to look ahead to emissions \nreductions of carbon dioxide that may be required to achieve national \nobjectives as established by the [Kyoto] treaty.'' As a key party to \nthe consent decree, Mr. Lashoff understands the objectives of this \nmodification, even if EPA does not.\n  My concerns about this development are several. First, this action \nconstitutes an attempted breach of promise against the Administration's \nassurances to Congress that there will be no implementation of the \nKyoto accord prior to Senate ratification. Under Secretary Eizenstat \nhas gone so far as to commit that ``no agency or interagency body has \nbeen given responsibility to develop potential proposals for \nlegislation or regulation that would be intended to comply with the \nKyoto Protocol if it were to become binding on the U.S.'' Second, the \nproposed modification exceeds EPA's authorities under the Clean Air \nAct. Third, the proposed modification is outside the scope of the \noriginal consent agreement.\n  Clearly, Madam President, Congress should expect both EPA and the \nJustice Department to withhold consent to this inappropriate \nmodification to the consent agreement. Could you state whether you \nbelieve the actions I have described would be an appropriate use of the \nproposed funding for EPA in the appropriations bill under \nconsideration?\n  Mr. BOND. First, I thank my colleague from Alaska for bringing this \nissue to the attention of this body. I agree that this is an issue of \nconcern. There are no funds currently provided to EPA, nor any funds to \nbe provided in this bill for fiscal year 1999 for the issuance of \nfederal regulations designed solely for the purpose of Kyoto Protocol \nimplementation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Missouri to note \nthe\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\nstatement at page 74 of the Report regarding the Agency's sector \nfacility indexing project. I concur with the Committee's judgment. I \nwould like to call to the Senator's attention some further concerns \nregarding the Agency's use of toxicity weighting factors in relation to \nboth the sector facility indexing project and the environmental \nindicators project. For example, the Agency's Science Advisory Board \nrecently criticized EPA's use of toxicity weighting factors based on \npolicy rather than science and raised other scientific issues as well. \nDoes the Senator share my concern?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, Senator Burns, I do share your concern on this issue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I had intended to offer an amendment \ntoday to begin monitoring of mercury emissions from coal-fired power \nplants and include this information in the Toxic Release Inventory. \nCongress has a long track record of supporting the public's ``right to \nknow'' about the nature and volume of toxic chemicals that are being \nreleased into the environment from manufacturing facilities in their \nneighborhoods. The ``Toxics Release Inventory'' has empowered citizens \nand communities and is helping local and state environmental agencies \nto identify the most pressing problems within their neighborhoods. A \nglaring gap in information from the Inventory is mercury emissions from \ncoal-fired power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates \nthat at least 52 tons of mercury are being released to the environment \neach year, every year, from these plants. When Congress amended the \nClean Air Act in 1990, we did not address mercury emissions but instead \nrequired EPA to report back to Congress on the sources, impacts and \ncontrol strategies for mercury. Congress finally received that report \nlast year and now needs to act on it. That is why I introduced the \n``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998.'' Although I will \nnot offer my mercury right-to-know amendment today, Congress has a \nresponsibility to act on the EPA Mercury Report to Congress. I believe \nSenator Chafee who is one of the leading proponents of the Clean Air \nAct Amendments of 1990, agrees with me that steps should be taken to \naddress mercury emissions.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I agree with the senior senator from Vermont that \nalthough the EPA Mercury Report does the best job so far in quantifying \nmercury emissions, many believe that the report understates the actual \namount of mercury being released to the environment. Along with Senator \nLeahy, I voiced my concern when the release of the EPA Mercury Report \nwas delayed. It is my understanding the EPA is taking a number of long-\noverdue steps to address mercury emissions. Toward the end of obtaining \nbetter data on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, we \nshould begin collecting information from these facilities on the \nmercury that they emit. As Chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I intend to hold hearings in September on the issues raised \nby the EPA Mercury Report and Senator Leahy's amendment in order to \nfoster a broader public discussion from all concerned parties about the \ninformation and findings that are contained in the EPA Mercury Report.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate the leadership that Senator Chafee is taking \non this issue in light of the troubling language included in the House \nreport on the Fiscal Year 1999 VA-HUD Appropriations bill. I have \nserious concerns about this language. Among other things, the report \nlanguage would require that another mercury report be developed. Each \nof the mercury-related tasks stipulated in the report language would \nneed to be completed before EPA would be allowed to make any regulatory \ndeterminations that pertain to mercury.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I agree with Senator Leahy. The American taxpayers have \nalready spent over $1 million on the EPA Mercury Report. The Report \ndoes not need to be redone. I do not believe that anyone who actually \nreads it objectively would conclude that we need to study mercury all \nover again before Congress or EPA can make any decision about mercury \nemissions. But that is precisely what the House report language would \nrequire. This report language is an inappropriate use of the \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is correct and I am glad to see that the \nSenate has not concurred with this language. I thank the Chairman and \nlook forward to participating in his hearing on this important issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, would the Senator from Missouri yield for \na question on the appropriation of funding for the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) and its energy and environment related \nprograms? I note that on pages 74 and 75 of the Committee's Report that \nthe Committee addresses the issue of the EPA's compliance with the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act and the EPA's submission of a \nreport on activities related to these ongoing programs. Is it the \nSenator's understanding that the committee report reminds the EPA that \nit is to fully comply with the Government Performance and Results Act?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The language in the report requires \nfull compliance with the Government Performance and Results Act.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is it the intent of the Senator to create additional legal \nrequirements in this area beyond those required by the letter and \nspirit of the Government Performance and Results Act?\n  Mr. BOND. No, not at all. I would say to my friend from West Virginia \nthat all we are asking here is for a more comprehensive explanation by \nthe EPA of the components of its energy and environment programs, any \njustifications for funding increases, and a clear definition of how \nthese programs are justified by the EPA's goals and objectives \nindependent of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I would also note that \nthe Committee Report expects the EPA to submit a report to the \nCommittee by December 31, 1998, with a follow-up analysis by the \nGeneral Accounting Office ninety days later. As the Senator may know, \nSenator Craig and I submitted language to the Interior Appropriations \nbill directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to submit a similar \nreport, but this report is to be submitted in conjunction with DOE's \nFiscal Year 2000 budget submission. Given the short period between the \nlikely enactment of this Act and the December 31 deadline, would the \nSenator agree that it might be more reasonable for the EPA to also \nsubmit its report along with its Fiscal Year 2000 budget submission?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. I believe that is a more appropriate time for the EPA \nto fulfill the reporting requirement as outlined in the Committee \nReport language.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. The EPA should provide a \nmore detailed plan for better evaluating its programs, but I believe \nthis is a more appropriate date to require such a report. It would not \nbe wise to arbitrarily cap funding for vital energy and environment \nprograms that encourage domestic energy efficiency, decrease costs, and \npromote domestic energy security. These programs should be evaluated on \ntheir own merits. The Federal Government serves a vital catalytic role \nin supporting and developing cutting edge research programs that the \nprivate sector can then take into the marketplace. The true benefits of \nthese technologies and programs may not be evident for a number of \nyears. Through these efforts, the United States has a tremendous \nopportunity to profit from new technologies, both at home and abroad, \nwhile at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n                   HUD NOTICE AND COMMENT RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith my colleagues, Senator Kit Bond, the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Senator Connie Mack, the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community \nDevelopment.\n  It is my understanding that the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) issued a series of regulations on June 30, 1998 \ndealing with a wide variety of HUD programs affecting millions of units \nof affordable housing. In each of these regulations, HUD has waived the \nsixty-day public comment period required under HUD's notice and comment \nrulemaking procedures. Instead, each of these regulations has included \nan expedited comment and review period. I would ask\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\nmy colleagues if I have stated the facts accurately.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking, \nHousing and Urban Affairs is entirely correct. On June 30, 1998, HUD \nissued three important regulations. For all these regulations, HUD \nwaived the sixty-day comment period. Specifically, these rules would: \nfirst, establish requirements relating to physical conditions and \ninspections and would apply to a wide variety of HUD rental assistance \nand mortgage insurance programs; second, establish uniform financial \nreporting standards for HUD housing programs; and third, establish a \nnew Public Housing Assessment System.\n  Despite the enormous impact of these proposed rules, HUD has waived \nthe sixty-day public comment period as provided by HUD's own \nregulations (24 CFR 10.1), often referred to as ``Part 10.'' \nPreviously, HUD attempted to repeal, as a practical matter, its Part 10 \nregulations related to notice and comment rulemaking. At that time, \nmembers of the Senate joined together in a bipartisan manner to enact \nlegislation to safeguard public notice and comment in HUD's rulemaking \nprocess.\n  It is essential that HUD maintain an adequate period of time for the \npublic to review, analyze and comment upon proposed changes in HUD's \npolicies and procedures. Congress established the notice and comment \nrulemaking procedure in order to allow the public to provide adequate \ninput so as to avoid potential confusion in the development of new \nrules. Given the importance of the proposed rules at issue, a more \nextensive period of time for public review and comment is warranted.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with my colleagues Senator Connie Mack and Senator \nAlfonse D'Amato, in urging HUD to reinstate a fair and adequate time \nperiod for public review of these important new rules. In fact, it was \nmy amendment in 1996 which halted HUD's attempt to remove the important \npublic notice and comment provisions of the rulemaking procedure.\n  On August 16, 1996, HUD issued a regulation entitled, ``Rulemaking \nPolicies and Procedures; Proposed Removal of Part 10.'' The Fiscal Year \n1997 VA-HUD Appropriations Act included my amendment to safeguard the \nnotice and comment procedure contained in the Part 10 regulation. Last \nyear, the VA-HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1998 contained a \nprovision which in practical effect makes the notice and comment \nprocedure part of the permanent law.\n  While HUD can provide for good cause waivers of the sixty-day comment \nperiod, the regulation states that such waivers should only be made \nwhen the procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the \npublic interest.'' I do not believe that HUD has met any component of \nthis threshold in this instance.\n  HUD's current public rulemaking procedure were not adopted by \naccident. In fact, they were adopted in an effort to respond to past \nprogram abuses and were considered an essential component of HUD \nreform. Given HUD's ongoing systemic management difficulties, it is \nincumbent upon HUD to abide by the rules of public notice and comment \nrulemaking. Waivers of public notice requirements will not contribute \nto the much-needed reform of HUD's management problems. Public \nparticipation and input are critical aspects to avoiding unintended \nconsequences in the rulemaking process.\n  HUD's new proposed rules have followed soon after a series of massive \n``Super-NOFA's,'' or Notices of Funding Availability which announce the \navailability and competition for dozens of HUD grant programs. Many \nlocal government agencies and community-based housing organizations are \nstill in the process of finalizing their applications for these \nimportant HUD programs. Most organizations--including local public \nhousing authorities, community-based non-profit corporations and \nresident organizations--have limited capacity to wade through and \nanalyze HUD's new proposed regulations, in addition to applying for \nfunding. HUD's decision to unilaterally waive the sixty-day comment \nperiod compounds this problematic situation.\n  I therefore join my colleagues in strongly urging HUD to extend the \nreview and comment period for the proposed rules issued on June 30, \n1998.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my colleagues for their remarks and I join them \nin urging HUD to extend the time allotted for public review and comment \nof these three important and expansive HUD rules. HUD's notice and \ncomment rulemaking procedures are designed to ensure an adequate period \nof time for public notice, review and comment.\n  It is essential that HUD provide an adequate timeframe in which \nhousing organizations, residents of assisted housing and local \ngovernment entities have a chance to offer meaningful input in the \ndevelopment of final regulations. Given the important nature of these \nthree rules and the significant impact which they will likely have on \nthe families assisted by HUD's programs, I believe it is essential that \nthe public be granted an additional amount of time in which to comment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, page 71 of the committee report \naccompanying the fiscal year 1999 VA, HUD and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations bill states that, ``[n]one of the funds provided to the \nEPA are to be used to support activities related to implementation of \nthe Kyoto Protocol prior to its ratification.'' I want to try to get a \nclarification on this report language from the distinguished chairman \nof the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Bond. I \nwould agree that the EPA should not use appropriated funds for the \npurpose of issuing regulations to implement the Kyoto Protocol, unless \nand until such treaty is ratified by the United States.\n  I would like to point out, however, that the United States is a full \nparticipating signatory nation to the 1992 Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. Under the 1992 Framework Convention, which was agreed \nto in Rio de Janeiro by President Bush and later consented to by the \nU.S. Senate, the United States pledged to carry out a wide variety of \nvoluntary initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. These \ninitiatives, being implemented by the EPA, the Department of Energy, \nand other agencies, are in place today. The Congress has funded these \ninitiatives for several years now, indeed, long before the December \n1997 climate conference in Kyoto, Japan. These initiatives; the Climate \nChallenge program, the Program for a New Generation of Vehicles, Green \nLights, Energy Star, and others, have to varying degrees reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions by increasing energy efficiency across a broad \nrange of domestic industrial sectors. They make sense for other \nreasons, Madam President. We have found with these programs and others \nthat our companies and American consumers benefit economically. When we \nconserve resources and reduce energy consumption in a sensible way, we \nsave money. When we research, manufacture and market new energy \nefficient goods and services, we create export opportunities and jobs. \nWe also increase U.S. energy security by reducing our dependence on \nimported oil, natural gas and coal. Finally, when we find cost \neffective ways to reduce greenhouse gases, we oftentimes reduce other \nair pollutants like mercury, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide.\n  So, I want to make sure that the committee report language that I \ncited previously does not interfere with these important and worthwhile \nefforts. I would ask my friend from Missouri if these ongoing energy \nconservation and climate-related programs and initiatives, which are \nnot intended to directly implement actions called for under the Kyoto \nProtocol, would go forward under this bill?\n  Mr. BOND. Indeed they would, Senator Chafee. Our only goal here is to \nprevent the issuance of federal regulations designed solely for the \npurpose of Kyoto Protocol implementation. We have funded these EPA \nprograms for the upcoming fiscal year and expect the agency to spend \nthe money in an effective and appropriate manner.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                        University of Cincinnati\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nextend my congratulations to Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski and \nother members of the appropriations subcommittee on the FY 1999 \nappropriations bill. The committee has faced tough budget constraints \nthis year and I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis bill. I would also like to call to the Chairman's attention an \nimportant project in Ohio that I believe is deserving of funding\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\nunder the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, \nspecifically, the Economic Development Initiative funding for various \ncommunity development projects. A number were listed by the Committee \nin its report on the bill. I am very interested in a project that has \nbeen supported by both the local community and the State of Ohio--the \nrehabilitation of the Medical Science Building at the University of \nCincinnati's Medical Center. This facility ranks among the top in the \nnation for biomedical research, research which benefits both the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Veterans' Administration, as \nwell as contributing to the local economy in excess of $2 billion. \nWould the Senator from Missouri agree that an initiative which will \nrehabilitate a facility dedicated to such research be a worthy \ncandidate for funding under the Committee's EDI provision?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Ohio raising \nthis issue. I agree with him that the project he has described in \nCincinnati would appear to be well-suited for the EDI program.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee for his \ncomments. I would ask that the Chairman of the Subcommittee take a very \nclose look at this project as he proceeds to conference with the House \non the final version of this appropriations bill. Specifically, what I \nam seeking is consideration for support of funds to allow for the \nrenovation of this facility.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand the Senator from Ohio's concerns, and commend \nhim for his efforts to seek a positive solution. As I am sure he well \nknows, this has been a difficult year for community development \nprojects, such as the one he has discussed. Nonetheless, I am impressed \nby the overall project and their commitment to continuing research. I \nwill give the Senator's request all due consideration as we go to \nconference on this bill. Is that satisfactory to the Senator?\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is satisfactory and I thank the distinguished \nChairman for his willingness to work with me and the members of the \nOhio Congressional Delegation as we work with the University to help \nthem carry on this important work.\n\n\n                      lorain st. joseph's facility\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I would like to draw the attention of \nthe distinguished Chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Bond, to the allocation of Community Development Block Grant \n(CDBG) funds for Economic Development Initiative projects. As the \nChairman may recall, we had numerous discussions last year about my \ninterest in preventing the permanent closure of the St. Joseph's \nHospital complex located in the heart of Downtown Lorain. Thanks in \nlarge part to the assistance provided Lorain in the FY 1998 VA-HUD \nAppropriations Conference Report, we were able to forestall closure and \nhave now developed a solid group of tenants who wish to occupy the \ncomplex.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I recall the effort of my colleague on \nbehalf of his constituents in Lorain, and am happy that we were able to \nbe of some assistance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, while I will not detail every \ndevelopment at the St. Joseph's site which has occurred over the past \ntwelve months, it is worth mentioning the highlights. Based on the \nexpression of Congressional support, Community Health Partners agreed \nto transfer ownership of the facility to a community-based non-profit \nentity incorporated as South Shore Development Corporation. Community \nHealth Partners has also agreed to provide 12 months of utilities and \nsecurity for the facility while South Shore proceeds with its plans to \nconvert the facility for non-hospital uses. Notwithstanding the need to \nattract additional funds to underwrite the conversion effort, the \nVeterans' Administration, the Lorain Public Schools system, the Lorain \nCounty Community College and the local Community Action Agency have all \nsigned leases to implement community services from the 400,000 square \nfoot facility.\n  As the distinguished Chairman may recall, earlier this year I had \nexpressed my support to him for a request for an additional $2,000,000 \nfor the conversion effort. These funds would be utilized for the \nestablishment of the Community College's distance learning center at \nthe St. Joseph's facility. It is through this facility and the downlink \nsite at the Community College that area residents would be provided \naccess to the job training programs which would be offered by the \nCommunity College for veterans, the unemployed and others struggling to \nmake the transition to the information technology marketplace.\n  Inasmuch as the Committee was not able to accommodate my request in \nthe bill reported from Committee, could my good friend the Chairman \nprovide me with some insights on the prospects for funding when the \nHouse and Senate meet to resolve differences between their respective \nbills?\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's continuing efforts to keep me \napprised of developments on the St. Joseph's conversion effort. I \nregret that our difficult funding problems prevented the subcommittee \nfrom allocating funding for this initiative, and I assure my friend \nthat I will do all that I can to accommodate his request in the \nupcoming conference.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for his comments, and stand ready to \nprovide him and the conferees with documentation validating the merits \nof this request.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, in January of this year I addressed \nthe Senate along with my colleagues from New York and Maine about the \nawesome ice storm that struck our area. Thanks to the help of Chairman \nBond and others, our region received much needed assistance and relief. \nToday, I rise to inform my colleagues that Vermont has experienced yet \nanother series of natural disasters. During the past few weeks the \nstate of Vermont has received tremendous amounts of rain, causing \nsevere flooding throughout the state. In fact, eleven of our fourteen \ncounties were declared disaster areas after several days of heavy rain \nflooded streams and rivers.\n  Hardest hit was the pristine Mad River in central Vermont. The \nriver's stream banks were overwhelmed. Heavy sediment washed down the \nriver depleting water quality. However, in sections of the river where \nmethods to protect the stream banks through bioengineering and \nvegetation planting were established, the banks held steady during the \nfloods preventing soils and sediments from entering the water system.\n  Assistance is needed in the Mad River Valley of Vermont. The quality \nof the water in the Mad River is of great importance to the communities \nin the valley. Because of the recent flooding there is a need for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to provide assistance for maintaining \nthat water quality. I am aware of the devastation that occurs during a \nlong period of heavy rain and understand the impact it can have on a \nriver's health and appearance. Protecting the water quality is \nimportant. EPA should provide assistance to the Mad River Valley Union \nMunicipal District to assist them in water quality improvements. \nExperimenting with new methods to protect our river banks will help \nfind solutions to maintain water quality and the health of our rivers, \nas well as safeguard the property and lives that inhabit the river \nvalleys.\n  Madam President, with help from the EPA, more creative methods could \nbe established and tested along the Mad River helping maintain water \nquality and the beauty of the river.\n\n\n                         metered-dose inhalers\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Hutchinson and the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine for \ntheir efforts to address the issue of FDA action on Chlorofluorocarbon \n(CFC) metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). I share their commitment to \nprotecting the health and safety of the millions of Americans who rely \ndaily on MDIs to treat asthma and other pulmonary conditions.\n  Most of today's products rely on CFCs, which the nations of the world \nunder the terms of the Montreal Protocol, have agreed to phase out. \nThis phase out is due to the reported damage CFCs cause to the \nstratospheric ozone layer which protects us from excessive amounts of \nultraviolet radiation. However, patients with asthma and other \npulmonary conditions understandably are concerned about the possibility \nthat one day they may no\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\nlonger have access to their medications and whether it will come before \nadequate replacement medicines are available.\n  I believe the resolution included in the appropriations legislation \nappropriately balances the need to establish a framework for the \ntransition from CFC to non-CFC products promptly, so patients and \nphysicians will understand the process and deal with it. Immediate \naction is needed so patients and care givers have the opportunity to \nconsider and appropriately manage the impact of a transition from one \nsafe and effective medication to another. With sufficient time to make \nsuch preparations, the important transition from CFC to non-CFC MDIs \nwill work for the people who matter most--the patients.\n  The resolution states the FDA shall issue a proposed rule no later \nthan May 1, 1999. Although I would like to see the process move more \nquickly, I believe this is ample time for the FDA to take into account \npatient concerns and needs. The FDA has already been working on this \nissue for more than 15 months and has heard from thousand of interested \nindividuals and groups. In March 1997, the FDA issued an advanced \nnotice of proposed rulemaking which most parties agree was flawed, \nparticularly in its tentative suggestion of a so-called ``therapeutic \nclass'' transition from existing drugs to new products. The resolution \nclearly instructs FDA not to take this approach, but to consider \nalternatives. For example, one preferable approach would be to require \nan alternative be available for a particular active moiety before the \nagency could take a CFC-containing product off the market.\n  The resolution recognizes the pharmaceutical industry has made a \ngreat deal of progress toward fulfilling the expectation of the \nMontreal Protocol--that there will be excellent non-CFC MDIs available \nto patients. Clearly, this is not a situation where we will be taking \ngood medications from the market and leaving a void. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth, but it's important for us not to send a signal \nto manufacturers who are doing the right thing in developing \nalternatives that we do not see the urgency of beginning this \ntransition. The resolution my good friends from Arkansas and Ohio \npropose corrects that mis-impression and I thank them for clarifying \nit.\n  The resolution expresses the expectation that the FDA, in \nconsultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, will assess the \nimpacts on the environment and patient health of a transition to CFC-\nfree products. In doing this, the FDA must consult in the process with \nthe many parties interested in this issue, which is as it should be. \nThe information the FDA receives and develops from these discussions \nshould be reflected in its proposed rule, along with information the \nagency has already received in the form of comments on its ANPR. I \nbelieve the intention of this resolution is clear--the FDA should \ncontinue this important dialogue after the proposed rule is issued. In \nthis way, we can be assured a fair and balanced rule will emerge and \nmove us away from the use of CFCs in a way which protects patients \nhealth and safety.\n  In short, this resolution urges the FDA to get on with the business \nat hand--namely, publish a proposed rule which lays out a framework for \nthe transition from CFC to non-CFC MDIs by no later than May 1, 1999. \nThis framework should be developed in consultation with patients, care \ngivers and others to ensure continued patient health and safety. The \nurgency of this action is dictated by the need to allow patients and \ncare givers time to consider the ramifications of the transition and \nprepare for it.\n  I want to thank the gentlemen from Arkansas and Ohio again for their \nleadership on this issue and their willingness to accommodate our \nconcerns.\n\n\n                    THE TUNNEL AND RESERVOIR PROJECT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. As we consider the FY 1999 VA-HUD and Independent \nAgencies Appropriations bill, I would like to call your attention to \nthe serious flooding problems that continue to plague the City of \nChicago and its surrounding suburbs, and to urge your consideration to \nprovide funding for a system of flood control tunnels designed to \nmitigate these weather-related problems.\n  For years, severe thunderstorms have caused extensive flooding in the \nChicago area due to the antiquated storm drainage system that serves \nthe region. The drainage system, also linked to the sewage system, is \nquickly filled to capacity and overwhelmed during storm events, \nresulting in sewage backflows into Lake Michigan and the basements of \nthousands of homes. This flooding creates major public health hazards, \nleaves neighborhoods without electrical power, and causes disruptions \nof major transportation thoroughfares.\n  These kind of flooding emergencies will continue to plague the City \nof Chicago and neighboring communities until the construction of an \nimportant system of tunnels and reservoirs is completed. This system is \nknown as the Tunnel and Reservoir plan (TARP), an initiative of the \nMetropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, my colleague from Illinois is \nexactly correct. TARP is a network of underground tunnels and \nreservoirs designed as an outlet for sewage and floodwaters during \nlarge thunderstorms. For almost two decades, the TARP system has slowly \ngrown, gradually improving flood prevention system in Chicago. Without \nTARP, local sewage and rainwater drainage would have no where to go \nwhen large storms hit the area.\n  Already, TARP has greatly reduced contaminated flooding of basements, \npolluted backflows into Lake Michigan, and to the amazement of many, \nhas markedly improved the water quality of the Chicago River, a feat \nthought to be impossible a decade ago. Although TARP is largely \ncomplete, federal funds are still needed to finish the system and \ncomplete the commitment that the federal government made to this \nproject years ago.\n  Chicago desperately needs additional capacity to stop this flooding. \nWithout TARP, homeowners and residents in the greater Chicago region \nwill continue to experience serious economic and health hazards from \nflooding during severe thunderstorm events.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is why we would like to ask the Chairman if he will \ngive us his assurances that the subcommittee will give every \nconsideration to including the House level of funding for this project \nduring conference of this bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the remarks of my colleagues from Illinois, \nand I understand the longtime importance of this pollution control \nproject to you and your constituents. You can be sure I will work to \ninclude the funding for this project during conference of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill.\n\n\n                           Mercury Emissions\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have spoken previously on my concerns \nabout the ongoing threats from mercury pollution to the lands, rivers \nand lakes of Vermont and the rest of the country. I sponsored a Senate \nResolution that called on the Administration to release its long \noverdue Mercury Study Report to Congress, a report that was mandated by \nthe Clean Air Act of 1990. Earlier this year I introduced S. 1915, the \n``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998'' which, if enacted, \nwould significantly reduce the risks that this powerful neurotoxin \nposes to the neurological health and development of pregnant women and \ntheir fetuses, women of child bearing age, and children. Senators \nSnowe, Wellstone and Moynihan have joined me in co-sponsoring the \nlegislation.\n  The Mercury Study Report to Congress states that 150 tons of mercury \nare released to the environment every year, year after year. The Study \nreports that more than one-third of the mercury that is released in the \nUnited States each year--52 tons--comes from coal-fired power plants. \nMercury is contained in the coal. When coal is burned the mercury is \nvaporized and is released to the environment.\n  Once released to the environment, mercury does not behave like many \npollutants. It does not biodegrade, it persists. Mercury does not \nbecome less toxic--it transforms chemically into even stronger and more \ntoxic forms such as methyl mercury. Methyl mercury accumulates in fish, \nand it accumulates in the human beings that eat the fish. Once \ningested, methyl mercury is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout \nthe body. It easily penetrates the blood-brain and placental barriers, \nand it stays in the body\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\nfor very long periods of time. One of the ways that it is finally \nexcreted from the body is through breast milk. A developing fetal brain \nand nervous system can be exposed to mercury because the placenta and \nthe blood-brain barriers offer no protection, and once born, the \nexposure can continue through breast milk.\n  There is ample evidence that mercury levels in the environment are \nincreasing. One of the most telling indicators is the trend in mercury \nfishing advisories. In 1993, 27 states had issued health advisories \nwarning the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish. In 1997, this \nhad grown to 39 states. We are going in the wrong direction. Before we \nknow it we are going to have filled the whole map with these warnings. \nIt is time to reverse this trend.\n  While the EPA report does the best job so far in quantifying mercury \nemissions, many believe that the report understates the actual amount \nof mercury being released to the environment. Toward the end of \nobtaining better data on mercury emissions from coal-fired power \nplants, EPA has issued notice of its intent to begin collecting \ninformation from these facilities on the mercury that they emit. I \nthink that this is an excellent step for EPA to be taking, and I \nstrongly urge the Office of Management and Budget to support this \ninformation collection request. It is very much in keeping with the \npublic's ``right to know'' about the types and amounts of toxic \npollutants that are being released, and I strongly urge EPA to \ndisseminate the information widely, including making it available via \nthe Internet.\n  Madam President, I would like to state my serious concern about \nmercury-related report language in the House of Representatives VA/HUD/\nIndependent Agencies appropriations bill. Among other things, the \nreport language would require that another mercury report be developed. \nEach of the mercury-related tasks stipulated in the report language \nwould need to be completed before EPA would be allowed to make any \nregulatory determinations on mercury.\n  This report language purely and simply delays efforts to control \nmercury emissions at the expense of those who are most susceptible to \nthe effects of mercury pollution--pregnant women and their fetuses, \nwomen of child bearing age, and young children.\n  To put this delay into perspective, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments \nrequired EPA to study mercury emissions and to report to Congress. EPA \ncompleted the report in 1994 and, largely due to highly effective \npressure exerted by the coal-fired power industry, the Agency sat on \nthe report for 2 years. It was finally released last December after \nmuch effort by this Senator and a number of my colleagues. It is an \nexcellent report, and the years that it spent on the shelf gathering \ndust did not alter its message. In the meantime, hundreds of tons of \ntoxic mercury emissions continued to rain down unabated on our lands, \nrivers, and lakes.\n  The mercury report does not need to be redone. I do not believe that \nanyone who actually reads it objectively would conclude that we need to \nstudy mercury all over again before Congress or the Executive Branch \ncan make any decisions about controlling mercury emissions. But that is \nprecisely what the House report language would require. If the past is \nany indicator of how long it will take to accomplish what is \ncontemplated by the report language, we will be at least halfway \nthrough the first decade of the next century and buried under more than \na thousand more tons of mercury before the United States can take even \nthe most minuscule action to control this toxic pollutant. This report \nlanguage is an inappropriate use of the appropriations process. Such \nmatters of substance and impact on the health and welfare of the \ncitizens of the United States should be debated on the floor of the \nSenate and House of Representatives.\n\n\n                             Ship Scrapping\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I inserted a provision in this \nlegislation to prohibit our government from sending our great Navy \nships overseas--where they are dismembered in a dangerous, \nirresponsible and immoral manner. The export of misery and the \nexploitation of workers is beneath the dignity and honor of our nation.\n  I'd like to give the Senate some background on this issue.\n  With the end of the Cold War the number of ships to be disposed of in \nthe military arsenal is growing. There are 180 Navy and Maritime \nAdministration ships waiting to be scrapped. These ships are difficult \nand dangerous to dismantle. They usually contain asbestos, PCB's and \nlead paint. They were built long before we understood all the \nenvironmental hazards associated with these materials.\n  This issue was brought to my attention by a Pulitzer Prize-winning \nseries of articles that appeared in the Sun written by reporters Gary \nCohn and Will Englund.\n  They conducted a thorough and rigorous investigation of the way we \ndispose of our Navy and maritime ships. They traveled around the \ncountry and around the world to see firsthand how our ships are \ndismantled, and Mr. President, I must advise that the way we do this is \nnot being done in an honorable, environmentally sensitive, or efficient \nway.\n  I believe when we have ships that have defended the United States of \nAmerica, that they were floating military bases--and they should be \nretired with the same care and dignity with which we close a military \nbase.\n  Let me read from the Sun series:\n\n       As the Navy sells off warships at the end of the Cold War, \n     a little known industry has grown up. In America's depressed \n     ports and where the ship breaking industry goes, pollution \n     and injured workers are left in its wake.\n       The Pentagon repeatedly deals with ship breakers with \n     dismal records, then fails to keep watch as they leave \n     health, environmental and legal problems in their wake.\n\n  Of the 58 ships sold for scrapping since 1991, only 28 have been \nfinished. And oh, my God, how they have been finished. I would like to \nturn to my own hometown of Baltimore.\n  In Baltimore the dismantling of the Coral Sea has been a disaster. \nThere were fires, lawsuits, delays--and injuries. The Navy inspector \nrefused to board the Coral Sea because he was afraid it was too \ndangerous.\n  I am quoting now the Sun paper. ``September 16, 1993, the military \nsent its lone inspector for the United States to the salvage yard in \nBaltimore. He didn't inspect it because he thought it was too \ndangerous.''\n  The inspector was right to be concerned about his own safety. The \nnext day a 23 year-old worker found out how safe it would be.\n  He walked on a flight deck and he dropped 30 feet from the hangar. \n``I felt the burning feeling inside,'' he said, ``blood was coming out \nof my mouth, I didn't think I would live.'' He suffered a fractured \nspleen, pelvis, and broke his arms in several places.\n  At the same time we had repeated fires that were breaking out. In \nNovember of 1996, a fire broke out in the Coral Sea's engine room. No \none was standing fire watch. No hose nearby. The blaze burned quickly \nout of control and for the sixth time Baltimore City's fire department \nhad to come in and rescue a shipyard. At the same time the owner of the \nshipyard had a record of environmental violations - a record for which \nhe ultimately was sentenced to jail.\n  While all of this has been going on, the Navy also planned to send \nour ships overseas--where worker and environmental safety are virtually \nignored.\n  In India, the Sun paper found a tidal beach where 35,000 men scrapped \nthe world ships with little more than their bare hands. They worked \nunder wretched conditions.\n  They often dismantle ships with their bare hands. They earn just a \ncouple of dollars a day. They have no hard hats, no training. Every \nday, someone dies breaking these ships.\n  I will quote from the Sun series:\n\n       They live in hovels built of scrap, with no showers, \n     toilets or latrines. They have come from poor villages on the \n     other side of India, lured by wages that start at one dollar \n     and fifty cents a day, to work at dangerous jobs, protected \n     only by scarves and sandals.\n       They suffer broken ankles, severed fingers, smashed skulls, \n     malaria fevers, dysentery and tuberculosis. Some are burned \n     and some are drowned. Nobody keeps track of how many die here \n     from accidents and disease. Some say a worker dies every day.\n\n  This is an international disgrace.\n  So I introduced legislation to prohibit the overseas sales of \ngovernment owned ships to countries with poor labor and environmental \nrecords. I inserted similar language in the VA-HUD\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nappropriations bill that we are considering today.\n  This is not a ban on exports. Ships could be exported to countries \nthat can break ships responsibly.\n  This limitation on exports would only be in effect for one year. This \nwould enable the Navy to come up with a more ethical, workable plan for \nexports. This one year pause in exports would also enable us to improve \nour ability to dispose of ships here in the U.S. This will provide \nAmerican jobs, and will strengthen our shipbuilding industrial base.\n  Some say that it is cheaper to send our ships to India and other \ndeveloping countries. It is cheaper. Why? Because workers earn one \ndollar and fifty cents a day. They work eighteen hours a day. They have \nno training and no protection. They die or are maimed in terrible, \npreventable accidents.\n  It is always cheaper to exploit workers--and it is always wrong.\n  I would like to thank the Sun paper for their outstanding service in \nbringing this not only to my attention but to America's attention. Now \nthe Senate must act to end these shameful policies.\n  The Sun reporters won the Pulitzer prize. But I want the United \nStates of America to be sure that we win a victory here today for \nworkers, the environment--and especially for the Navy. Because I know \nour Navy wants to do the right, honorable thing.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with me that the practice of \nexploiting foreign workers and ignoring the environment is beneath the \ndignity of our great Navy, and of our nation.\n  (At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. GLENN. I want to commend Senator Mikulski and the other \nMembers of the Subcommittee for incorporating elements of the Mikulski-\nGlenn Bill (S. 2064) to prohibit export of ships to be scrapped in \ncountries with substandard environmental laws and practices.\n  Senator Mikulski, with me as the prime cosponsor; introduced the \noriginal bill in May upon learning that the Federal ship-owning \nagencies, principally MARAD and the Navy, were retaining the option to \nexport ships to countries with weak environmental and labor protection \nlaws. They were retaining this option even after public reports and a \nGAO analysis that criticized Federal agencies for allowing the export \nof ships laden with PCBs, asbestos and hazardous materials.\n  In the past, these ships were sent to developing countries to be \nscrapped. They would lie listing just offshore, giant metal hulks \nwaiting to be cut up and disassembled--often by children in barefeet--\nwith the hazardous waste from the ships' interiors unceremoniously \ndumped overboard.\n  While I can respect the sovereignty of these countries in making \ntheir own environmental and labor laws--however inadequate they may be, \nI don't think that as a government the Feds should be contributing to \nthat inadequacy by sending its own ships there to be scrapped in that \nfashion.\n  The VA-HUD Appropriations Bill contains language that contains a 1 \nyear restriction of Federal ship exports for scrapping. No exports can \nbe made unless the EPA certifies that the destination country has \nenvironmental standards and enforcement ``comparable'' to the U.S. So \nit is not an outright ban on exports. The language supplements the \nother part of the Mikulski-Glenn Bill, which strengthens environmental \nand labor protection criteria in Federal contracts for domestic ship \nscrapping. Those provisions were unanimously adopted as part of the DOD \nAuthorization Bill and $7.8 million has been provided for this effort \nin the DOD Appropriations Bill.\n  We can protect our oceans, treat harmful hazardous waste safely, and \nscrap ships responsibly if we're willing to make the commitment to do \nthe right thing. The language incorporated into the VA-HUD Bill takes \nthat approach and resides there largely because of the effort and \npersistence of the good Senator from Maryland. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport that language, and to oppose any efforts to weaken it or strike \nit. \n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill. I thank Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski, my \ngood friend from Maryland, for their efforts in bringing this bill to \nthe floor so quickly. I know how difficult it is to balance the many \ncompeting needs contained in this appropriations bill. Senators Bond \nand Mikulski are to be commended for the good bill that they have \nproduced.\n  As Ranking Member of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs, I am particularly pleased with the appropriations for HUD. S. \n2168 provides an increase in appropriations to HUD over what was \nenacted in FY 1998. I applaud these funding increases and I believe \nthey will go a long way towards helping our neediest citizens. However, \nI am concerned that they fall somewhat short of the Administration's \nrequest--and considerably short of what is needed to address the severe \nhousing and community development needs in this country.\n  Today, only about one out of every 4 households in need of housing \nassistance receives it. This includes households living in public \nhousing, assisted housing, and housing built with the tax credit and \nHOME funds. Of the roughly 12 million unassisted families, \napproximately five and a half million have worst-case housing needs. \nThese families are paying more than half of their incomes every month \nin rent, or live in physically substandard housing, or both.\n  My colleagues on the Appropriations Committee recognize this need. \nFor the first time since 1995, they have provided for additional \nincremental vouchers; $40 million has been appropriated to support \nroughly 7,000 to 8,000 welfare-to-work vouchers--vouchers that will \nplay a crucial role in helping smooth the transition from welfare to \nwork. Furthermore, the appropriators have deleted a provision in \ncurrent law which requires housing authorities to retain vouchers and \ncertificates for a period of three months upon their turnover. This \nsimple change means that as many as 40,000 additional low-income \nfamilies will be served by the Section 8 program each year. I commend \nthe appropriators for implementing this change.\n  While I applaud the direction S. 2168 moves us, I am discouraged by \nthe pace. I fully understand the constraints in which the Committee has \nto work, but these constraints are artificial. CBO tells us to expect \nup to $63 billion in budget surpluses for FY '98, and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in surpluses over the next ten years. At least some \nportion of these funds should be returned to the HUD budget, which has \nbeen sacrificed over the years in the name of deficit reduction.\n  An appropriate start would be to fully fund the Administration's \nrequest of 50,000 welfare-to-work vouchers. A recent HUD study found \nthat the fastest growth in worst case housing needs during the 1990s \nhas been among working families. These findings indicate that wages \nearned by lower income working families simply have not kept pace with \nthe escalating cost of housing. Welfare-to-work vouchers help fill the \ngap between real wages and housing costs. Additionally, they help \nunemployed and underemployed individuals move to where jobs are \navailable. Finally, welfare-to-work vouchers build new partnerships \nbetween housing agencies and other local agencies which promote and \nimplement welfare reform. For all of these reasons, it is important \nthat more welfare-to-work vouchers are available in future years.\n  We should also be providing funding to fulfill the President's \nrequest of 34,000 vouchers for homeless persons. Homelessness continues \nto be a significant problem in this country. It is estimated that as \nmany as 2 million people will experience homelessness at some point in \nthe next year. Some of these people have chronic disabilities that lead \nto chronic homelessness; others experience unanticipated problems such \nas job loss or a sudden illness which results in displacement from \ntheir housing.\n  That is why I strongly support the appropriators' decision to \nsubstantially increase funding for homeless programs, and their \ndecision to include a recommendation that 30% of all funding be \nallocated to permanent housing. These gestures indicate a real \ncommitment to attaching permanent solutions to the problem of \nhomelessness. But make no mistake. Vouchers are an essential tool for \naddressing the needs of the homeless. A tenant-based voucher provides \nimmediate assistance to families in need, and is a much better and\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\ncheaper housing alternative than a shelter. Project-based vouchers can \nleverage funding for supportive housing developments, which provide \nessential services for chronically disabled and chronically homeless \nindividuals.\n  I am also pleased to see a renewed commitment to the HOPE VI program. \nS. 2168 would increase funding for the HOPE VI program by $50 million. \nThis program has provided a crucial source of funding for redeveloping \nobsolete public housing developments and transforming entire \nneighborhoods. HOPE VI funds are used to leverage other public and \nprivate funds which can be used to promote resident self-sufficiency \nand economic independence. I have witnessed first-hand the impact that \nthis program has had on communities in Baltimore, and I commend the \nappropriators for pledging more funds in support of these vital \ninitiatives.\n  In order to succeed, however, public housing needs more funding. \nWithout adequate operating subsidies, public housing authorities cannot \npay for the day to day operations of their housing developments. PHAs \nare forced to put off routine maintenance and small capital projects. \nOver time, this leads to a greater demand for large scale capital \nimprovements. It is currently estimated that PHAs would need roughly \n$4.5 billion of capital funds per year for 10 years just to address \ntheir backlogged capital needs. The Senate appropriation of $2.55 \nbillion in capital funding for FY 1999 represents a $50 million \nincrease over the level enacted in 1998, but does not come close to \naddressing the severe need for public housing capital improvements.\n  It is regrettable that S. 2168, while providing a much needed $75 \nmillion increase for Community Development Block Grants, does not \nadequately fund the Administration's Economic Development Initiative. \nThe EDI supports grants and Federal loan guarantees which \nmunicipalities can use to leverage private capital for business loans, \ncommunity development banks, revolving loan funds, large scale retail \ndevelopments, and welfare-to-work projects. HUD requested $400 million \nto fund EDI in FY '99, anticipating that this would leverage $2 billion \nin private sector loans and create roughly 280,000 jobs in needy \ncommunities. Economic growth and jobs are the key to revitalizing urban \nareas, and the EDI fosters these opportunities. It is unfortunate that \nthe EDI could only be funded at $85 million.\n  I am pleased that the appropriators showed a commitment to \nhomeownership by expanding the FHA single family mortgage insurance \nprogram. This program is the best tool that the Federal government has \nfor helping low- to moderate-income families become homeowners, and it \ndoesn't cost the taxpayer a single dime. It is well documented that the \nFHA program serves a higher proportion of low-income, minority and \nfirst-time homebuyers than any of the conventional home loan products. \nBy increasing the loan limits for this program, we should see a further \nexpansion in homeownership throughout the country--both in high cost \nurban areas and lower cost rural regions.\n  S. 2168 also contains language which would require HUD to engage in a \nlengthy and resource consuming effort to redefine their fair housing \nmission. While I appreciate the need to have a clear mission statement, \nI am concerned that the process prescribed in S. 2168 will be \ndetrimental to the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity's \nability to fight housing discrimination. The Department's standard \npolicy making procedures require that the public and Congress be \nnotified when significant policy changes are being contemplated. \nAdditional requirements beyond this will hamstring the Office, and take \naway resources which could be deployed to meet program goals.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for all of their \nhard work. They are to be commended for substantially increasing the \nFederal commitment to housing and economic development programs in a \nclimate of limited resources. I regret that we cannot do more at this \ntime in the areas I have outlined, but S. 2168 is a good bill and I \nurge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n\n\n                                  FEMA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the good work of \nmy colleagues, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, for taking on the \ndifficult task each year of drafting the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I \ndon't think many of us envy the job they have or the difficult choices \nthey have had to make.\n  I have come to the floor today to talk about a small but very \nimportant agency that is funded in under the VA-HUD Appropriations \nbill--the Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA.\n  My first experience with FEMA was during the devastating floods that \nswept through Minnesota in the Spring of 1993. Most recently, I \ntraveled with James Lee Witt to tour the damage caused by tornadoes \nthis spring from Comfrey to St. Peter, Minnesota. I never thought that \nI would be forced to learn the intricate ins and outs of FEMA's \nprograms and other emergency assistance programs, but I have. Since the \nflood of 1993, FEMA has been there on several occasions to help \nMinnesotans as they struggled through the early days after tornadoes \nand blizzards and floods to rebuild their lives and communities.\n  I want to thank James Lee Witt the Director of FEMA for all of his \nhelp over the years.\n  I really had the opportunity to get to know James Lee during last \nyear's devastating flood of the Red River. He is one of the President's \nmost outstanding appointments, a dedicated public servant and a great \nguy. Spending time with James Lee always has a catch, because it \nusually means that something really bad has happened in your state.\n  The good news is that it also means that something good is about to \nhappen. Because FEMA comes in fast, comes in ready and works in \npartnership with state and local communities and authorities. FEMA is a \ngreat partner to have.\n  Under the direction of James Lee Witt, FEMA has undertaken a new \nprogram called Project Impact, a predisaster mitigation program. With \nProject Impact, FEMA joins in partnership with local communities and \nprivate sector businesses to educate residents on the steps they can \ntake to reduce the damage disasters bring to our families and \ncommunities. This is another example of FEMA being a good partner.\n  FEMA and Director James Lee Witt have been there on many instances to \nhelp my state. I want to thank them for their assistance. Following our \naction here on the floor of the Senate, this bill will move to \nconference. At that time I hope that our conferees will remember the \nneeds of a small agency with a big job--FEMA--and support the level of \nfunding that was requested in the President's budget.\n\n\n                       STATE REVOLVING LOAD FUNDS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President--I would like to take some time to talk \nabout the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Funds.\n  First, let me say that the Clean Water Act has been one of our most \nsuccessful environmental statues. Our success is measurable and \nindisputable. We must ensure that the progress made continues.\n  Enacted in 1972--we have seen impressive gains in our water quality \nprotection.\n  Most of us are familiar with the Cuyahoga River fires. We are all \nfamiliar with rivers and streams that we couldn't let our kids swim or \nfish in.\n  Here in Washington, Lyndon Johnson called the Potomac River a \n``national disgrace''.\n  The Clean Water Act, and more importantly, with the cooperation and \ndedication of the American people and industry, the majority of our \nrivers, lakes, and streams are fishable and swimmable.\n  But, we still have a ways to go.\n  Why?\n  One reason is that statistics show that beaches, rivers, and lakes \nare the number one vocation choice for Americans. Whether people go to \nswim, boat, or one of my favorite past-times--fish, keeping our rivers, \nlakes, beaches, and streams clean is imperative for public health, the \nenvironment and the economy.\n  In addition, it has already been ``shown'' that improving the water \nquality of the Potomac, or the Lehigh in Pennsylvania, or the \nShenandoah in West Virginia is not just an environmental and public \nhealth success, but an economic one as well.\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\n  According to EPA's 1999 Annual Plan Request, ``Safe drinking water is \nthe first line of defense in protecting human health.'' In addition, \n``Safe drinking water is essential to human health and contaminated \ndrinking water can cause illness and even death, and exposure to \ncontaminated drinking water poses a special risk to such populations as \nchildren and the elderly.''\n  Today, we have close to 58,000 community water systems that are \nproviding drinking water for 80 million households.\n  According to statistics this country has over 3.5 million miles of \nrivers and streams, 41 million acres of lakes, and 58,000 miles of \nocean shoreline.\n  Cleaning up our nation's wastewater and assuring safe drinking water \nshould be, must be, at the top of our environmental priority list.\n  Putting our resources to work where the risks are known and the \nbenefits--both environmental and public health--are real and tangible! \nSetting priorities and making progress. Protecting public health and \nthe environment. Investing our taxpayer dollars the right way. That is \nwhat investing in our water infrastructure is about.\n  Mr. President, despite the fact that the Administration has claimed \nclean water as a top priority, the President proposed a reduction of \n$275 million in the Clean Water and Drinking Water Revolving Loan Funds \nfor fiscal year 1999.\n  As Chairman of this Subcommittee, I have made a priority of state \nrevolving funds for water infrastructure financing--providing over $6 \nbillion for SRFs since becoming chairman.\n  I know. Senator Mikulski knows. More importantly, this Congress has \n``shown'' that the state revolving funds are critical for ensuring the \nnation's water is protected and safe drinking water is provided to \ncommities across the country.\n  The state revolving funds stretch the federal dollar significantly \nthrough leveraging and cost-sharing features, helping to meet the very \nlarge need for water infrastructure financing.\n  The $14.3 billion federal investment into the clean water SRF has \ngenerated an additional $11.4 billion for wastewater projects, \nincluding $8.7 billion in net leveraged bond proceeds. This loan pool \nof $25 billion has resulted in almost 6,000 project loans! This is a \nvery substantial and gratifying return on the federal investment.\n\n  According to EPA, the SRF program buys up to 4 times more \nenvironmental protection for the federal dollar than traditional one-\ntime grants over a 20-year period.\n  EPA has identified the national need for infrastructure financing at \nover $130 billion just in the wastewater area alone. EPA has identified \nover $135 billion in drinking water infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. President--there are two glaring reasons of why investment in our \nwater infrastructure is imperative.\n  First are tuberculated drinking water pipes.\n  Let me give you the definition of ``tubercle.'' Tubercle is a \n``small, rounded prominence or process, such as a wartlike excrescence \non the roots of some leguminous plants.'' In other words, there is \nsomething growing.\n  Too many drinking water pipes providing water to communities--water \nthat comes out of your faucet in your kitchen sink and bathtub--are \ntuberculated. But it is rare that anyone ever thinks about it.\n  Too often no thought is given to the pipes until we become sick or \nthere is an outbreak in the community.\n  The second reason is a sanitary sewer overflow.\n  A sanitary sewer overflow is a release of raw sewage often into \nlakes, rivers, and streams.\n  We still have instances of raw sewerage overflowing into our lakes. \nAs I mentioned earlier, EPA has estimated over $130 billion in \nwastewater needs. Continued improvements to our wastewater \ninfrastructure will help us conquer the problem.\n  For example, according to the EPA, improved sewage treatment is \nrecognized as the single biggest factor in the Potomac River's \nrestoration.\n  Our wastewater infrastructure, like our drinking water \ninfrastructure, is out of sight. We forget that in some cases we have \ncentury-old facilities. All too often, we have facilities that have not \nbeen able to keep in step with the population growth and treatment \nneeds.\n  Like our nation's highways, in many areas our water infrastructure \nhas well exceeded its design life. Add to the expired design life, \nincreased capacity and increased federal and state regulatory \nrequirements and we have a potentially disastrous situation.\n  I was reading a brochure about clean water given to me by the \nNational Utility Contractors and came across the following:\n\n       Before you build homes, establish businesses, or pave the \n     streets, a dependable wastewater treatment system must be in \n     place.\n\n  Way too often we tend to forget this basic fact.\n  Mr. President, I have made, and will continue to make, a commitment \nin protecting our nation's water. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure that our progress \ncontinues in protecting public health and that real environmental gains \nand progress are made.\n\n\n                             kyoto protocol\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion \nover the past year on the Kyoto Protocol and concerns about efforts to \nimplement its requirements prior to Senate ratification.\n  We may disagree about whether or not the global climate is warming--\nand there certainly is no scientific consensus on the matter. But \nregardless of the scientific uncertainties and the differing views on \nthe issue, one thing is certain: the level of greenhouse gas reductions \ncalled for in the Kyoto Protocol have the very real potential of \ninflicting serious economic harm on the U.S. economy.\n  The agreement reached last December in Kyoto would, according to \nnumerous studies, lead to significant job less and substantial \nlifestyle changes for Americans. Energy prices could rise dramatically. \nOne study by Charles River Associates and DRI/McGraw-Hill, for example, \nprojected that in my state, industrial electricity prices could \nincrease 54.4 percent.\n  Mr. President, this kind of increase in electricity prices would be \ndevastating to small businesses, farmers, large manufacturers who \nemploy thousands, and individual consumers, including those with \nlimited incomes who would be hardest hit.\n  From the numerous studies that have been done to determine the \neffects of implementing the Kyoto Protocol, we know that we could \nexpect a serious economic disruption. What is not so clear is whether \nthere is a global climate change problem, and if so, how significant it \nis and what is its cause.\n  Therefore, I believe we must continue the debate and try to gain a \nbetter understanding of climate change and what action might be needed. \nTo do so, we must continue funding of research and technology \ndevelopment. We must continue to support the voluntary efforts that \nmany companies have undertaken to reduce greenhouse gases. And we must \ncontinue to support energy efficiency programs.\n  What we should not do at this time is to begin to implement the \nreduction requirements called for in the Kyoto Protocol. That should \nnot happen until there has been a full debate and until this body has \ngiven its advice and consent to ratify the Protocol.\n  The Administration has assured Congress that it is not their intent \nto implement the Kyoto requirements in the absence of Senate \nratification. Those assurances are appreciated. There is evidence, \nhowever, that efforts are underway to begin to implement the Kyoto \nrequirements prematurely.\n  This is a concern because, as I said earlier, there is a potential \nfor serious economic harm if the Protocol is implemented. Until we have \neliminated the uncertainties surrounding climate change, and until we \nhave had a full, open debate on the issue and appropriate responses, we \nshould not embark on a path that could lead us into economic disarray. \nImplementation before ratification is not the responsible--nor \nconstitutional--way to go.\n  That is why the Senate Appropriations Committee included in the VA/\nHUD report language clarifying that no funds should be used to \nimplement the Kyoto Protocol. We must continue to provide for research \nefforts and other important programs that make sense, such as energy \nefficiency and voluntary initiatives, but we should not\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\nbegin to spend funds for a Protocol that has not yet been determined to \nbe in the best interests of our country.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor so \nquickly and with such widespread support. It is a good bill--one which \nbalances a number of competing demands while reinforcing the Senate's \ncommitment to create new affordable housing and community development \nopportunities. This is not an easy task, and they deserve \ncongratulations for successfully juggling many differing needs and \ninterests.\n  While I wish that it could be more, I was pleased that President \nClinton requested $50 million in funding for the cleanup of Boston \nHarbor. I am disappointed that the bill does not allocate funding for \nthis project and other important water and sewer projects in \nMassachusetts. However, I am pleased that the House of Representatives \nhas funded four important water and sewer projects in Massachusetts. I \nwill be working to ensure that funding for Boston Harbor and other \nimportant water and sewer priorities are included in the Conference \nReport.\n  I believe that the overall budget for the Environmental Protection \nAgency is adequate. However, I am disappointed that bill does not \ninclude $600 million in funding to accelerate the cleanup of superfund \nsites which protect the public health.\n  I am also delighted that the bill includes a $500,000 appropriation \nto undertake interior restorations of Symphony Hall in Boston. For \nalmost a century, Symphony Hall has been among the finest concert halls \nin the world and has been the center for classical music for the City \nof Boston and the New England region. These funds will be used to \nundertake interior renovations of Symphony Hall, including updating of \nthe electrical, climate control, and fire protection systems.\n  I am pleased that the bill increases the level of funding that would \nbe made available for medical care, benefits, pensions, and assistance \nprograms to our nation's veterans in Fiscal Year 1999. I strongly \nbelieve that the administration's budget request for veterans--\nespecially for VA medical care--sorely shortchanged the medical care \nneeds of our veteran population as it is increasing in age and \nrequiring additional health care attention. We have a moral obligation \nto ensure that all 25 million American veterans have adequate benefits \nand access to the best possible health care available.\n  I will continue to work diligently with my colleagues to find \neffective means to compensate veterans for smoking related illnesses \nand disabilities that directly resulted from the use of tobacco \nproducts during the veteran's active military service. Regrettably, the \namendment raised by Senator Wellstone--that would have restored the \nability of veterans to receive tobacco-related benefits eliminated with \nthe enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century--\ndid not pass. I cosponsored this amendment with the strong belief that \nthe VA must retain this compensatory authority so that our veterans no \nlonger are betrayed in underhanded attempts to secure funds for \nunrelated programs.\n  There is no parliamentary procedure or backdoor maneuver that can \ndisguise the intention of the administration and many members of the \nSenate to deny veterans the ability to apply for these compensation \nbenefits and the ability to receive health care treatment for them. \nAmerica's veterans are painfully aware of these attempts. It is clear \nthat our government actually contributed to the use of tobacco by \nservice members when it supplied tobacco products free or at reduced \nprices. It is equally clear that our government has the responsibility \nto compensate them for the suffering they have incurred as a direct \nresult. I remain committed to our nation's veterans and will do all I \ncan to see that they receive the health care and attention they \nrightfully deserve.\n  There are many who would argue that the government no longer needs to \nfocus its energies on housing and economic development initiatives. \nThey say that the economy has never been stronger. They will site seven \nconsecutive years of economic expansion. They will site growth in the \nGDP of 3.9% last year--the best showing in a decade. They will point to \nthe lowest unemployment rates in 24 years and to the more than 14 \nmillion new jobs that have been created since 1993. And indeed, these \nare tremendous accomplishments for which the Clinton Administration is \ndue a great deal of credit.\n  But to assume that all communities and individuals are benefiting \nfrom this growth would be a grave mistake. Nationwide the poverty rate \nin cities increased nearly 50% between 1970 and 1995. In all metro \nareas, central city unemployment rates are at 5.1%, a full one and a \nhalf points higher than their suburbs. It has also been estimated that \nonly 13% of the new entry-level jobs created in the early 1990s were \ncreated in central cities. And tragically, while the nation is \nexperiencing record levels of home ownership, there are still two \nmillion Americans who will experience homelessness in the next year.\n  This growing discrepancy in economic opportunity argues for a renewed \ncommitment to funding for The Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment programs. Unfortunately, over the past few years, the exact \nopposite has occurred. Since 1995, more than $11 billion has been cut \nfrom the HUD budgets. During this same period, HUD has instituted \nprogrammatic reforms that have produced savings of more than $4.4 \nbillion. In other words, HUD has contributed more than $15 billion in \nsavings and deficit reduction to the Federal government during a time \nwhen demand for its programs is growing. Now that the budget deficit \nhas been eliminated, and there are projections of budget surpluses for \nthe next decade, it is time to start reinvesting in housing, job \ncreation and economic development for all Americans.\n  I believe that this bill takes a step in the right direction. On the \nwhole, it provides additional funding for HUD above what was \nappropriated in FY 1998. $40 million has been appropriated to fund \nroughly 7,000 to 8,000 welfare-to-work vouchers. These vouchers \nestablish a crucial link between housing and employment opportunities, \nwhile simultaneously helping those who are making a concerted effort to \nget off of welfare assistance. They are important tools whose \nsignificance cannot be understated given the uncertainty of welfare \nreform. It is unfortunate that the subcommittee was not provided enough \nfunding to fully support the Administration's request to fund 50,000 \nwelfare-to-work vouchers. It is also unfortunate, given these funding \nlimitations, that the committee chose to earmark the vast majority of \nthese vouchers for communities which may not have the greatest need.\n  I want to applaud the committee for striking a provision in previous \nappropriations bills which required housing authorities to delay the \nreissuance of vouchers and certificates for a three month period. The \nthree-month delay meant that about one-fourth of all vouchers and \ncertificates were taken out of circulation each month. As a result of \nthe effective leadership shown by Senators Bond and Mikulski, repeal of \nthe three-month delay provision means that approximately 30,000 to \n40,000 more low-income families will be provided with housing \nassistance each year.\n  The committee is also to be congratulated for enhancing the \ncommitment to fighting homelessness. This bill provides $1 billion in \nhomeless assistance, a 22% increase over the $823 million appropriated \nfor FY 1998. This money will be used by municipalities and non-profit \norganization to fund a variety of activities, locally determined, which \naddress the needs of homeless Americans. This bill also includes a \nrecommendation that at least 30% of these funds be used in support of \npermanent housing activities. Homeless providers and policy experts are \nnearly unanimous in their support for this set-aside. Permanent housing \nis the only long term solution to the homeless problem. I regret that \nthe committee could not fund the Administration's request for 34,000 \nSection 8 vouchers for the homeless, but on the whole this bill \nreaffirms the Senate's commitment to ending homelessness.\n  It funds the Community Development Block Grant program at $4.75 \nbillion, or $75 million more than was appropriated in FY 1998. These \nadditional\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nfunds will help communities fund economic development projects in \ndistressed neighborhoods. Included in this appropriation is a $40 \nmillion set-aside for the Youthbuild program. I am the primary author \nof the YouthBuild legislation in the Senate. Youthbuild provides on-\nsite training in construction skills, as well as off-site academic and \njob skill lessons, to at risk youth between the ages of 16 and 24. \nApproximately 7,300 young people have participated in Youthbuild \nprograms to date. By increasing funding for this program by $5 million \nover what was enacted in FY 1998, the Senate has demonstrated a firm \ncommitment to this very important program. More is needed, however, to \nhelp this program grow to meet the demand for these services. I will be \nworking to increase the funding for this worthy program to $70 million \nin the Conference Report.\n  It is unfortunate that the committee could only make $85 million \navailable for the Economic Development Initiative, another very \nimportant set-aside under CDBG. The EDI supports grants and Federal \nloan guarantees which allow municipalities to leverage private capital \nto promote economic development. HUD requested $400 million for EDI in \nFY 1999. At this higher level of funding, the EDI fund could serve as a \nmechanism for providing incentives for standardization of economic \ndevelopment loan criteria. Such standards could eventually serve as the \nfoundation for development of a private secondary market for economic \ndevelopment lending--a step whose significance cannot be overstated. \nOur mortgage markets are the envy of the world because of their depth \nand liquidity--neither of which would be possible without the existence \nof government-sponsored secondary markets. These principles should be \napplied to economic development lending, and an enhanced EDI fund could \nprovide the crucial first step. I hope that this need can be better \naddressed in conference.\n  We are currently seeing record levels of home ownership in this \ncountry, and HUD should take great pride in this accomplishment. The \ncommittee recognized the importance of home ownership, and has expanded \nthe FHA single family mortgage insurance program to better reflect \ntoday's housing prices in high cost urban and rural areas. I support \nthis provision. The FHA program is one of the most effective tools the \ngovernment has for assisting low-income, minority and first time home \nbuyers, and the modest expansion proposed by appropriators will help \nmore middle income Americans realize the dream of home ownership. But \nwe need to ensure that all who qualify for home ownership, regardless \nof race, creed or color, are afforded an opportunity to purchase a home \nin the neighborhood of their choice. Discrimination, as intolerable and \ndeplorable as it is, is still a significant problem in this country--\nespecially in the home purchase and rental market. That is why it is \nimportant to promote HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal \nOpportunity. The programs run out of this office support \ninvestigations, training, technical assistance, lawsuits and other \nlocally developed initiatives that target and eliminate housing \ndiscrimination. Unfortunately, this bill falls considerably short of \nthe Administration's request to fund these programs at $52 million for \nFY 1999. Worse yet, it institutes an onerous policy development \nrequirement which may actually diminish FHEO's capabilities to protect \nAmericans against housing discrimination. I believe the Department's \nfair housing policy is best set through the regular notice and comment \nrulemaking process, which takes into account the views of the public \nand the Congress. Adding additional requirements beyond this process \nwill burden FHEO and hamper their vital mission.\n  Mr. President, this appropriations bill is not perfect. In addition \nto some of the shortcomings I've already highlighted, S. 2168 contains \na significant cut in the public housing operating fund and continues to \nstarve public housing of much needed capital funds. It does not fund \nHOME, lead-based paint initiatives, or homeless assistance at the \nlevels requested by the Administration. Nonetheless, the bill has \nmanaged to increase funding for a number of very important HUD \nprograms, which is no small task in a resource-starved environment. \nThis bill places housing and economic development issues in the \nforefront of public debate, and takes a step in the direction of \nhelping those who have yet to benefit from our nation's recent economic \ngrowth. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3199\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, had I been present for the vote regarding \nwaiving the Budget Act for Senator Wellstone's amendment, I would have \nvoted to waive the Budget Act. Senator Wellstone's amendment addresses \nthe same issue as the point of order Senator Murray raised earlier this \nweek. I supported Senator Murray then in her effort to ensure that \nveterans receive the compensation they are due, and I support Senator \nWellstone. Although the Budget Act was not waived by a vote of 54-40, \nSenator Wellstone's effort was fitting and praiseworthy.\n  Veterans who suffer from smoking-related illnesses must be \ncompensated by the government that encouraged them to smoke during \ntheir military service. During World War II, the government included \ncigarettes in the rations it issued to troops. Long after the \ngovernment stopped issuing cigarettes, a ``smoke `em if you got `em'' \nculture pervaded military life. That culture led troops to begin and \ncontinue smoking, so this government has an obligation to do right by \nthe men and women who once fought this nation's enemies. Many of those \nmen and women are now locked in a different sort of combat. They battle \nagainst life-threatening, smoking-related illnesses, and in the \nmeantime, this government is shifting funds away from veterans to pay \nfor roads.\n  Today, the addictive nature of cigarettes is well known. Many \nveterans now smoke because they started during their military service. \nThe government cannot deny this fact, nor can it walk away from \nveterans by denying them the compensation they are due. I will continue \nto stand with my colleagues who support providing for our veterans' \nneeds.\n\n\n                        Prostate Cancer Research\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduced the Prostate Testing Full \nInformation Act in June of 1997 following a series of town hall \nmeetings in my State of California. At these meetings, we brought \ntogether the top prostate cancer experts in the State, the head of the \nurology branch at the National Cancer Institute, and prostate cancer \nsurvivors. Participants at these meetings reached consensus that \nCongress needs to do much more to fight prostate cancer. I introduced \nmy bill to mobilize Congress on this issue and to increase resources to \nhelp the thousands of men who suffer from prostate cancer.\n  Last month, President Clinton announced the release of $60 million \nfor prostate cancer research grants in a promising new Department of \nDefense program. This DoD research complements research at the National \nInstitutes of Health. It is an essential component of the national \neffort to find effective treatment for prostate cancer.\n  To institute this program at the $60 million level, the DoD had to \ncombine two years of appropriations. Even then, the program was only \nable to fund 25 percent of the worthwhile research projects presented. \nEvery meritorious grant that goes unfunded is a missed opportunity to \nfind a cure.\n  To ensure the strength of the DoD program, Congress should \nappropriate $80 million for fiscal year 1999. This would include $60 \nmillion to continue funding peer-reviewed research projects, and $20 \nmillion to maintain other elements of the DoD prostate cancer program, \nsuch as the prostate cancer imaging project at Walter Reed Medical \nCenter and research initiatives to target minority populations. To \nappropriate anything less than $80 million would send a devastating \nmessage to the men living and dying from this disease, to their \nfamilies, and to the scientific community that is working to find a \ncure.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has proposed, at a minimum, \nfunding prostate cancer research at the same level as last year. That \nproposal is not good enough. We need to do more on prostate cancer--not \nthe same as we have done in the past. The Senate proposal does not \nprovide sufficient funds to expand prostate cancer research. We need to \nappropriate at least $80 million for prostate cancer research at the \nDoD\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\nif we are to reach our goal of funding a cure for this disease.\n  41,800 American men will die from prostate cancer this year. It is \nthe most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer among all Americans. More \nthan 15 percent of all new cases of cancer this year in America will be \nprostate cancer, but less than 4 percent of total federal cancer \nresearch funds go to prostate cancer research. In the United States, \nprostate cancer kills about the same number of men each year as breast \ncancer kills women, yet prostate cancer receives only one-sixth of the \nresearch funding for breast cancer. This does not mean we should cut \nbreast cancer research. Rather, we need to significantly increase our \ncommitment to prostate and other cancer research.\n  Yesterday, 575 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer; another 575 \nmen will be diagnosed today. 114 men died yesterday of prostate cancer \nand that same number will die today. We cannot make a difference for \nyesterday or today. But we can and must make a difference for tomorrow. \nI urge my colleagues to support this increase in funding for prostate \ncancer research at the Department of Defense so we can make true \nprogress in the fight against devastating disease.\n\n\n           COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for once again crafting a VA-HUD Appropriations bill \nwhich deals fairly with a wide variety of competing programs and \ninterests. I know that budget constraints have made the job especially \ndifficult in recent years, but within those constraints in general, \nthis bill reaches a very good balance.\n  There are two provision in the bill which I have concerns about and \nwhich I hope can be addressed in conference. The first is funding for \nthe Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund. The \nSenate bill provides $55 million for this important program, $25 \nmillion below last year's level and $70 million below the President's \nrequest.\n  The CDFI Fund is an economic development initiative that was adopted \nwith overwhelming bi-partisan support several years ago. The program is \nan important investment tool for economically distressed communities. \nCDFI leverages private investment to stretch every Federal dollar. The \nVA-HUD Appropriations bill reported by the House Appropriations \nCommittee includes level funding for CDFI, still well below the level \nrequested by the Administration. This program is working effectively in \ncommunities across the country, and I believe additional resources are \nneeded to maximize the value of this important Federal investment. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond during \nconference to provide additional funding for this program.\n  The second provision I would like to address is Section 214 of the \nSenate bill. Section 214 specifically prohibits the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) from providing any extra points or \npreferences to grant applications from Empowerment Zones or Enterprise \nCommunities on the basis of their special designation. This prohibition \nis in direct opposition to the approach Federal Departments have taken \nsince the creation of the Empowerment Zone program, of providing modest \nadvantages to applications from designated communities. The grant \npreferences HUD offers to designated communities are indeed modest, two \npoints out of a total score of 100. These extra points will not provide \nthe boost needed to allow bad applications to be chosen over good ones \njust because the poorer application is submitted from an Empowerment \nZone or Enterprise Community. What they do provide is an incentive for \ndesignated communities to continue to pursue the initiatives they set \nout in their application for Empowerment Zone status. I strongly oppose \nthis provision and will work with Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski in \nconference to drop it from the VA-HUD Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, despite overwhelming public opposition to \nweakening protections for the environment and public health, some \nmembers of Congress are attempting to do so indirectly, by including \nanti-environment and anti-health directives in committee reports \naccompanying this year's appropriations bills. Often, these policy \ndirectives flatly contradict specific laws or the statute books.\n  One particularly insidious example would endanger children. In the \nlast Congress, with broad bipartisan support, we enacted the Food \nQuality Protection Act to provide safeguards against exposure to \ndangerous pesticides. But now, the Senate committee report accompanying \nthis VA-HUD Appropriations Bill contains language that could delay \nimplementation of key parts of this law for years, prolonging exposure \nof children to pesticides used in treating high chairs, sponges, \ncutting boards and other products used by children.\n  The use of pesticides in these products is unauthorized, but \nunauthorized uses have become a serious problem in recent years. Some \nmanufacturers are taking pesticides intended for other uses, and using \nthem in connection with common household products, and advertising the \nproducts as safe. Very little research has been carried out to \ndetermine whether these household uses are safe. Until they are shown \nto be safe, their use in such products should be restricted. EPA has \nthe authority to do so, and EPA is right to do so.\n  Under the Food Quality Protection Act, the Environmental Protection \nAgency has recently acted against manufacturers who use pesticides in \nways not approved by EPA. Usually, the manufacturers make unproven \nclaims that their products kill salmonella or other germs, and state or \nimply that the products are safer for children than other products on \nthe market that have not had such treatment.\n  The Committee report on the current bill asks EPA to go through the \nprocess of promulgating a formal rule before moving forward with such \nenforcement actions. EPA has already given extensive opportunities to \nthe industry to comment on the agency's rules on this issue. A formal \nrulemaking procedure is unnecessary and will result only in delay of \nneeded action and needless litigation to block such protection.\n  Obviously, committee report language cannot change current law. I \nurge the Administration to ignore all policy directives in reports that \nare inconsistent with existing law and that would undermine the \nenvironment and public health. EPA should continue its important \nmission of protecting the environment and children's health.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to thank my colleague, the \nChairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Committee, Senator Bond, for \nincluding in this appropriations bill an important provision--one that \nwould unlock and open the door to many first-time home buyers.\n  As we are all aware, it is often the downpayment that is the largest \nimpediment to home ownership for first-time home buyers. The Federal \nHousing Administration (FHA) began a pilot program two years ago to \nhelp families overcome that impediment by lowering the downpayment \nnecessary for an FHA home mortgage.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the pilot program, which is \nlocated in Alaska and Hawaii, has reported great success.\n  This pilot program is effective because it accomplishes two feats: \n(1) it lowers the FHA downpayment, making it more affordable; and (2) \nit makes the FHA downpayment calculation easier and more understandable \nfor all parties to the transaction. The pilot program requires--on \naverage--only a minimum cash investment of three percent for home \nbuyers.\n  Earlier in the year, I and Senators Stevens, Akaka and Inouye, \nintroduced a bill that amends the National Housing Act by simplifying \nthe current complex downpayment formula. The simplified formula creates \na lower, more affordable downpayment. Our bill would extend this lower \nand simplified downpayment rate to perspective home buyers across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the pilot program is a win-win situation: affordable \nhomes are made available to responsible buyers without any increase in \nmortgage default rates. Here's what mortgage lenders have reported:\n\n       There is no indication of increase in risk. The loans we \n     have made to date have been to\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\n     borrowers with excellent credit records and stable \n     employment, but not enough disposable income to accumulate \n     the cash necessary for a high downpayment.--Richard E. \n     Dolman, Manager, Seattle Mortgage, Anchorage Branch.\n       Is the 97% program working? The answer is a resounding \n     YES!. . .In this current day, it takes two incomes to meet \n     basic needs. To come up with a large downpayment is \n     increasingly difficult, especially for those just starting \n     out. The 3% program is a good start. . .I do not believe that \n     lowering the downpayment increased our risk. . .--Nancy A. \n     Karriowski, Alaska Home Mortgage, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska.\n       We have experienced nothing but positive benefits from the \n     FHA Pilot Program Loan Calculation in Alaska and Hawaii.--\n     Roger Aldrich, President, City Mortgage Corporation, \n     Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  In fact, but for the pilot program, approximately 70% of the FHA loan \napplications in Palmer, Alaska would be rejected, simply because the \nbuyer could not afford the downpayment. Mr. President, thanks to this \npilot program, more and more deserving Alaskans are becoming home \nowners.\n  Mr. President, our legislation has the support of the Mortgage \nBankers Association of America, the National Association of Realtors, \nthe National Association of Home Builders and the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. They believe, as I do, that borrowers in \nall states should benefit from the simplification of the FHA \ndownpayment calculation.\n  Therefore, I am pleased that the Chairman of the Subcommittee has \nincluded in this appropriation bill a provision to expand the Alaska/\nHawaii demonstration program to all states. The provision only offers \nthe program as a two-year demonstration project, whereas, my \nlegislation would have made it permanent--but I understand the \nChairman's desire to continue evaluating the costs of this program \nbefore permanent status is granted.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that helping American families \nrealize their dream of home ownership is vital to the Nation as a \nwhole. This important provision in the VA/HUD appropriations bill does \nmuch to assist families in owning their first home--thereby making the \nAmerican dream of home ownership a reality.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with respect to the HUD Section 811 \nprogram, does the bill provide for continued funding for the \n``mainstream'' voucher and certificates program?\n  Mr. BOND. The bill allows HUD to direct 25% of the funds allocated \nfor the HUD Section 811 toward tenant-based rental assistance for \npeople with disabilities--$48.5 million. Congress has allowed HUD to \ntransfer these funds for ``mainstream'' vouchers and certificates in \nboth FY 1997 and FY 1998. In addition, the bill grants HUD specific \nwaiver authority with respect to existing programmatic requirements \nunder Section 811. This limited waiver authority is intended to assist \nHUD in furthering the overall goals of the 811 program by increasing \nhousing opportunities for persons with the most severe disabilities.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe that the voucher and certificate 811 program \nwould be more beneficial to those with significant disabilities if non-\nprofit organizations with significant experience providing such \nservices would be fully engaged, working with housing authorities. And, \nI believe that HUD should give favorable treatment to applications \nproviding for substantial assistance by non-profit organizations with \nexperience in helping the severely disabled.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree. As my colleague knows, non-profit organizations \nthat traditionally serve persons with severe mental and physical \ndisabilities are a critical part of the success of the section 811 \nprogram. Any federal programs intended to meet the housing needs of \npeople with mental and physical disabilities should draw in the \nexpertise of organizations that have experience in providing supports \nand services to adults with severe disabilities. By contrast, the \ncurrent ``mainstream'' voucher and certificate program does not \ncurrently consider this very important issue in the allocation of \ncertificates and vouchers. Housing authorities should be encouraged to \nincrease their coordination with non-profit organizations and the \nawarding of the vouchers and certificates should be based, in part, on \nthat factor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Chairman's assistance in this matter.\n\n\n             recognition of ozanam in kansas city, missouri\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ozanam in Kansas \nCity, Missouri for its service to the community. For fifty years, \nOzanam has been helping children and families in turmoil. Ozanam \nfacility and staff help children reach their full potential and become \nproductive members of society.\n  Ozanam began in the home of Mr. Al Allen, a Catholic Welfare Staff \nmember, who after noticing the lack of help for emotionally disturbed \nadolescents, took it upon himself to being six boys into his own home \nto give them long-term care, education and guidance. However, in just a \nyear's short time, the need for a larger facility became apparent. \nPresently, the agency occupies 95 acres including two dormitories, a \ncampus group home, a special education center that contains vocational \ntraining classrooms, indoor and outdoor recreation facilities and a \nspiritual life center.\n  During its existence, Ozanam has had some outstanding staff and \nadministration to help the more than 4,000 children who have stayed \nthere. Paul Gemeinhardt, President, Judith Hart, Senior Vice President \nof Development and Doug Zimmerman, Senior Vice President of Agency \nOperations, deserve special recognition for their undying commitment \nand service to Ozanam.\n  I commend the staff of Ozanam for their untiring dedication to \nhelping children and their families in their time of need. I join the \nmany in Missouri who thank Ozanam for its good work and continuing \nefforts to better the community. Congratulations for fifty years of \nservice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I just wanted to raise an issue to my \ncolleague from Missouri, the manager of the bill, and the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland. This is just as an issue to raise with you. We \nmay want to take a look at it. I regret I didn't bring this up earlier.\n  Under the present system, as I understand it, nurses at VA hospitals \ndo not receive cost-of-living adjustments. It is based on locality pay. \nIn many areas around the country, nurses in our VA hospitals have not \nbeen getting raises. It is a bit more complicated an issue than just a \nsimple amendment to deal with this, but for the last 3 years, in many \nveterans hospitals there have been no cost-of-living or locality \nincreases during a robust economy.\n  Many of these, mostly women but some men, work very hard on behalf of \nour veterans. I know all my colleagues know and understand this. I \nurge, if we could, maybe enter into a colloquy in some way and look at \nreport language in which we might examine that issue in terms of how, \nfor nurses who work in these hospitals, we may be able to work out some \nbetter pay increase arrangement for them at these VA hospitals. I \nreally raise that for the consideration of the two managers of the \nbill.\n  I apologize for interrupting what I know is a decision to just move \nto final passage on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, frankly, I am not aware of this problem, \nbut I sincerely appreciate the Senator from Connecticut raising it \nbecause it sounds like a very serious problem. I can assure the \nSenator, our staffs and we will work with the Senator to try to get to \nthe bottom of this because we want to maintain the highest caliber \nprofessional service to our veterans in the VA system.\n  I am not prepared to say anything about how it is occurring or why, \nbut I assure the Senator we appreciate his bringing it up and we will \nlook into it and work on it. Perhaps in conference we can take some \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor raising this issue. It is never too late to raise the issue about \nthe quality of care that our veterans get. That means we need to be \nable to retain the very best from our nurses. The Senator has brought \nto our attention an issue which I believe has not been raised before. \nAs we move to conference, you have the assurance of your colleague on \nthis side of the aisle, we will look\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\ninto the matters raised and see how we can do the redress in \nconference, if a remedy is necessary.\n  But you have really brought something to our attention. It is \nimportant to the nurses who give care that they get paid and are \nretained, and we say thank you by adequate pay. Second, it has a direct \nimpact on veterans' care, because the more we retain the best, the \nbetter care they get. So I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me say, I thank both the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri and the distinguished Senator from Maryland for \ntheir comments. As I said, I think it is a complicated issue. I don't \nmean to suggest it is simple. But I really do appreciate--I know the \nnurses all across the country who work in our veterans hospitals really \nappreciate the attention I know our colleagues will give to this issue, \nto see if some mechanism can be offered to try to address this issue.\n  I am very grateful to both of them. I know the nurses in the hospital \nin West Haven, CT, are, and I am certain they are in other parts of the \ncountry as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed.\n  (The text of the bill (S. 2168) will be printed in a future edition \nof the Record.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I know there may be a couple of statements \nby the managers of the bill. I thank them for the work they have done. \nThey stayed here until about midnight last night.\n  The distinguished chairman from Missouri and ranking member, Senator \nMikulski from Maryland, have done outstanding work. By staying here \nuntil midnight last night, they completed a bill that probably would \nhave taken 2 full days next week, so I congratulate them for their good \nwork. We just passed the HUD-VA appropriations bill. That is the fourth \nappropriations bill this year.\n  We will next proceed to the legislative appropriations bill. However, \nno further votes will occur during today's session. Because of the good \nprogress we are making and the cooperation we are receiving, we can go \nto the legislative appropriations bill. Any votes with respect to the \nlegislative appropriations bill will be postponed to occur at 9:30 a.m. \non Tuesday. Therefore, there will be no recorded votes on Monday. On \nMonday, the Senate will begin the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield for a quick question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. On the legislative appropriations bill, will there be no \nfurther amendments after today if we have to vote on them next week?\n  Mr. LOTT. I respond, Madam President, to the Senator from Kentucky, \nit is our intent to complete debate on all amendments with the \npossibility of one amendment where there could be some further debate \non that on Monday. But all debate on all issues will be completed \nduring today, except that one amendment. There could be 2 hours debate \non Monday and hopefully complete it with a voice vote; hopefully \ncomplete legislative appropriations on Monday. If a vote or votes are \nrequired, they will not occur until Tuesday morning.\n  Mr. FORD. I am not particularly worried about when you have a vote on \nfinal passage. I am worrying about cutting off amendments, so that when \nMonday comes and somebody thinks of another amendment, they will be cut \noff.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will propound another unanimous consent request to lock \nthat in.\n  There will be no more recorded votes today and no recorded votes on \nMonday. The next will occur at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I express appreciation to the leadership \non both sides--the majority leader and the minority leader--for \nenabling us to get back on this bill and move it through. I thank all \nSenators for their accommodations and for working with us to get a very \nchallenging and interesting bill finished.\n  I express particular appreciation to Senator Mikulski. She has been \nan absolutely invaluable ally in making accommodations and working out \nreasonable agreements on this bill. Last night she said her clear, \ncogent, and charismatic comments, which helped us move the bill forward \nin an expeditious fashion.\n  I express thanks to her very able staff, Andy Givens, David Bowers, \nand Bertha Lopez.\n  I thank my staff, John Kamarck and Carolyn Apostolou, as well as \nmembers of my personal staff who helped on the bill. We look forward to \ntaking this measure to conference and working on it in the most \nefficient and effective way possible. I appreciate the assistance of \nall those who stayed with us last night. Their sense of humor continued \ninto the small hours of the morning, and I am most grateful for that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, first, I thank the leadership--the \nRepublican leader and the Democratic leader--for giving us a window of \nopportunity which enabled us to move the bill. Yes, it was late at \nnight, but we did due diligence and deliberation. I am proud to support \nthe final passage of this bill. It is good for the Nation; it is good \nfor my own home State.\n\n  We provide increases for veterans' medical care and veterans \nresearch. We fought to restore cuts in elderly housing, and we provided \nincreases in the high-tech future through NASA and the National Science \nFoundation. We are going to get behind our kids in terms of the funding \nfor national service and those wonderful informal science programs at \nthe NSF.\n  We worked to protect our environment, as well as stand sentry to help \nour communities in the event of a disaster. I was particularly pleased \nto work on a bipartisan effort to increase antiterrorist efforts in the \nFEMA program and to make sure that we protect our Nation from any foe, \ndomestic or foreign. That is our oath, and that is what we will do.\n  Also in this funding, we look for those important things that look \nout for the Chesapeake Bay and deal with important research on \npfiesteria.\n  Madam President, this is a good bill. I was pleased to work with \nSenator Bond. Again, this is a partisan-free zone that we had called \nfor. I thank him. I thank his professional staff for their very \nprofessional behavior. I thank my own staff for the hard work that they \nput into this bill, and I look forward to working in conference and \nperhaps getting our conference done before the August recess.\n  Madam President, that concludes my remarks on this bill. Again, \nthanks to John Kamarck, Carolyn Apostolou, Andy Givens, David Bowers, \nand Bertha Lopez.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                      Coeur d'Alene Lake and Basin\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I chose not to offer an amendment on VA-\nHUD, and I thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for the tremendous \nwork that they have done.\n  For a few moments, if I can have the attention of the Senate, Madam \nPresident, I want to speak to an issue that is not unlike what the \nSenator from Nebraska spoke to last evening, a very real concern of \nmine and the Idaho congressional delegation and the citizens of our \nState. This is an issue that particularly affects north Idaho, the \nbeautiful lakes and the mountains that we are so proud of in my State \nand that many of you have come to enjoy.\n  As I said, I was prepared to offer an amendment that would assure the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency would participate in the mediation \nprocess that is currently underway in my State over the issue of the \nCoeur d'Alene Basin.\n  On May 4 of 1998, U.S. News & World Report published an article \ndealing with supposed pollution in the Coeur d'Alene Lake and Basin. I \nread the article with near disbelief. For the first\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\n2\\1/2\\ pages, I read of a land fouled by pollution, of poisoned fish \nand dying wildlife, and the Idaho congressional delegation \n``scrambling'' to block the creation of a Superfund site of over \n1,500--let me repeat--a Superfund site proposed of over 1,500 square \nmiles in my State stretching into the State of Washington and the \nPacific Northwest.\n  I read the article and said, could this be the land that I know and \nlove, a land of beautiful forests, mountains, lakes, rivers, the Coeur \nd'Alene area, ``considered to be one of the most beautiful mountain \nlakes in the world''? I have put this in quotes because it is a direct \nquote from the web site of the Coeur d'Alene Basin Indians. The Coeur \nd'Alene Indians talk about the beauty of the land, and yet the Coeur \nd'Alene Tribe has also filed a lawsuit asking for a Superfund natural \nresource damage settlement in the basin that could be up to $1 billion.\n  One would believe that another study is needed to understand the \nhorrible pollution that is described in the beginning of that article.\n  But then I arrived on page 3 of the U.S. News & World Report article \nand read about the lake, this beautiful lake that I have just spoken \nof, a lake that meets Federal drinking water standards and that the \nsediments in the lake are not known to be causing problems. Indeed, \nthousands of people swim in this lake every year. They boat in its \nwaters; they fish, they camp and recreate along its shores.\n  Over the Fourth of July break, just a few weeks ago, 40,000 to \n100,000 people came to recreate in and around Lake Coeur d'Alene. \nSeveral communities draw their drinking water from the river below the \nlake. The water they consume continually meets tough Federal drinking \nwater standards.\n  A recently completed statistical validation study by the State of \nIdaho, with assistance from the Coeur d'Alene tribe and a toxicologist \nat the Federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, with \ndata analysis from the Federal Centers of Disease Control and \nPrevention, have said and found no contaminated fish in the waters of \nthis lake.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies have \nspent millions of dollars from the public coffers to study the \nsituation. Lawyers are litigating and making hundreds of thousands of \ndollars and building beautiful homes along the lake's shore from the \nmoney they make from this lawsuit as they describe the poisonous \nsediments of this lake. Now, remember, this is the lake that I just \nsaid meets Federal drinking water standards.\n  What is going on up there? Well, it is not unlike what the Senator \nfrom Nebraska talked about last night--an EPA that just keeps on \nrunning and keeps on moving and pushing the regulations when there is \nno basis under Federal law and tests for that. Looks like they have \njust got to have something to do.\n  Should we be looking for ways to address the problem rather than \npursuing study after study that appears to lead to more studies? Well, \nI think the answer is yes. That is why the Idaho congressional \ndelegation has introduced legislation to improve cleanup efforts rather \nthan to fuel more lawsuits and spend more taxpayers' dollars studying \nthe already well-defined problem.\n  This legislation has been approved by the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. This is what we need to do in the Coeur d'Alene \nBasin. We need to stop EPA and work to resolve the issue instead of \nspreading it to a 1,500-square-mile area. It is impossible to believe \nthat when we created the Superfund law that we were intending EPA to \neven reasonably think about an area of 1,500 square miles. That is \nbigger than some States here on the east coast.\n  I have not offered the amendment because EPA is now beginning to \nnegotiate with the State of Idaho. I hope they can continue to work \ntogether to resolve this issue and not expand a Superfund site beyond \nthe limited one we have that is now being well addressed and properly \ncared for.\n  I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Bond, \nfor being reasonable and working with us on this issue.\n  But EPA ought to get the message, and the Justice Department ought to \nget the message: Politics is one thing, but spending America's taxpayer \nmoney--millions and millions of dollars--to play the political game is \nyet another thing. To tie up the beautiful Lake Coeur d'Alene and the \ncity of Coeur d'Alene, one of the No. 1 destination sites in the Nation \nfor tourism and recreation, an area that you can walk out into the lake \nand swim in the lake and drink the water, and yet EPA is suggesting, \nand the Coeur d'Alene Indians are suggesting, that this should be a \nSuperfund site? I would hope not.\n  In fact, I hope this Congress would wake up to the games that have \nbeen played in the EPW Committee not to allow Superfund reauthorization \nout because somehow it does not fit the politics of the current \nadministration. It does not make a lot of sense, certainly does not \nmake any sense in Idaho.\n  I hope EPA will continue to negotiate with our State to resolve this \nissue. If not, the Idaho congressional delegation will be forced to \ntake quick action to resolve the issue here. I think finally we are \ngoing to get the understanding of our colleagues because of their \nrecognizing that Superfund does not work anymore. It just means a lot \nof lawsuits and a lot of politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the statement \nmy good friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, made about the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Coeur d'Alene Basin's pollution problems. I \nappreciate that he did not offer his amendment, which I would have \nopposed, because I believe it would have severely restricted the State \nof Washington's rights to protect its citizens from pollution generated \nin Idaho.\n  At least one version of the senior senator from Idaho's proposed \namendment would have given the governor of Idaho veto power over the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's ability to protect the watershed \nshared by Washington and Idaho citizens. The amendment would have \nprevented the EPA from even studying expansion of the existing \nSuperfund site without the Idaho governor's permission.\n  This is a bad precedent. I know there are many times when decisions \nmade in one state can affect the quality of the water in another state. \nIn this case, the Governor of Washington has publicly stated his \nsupport for potential expansion of the Superfund site to ensure all \npolluted waterways are cleaned up. Why should the governor of Idaho be \nallowed to thwart efforts to protect the quality of water in \nWashington?\n  I don't think he should.\n  Mr. President, I have written a letter to Senators Craig and \nKempthorne asking them to work with me to develop a way to ensure we \ncost-effectively clean up the Coeur d'Alene Basin while ensuring my \nstate's interests aren't jeopardized in the decision making process. I \nfirmly believe we can do this.\n  I am committed to protecting water quality in the State of \nWashington. I believe we could establish a working commission, which \nwould include the federal government, both state governors, and tribes, \nthat could develop a model by which the Coeur d'Alene Basin would be \nquickly, cost-efficiently, and rationally cleaned up. However, giving \none state's governor veto power is not the way to do it.\n  I pledge to work with the Idaho delegation, the State of Washington, \nand concerned citizens to ensure our waters are as pure as they can be. \nThere are few more precious natural resources than water and we all \nmust work to protect it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                    On the Victory for FHA Insurance\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I was tremendously heartened by the \nvote today on an amendment which would have set back home ownership \ntremendously. Indeed, by a vote of 69 to 27, the Senate voted to table \nthe amendment offered by Senator Nickles which would have limited FHA \ninsurance to over 50 million Americans.\n  Currently, there are 52.5 million Americans who live in high-cost \nareas where FHA simply does not reflect the reality of the marketplace. \nIn high cost areas, such as Nassau County, New York the current FHA \nlimit of $170,000 is insufficient because the median cost for a home \nwas $195,000 in 1997. It is nearly impossible for many young families \nstarting out to achieve the American Dream of homeownership. Let me\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nbe clear, we are not talking about wealthy families; we are talking \nabout a two-wage-earner couple, just married, a schoolteacher and a \npolice officer--struggling to accumulate the necessary funds for that \nfirst downpayment.\n  In many high cost areas, FHA no longer covers the cost for entry-\nlevel, new starter homes. In Levittown, Long Island--which epitomized \npost-war expansion of homeownership for working, middle-class families, \nespecially for GIs returning home from the war--that opportunity, \nunfortunately, is becoming more difficult today. Even in times where we \nsay the economy is booming and a nationwide rise in homeownership, \nfamilies in high cost areas are too often being left behind. Indeed, in \nmany of these high cost areas, the homeownership rate is lagging far \nbehind the nationwide average. Young families starting out on their own \nhave to come up with $25,000 for a downpayment--which is very, very \ndifficult to achieve, especially in an area where the cost of living \nplaces such a tremendous strain on the family budget. We are not \ntalking about people of affluence. Nor are we talking about magnificent \nestates or mansions, but simply average median-cost homes.\n  Indeed, in Long Island, where homeownership has been such a key \ningredient to permitting people to work and live as part of a \ncommunity, home ownership is becoming more difficult for these working, \nmiddle-class families. It is simply beyond their reach. Thankfully, \ntoday we have helped to bring relief to families in high cost areas by \nraising the FHA limit. In Long Island, the area that I grew up in and \nlive in, where there are nearly 3 million people, we will now be \nproviding greater opportunities for young middle class families to own \ntheir own home. The current FHA limit, which is set at $170,000, is \nsimply too low in an area where there are relatively very few homes \nthat can be purchased in all of the island for $170,000 or less. By \nraising the limit up to $197,000, FHA will better reflect the reality \nof the marketplace where the median home prices in Nassau and Suffolk \nCounties were $195,000 in 1997. We will now be providing that \nopportunity to thousands of young families who will be looking to \npurchase that first home in Long Island.\n  Nationwide, about 21 percent of the Nation's population lives in \nhigh-income areas. Again, this FHA increase in not for the benefit of \nthe affluent--they do not need FHA insurance and will continue to be \nserved by the private market. Indeed, they buy homes that cost much \nmore than $197,000.\n  What we have done is, I believe, struck a blow for home ownership, \nfor young families who want to get an opportunity, from one length of \nthe country to another.\n  The mayor of Albany, Mayor Gerald Jennings, he called me yesterday. \nHe was concerned because of the outlying communities in the Albany \narea. The county executive from Nassau, Tom Gulotta, called me because \nhis housing experts advised him that too many young families are being \ndenied the opportunity to purchase a home. They need to be able to get \nFHA insurance for young families who are starting out on their own.\n  I commend the Senate for overwhelmingly supporting this provision by \na vote of 69-27 to raise the FHA limits in high cost areas. I believe \nwe achieved a big victory for home ownership throughout this country \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the issue of Social Security has been \ngiven a new bit of attention this week. Senator Judd Gregg of New \nHampshire and Senator John Breaux of Louisiana announced their intent \nto introduce legislation that effectively takes the recommendations of \na year-long study and recommends a number of changes.\n  I like their proposal, Madam President. Senator Moynihan and I \nearlier introduced legislation that proceeds along similar lines. \nSenator Gramm and Senator Domenici are working on their own proposal. \nThe President has suggested that we have a year-long discussion of \nSocial Security and that sometime in the latter part of this year/first \nof next, he will call the congressional leadership in and we will try \nto solve this problem in 1999. That will be very difficult to do unless \nthese discussions are conducted in an environment where we make a real \neffort to educate the American people about what Social Security is and \nwhat Social Security isn't.\n  There was a recent Town Hall meeting on Social Security in \nProvidence, RI. I attended the first meeting in Kansas City, MO. \nIndeed, the President was at Georgetown when he kicked this whole thing \noff earlier this year. When he was introduced at Georgetown, a woman \nwho is a student at Georgetown did something quite interesting and \nquite common in the Social Security debate. She said when she took her \nfirst job, she noted on her paycheck that there was a person called \nFICA. She went home to her mother and said, ``Mom, who is this FICA \nperson, and why are they taking so much money from me?'' She had \ndiscovered the payroll tax, which is the largest tax burden on working \nAmericans today.\n  I note that there is growing interest in using the surplus, that we \nhave to use it to do some kind of a tax cut. I intend to argue that if \ntaxes are going to be cut, it ought to be the payroll tax that gets \ncut. FICA is the largest tax for nearly 70 percent of Americans. The \nmedian family in Nebraska will pay twice as much in FICA taxes--in \npayroll taxes--as in income tax.\n  As this young Georgetown woman went on to say, her mother told her \nthat FICA is a payment she is making into Social Security that she will \nget back out when she retires. And she hopes, she said to the \nPresident, that their discussion will lead to the protection of the \nmoney she has paid in over the years. Relevant to the discussion of \nSocial Security, one of the things I hope the President and the Vice \nPresident will do when they are having a discussion of Social \nSecurity--is to allow workers to have just that--the ability to use a \nportion of their payroll taxes to create wealth for retirement.\n  You hear other people describe Social Security as a program with a \npoor rate of return. As I said, I did not go to the Providence \ndiscussion, but I sent staff to it and they reported back that numerous \npeople expressed the view that Social Security is a savings program, \nthat individuals are making a contribution into it, and all they are \ngetting back is what they paid in.\n  It is not a savings program. You own nothing with Social Security. \nSocial Security is a payroll tax, and it is a tax that is imposed upon \npeople who are working. The proceeds of that tax come to the Federal \nGovernment, and are distributed to people who are eligible, based on \nvirtue of meeting the test of age, disability, or survivorship of a \nperson entitled to Social Security benefits. For retirees, there is an \nearly eligibility age of 62, and there is a normal eligibility age of \n65. There are also many people who actually choose to take a later \neligibility of 70, where they can get a higher level of benefits.\n  This is very important. As the President goes forward with the \ndiscussion on Social Security, he is the principal leader in this \nregard. He has the bully pulpit. I praised him before and I praise him \nagain for taking this issue on. It is an extremely important program \nand has benefited Americans enormously. It has changed the face of this \ncountry. It is a moral commitment that we make. But, it is not a rate \nof return program.\n  I urge the President and the Vice President, when they are leading \nthese discussions, if there is any confusion, to say to Americans that \nthis program is an intergenerational commitment. By maintaining the \ncurrent program, those of us who are working allow ourselves to be \ntaxed at a fixed rate, and\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\nto let the proceeds be transferred in a very progressive fashion. As I \nmentioned earlier, we let the proceeds be distributed to people who are \neligible, based on virtue of meeting the test of age, disability, or \nsurvivorship of a person entitled to Social Security benefits.\n  If the American people don't understand that, we need to inform \nthem--especially retirees. If people over the age of 65 believe that \nall they are getting back is a monthly check that is based upon what \nthey contributed, this debate will reach a dead end. I have heard many, \nmany elected politicians essentially pander to the audience and lead \nthe audience to believe all they are getting back is what they paid in. \nThey let them believe that it is their Social Security--they paid it \ninto it all their lives. In reality, it is a tax on people who are \nworking. That young woman who introduced the President had it half \nright. There is a 12.4 percent tax on wages, which is transferred to \npeople who are eligible.\n  If anybody right now is struggling under the burden of Social \nSecurity, it is people who get paid by the hour, particularly low \nincome people--people who earn their living as a consequence of their \nwork and the wages paid to them. For example, in 1996, the median \nhousehold income was $35,492. A family earning that amount and taking \nstandard deductions and exemptions, paid $2,719 in federal income \ntaxes, but lost $5,430 in income to the federal payroll tax. What we \nneed to be doing is giving some of this payroll tax money back to these \nfamilies so they can participate in the growth of the American \neconomy--so that they can accumulate wealth for their retirements. \nSince 1983, the payroll tax has been higher than necessary to pay \ncurrent benefits.\n  I come to the floor today to praise Senator Gregg and Senator Breaux \nfor their proposal, for their courage, in introducing this piece of \nSocial Security reform legislation. Most importantly, I come to the \nfloor to urge President Clinton and to urge Vice President Gore, when \nthey are having these discussions, to describe this program honesty. \nDescribe it as it is. Don't allow individuals, especially people over \nthe age of 65, to presume that all they are getting is a monthly check \nthat represents what they paid in over the course of their working \nlives. It is a tax, transferred in a progressive fashion, to people who \nare eligible.\n  Furthermore, don't allow the notion to lie on the table that the age \nof 65 is a retirement age. It is not a retirement age--people can \nretire at any age they choose. Sixty-five is an eligibility age. There \nis an early eligibility. There is a normal eligibility. There is a late \neligibility.\n  One of the most frustrating things that I suspect Senator Gregg and \nSenator Breaux face, is people saying, ``Senator, you are trying to \nmove the retirement age.'' It is eligibility, not retirement. There are \nmany people who retire early, they retire later, and as a consequence \ntheir benefit levels will be adjusted. They understand these \nadjustments, and as a consequence they make choices based on it.\n  I hope this debate will continue, but unless it continues in an \nhonest fashion, with the program being understood for what it is, it \nwill hit a dead end. This is a very easy program to demagogue. It is a \nvery easy program to misrepresent. There is a large percentage of \npeople who do not understand what this program is. Unless we increase \nthe number of people who do understand what the program is and decrease \nthe percentage of people who misunderstand it, it is likely this entire \nyear's discussion will lead to nothing more than political warfare with \npeople misrepresenting the program in order to achieve political \nadvantage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8447-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8448-S8450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC IS A CRIMINAL\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, for too long now, the world has been \nwatching a terrible carnage take place with the changing of the former \nYugoslavia, with the various factions fighting for autonomy, with the \ndeterioration of respect for human life being so obvious, that we \nalmost take it as a matter of fact when people are massacred, and we \nhear that the atrocities reach incredible levels.\n  It becomes commonplace to hear of tens of thousands of people who can \nno longer live in their homes. Indeed, estimates are that 3 million \npeople have been forced to move. They call it ``ethnic cleansing.'' \nDespite the best attempts by the United States and some of our allies, \nwe have been unable to bring about some resolve. Tens of thousands of \nU.S. and NATO troops are now positioned in Bosnia to attempt to keep \nthe conflict from again affecting the lives of the innocent--women and \nchildren, people who are held hostage, people who are abducted, women \nwho are raped, young men who are killed because of their ethnic \nbackground. It is incredible. Muslims are killed because they are \nMuslims. Croats are killed because they are Croats. Serbs are killed \nbecause they are Serbs. The madness that exists in this day and age is \nincomprehensible.\n  Madam President, the situation is not getting better. The situation \nis deteriorating. And behind it all, the motivator, the prime mover in \nall of this, is one man. That doesn't mean that there aren't others who \nare responsible on all of the sides for having had their people \nundertake horrific acts against humanity. But there is one person--a \nhard-core Communist dictator who has been able to keep power by way of \nappealing to the worst prejudices of people--by the name of Slobodan \nMilosevic. He would like to think of himself as a duly-elected \nPresident. He is the last surviving Communist leader still in power \nfrom before the wall fell. Make no mistake about it, although he may \ncall himself a President, but he is a criminal, he is a thug, and he \nhas been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people, \nincluding his own people. This is the man, the thug, the killer.\n  Indeed, the resolution that I, Senator Lieberman, and a number of our \ncolleagues, including the present Presiding Officer, have worked on is \none that deals with this thug. It is one that will call for the United \nStates and others to gather the factual information necessary to pursue \na trial in the international courts that have been established just for \nthat purpose. Indeed, the United Nations Security Council, in 1993, \ncreated the International Criminal Tribunal with the former Yugoslavia \nlocated in the Hague. The tribunal has already publicly indicted 60 \npeople for war crimes or crimes against humanity. It is horrific.\n  Even at this time, today, in the New York Times, we read an account \nof what is taking place.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Serb Forces Said to Abduct and Kill Civilians in Kosovo\n\n                           (By Chris Hedges)\n\n       Decani, Serbia.--Serbian forces have been turning \n     increasingly to the abduction and execution of small groups \n     of civilians in their fight against ethnic Albanian \n     separatists in Kosovo, according to human rights officials \n     and witnesses.\n       Many of the executions took place moments after Serbian \n     special police units concluded attacks on villages held by \n     the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels, witnesses said.\n       ``The number of disappearances are increasing each month,'' \n     said Behxhet Shala, secretary of the ethnic Albanian Council \n     for Human Rights. ``There is a mathematical logic to all \n     this. As the Kosovo Liberation Army kills more police, the \n     police go out and hunt down civilians who live in the areas \n     where the attacks take place. These are reprisal killings.''\n       Some 300 ethnic Albanians are listed by human rights \n     officials as missing since March, when the conflict \n     intensified between the rebels and the 50,000 or so Serbian \n     soldiers and policemen deployed here. Some of them may have \n     fled to Albania or Montenegro and others may be living with \n     relatives elsewhere in Kosovo. But some were seen by \n     witnesses being led away by special police units, never to \n     reappear.\n       As the war progresses, and as the rebels, who themselves \n     have abducted at least 30 Serbs, increasingly make Serbian \n     civilians their target, the fear is growing that the\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\n     fighting could spiral into the kind of war against civilians \n     that swept across Bosnia.\n       Visits to six of the sites where kidnappings and executions \n     by Serbian forces are said to have taken place yielded \n     accounts by witnesses and a look at the bodies of some of the \n     victims. But the precise number of those executed is \n     difficult to determine.\n       Based on the accounts of witnesses from each area, it \n     appears that a total of about 100 ethnic Albanians, most of \n     them men of fighting age, have been rounded up and shot, \n     usually in groups of fewer than a dozen, in the last five \n     months.\n       One man, Ndue Biblekaj, said he witnessed abductions and \n     executions by members of the notorious Serbian, ``black hat'' \n     unit, which was employed in Bosnia to kill Muslims and Croats \n     and expel them from their homes.\n       ``There were massacres in the village of Drenoc and Vokshit \n     near Decani,'' he said in an interview in rebel-held \n     territory. ``I saw a black hat unit line up 13 civilians and \n     shoot them. They stripped the bodies of their clothes, \n     slashed the arms and legs with their knives and dug out their \n     eyes. They used an excavator to dig a pit and bury the \n     bodies.''\n       ``I will never forget this sight,'' he said. ``There were \n     other executions that included women, children and the \n     elderly. You could see the bodies, including one group of 15 \n     people, lined up by the side of road.''\n       The detained men were often marched in single file by the \n     black-uniformed Interior Ministry commando unit to the local \n     water treatment plant, which was used as a command center, he \n     said.\n       Biblekaj, an ethnic Albanian, served for eight years in the \n     police force in the border village of Junik. He was part of \n     the Serbian force that recaptured Decani from the rebels in \n     June. The Serbs shelled the town reducing whole sections to \n     rubble. They sent in tanks and armored personnel carriers, \n     blasting holes in the walls of houses and driving nearly the \n     entire population over the mountains into Albania.\n       Decani is now abandoned, and the Serbian police, who crouch \n     behind sandbagged positions in the ruins, come under frequent \n     fire from rebel units.\n       Biblekaj has deserted the police to join the rebel \n     movement. He changed sides after the attack on Decani, \n     because, he said, he was appalled by the killing there.\n       Repeated attempts to inspect two sites suspected of being \n     mass graves in a wooded area near the deserted and badly \n     damaged town, still the scene of frequent armed clashes, were \n     thwarted by special commando police units.\n       The governor of Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, a Serb in a \n     province that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, denied that the \n     police had executed anyone. Serbian officials, as a matter of \n     policy, refuse to disclose the names or location of those \n     taken into custody.\n       Not every ethnic Albanian who is picked up by the police \n     disappears permanently, but the fear of being seized has \n     become common in these villages. Many are those picked up \n     return after a few days, complaining of beatings and other \n     ill treatment at the hands of the police.\n       According to witnesses, the largest number of killings \n     occurred in the villages of Likosane and Cirez at the end of \n     February, in the village of Prekaz in the first week of \n     March, in the village of Poklek at the start of May, in \n     Ljubenic at the end of May and in Decani in June.\n       On May 30, special police units entered Poklek and ordered \n     most of the residents into a house owned by Shait Qorri.\n       Fazli Berisha, who was outside the village hiding behind a \n     wall, said he saw 60 or 70 women and children ordered out of \n     the house as Serbian forces burned neighboring homes. The \n     women were told to walk across a field to Vasiljevo, a \n     neighboring village, he said.\n       ``Hajirz Hajdini and Mahmut Berisha were brought out \n     moments later and told to walk in the opposite direction,'' \n     he said, referring to two men. ``As they walked away they \n     were shot by the police. Sefer Qorri, 10 minutes later, was \n     brought out of the house and told to walk in this direction. \n     He was shot in about the same spot.''\n       The villagers said they later found the body of Ardian \n     Deliu, a 17-year-old youth, near Vasileva, about two miles \n     away, but they said nine men remain missing.\n       On June 8, Fred Abrahams, a researcher at Human Rights \n     Watch, spoke with Zahrije Podrimcaku, who witnessed the \n     attack on Poklek. An hour after speaking with Abrahams, who \n     is compiling a report on human rights violations, she was \n     arrested by Serbian police officers in Pristina, the \n     provincial capital. She was charged a week later with \n     involvement in terrorist activity. She remains in jail.\n       Poklek is part of the silent no man's land that lies \n     between the Serbs and the rebels, who control about 40 \n     percent of the province. Broken glass litters the main \n     street. The deserted stucco homes and small shops have been \n     looted, with household items strewn over yards and left in \n     broken heaps. A pack of mangy dogs snarl from behind the \n     blackened shell of a house, and the stench of a dead farm \n     animal rises from an untended hayfield.\n       Down the road in the town of Glogovac the residents seem to \n     move in fear down the dirt streets, which are periodically \n     the targets of Serbian snipers. A farmer, Ali Dibrani, 54, \n     was shot dead recently as he walked home at dusk with his \n     niece.\n       The Serbian authorities, who have issued a written order to \n     block food and commercial goods to all but state-run shops in \n     Kosovo, have effectively cut supplies to Glogovac and nearby \n     rebel-held areas. The shortages have left people bartering \n     for liter-size plastic bottles filled with gas. The clinic \n     has run out of medicine, and processed food, like cooking \n     oil, is scarce.\n       Here, too, abductions have left their mark. Dr. Hafir \n     Shala, 49, an ethnic Albanian who worked in a clinic run by \n     Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity mission in Glogovac, was \n     seized by the Serbian police on April 10.\n       Shala, who was jailed for four years for separatist \n     activity during Yugoslavia's period of Communist rule, was \n     pulled from a car at a police checkpoint on the road to \n     Pristina and put in a black jeep with three plainclothes \n     police officers. One officer got into a gray Volkswagen \n     Passat with two of Shala's companions. The two vehicles were \n     driven to the central police station in Pristina.\n       ``The three of us were taken to separate rooms on the third \n     floor,'' said Shaban Neziri, 49, who was traveling with the \n     doctor, as he sat in the remains of an unfinished house in \n     the village. ``I was interrogated for six hours and then told \n     I could leave. When I was escorted out of the room and down \n     the hall I heard horrible screaming. It was Dr. Shala. I \n     stopped. I asked the policeman what was happening to Dr. \n     Shala. He pushed me forward, saying, `Go, go, go.' ''\n       The doctor never returned. His father, Isuf Shala, 63, went \n     to the police headquarters the next day, but was turned away \n     at the door.\n       ``I saw the police after a few days and they said Hafir was \n     not on the list of prisoners,'' he said, seated cross-legged \n     in his home. ``They said he had never been in police custody. \n     The police said maybe our soldiers had taken him, perhaps I \n     should check with them.''\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me read a little excerpt:\n\n       Serbian forces have been turning increasingly to the \n     abduction and execution of small groups of civilians in their \n     fight against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, \n     according to human rights officials and witnesses.\n\n  The article goes on to interview a man by the name of Ndue Biblekaj. \nBiblekaj was a member of the police force for 8 years, and he \neventually left in disgust after having witnessed the kinds of things \nthat he describes. He says he has witnessed the abductions and \nexecutions by members of the Serbian ``black hat'' unit, which was \nemployed in Bosnia to kill Muslims and Croats and expel them from their \nhomes.\n  Imagine, they have an official unit, and their job is to get rid of--\nand that is the ethnic cleansing--anyone who is different, like the \nMuslims and Croats. He said, ``I saw black hat units line up 13 \ncivilians and shoot them. They stripped the bodies of their clothes, \nslashed the arms and legs with their knives and dug out their eyes.\n\n       ``I will never forget this sight,'' he said. ``There were \n     other executions that included women, children and the \n     elderly. You could see the bodies, including one group of 15 \n     people, lined up by the side of road.''\n       Biblekaj has deserted the police to join the rebel \n     movement. He changed sides after the attack on Decani, \n     because, he said, he was appalled by the killing there.\n\n  That is just one man who was so repulsed at what he saw that he had \nto do something. He joined the rebel movement.\n  This is a killing field once again. This is a killing field that \nunfortunately has been directed by Milosevic to empower himself. That \nis why this resolution, which is bipartisan and has the support of the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and the \nranking member, Senator Biden, and people from both sides of the aisle, \nis so important. It is a resolution that will send a clear and \nconvincing signal to the entire world that the United States is sick \nand tired of the way the world treats war criminals and that the world \ncommunity can no longer sit by idly while the Milosevic killing machine \ncontinues. Yes. Even this day as we are here that killing machine \ncontinues. And so tens of thousands of people are on the move, fleeing \ntheir homes, and fleeing the villages where they grew up and their \nforefathers--fleeing because of their ethnic background, and the \nmilitary forces who are bound to destroy them.\n  Madam President, I want to commend all of my colleagues who have \nworked, along with Senator Lieberman and I, in bringing this resolution \nforward, because the United States should be publicly declaring that \nthere is no reason to continue this without seeking the collection of \nevidence and making it high priority--evidence that the United States \nalready possesses--to make this evidence available to the tribunal, to \nthat court, as soon as possible. The United States has the ability\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\nto do this, and we should discuss with our allies and other States the \ngathering of this evidence so that Mr. Milosevic can be indicted. And I \nam certain, given the numerous accounts by historical experts--one of \nthe leading accounts on this is entitled, ``War Crimes and the Issues \nof Responsibility,'' which was prepared by Norman Cigar and Paul \nWilliams. It is an outstanding study of what is taking place, and the \ninescapable conclusion that Milosevic can and should be tried as a war \ncriminal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have excerpts from this report printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpted material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n   War Crimes and the Issue of Responsibility: The Case of Slobodan \n                               Milosevic\n\n              (Prepared by Norman Cigar and Paul Williams)\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The above review of information available in the public \n     domain indicates that there is sufficient evidence to \n     establish a prima facie case that Slobodan Milosevic is \n     criminally responsible for the commission of war crimes in \n     Croatia and Bosnia.

Madam President, shortly I hope, before the Senate \nadjourns for the weekend, the majority leader will be propounding some \nunanimous consent requests. Those requests are designed to set in place \nthe procedures by which we will move forward next week and the \nlegislation which we will take up.\n  One of those unanimous consent requests will involve two pieces of \nlegislation, one which I have offered, and the second which has been \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, which deals with \nthe question of pornography on the Internet.\n  There is a history to this. In the last Congress, Senator Exon and I \ncosponsored legislation which introduced our colleagues for the first \ntime to the dark side of the Internet; that side of the Internet that \nis not used for educational purposes, is not used for valid \ncommunication purposes, but which is designed to lure people into the \npractice of ordering and paying for pornographic images, words, and \nfilms, and other forms of pornography across the Internet. We know our \nfirst amendment prohibits our eliminating that and banning it. The \nright of free speech gives the right of adults to click into that, pay \nfor that, subscribe to that, and to order that as long as that material \nis not deemed obscene. Even though it is indecent, and many of us would \nclassify it as obscene, it has to be a standard set by the Supreme \nCourt in upholding the first amendment. It is one of the perhaps dark \nsides of the first amendment.\n  But we all understand that battle. And that is not what this battle \nis about. This battle is about protecting children from access to that \nmaterial, which most of us would turn our heads from, or say that is \nenough, were we given the opportunity to look at it. In fact, all of \nthe noble first amendment arguments that were raised during the debate \nin the last Congress against the bill that was offered by Senator Exon \nand myself melted away as Senator Exon invited Members into the \nDemocrat cloakroom, both Republicans and Democrats, to view images that \nwere copied from the Internet, and said, ``Did you realize this \nmaterial is simply a click away on your Internet?'' At that time, the \nInternet was pretty new. People were still discovering it. Most of us \nhad not even signed up, or even knew what it was.\n  Members were shocked at what they saw, because what they saw was not \nthe centerfold of Playboy Magazine. But what they saw was some of the \nmost despicable, some of the most brutal, some of the most sadistic, \nsome of the most sexually explicit material they have ever witnessed--\nyoung children being sexually exploited, bestiality, women being \nsexually exploited. I don't want to go into graphic detail here. But it \nwas enough to convince the Senate that we ought to move on it and move \non it right away.\n  So it passed, despite again the pleas for first amendment freedom. \nThat legislation, authored by Senator Exon and myself, passed the U.S. \nSenate by a vote of 84 to 16. It was adopted by the House in exactly \nthe Senate form, went to the President, the President signed it, signed \nit with a fair amount of publicity about the need to take action on \nthis to protect minors, to protect children from this access.\n  We had a standard in there--an indecency standard that was copied in \nthe exact language that the Supreme Court approved for the dial-a-porn \nbill that went through and survived the Supreme Court review, and was \ndeclared constitutional even though actions were filed against it.\n  We thought that since the Court approved it for telephone \npornography, surely they would approve it for video pornography and \npornography that came across the Internet. Picking up the phone is not \na whole lot different than turning on the computer. Both are invasive. \nBoth come into the home. Do they require some action on the part of the \nparticipant? Yes. You have to pick up the phone when it rings. You have \nto dial a 900 number. There is the luring of that.\n  Again, we are saying that first amendment prohibits us from \nprohibiting adults from doing that. But the Court has upheld in the \npast, and they did in the dial-a-porn case, reasonable restrictions in \nterms of children having to prove that they were adults. And, if they \ncouldn't prove that through verification of a credit card, or other \nmeans, then the material was not allowed to be passed on to them.\n  The Court said the computer is not the same as the telephone. The \ncomputer isn't as invasive as the telephone. Well, the Court needs to \nunderstand the computer. I wrote that off to a generational problem--a \ngeneration of individuals. Maybe I oversimplify this. But I do not know \nhow to better explain it, because it is the only possible explanation I \ncould come up with as to why the Court made a distinction\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nbetween a dial-a-porn standard and the computer standard. I don't think \nthey understood exactly what the computer does and how accessible it is \nand what the Internet was, at least at that time. I think they know \nnow. Maybe I underestimate the Court. Maybe there are other reasons.\n  In any event, as we know now, whether you are in the classroom, \nwhether you are in the school library, whether you are in your study \nhall, or whether you are in your dorm room in boarding school, or \nwhether you are at home in your bedroom, or your den, or your family \nroom, the computer is there, and a click away is the most lurid \nmaterial we have ever seen available to children and adults, simply \nwith the warning you have to be an adult to access this material and \nthat is it. You click here if you agree, and we send you the material.\n\n  I am going to describe as we get into the bill some of the effects \nthis has had on our culture, on our society, and particularly on our \nchildren. My purpose here today is to plead with my Democrat colleagues \nto allow us to bring this bill to the floor. We have revised the bill \nthat the Supreme Court struck down to comply with their objections, to \naddress the question of the standard which we have changed from the \nindecency standard to the harmful-to-minor standard. The harmful-to-\nminor standard was the standard the Court laid out in the Ginsberg \ncase, and we have taken that word for word.\n  Second, we have restricted this, as the Court ordered that we had to \ndo in order to meet the constitutional test, to the World Wide Web, to \nthe commercial selling and display of these images, rather than private \nconversations, e-mail, chat rooms where individuals are engaging in \nthis kind of activity.\n  That is not how I wanted to draft the bill, but in order to get a \ncourt to uphold what is clearly the will of the American people as \nexpressed by their representatives in an overwhelming vote in the \nSenate and unanimous acceptance in the House of Representatives and \ndeclarations by the President of the United States that the \nadministration stands foursquare behind this, we find ourselves back \nhere having to narrow the bill in order to survive court muster.\n  That is what we have done. We have worked with constitutional experts \nto make sure that we have done it correctly, that we comply with the \nCourt, and we want to give them another chance. We want to give them \nanother chance, hopefully with a better understanding of the impact of \nthe Internet, both positive and negative. And as I said, there is a \ndark side to the Internet, particularly as it relates to children, and \nwe are trying to address that.\n  Now, for several months I have been searching for ways to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. It was introduced and referred to the \nCommerce Committee. It was debated there and passed out of that \ncommittee on a 19 to 1 vote.\n  Some had said, look, the solution to this problem is the software \npackages that are being developed by the industry that parents can buy \nand attach to their computer or integrate into their computer and that \nwill solve the problem and block the images.\n  That is a partial solution to the problem but not a complete solution \nto the problem because the changing technology, the proliferation of \nweb sites is so fast that no software can keep up with it. The \ningenuity of the pornographers, the sellers of pornography is such that \neven the most innocent of words are now linked to a means by which \npornography is pulled up. If you want to find out about Disney World or \nDisney movies or Disney characters, the pornographers have found a way \nto use the term ``Disney'' and click right into pornography. If you \nwant to look up Boy Scouts, horses, dogs, cats, women, men, marriage, \nyou name it, seemingly the most innocent of words, you are now linked \ndirectly to pornography. Why? Because the pornographers have discovered \nthat this software is attempting to block the explicit language and \nthey want to try to find a way in which to commercially entice people \nwho are searching in other areas to be presented with this information \nso they can click into it.\n  So what happened there, then, was Senator McCain's software bill and \nmy Internet pornography bill were both passed out of committee. Senator \nMcCain and I agreed that both are necessary to address the problem and \nthat we would agree to go forward with these together. In recognition \nof the work that needed to be done in the Senate, we wanted to pursue a \nprocess by which we would agree to a time limit. We would agree to \nothers offering any amendments that they thought appropriate. We would \ndebate those, have a vote on those, let Congress express its will and \ngo forward.\n\n  This was not an attempt to tie up the Senate. In fact, we have been \noverly cooperative. I wish we had not been so cooperative. We were \npromised this would come forward. In defense of the majority leader, I \nthink he has made a good-faith effort to try to bring this forward. But \nin each instance other circumstances have arisen, primarily the \ninability to get the consent of some Members of this body to allow us \nto proceed with this bill, debate it, amend it, vote on it, and either \nsend it on or vote it down, whatever was the majority disposition. That \nis what we have been attempting to do.\n  We are frustrated--I am frustrated; I am terribly frustrated--in our \ninability to take something that I think has overwhelming support to at \nleast bring it up and talk about it. It seems that every time we get \nready to go forward with a unanimous consent request to bring the bill \nup, we are notified that someone has put a hold on the bill. We find \nout who that is. We go over and talk to them. We offer them--they say, \nwell, we want to offer an amendment on it. Fine. We will add your \namendment to the unanimous consent agreement. Take whatever time you \nwant on it. We will lock in an amount of time. We will give you a vote. \nWe will eliminate second degrees. We do not want to do anything to \ncause you not to have an up-or-down debate on your amendment. That \nperson agrees.\n  We go back to the majority leader and say we are all clear; we are \nready to go. Whoops, here comes another hold. Somebody else has a \nproblem. We solve that. Now it is a problem on the McCain bill. The \nnext one is a problem on the Coats bill. We solve both of those. The \nnext one is a problem on the McCain bill. We solve that. We think we \nare ready to go. Whoops, another problem on the Coats bill.\n  We are running around putting out fires, and we start to wonder if we \ndon't have some kind of rolling hold process going on here where there \nhas been a decision to block this legislation from coming forward, and \nwe just simply pass on the baton of objection to different people who \nsay; ``Time is on our side. If we delay long enough, we will get into \nthe appropriations process and we will block this and we will get \nthrough the year and we won't have had to deal with it.''\n  I don't want to ascribe that motive to the other side, and that is \nwhy I am making this statement today because I just want to offer to my \nDemocrat colleagues: if you have a problem with this bill, offer your \namendment. I am not here to block your amendment. I am not here to \nblock debate on your amendment. I am not here to block a vote on your \namendment. I am not here to modify your amendment. I am here to simply \nsay let's discuss the issue, debate it, vote on it, and move on.\n  We have spent 4 weeks on the tobacco bill, and I understand, that was \nan important issue and that blocked a lot of other legislation. I \nunderstand that we have appropriations bills backed up, and we need to \nmove forward on those, which is why we are willing to do a limited time \nagreement on this. But we cannot move forward, and are going to be \nforced to have to offer this to appropriations bills in order to get \nthe Senate to consider it--offer it as an amendment, unless we can get \nagreement to bring this up, debate it with a time certain and move on. \nI do not want to do that. I do not want to interfere with Senator \nStevens and the appropriators' efforts to do the business of the \nCongress that needs to be done. I understand things are backed up \nbecause of the tobacco bill. We heard a lot of great speeches in that \ntobacco bill about first amendment rights needing to be waived, why the \nfirst amendment did not apply as it involved advertising on tobacco.\n  But we are not getting that same kind of flexibility and \nunderstanding from some of our colleagues as it applies to pornography. \nI think I would challenge those Members who think\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nthe first amendment is sacrosanct, that we cannot move forward with \nthis, to ask themselves the question: Why is it OK to waive first \namendment rights and not apply the first amendment to those commercial \nentities who are using the symbol of Joe Camel because that is so \ndestructive to the health and welfare of our children, but when it \ncomes to bestiality, when it comes to some of the worst forms of \npornography that is wide open on the worldwide web and available to our \nchildren with the click of a mouse, that, oh, no, the first amendment \nmust apply here? We have to be purists on this?\n  I ask my colleagues to ask themselves as parents, and ask the parents \nthey represent in their States, what those parents think is the higher \npriority issue. If they are given the choice, are they more worried \nabout their children modifying their behavior and taking up smoking \nbecause they see a 5-second image of Joe Camel? Or, are they more \nworried about their children modifying their behavior and responding in \na way because they have been able to view some of the most crass, \nindecent, and, in my opinion, obscene sexual images that we have ever \nseen? I think the resounding response is going to be: Senator, let's do \nfirst things first; let's address the problems that are real problems.\n  So I conclude by pleading with my colleagues to let us resolve \nwhatever problems you have with our going forward with this. We have \nbeen trying to do this. We have hotlined this 2 weeks ago. Both sides \nknow what we are trying to do. If people have a problem, we will \nresolve that problem. But I hope there will not be an objection to \ngoing forward with that today when the majority leader propounds his \nunanimous consent request to allow us to go forward with this bill.\n  If there is an objection--after 2 weeks of hotlines, after 2 weeks of \ngoing to Members saying, ``If you want an amendment, have an amendment, \nbut at least allow us to debate the bill''--I can only conclude there \nis some effort here to prevent us from even talking about it, even \nbringing the bill up. We have an opportunity to avoid all that today \nvery shortly when that unanimous consent request is propounded. I trust \nwe will be able to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, as I said, I was planning to ask \nunanimous consent that we proceed to S. 2137 and outline a series of \namendments that would be in order. We are still working on that \nagreement between the majority leader and the minority leader who, I \nunderstand, are talking on this issue right now.\n  When we do go to that appropriations bill, I will make a point of \nthanking Senator Dorgan for his assistance as the ranking member. Since \nI have been chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee and he has \nbeen my ranking member, we have not had, in my memory, a single point \nof major disagreement. Senator Dorgan has been more than diligent in \nattending all of the meetings of the subcommittee. His staff has been \nvery cooperative with the majority staff in working out the \ndifficulties, and I think it has been the kind of legislative \nrelationship that I looked forward to, when I ran for the Senate, \nbetween members of the different parties.\n  The legislative branch bill will provide $1,585,021,425 in new budget \nauthority, exclusive of the House items for fiscal year 1999. Comity \nbetween the two Houses allows the House to set its amount and the \nSenate to set its amount, without difficulty from each other. This is a \n$53,704,925 increase, or 3.5 percent above the fiscal year 1998 level. \nBut it is $72,359,575 below the amount included in the President's \nbudget. The majority of the increases in the bill are for cost-of-\nliving adjustments, estimated at 3.1 percent.\n  The Senate portion of the bill includes a 1.8 percent increase over \nthe fiscal year 1998 funding, which I think demonstrates some fiscal \nresponsibility on our part. The Library of Congress and the GAO were \nprovided funds for additional FTEs to assist the Congress in the \ninformation technology area, particularly addressing the year 2000 \ncomputer problem.\n  The Presiding Officer and others in the Chamber know I have made this \nsomething of an obsession. The Senate has created a special committee \non the year 2000 technology problem, which I chair. We recognize that \nmost of the expertise to provide the committee with the guidance that \nit needs will come from detailees to the special committee and from \nthose experts in the Library of Congress and the GAO who already have a \nbackground in this area. So, to make sure the year 2000 problem is not \nexacerbated by lack of funds, these additional FTEs were included in \nthis bill. That is part of the 3.5 percent increase over last year's \nlevel.\n  Approximately 21 percent of the Architect's budget is for capital \nprojects; the balance, of course, of 79 percent is for the operating \nstatement.\n  These are the outlines of the overall bill. As far as I know, and \nSenator Dorgan knows, the bill is noncontroversial except for those \namendments that some Senators have indicated they would be willing to \noffer.\n  With that background of the bill that we have in mind, I yield the \nfloor. I understand Senator Brownback will be talking about some of the \namendments that he would offer once the bill does come before us, and \nwe can proceed then in morning business with that matrix. I see the \nSenator from Kentucky. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I ask Senator Brownback how long he \nthinks he will take? We have some Senators with time problems, and I \nwant to try to accommodate them. If I know how long he will be \nspeaking, and others, I can probably accommodate them.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I don't know for certain who all will be interested in \nspeaking on this.\n  Mr. FORD. You are asking for more than 10 minutes. I am wondering how \nlong.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Probably around 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator be willing to say no longer than 30 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Not at this point in time, but I think that will \nprobably----\n  Mr. FORD. If that is the way we are going then, no one else will get \nmore than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nKansas is recognized under the previous order.\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8452-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8452-S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

We recognize that \nmost of the expertise to provide the committee with the guidance that \nit needs will come from detailees to the special committee and from \nthose experts in the Library of Congress and the GAO who already have a \nbackground in this area. So, to make sure the year 2000 problem is not \nexacerbated by lack of funds, these additional FTEs were included in \nthis bill. That is part of the 3.5 percent increase over last year's \nlevel.\n  Approximately 21 percent of the Architect's budget is for capital \nprojects; the balance, of course, of 79 percent is for the operating \nstatement.\n  These are the outlines of the overall bill. As far as I know, and \nSenator Dorgan knows, the bill is noncontroversial except for those \namendments that some Senators have indicated they would be willing to \noffer.\n  With that background of the bill that we have in mind, I yield the \nfloor. I understand Senator Brownback will be talking about some of the \namendments that he would offer once the bill does come before us, and \nwe can proceed then in morning business with that matrix. I see the \nSenator from Kentucky. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I ask Senator Brownback how long he \nthinks he will take? We have some Senators with time problems, and I \nwant to try to accommodate them. If I know how long he will be \nspeaking, and others, I can probably accommodate them.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I don't know for certain who all will be interested in \nspeaking on this.\n  Mr. FORD. You are asking for more than 10 minutes. I am wondering how \nlong.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Probably around 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator be willing to say no longer than 30 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Not at this point in time, but I think that will \nprobably----\n  Mr. FORD. If that is the way we are going then, no one else will get \nmore than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nKansas is recognized under the previous order.\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8452-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8453-S8456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          MARRIAGE PENALTY TAX\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Utah taking the time to explain what we are hoping to go to next, \nthe legislative branch appropriations bill. I hope we can discuss as a \npart of that legislative branch appropriations bill something that \naffects 21 million American families and it increases their taxes an \naverage of $1,400 per family. It was done to them in 1969, the last \nyear that we balanced the budget, until this year, and we have the \nability to deal with it now. That is a thing called the marriage \npenalty, the marriage penalty tax.\n  I don't know how much of the American public is aware of this tax, \nbut in 1969, there was placed a tax, actually a change in the Tax Code \nto a point that married couples were taxed more for being married than \nif they were single. It amounts, on average, to $1,400 per family. It \naffects around 21 million American families, and it is wrong.\n  It is the wrong kind of tax. It is the wrong kind of notion. It is \ntelling people, in the Tax Code, that we are going to penalize you for \nbeing married. This is a wrong idea when we are struggling so much in \nAmerica today with the maintenance of families, with trying to keep \nfamilies together, when we are trying to say that the foundational \nunits of a civil society is the American family, and then we are \nsaying, ``Well, yeah, but we're going to tax you.'' We send by that \nsignal that we think less of married families.\n  It is time that we go back and do what we did prior to 1969, and that \nis not tax married couples more than if they were just single people \nliving together. We were, up until 1969, operating that way, and then \nin that year, in an attempt to get more revenues into the Federal \nGovernment, we put this tax in place, taxing married couples. It is \nwrong. It is the wrong idea. It is the wrong signal.\n  It is something that we have the ability to deal with now. The \nCongressional Budget Office this week stated that over the next 5 \nyears, we will have $520 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years--\n$520 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years, a half a trillion \ndollars. I just say to my colleagues, my goodness, if we have that \nresource there, we have families struggling so much, if the \nfoundational unit of a civil society is the family and we are taxing \nthat family more, let's give them a little break.\n  This is the right vehicle on which to do it. We are talking about \nfunding the legislative shop here, let's help fund the families a \nlittle bit. We have the ability to do it, and it will send the right \nsignal. It will send a good signal. It is the time we can send a \nsignal, and we ought to do it, and we ought to do it now.\n  That is what we were hoping to propose on the legislative branch \nappropriations bill, to deal with the elimination of the marriage tax \npenalty for the working families. This hits mostly families between a \ncombined income of $20,000 per year to $75,000 per year. That is the \ncategory of families that is hit by this marriage tax penalty.\n  The amendment that I was going to propose and was sponsored by \nSenator Ashcroft and a number of others--Senator Inhofe, Senator Smith, \nand I think a lot of my colleagues would join on this amendment--the \namendment I was going to put forward does a very simple thing: It just \nmakes the standard deduction the same for married couples as it is for \nsingles.\n  I don't know how many people recognize this, but currently, if you \nfile single, under the Tax Code, the standard deduction is $4,150, \nwhile the marriage standard deduction is only $6,900. Our amendment \nwould simply raise the standard deduction for all married couples to \n$8,300, precisely double what it currently is for single people, so you \ndon't have this penalty built into the system, so you don't have this \nsignal to the American public that we devalue this institution of \nmarriage. In 1969, and prior to that period of time, we said you get \nthe same if you are married, and then after 1969, we said you don't.\n\n  I guess there were a number of reasons this was put into effect in \n1969. People were saying, ``Well, if you are single versus if you are a \ncouple, you have living expenses that are a little less.'' If there are \ntwo singles versus two people living together in the same place--there \nare a number, I suppose, of different reasons, but I guess actually at \nthe end of the day, the reason was to get more tax money out of \npeople's pockets. It was done then, and now we are saying let's correct \nthis wrong.\n  When you ask the American public about this issue--and I raise it \nquite a bit with people--they think this is a ridiculous tax. We \nshouldn't be taxing couples more than we tax singles who live together. \nIt just sends a signal that this is not the sort of thing we want to \ntake place today, particularly when you look at what happens to our \nfamilies across America.\n  I don't think I need to remind many people about the problems we are \nhaving with marriage and with families in this country today. We are \nhaving at any one time nearly 50 percent of our children living in a \nsingle-headed household, and many of these families struggling \nheroically to raise a family, but yet we are sending a signal against \nthe family at the same time we do that.\n  We are also sending it to some of the hardest hit families who \nstruggle the most in the economy today. This tax applies heaviest to \nfamilies with incomes of between $20,000 a year and $75,000 a year. \nThis is a good bracket of folks we are taxing more heavily, and we \nshouldn't be taxing them more heavily at this point in time.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to some of the reports that have \nbeen put out on this issue as well. The Congressional Budget Office did \na report about a year ago on this particular issue. They state in their \nreport:\n\n       Federal income tax laws generally require that a married \n     couple file a joint tax return based on the combined income \n     of the husband and wife. As a result, husbands and wives with \n     similar incomes usually incur a larger combined tax liability \n     than they would if they could file individually.\n\n  This is the opening statement of the CBO.\n  I ask all of my colleagues, How many of you agree with that tax \npolicy? That is something that the Congress put in place. How many \npeople actually agree with that tax policy? I don't know that there \nwould be anybody who would actually agree with that tax policy, yet it \nis in place and we have the time, we have the wherewithal, we have the \nvehicle here funding the legislative branch that we can do this and \nfund this now. I think it is appropriate that we should do that and \ntake care of something that in 1969--relatively recently--was put in \nplace.\n  I draw my colleagues' attention to some editorials that have been \nwritten on this particular subject. The Indianapolis Star talks about \nthe marriage penalty and that this is something from which we should \nget away. They have even a pretty nice cartoon about a couple and a car \nwho are just married, and they are hooked to this big anchor, a \nmarriage tax penalty, pulling them back the other way.\n  Is that the sort of signal we want to send from Congress toward the \ninstitution of marriage? I don't think it is.\n  The Christian Science Monitor: ``Bid to Make Tax Policy Friendlier to \nMarriage.'' They are saying, ``Look, this is something we ought to \ndo.''\n  We have a number of editorials where this was raised across the \ncountry.\n  We are just dealing with one aspect of this. In fact, according to \nthe Joint Economic Committee, in a study on the marriage penalty, the \nTax Code contains 66 provisions that can affect a married couple's tax \nliability. So it is a number of places. We are just getting at one \nparticular feature of it which is that standard deduction. I think \nthere are places we ought to look at overall in doing more in this \narea. That is the sort of thing that we want to take up--this \nridiculous tax--that we want to put forward.\n  I am hopeful that, with the manager of the bill who has been \nagreeable to this, we can get the Democrat ranking member to agree that \nwe could bring up this ridiculous tax, and that he would consent to us \nhaving a debate, a vote on this particular issue, so we can say to the \nAmerican public, this is something that is pretty important, and we can \ndo this now, particularly since the CBO said we have the wherewithal to \nget this done.\n  So I plead with my Democrat colleagues, let us bring this up. A \nmarriage tax penalty is something important----\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I can regain the floor, yes.\n  Mr. FORD. We do have a marriage bonus that is now for the upper \nincome. The marriage bonus, you know, is quite lucrative. I have a bill \nto eliminate the marriage penalty also. So I am basically agreeing with \nwhat you are trying to do. But when I started developing this, I found \nout we had a marriage bonus. If we eliminate the marriage bonus, \neliminate the marriage penalty, we will come out with a surplus of \nabout $4 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Is the Senator willing to do something along that line?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am not interested in raising taxes at the point in \ntime of the American public is----\n  Mr. FORD. We are not raising taxes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It would be raising taxes on a certain group of \npeople. If you are saying, let us do away with this particular bonus, I \ndo not have any problem giving bonuses to people who are married. I \nthink this is a good institution that we ought to be supporting. I am \nnot interested in raising taxes on anybody, particularly people who are \nmarried.\n  I think that is not the way we ought to be going, particularly with \nthe kind of money that we have flowing into the Treasury, and \nparticularly with the American public being taxed at roughly 40 percent \nof their income annually. They are taxed to the max. And then we add on \ntop of that--to working families--the marriage penalty. The tax repeal \nI am talking about applies to families that make a combined income \nbetween $20,000 a year and $75,000 a year. And that is the one that I \nwant to pull off. And I hope that----\n  Mr. FORD. I understand where the Senator is coming from. I also agree \nbecause I have a similar bill. It is at the table. But it seems like, \nto me, that we want to be fair to everyone. If you are going to be fair \nto everyone, you ought to be paying about the same. The bonus is nice \nto have, I understand. But some are eligible over the $75,000 for a \nbonus. We ought to be trying to help those under $75,000. I think we \ncould equalize the tax situation, do both of the things that you and I \nwould like to do.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would be agreeable to my colleague bringing his bill \nup on this bill if it will allow us to bring this one up on this bill. \nI would be agreeable to him putting that forward. That would be fine \nwith me. I will not be voting with you on it because I just am not \ninterested in taxing marriages more. But I would----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand it is: ``My way or nothing.'' \nProbably what we get is nothing.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am just saying, if you want to bring your bill up, I \nwould be happy to see that particular one brought up on this vehicle, \nas well dealing with the institution of marriage, I think, is an \nimportant thing to be able to do.\n  My colleague from Missouri wanted to address this topic, too. I would \nbe willing to yield to my colleague from Missouri if he desires to talk \non this particular topic--or he may want to wait until another time.\n  I point out, we have support from a number of groups that are \ninterested in this moving on forward.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator from Kansas yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Senator from Kansas agree that a marriage \npenalty not only would provide a disincentive for people to get \nmarried, but it might, as a matter of fact, provide an incentive for \nsome people who are married to get a divorce?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is strange, but actually if you look at our tax \npolicy, people would be paid to be able to--if they do get a divorce \nand live separately, they would actually have more money coming to them \nand less going to the Federal Treasury, which is an extraordinary, \nridiculous notion that is built into the Tax Code.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is the Senator from Kansas aware of the fact that that \nhas actually happened? There are a number of couples that decided to \nget a divorce so that in the eyes of the law they are divorced so that \nthey could get this subsidy for divorce from the Federal Government?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate the question the Senator is asking. I am \ntold also there is a married couple, they are economists at one of the \nuniversities in the country, who each year divorce at the end of the \nyear and get married the next day. Then they have kind of a party with \nthe money that they earned and keep by going through this process of \ndivorcing on December 30, or 31 and marrying again on January 1st or \n2nd. They have kind of a honeymoon each year off of this signal that \nthey are able to read from the Federal Government. And the thing about \nit, I do not want to suggest that more people do that. I think that \nwould be a wrong notion. But still it is----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Senator agree our tax laws literally are \nsuggesting that people get divorced and remarried and then fritter away \nor otherwise use the proceeds of this anomalous provision in the code?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is actually what happens and takes place, which \nis--just think about it. That is the signal that we are sending to the \nAmerican public, that they actually are encouraged to do something like \nthis by the tax policy of the U.S. Congress? That is an incredible \nthing.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Senator from Kansas agree that when the \nSenator from Kentucky talks about a bonus, he is talking about a \nsituation where one of the two marriage partners is not employed \noutside the home; and really what the tax law does is allow, in some \nrespect, part of the income to be assigned to that partner, some of the \ncost be assigned to that partner, and for that reason there is a \ntheoretical bonus? But would the Senator agree it is important to \nunderstand that in marriage that there are a lot of respects in which \nit is appropriate that the ``nonemployed spouse'' be understood as \nhaving contributed substantially to the proceeds of the family that \nresult from the employed spouse's earnings?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Absolutely. I could not agree more with the notion \nthat there are things that ought to be taken into consideration here. \nAnd the notion of a bonus in marriages is not an accurate notion here. \nI was willing to let my colleague from Kentucky go ahead and raise his \namendment on this particular bill, if he would desire to, if he would \nlet us be able to put this amendment forward and have a discussion, if \nhe wants to try to refute that sort of argument taking place. But I do \nnot think that we should be in the business, even if there is such a \nthing as a bonus, of removing that on married couples.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Now, this week the Congressional Budget Office has \nforecast a surplus over the next 5 years. And that surplus has really \nbeen growing dramatically. It started out about 4 or 5 months ago that \nthey said it might be $140-some billion. Now they have taken the \nsurplus projection to--how much over the next 5 years?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. CBO has taken their budget projections now to $520 \nbillion over the next 5 years, over half a trillion dollars in budget \nsurplus.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So that is money that is supposed to be in excess of \nwhat we would otherwise budget?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That money is indexed as to what we would actually \nalready have budgeted. I point out to my colleague from Missouri, not \nonly is that in excess of it, but we found a way to cut the taxes while \nwe were in deficit. Now we are running a surplus, and we are saying, \nCan't we find a little way here to be able to cut taxes on hard-working \nmarried couples in America?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask you--we have $520 billion in surplus--how much of \nthe surplus would it take in order to eliminate the marriage penalty?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. In order to be able to eliminate the marriage penalty, \nthere are different ways people have configured and looked at this \nissue. The bill we are putting forward has a $151 billion price tag \nover 5 years. So you are not even talking about dealing with the entire \nsurplus with this marriage tax penalty.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Less than one-third.\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Less than one-third.\n  Out of every $5 surplus you have, $1.50 is going back to married \nfamilies. Does that make any rational sense here, that we are getting \n$5 in and saying, OK, $1.50 is back. I think we ought to be doing far \nmore. This ought to start the overall situation, but we are looking at \nleast a start here.\n  This is the sort of thing we need to do. We need to move. You ought \nto see the groups supporting this. The National Taxpayers Union, with \n300,000 members, strongly supports the Marriage Tax Elimination Act. \nThe Marriage Tax Elimination Act would address that and dramatically \nwiden the scope of tax relief.\n  This is a broad tax relief issue--21 million families, not just \nindividuals, 21 million families, in America pay this tax penalty. \nCurrently, laws force many married Americans to pay a higher tax bill \nthan they would if they remained single and had the same combined \nincome. Such a double standard is wholly at odds with the American \nideal that taxes should not be a primary consideration in any \nindividual's economic or social choices. I want to underline ``social \nchoices'' because we have social problems in this country. We have \nsocial maladies in this country.\n  I held a forum with Joe Lieberman last week about the overall issue \nof violence and teen violence taking place, and everyone there----\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. From the left, from the right--I want to go ahead and \nfinish this point, if I could--from the left and from the right. We had \na former Black Panther there, a former Clinton administration official \nsaying the real problem we have here is we have a breakdown in the \nfamilies taking place. We have too little density of responsible adults \nper children. We are saying send a signal that does not decrease the \ndensity of adults per child. I think that is a responsible social \npolicy instead of a social choice here that is actually contrary to the \nissue.\n  Americans for Tax Reform support the Marriage Tax Elimination Act, \noffered in the House by Representatives Weller! and McIntosh. ``We \nbelieve that married working couples deserve the same treatment as \nsingles.'' That is their statement.\n  Now, isn't that pretty clear? Now is the perfect time for action \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office is anticipating an earlier-\nthan-expected fiscal surplus. This is Americans for Tax Reform saying \nthat this is a good way to go. For many Americans, the average marriage \ntax is approximately equal in value to half a year of car payments. \nHalf a year of car payments we are talking about. With an extra $1,400 \na year, a couple might be able to send a child to the school of their \nchoice. The bottom line is, according to the Americans for Tax Reform, \na marriage tax is very real to many working couples in this country.\n  I ask people who are watching this, if you would look and figure up \nyour own tax and see how many of you are paying a marriage tax penalty \nfor being married.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I can retain the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada would like to inquire of the \nSenator from Kansas, the Senator from Nevada has a bill he would like \nto introduce. It would take 7 or 8 minutes. Is it possible to work out \nsome kind of time arrangement to do so? The Senator from Nevada also \nhas a flight at 12:45 he would like to make. I am prepared to enter \ninto a unanimous consent if my colleagues agree the floor would be \nimmediately reclaimed by the Senator from Kansas. I am not trying to \ncut him off, but I do have a time constraint that poses some \nlimitations upon the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am happy, if I retain the floor after \nthe 7 minutes or the 8 minutes, to yield with that understanding.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will propound a unanimous consent, if that is agreeable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to have 8 minutes with the \nunderstanding the floor would be retained by the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Nevada?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his consideration.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bryan pertaining to the introduction of S. 2326 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I was glad to accommodate the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I have had similar situations come up. I understand the \nSenator from New York may have a similar time situation, and I would be \nwilling to accommodate him, with a unanimous consent to obtain the \nfloor after the Senator from New York is finished. He had previously \nbeen willing to yield the floor to some other individuals.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork, with the understanding that I retain the floor after that 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \ninquire of the Senator from Kansas. I understand we are in morning \nbusiness. I don't object and would not object to the Senator taking \nsubstantial time in morning business. As I understand it, we are \nallowed 10 minutes, but the Senator has, by unanimous consent, received \npermission to speak for as long as he chooses. Normally, in morning \nbusiness when Senators want to speak, we can increase that time of 10 \nminutes.\n  In this circumstance, we were about prepared to go to the legislative \nbranch appropriations bill. Senator Bennett from Utah made an opening \nstatement in morning business. I am the ranking member on that \nsubcommittee and I was prepared to make an opening statement. I guess I \nwould like to get some notion of how long the Senator from Kansas \nintends to retain the floor in morning business before I agree to other \nsets of circumstances, so I can try to gauge the time and understand \nwhat might transpire on the floor of the Senate. So reserving the right \nto object, I inquire of the Senator from Kansas as to what are his \nintentions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator. As I understand it, negotiations \nare going on now as to whether or not we will be able to bring up this \nparticular elimination of the marriage tax penalty. We are trying to \nget agreement with your side of the aisle on whether or not that would \nbe allowed to be brought up in the legislative branch appropriations \nbill. That is my desire. If we get that worked out, I will be yielding \nrapidly so that you can go forward with your items. If that is not \ngetting worked out, I am going to talk about this for awhile, because \nit is an important issue.\n  The Legislative Calendar is short. We have spent a lot of time \ntalking about the tobacco settlement--a month. We have spent a lot of \ntime talking about things that don't as directly affect the American \nfamily as the marriage tax penalty does, on 21 million American \nfamilies. So I think it is time that we start talking about something \nthat gets to North Dakota families and others directly. That is why I \nam willing to do this and to tie things up until we get moving forward \non some of that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas certainly has that \nright. In fact, when the bill is brought to the floor--the bill is not \nyet technically on the floor, the legislative appropriations bill--when \nthe bill is brought to the floor, the Senator certainly has a right to \noffer any amendments. Nothing will prevent the Senator from his right \nto offer an amendment.\n  I guess the issue is whether the Senator can offer his amendment, but \nother people are prevented from offering theirs. Maybe it will be \nworked out, but my expectation is that it won't get worked out. You \nused the term ``tie up'' the floor. I would really prefer that you not \ndo that in morning business. I prefer that you find a way to do that \nthe minute the bill is on the floor, if you so choose. But tying up the \nfloor in morning business simply inconveniences others who would like \nto do some work here.\n  I am sympathetic to the notion that there is a marriage penalty. I \nguess I am standing here, however, with the Senate in morning business, \nhoping that perhaps the Senator might allow the Senator from New York \nto proceed, and then allow me to proceed, and others who might want to \nproceed, and then it doesn't matter whether somebody talks until Sunday \nnoon. I would\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\nlike, in the morning business segment, or perhaps the opening segment \nof the appropriations bill, to be able to dispatch that business and \nlet whoever wants to talk, do it until they are exhausted.\n  You are speaking of a subject of some importance, I admit that. I am \nsympathetic to the issue you are raising. I hope that you perhaps would \nallow us to do the things we would like to do in preparation to get the \nbill to the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, retaining the floor, I am going to \nproceed on forward with a discussion of the marriage tax penalty. I \nwithdraw my unanimous consent request if it is not going to be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I was proceeding earlier, before allowing the Senator \nfrom Nevada to speak before catching a plane.\n  A number of groups have taken notice of this issue of a marriage tax \npenalty and think that it is clearly time and it is important that we \nat this time address this particular issue.\n  The Independent Women's Forum has sent a letter urging Congress to \n``put the Tax Code where its rhetoric is.''\n  I think that is a real interesting way they state that in the letter. \n``We should put the Tax Code where the Congress' rhetoric is.'' We talk \na lot about families, values, and virtues, and those sorts of \ninstitutions that make for a civil society. We talk endlessly about \nthose things. Yet, then we tax them; we tax them disproportionately. \nThis group has the courage to be able to identify, well, I guess then \nyou guys really don't mean it. You will say one thing and do another.\n  The Independent Women's Forum urges Congress to put the Tax Code \nwhere its rhetoric is and eliminate marriage penalties. Serious steps \nto reform tax laws would mean real liberation to those who work and \nthose who may have to in the future. Marriage taxes can impose a nearly \n50-percent marginal tax rate on second earners.\n  They are saying in their publication, most of which are spouses, \nobviously, this is a State-sponsored discrimination, the unintended \nconsequence of which is to discourage--they are saying here--women from \nentering the labor force.\n  ``If Congress is sincere in improving the lives of American families, \nit will eliminate tax loopholes that choke paychecks. Real support for \nthe family begins with tax reform.''\n  There is a strong letter that they are citing that we ought to change \nour Tax Code along that line.\n  Let's look at the Catholic Alliance, and what they say.\n\n       The Catholic Alliance Endorses the Marriage Tax Elimination \n     Act.\n\n  Their president announces support for the Marriage Tax Elimination \nAct and the end of the marriage tax penalty. They say this:\n\n       Catholic Alliance promotes the primacy of the family as a \n     matter of public policy. We support the Marriage Tax \n     Elimination Act as one step in the right direction. The \n     current tax code, while it still exists, should be used as a \n     vehicle to promote social responsibility. It certainly should \n     not be used in a punitive manner toward the preeminent \n     institution of marriage and family.\n\n  How better could you describe it than that? ``It certainly should not \nbe used in a punitive manner toward the preeminent institution of \nmarriage and family.''\n  They go on to state:\n\n       We welcome the Marriage Tax Elimination Act introduced \n     today by representatives Dave McIntosh and Jerry Weller. This \n     bill can be a first step in recognizing in law that the \n     family is the first church, the first school, the first \n     government, the first hospital, the first economy, and the \n     first and most vital mediating institution in our culture. In \n     order to encourage stable two-parent marriage bound \n     households we can no longer support a tax code that penalizes \n     them,'' Fournier said.\n\n  Then this is what Pope John Paul II said in a letter in a publication \ncalled ``Christian Family in the Modern World.'' The Pope says this:\n\n       . . . families should grow in awareness of being \n     ``protagonists'' of what is known as ``family politics'' and \n     assume responsibility for transforming society; otherwise \n     families will be the first victims of the evils that they \n     have done no more than note with indifference.\n\n  There are some pretty strong terms that they noted.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will yield for a \nsuggestion that I would propound a unanimous consent. I have \nlegislation that I know the Senator from Kansas is supportive of, and \nwe want the Senate to be supportive. It would take me no more than 5 \nminutes to ask that it be brought up under a unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  I will speak for no more than 10 minutes, and probably less, because \nI have had an opportunity to make my views known; then, further, that \nthe ranking member, Senator Dorgan, on the legislative appropriations, \nbe given up to 15 minutes so that he might make his opening remarks on \nthe legislative appropriations. That would be no longer than 25 \nminutes, and thereafter the Senator would retain the floor and the \nfloor would return to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, if at that point in \ntime I would be able to retain the floor, I am willing to agree.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That would be the agreement.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I can then continue with my statement and have it \nappear continuously in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my colleague from Kansas for being gracious, and \nSenator Dorgan, the ranking member, for his suggestion so we can \naccommodate the needs of our colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8453-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8456-S8458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CULPABILITY OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC FOR \n                               WAR CRIMES\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I believe we are about to take historic \naction that is so important, because, to date, what we have been doing \nis pleading, negotiating, hoping while the world burns in front of us. \nWhen I say ``the world,'' I am talking of technically the people in \nthis war-torn area of Kosovo.\n  It is incredible that 90 percent of the population there are ethnic \nAlbanians under withering attack. In today's New York Times, it \ngraphically speaks about it on the front page.\n  As a witness to this, a former paramilitary, former police officer in \nthe Serbian police, said he can no longer stay there and work there as \nhe watched innocent women and children being raped, killed, tortured \nand savaged--3 million people on the move, ethnic cleansing, moving \nthem out of their homes, moving them out of their communities all \nbecause of one thing--all because of their ethnicity.\n  What we do today is the least we should be doing; and that is calling \nfor the United States to, yes, utilize the provisions that the United \nNations set up in terms of Security Council Resolution 827 creating the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal.\n  This man can and should be charged as the war crime criminal that he \nis. The documentation has already been chronicled in one of the best \nreports, which I have submitted to this body. The conclusions are \ninescapable. It is called ``War Crimes and the Issue of \nResponsibility,'' prepared by Norman Cigar and Paul Williams. It \ndocuments the systematic slaughter and use of paramilitary groups \nagainst innocent civilians. There is no doubt that not only did he know \nabout that but that he continues to perpetuate this kind of conduct.\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\n  To summarize briefly what Resolution 105 does, it says that we, the \nUnited States, should publicly declare its considered reasons to \nbelieve that Milosevic has committed war crimes; that we make the \nchecks of information that can be supplied to the Tribunal as evidence \nto support an indictment and trial of Milosevic for war crimes against \nhumanity and genocide; that we should undertake it as a high priority; \nall of the information that we collect should be provided to the \nTribunal as soon as possible; and, thereafter, that we coordinate our \nactivities with our allies, members of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization and others interested in a matter of discussion of what we \ncan and should be doing to apprehend this war criminal and others.\n  Yes. Mr. President, the time has come to gather the evidence and to \nsubmit it to the Tribunal, and to see to it that this man is branded as \nthe war criminal that he is instead of us all sitting back silently as \ninnocent lives continue to be taken.\n  Mr. President, I thank all of the Members of the U.S. Senate for the \nrelatively short period of time Senator Lieberman and I began this \neffort in terms of gathering cosponsors and support several days ago.\n  It makes me proud to be a Member of this body, for people to come \ntogether in this way to see, yes, the indictment of this war criminal. \nAnd he is one of the most evil men of our period of time. Make no \nmistake about it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today as a co-sponsor in support \nof S. Con. Res. 105, which expresses the sense of the Congress \nregarding the culpability of Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes, crimes \nagainst humanity, and genocide in the former Yugoslavia.\n  Yugoslav President Milosevic is the walking definition of an \nunscrupulous politician. I have come to understand the stark truth that \nthe only thing that matters to Milosevic is his own political survival. \nThe only thing.\n  Since his rise to power in Serbia in the late 1980's, he has been a \nfailure at everything he has attempted--except, I regret to say, in \nstaying in power.\n  Slobodan Milosevic has been an unmitigated disaster for the Serbian \npeople.\n  As a result of his insane attempt at creating a ``Greater Serbia,'' \nthe centuries-old Serbian culture in the Krajina and Western Slavonia \nin Croatia has been extinguished, the Bosnian Serb community has been \ndecimated and impoverished, and Serbian life in Kosovo seems on the \nverge of eradication.\n  Of course, that is only half of the story, for Slobodan Milosevic has \nalso been a curse for many of the neighboring peoples of the Serbs. His \nvile ``ethnic cleansing'' led to a quarter-million deaths and more than \ntwo million refugees and displaced persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nBosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats, and Croats in Croatia were brutalized \nand murdered.\n  Most recently, Milosevic's special police storm troopers have moved \ntheir grisly activities to Kosovo where they are visiting upon the \nethnic Albanian population the same horrors suffered by the Bosnians \nand Croats.\n  I would like to add a personal note. I believe that I am one of only \na very few Senators who have met Milosevic, and I am certain that I am \nthe only one who ever called him a war criminal to his face.\n  In April 1993, on the first of my many trips to Bosnia, I also \nstopped off in Belgrade to see Milosevic. In the course of a lengthy \nmeeting that went on late into the evening, I went through the entire \nlitany of the horrors that his Serbian troops had perpetrated and were \ncontinuing to perpetrate. Of course, Milosevic protested that he had no \ncontrol over any of this.\n  Nonetheless, he later asked if I wanted to meet Radovan Karadzic, the \nBosnian Serb leader who has subsequently been indicted as a war \ncriminal. I said yes, and twenty minutes later Karadzic came running up \nthe steps of Milosevic's palace, totally out of breath. Rather \ninteresting for a guy who supposedly had no influence in Bosnia!\n  After all this, Milosevic looked across the table and asked, ``What \ndo you think of me?''\n  I answered, ``I think you're a damn war criminal!''\n  Milosevic's reaction was like water off a duck's back. He just \nresumed talking as if nothing had happened. He might as well have said, \n``lots of luck in your sophomore year!'' This is one brazen guy.\n  Mr. President, I said earlier that the only thing Milosevic cares \nabout is his political survival. I believe that for the first time \nthere is a reasonable chance that he may be failing in this arena too.\n  In the person of Milo Djukanovic, the dynamic, young reformist \nPresident of Montenegro, the junior partner of Serbia in the Yugoslav \nFederation, the democratic opposition to Milosevic has both a new \nleader and a constitutional means of expressing its opposition. We must \ncontinue to support Djukanovic and Montenegro in their struggle.\n  In the meantime, as S. Con. Res. 105 urges, the international \ncommunity should speedily bring Milosevic to trial before the \nInternational Tribunal in the Hague for his criminal behavior.\n  There is no possibility for lasting peace in the Balkans until Serbia \nhas a democratic government, willing to live in peace and equality with \nits non-Serb citizens and non-Serb neighbors. Removing Milosevic from \npower is the sine qua non for this to happen, and S. Con. Res. 105 \ncharts the path.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments at the \ndesk, the resolution, and the preamble be agreed to, that the \nresolution, as amended, be agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, \nas amended, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution appear at this point \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Numbered 3212 and 3213, En Bloc\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York (Mr. D'Amato) proposes amendments \n     numbered 3212 and 3213, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 3212 and 3213) en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3212\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)\n\n       On page 3, line 4, strike ``probable cause'' and insert \n     ``reason''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3213\n\n       On page 5, strike lines 24 through page 6 line 5.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 3212 and 3213) were agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (S.

Res. 105\n\n       Whereas there is reason to mark the beginning of the \n     conflict in the former Yugoslavia with Slobodan Milosevic's \n     rise to power beginning in 1987, when he whipped up and \n     exploited extreme nationalism among Serbs, and specifically \n     in Kosovo, including support for violence against non-Serbs \n     who were labeled as threats;\n       Whereas there is reason to believe that as President of \n     Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic was responsible for the conception \n     and direction of a war of aggression, the deaths of hundreds \n     of thousands, the torture and rape of tens of thousands and \n     the forced displacement of nearly 3,000,000 people, and that \n     mass rape and forced impregnation were among the tools used \n     to wage this war;\n       Whereas ``ethnic cleansing'' has been carried out in the \n     former Yugoslavia in such a consistent and systematic way \n     that it had to be directed by the senior political leadership \n     in Serbia, and Slobodan Milosevic has held such power within \n     Serbia that he is responsible for the conception and \n     direction of this policy;\n       Whereas, as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     (Serbia and Montenegro), Slobodan Milosevic is responsible \n     for the conception and direction of assaults by Yugoslavian \n     and Serbian military, security, special police, and other \n     forces on innocent civilians in Kosovo which have so far \n     resulted in an estimated 300 people dead or missing and the \n     forced displacement of tens of thousands, and such assaults \n     continue;\n       Whereas on May 25, 1993, United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 827 created the International Criminal Tribunal \n     for the former Yugoslavia located in The Hague, the \n     Netherlands (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Tribunal''), and gave it jurisdiction over all crimes \n     arising out of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas this Tribunal has publicly indicted 60 people for \n     war crimes or crimes against humanity arising out of the \n     conflict in the former Yugoslavia and has issued a number of \n     secret indictments that have only been made public upon the \n     apprehension of the indicted persons;\n       Whereas it is incumbent upon the United States and all \n     other nations to support the\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\n     Tribunal, and the United States has done so by providing, \n     since 1992, funding in the amount of $54,000,000 in assessed \n     payments and more than $11,000,000 in voluntary and in-kind \n     contributions to the Tribunal and the War Crimes Commission \n     which preceded it, and by supplying information collected by \n     the United States that can aid the Tribunal's investigations, \n     prosecutions, and adjudications;\n       Whereas any lasting, peaceful solution to the conflict in \n     the former Yugoslavia must be based upon justice for all, \n     including the most senior officials of the government or \n     governments responsible for conceiving, organizing, \n     initiating, directing, and sustaining the Yugoslav conflict \n     and whose forces have committed war crimes, crimes against \n     humanity and genocide; and\n       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic has been the single person who \n     has been in the highest government offices in an aggressor \n     state since before the inception of the conflict in the \n     former Yugoslavia, who has had the power to decide for peace \n     and instead decided for war, who has had the power to \n     minimize illegal actions by subordinates and allies and hold \n     responsible those who committed such actions, but did not, \n     and who is once again directing a campaign of ethnic \n     cleansing against innocent civilians in Kosovo while treating \n     with contempt international efforts to achieve a fair and \n     peaceful settlement to the question of the future status of \n     Kosovo: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should publicly declare that it \n     considers that there is reason to believe that Slobodan \n     Milosevic, President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     (Serbia and Montenegro), has committed war crimes, crimes \n     against humanity and genocide;\n       (2) the United States should make collection of information \n     that can be supplied to the Tribunal for use as evidence to \n     support an indictment and trial of President Slobodan \n     Milosevic for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \n     genocide a high priority;\n       (3) any such information concerning President Slobodan \n     Milosevic already collected by the United States should be \n     provided to the Tribunal as soon as possible;\n       (4) the United States should provide a fair share of any \n     additional financial or personnel resources that may be \n     required by the Tribunal in order to enable the Tribunal to \n     adequately address preparation for, indictment of, \n     prosecution of, and adjudication of allegations of war crimes \n     and crimes against humanity posed against President Slobodan \n     Milosevic and any other person arising from the conflict in \n     the former Yugoslavia, including in Kosovo;\n       (5) the United States should engage with other members of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other interested \n     states in a discussion of information any such state may hold \n     relating to allegations of war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity posed against President Slobodan Milosevic and any \n     other person arising from the conflict in the former \n     Yugoslavia, including in Kosovo, and press such states to \n     promptly provide all such information to the Tribunal;\n       (6) the United States should engage with other members of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other interested \n     states in a discussion of measures to be taken to apprehend \n     indicted war criminals and persons indicted for crimes \n     against humanity with the objective of concluding a plan of \n     action that will result in these indictees' prompt delivery \n     into the custody of the Tribunal; and\n       (7) the United States should urge the Tribunal to promptly \n     review all information relating to President Slobodan \n     Milosevic's possible criminal culpability for conceiving, \n     directing, and sustaining a variety of actions in the former \n     Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, that have had the effect of \n     genocide, of other crimes against humanity, or of war crimes, \n     with a view toward prompt issuance of a public indictment of \n     Milosevic.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank this body and thank all of my \ncolleagues for their support of what I consider to be a very important \ninitiative. I certainly hope that the House acts quickly on this. I \nbelieve this is the least that we can and should do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8456-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8458-S8459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are at some time going to take up the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill formally. I wanted to make a \ncouple of comments in response to the comments made by the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch.\n  Senator Bennett spoke about this work of the subcommittee. I have \nsaid before and I will say again I think he is an awfully good \nlegislator. I appreciate very much the opportunity to work with him. We \nhave worked in a cooperative spirit, in a bipartisan way, and have \nbrought to the floor of the Senate a bill that I think reflects the \nright priorities and the prudent expenditure of the taxpayers' money \nfor the things that are important and necessary.\n  I especially wish to commend Senator Bennett. For those who don't \nknow about his work on what is called Y2K or the year 2000 problem, I \nmust say, having sat through all of the hearings we held, in every \ninstance with every agency and every department, Senator Bennett has \nbeen very determined to make certain that we are on the road to \naddressing the problems that confront us with the turn of the century \nand the programming and the computer software that exists around our \ncountry, and he has, of course, since been named chairman of a panel on \nthis issue. A lot of people don't think too much about it because it is \na year and a half away, but it is a very important issue. Senator \nBennett has been a leader on that issue, and I think the Senate owes \nhim a debt of gratitude.\n  Let me just for a moment mention a couple of items in the \nappropriations bill itself. We have in this legislation provided for a \nTrade Deficit Review Commission. With the announcement once again today \nthat the trade deficit hit another record high, and the trade deficit \ncontinues to swell and balloon on us, I think it is important for our \ncountry to do a comprehensive review of what is happening and what is \ncausing it, and what are the range of things we might do to address it.\n  On this issue, we have worked, in consultation with the Senate \nFinance Committee, to make some changes that would be satisfactory to \nthem. These changes will be reflected in the managers' amendment, and I \nthink this process of constructing this recommendation has been a very \nuseful process. It has been a collaborative effort with the folks in \nSenate Finance and others.\n  As to this Trade Deficit Review Commission, the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Senator Stevens, has been a very strong supporter and a \ncosponsor; the ranking member, Senator Byrd, from West Virginia, a \ncosponsor and a very strong supporter as well. I think, especially \ngiven the news once again today, it is timely and important, and I \nappreciate, again, the cooperation of the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  I want to mention the General Accounting Office which is funded in \nthis bill. The GAO, which most people know it by, normally shows up in \nstories around the country that are written about the investigations \nthey do. The GAO does first-rate investigative work. It is the \ninvestigative arm of Congress. It is not partisan, has never been \npartisan. It is a group of dedicated professionals who, at the \ndirection of Congress, review and study, investigate, and evaluate a \nmyriad of things we ask them to do about how the money that Congress \nappropriates is being spent.\n  The GAO is a very, very important organization. We have cut the GAO \nsubstantially over a number of years and now we have tried to stabilize \nit with the right kind of investments. It is a smaller organization \nthan it was, but it is a strong and assertive organization that does \nwonderful work for Congress.\n  I am pleased that the recommendation we have in this particular \nappropriations bill reaches the level, albeit a much lower level of \nstaffing at the GAO than had been there previously, a level which I \nthink will give it the strength to do the job we expect them to do and \nthe American people expect them to do. Anyone who has read their \nreports, read the news reports of the studies they have done, knows the \nvalue of the GAO.\n  I do want to make a point that I have made repeatedly as well. I am \nprofoundly disappointed, with respect to the GAO, that 21 months have \npassed since the departure of the Comptroller General, who is the \nperson who heads the GAO. Comptroller General Bowsher headed the GAO \nfor many, many years, a respected professional in every quarter in this \ncommunity and around the country.\n  Twenty-one months ago Mr. Bowsher left the GAO. That was not a \nsurprise because he had reached the end of his rather lengthy term and \nhad announced he was leaving. So we have\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nhad probably over 2 years' notice that position was going to be vacant. \nI am disappointed to tell my colleagues today that there is still not a \npermanent head of the GAO. We do not have a Comptroller General. We \nhave someone who is acting. I have great respect for that person; he \nhas done a very good job. But that is not the same as having a \npermanent head of an organization who is thinking in the intermediate \nand longer terms about what they hope to accomplish, how they want to \nrun the organization.\n  I say to my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, all friends \nof mine, I am sure, if you are one of those whose responsibility it is \nto help select from a list of premier candidates a new Comptroller \nGeneral, and you have not yet done that in consultation, I might say, \nwith the White House, please get about your business. Get it done. It \nis profoundly disappointing to me and many others, and I think the \nAmerican people, to know that the Comptroller General's position has \nbeen unfilled for 21 months. That is not fair to the American people, \nin my judgment. Those responsible ought to get to work and get this \ndone.\n  One other item I might mention finally is the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I was pleased that the committee report includes an exchange of \nletters that results from some items I have raised with the head of the \nCongressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office was putting out information on a \nmonthly and quarterly basis that talked about the surplus in the \nFederal budget. The law requires them to put out all the information, \nnot just some of the information. And all of the information by law \nrequires them to tell us not just what the so-called unified budget \nportrays, but what the budget looks like if you do not include the \nSocial Security trust funds, and that is a different number. There is \nno budget surplus unless you take the Social Security trust funds and \nbring them over into the operating budget, there is no surplus. It \ndoesn't exist. And so all of these rosy surpluses put out by CBO and \nused by some of my friends here in Congress to whet their taste for \nmore tax cuts, all these surpluses are just fiction.\n  We finally have the CBO now putting out numbers that describe, all \nright, if you use the Social Security trust funds, here is the unified \nbudget surplus. If you don't use the Social Security trust funds, here \nis the deficit. Every piece of information they put out, I might say, \nincludes a notation that the Federal debt will continue to increase \neven as on the unified budget they claim there is a surplus. So that in \nitself will tell you that the American people need to have all of the \ninformation.\n  I think we are making progress there. I know that those who take the \nunified budget portion of the CBO reports will hire a band that plays \nfast music and will dance so fast we can hardly see them in the next \ncouple of months to try to satisfy this appetite to construct a $50-, \n$100-, $200 billion tax cut bill. First of all, there is no surplus \nwith which to construct that tax cut. And second, my judgment is that \none of the first acts with any bona fide and real surplus ought to be \nto make some payment on that debt, just begin to ratchet that debt \ndown. I have no idea whether the Senator from Utah agrees with that, \nbut I do recall his presentations on the floor of the Senate, with a \nvery interesting chart in which he looked at this fiscal policy in a \nway that was different from the way anyone else had looked at it.\n\n  I do think it would probably be a wonderful signal to the American \npeople if we would take some part, of any future real surplus--not a \nfictional surplus but a real surplus--and say we intend, during good \ntimes, to try to reduce the actual indebtedness.\n  I just mention that because a lot of what we do relates to what \ninformation we have, and when the Congressional Budget Office is \nputting out information only about the unified budget and ignoring the \nsection of law that requires disclosure of what the budget situation is \nif you do not use the Social Security trust funds, it, in my judgment, \nis giving information to people that is making them far more excited \nthan they should be about a surplus that honestly, at this point, does \nnot exist.\n  Let me mention, finally, we have some very dedicated people who serve \nthis Congress--officers of the Senate and others who run the agencies \nand departments. I would like to say many of them have testified before \nour subcommittee. Many of them do outstanding work. They are not often \nheralded for that work. There is not a lot of information about the \nwork they do. But I know, because we work late hours and spend a lot of \ntime here, they put in a lot of hours. Their employees put in a lot of \nhours. We are well served by some people who are in public service here \nwho provide staff assistance to the Congress. We should make mention of \nthat.\n  One of the other agencies I want to mention finally is the Library of \nCongress. I know Senator Bennett and I have had talks with Dr. \nBillington and others who run that wonderful institution. I think it is \nan institution that has somewhere around 14 million volumes of work. It \nis, I am told, the largest repository of human knowledge anywhere on \nEarth.\n  Just as an aside, I read a speech by the president of IBM. He was \ntalking about what they are doing on storage technology. He said they \nare, he thinks, on the edge of research breakthroughs sufficient so \nthat, in the not too distant future, they would be able to put all of \nthe works in the Library of Congress--in other words, all of the \nlargest volume of work of recorded human knowledge anywhere on Earth, \non a wafer the size of a penny. Pretty remarkable, isn't it?\n  But the Library of Congress is a wonderful, important treasury of \ninformation for this country. We have had the pleasure of working with \nthem on a wide range of issues. I want to especially compliment the \nwork they are doing, digitizing a lot of their records, and the other \nthings that are happening at the Library of Congress.\n  So let me conclude where I began, to say it is truly a pleasure to \nwork with Senator Bennett. He is, I think, an outstanding legislator. I \nhope at some point we can get the bill up. I hope when we get the bill \nup, we can get the bill passed and get on with this. But as I indicated \nin response to the Senator from Kansas, the issue he is talking about \nis not an insignificant issue, it is a real issue and an issue of some \nimportance. As soon as we can find a way to resolve all these issues, \nperhaps we can get the legislative branch bill to the floor and get it \nresolved with some dispatch.\n  Let me thank the Senator from Kansas for his cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8458-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8459-S8464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MARRIAGE PENALTY TAX\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor his statement. I do want to note what is going on here. The \nleadership on our side is attempting to get the legislative branch bill \nto the floor for debate. That is appropriate and that is as it should \nbe. I am simply saying, before we give the legislature its money, let's \ngive some American families their money back in a small tax cut. \nActually, I think we could do far better than this, but a tax cut that \nthey should have. The leadership, Trent Lott, agrees with me on this \nand is willing to do that.\n  We have an objection from the other side of the aisle. The Democrat \nside of the aisle is not willing to let us take this bill up at this \ntime.\n  The majority leader is in agreement and wants to do this, wants to \nhave a vote on this particular bill. We cannot get agreement from our \nDemocrat colleagues to agree to vote on this bill. The irony of that \nis, I think, if we were able to get it up for a vote, there would be a \nnumber of my Democrat colleagues who would agree that we should do away \nwith the marriage tax penalty. This is a ridiculous notion, way out of \nstep with all of our rhetoric, way out of step with the rhetoric of \neverybody running for public office in America, talking about the need \nto support family and family values.\n  We tax families more than we do people who are not in a family \nsituation--not that we should penalize those either, but this should \njust all be level. Many of my colleagues on the Democrat side of the \naisle, I am convinced, would vote for this. But we are being blocked by \nmy Democrat colleagues from being able to take this up for a vote on a \nlegislative branch bill, and I\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\nam just not willing to concede that we should not vote on this issue at \nthis point in time when we are running budget surpluses--that we should \njust say, OK, we will fund the legislature, we will fund all the \noperations of these fine institutions, but we are going to keep taking \nmore money from married couples who make between $25,000 and $75,000 a \nyear. We are going to penalize them $1,400 a year, on average, while \nthe legislature gets their money and while the Democrat side of the \naisle objects to this being voted on.\n  I do not think that is right. I do not think we ought to do that, \nparticularly in light of what we know our financial situation to be. We \ncan do this. It should be done. We used to do it. We used to treat \nmarried couples the same as single filers up until 1969. We treated \nthem the same at that point in time. Then, at that point in time, we \ncreated the imbalance situation, to where married couples are taxed \nmore.\n  I do not know how many people recognize just how this works, because \nit is not even all married couples who are taxed more. The National \nCenter for Policy Analysis, in a February 1998 policy background paper, \nputs it this way. They say:\n\n       A marriage penalty results when a married couple pays more \n     for taxes by filing jointly than each could be if each filed \n     as a single person.\n\n  That was the feature we talked about earlier--some economists--a man \nand a woman, economists, who each year at the end of the year divorce, \nfile separately, retain the extra money, have kind of a special party, \nhoneymoon, and then marry again the first of the year. That is just \neach year they do this to take advantage of this situation, which is \nridiculous, that the Tax Code would actually encourage that.\n\n       A couple files the marriage penalty only [only] when both \n     spouses have earned income.\n\n  Is that fair, that we only do this when both spouses have earned \nincome? A large percentage of married couples, where both spouses work, \nwork because they have to; they have to, to make ends meet, when you \nhave a national effective tax rate--national, State, local--of 40 \npercent, and you have one spouse work to pay taxes and the other spouse \nwork to pay for everything else. So we have, in this country, again \nbecause of tax policy, in many respects--we force both couples to work, \nwhether or not they really want to, in their family arrangement. That \nis their choice of what they decide to do.\n  But this marriage tax penalty then, to add insult to injury again, \nonly applies when both spouses have earned income--only when both of \nthem are working. Does that make any sense for a tax policy in America? \nDoes that make any sense for struggling families at all? I think my \nDemocrat colleagues ought to want to vote on that sort of issue.\n\n       Single earner couples never pay a penalty; in fact, always \n     get a bonus from the Tax Code.\n       Single earner couples never pay a penalty; in fact, always \n     get a bonus from the Tax Code, paying less taxes than they \n     would pay as singles.\n\n  This is single-earner couples. Is that good tax policy either? Is \nthat the way we should be? I think my Democrat colleagues would want to \nvote on an issue like this. We are talking about returning a portion \nand not spending more in deficit and not hurting Social Security reform \nor saving Social Security. We can still save Social Security. You don't \nhave to pick between marriage and Social Security on this. CBO says we \nwill have $520 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years. We can help \npay down the debt, we can support marriage, and stop this ridiculous \ntax on marriage, and we can save Social Security. Those are doable in \nthe current situation we are in. Why on Earth would we not want to \nvote? Why on Earth would my Democrat colleagues be blocking us from \nvoting on this particular issue that is so important?\n  And, finally, we can help match our rhetoric to our actions on how \nimportant family values are. We need to do those things. They show, in \nthis National Center for Policy Analysis backgrounder piece, just how \nthis issue works.\n\n       The marriage penalty fundamentally results . . . [and they \n     have charts in here] ``Percentages of couples with marriage \n     penalties and bonuses.''\n\n  I note it only applies to two-wage-earner families that you get the \nmarriage penalty, which I think is wrong. But what happens is, when you \nhit into this penalty category, this is when you have two-wage-earner \nfamilies making between approximately $20,000 a year and $75,000 a \nyear, hit this penalty category, this tax increase category.\n  Think about that. How many people in America would be impacted then \nby that? We are talking about two-wage-earner families making combined \nbetween $20,000 and $75,000 a year. That is a lot of people. It is an \nestimate that is affecting 21 million American families. That is just \nthe two-wage earners. It is not the other children associated with the \nfamilies who are getting this huge tax hit that on average is $1,400.\n  Maybe some people don't think $1,400 is very much money. It is a \nhalf-a-year car payment for some people. It is a wrong signal to \neverybody. Whether you agree or disagree that this is very much or very \nlittle, it is the wrong signal to send at this time of such struggle \nthat we are having taking place in America. It just hits that category \nof people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield for a \nbrief question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did not intend to interrupt the Senator from Kansas, I \nthink, three times. He doesn't understand why the Democrats object to a \nvote on this. Does the Senator understand, the Democrats, as he \ncharacterized it, are not objecting to a vote on this? The objection is \nto a unanimous consent request that says there would be a vote on what \nyou are proposing, but no one on this side of the aisle would be \nallowed to present alternatives for a vote.\n  We have a couple of people in the Cloakroom, I am told, who want to \noffer tax amendments as well, if you want to have a vote on tax \namendments on the legislative branch bill.\n  It is not a case of Democrats objecting to a vote on your bill. I \nwant people who might be listening to the debate to understand that. \nThe unanimous consent request would say, let us have a vote on yours, \nbut prevent anybody else from offering anything. Obviously, we have \nsome folks who object to that.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. And, obviously, then the reason I am not getting a \nvote on the tax penalty is your objection to this.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, no----\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. My point in making that is to say we have a real \nsituation here, well known, extraordinarily documented, and we have the \nability to pay for it. And before we pay ourselves in the legislative \nbranch bill, let's pay the American families a little something. That \nseems to me to make eminent sense of something we should do.\n  I also further note, if I can----\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will in just a moment.\n  We spent 4 weeks on the tobacco legislation. We spent lots of time on \nother things in which I know the Senator from North Dakota was deeply \ninterested. We gave lots of folks lots of floor time. Have we voted on \nany tax cuts yet for the American public? We have voted on a lot of tax \nincreases. I think it is time we start saying it is time to give the \npeople back a little bit of money. I would like to see married couples \nget it back first.\n  I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I want to make one quick clarification. The Senator made \na comment that before we pay ourselves, and there are many people who \nbelieve that pay for Members of the Senate is included in the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill. I want to make it clear that it \nis not. The legislative branch bill is pay for the staff, pay for the \nagencies connected with the legislative branch, but Members' pay is not \nhere. If we do go to the legislative branch appropriations bill, it \nwill not deal with pay for Members of Congress.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. And I stand corrected on that issue. That is correct, \nand I did misspeak on that point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate my colleague from Utah for pointing that \nout. That was a misstatement on my part.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further for a \nquestion?\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes. I do want to show what is paid for in the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill then as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate his courtesy. I just observe, however, I \ndon't want him to skip over this point. The point isn't that somebody \non one side of the aisle in the Senate is objecting to what you are \ndoing. If there is intended to be a debate about tax policy on this \nbill, I expect the Senator from Kansas would fully understand, in the \nname of fairness, that it wouldn't be just his amendment that would be \nin order to be offered, but that there would be others, probably on \nboth sides of the aisle, who would want to weigh in with their \nparticular amendments.\n  The objection is to the unanimous consent request that would say you \nget to offer your amendment but no one else gets to offer their ideas \non the subject of taxation. I hope that when you characterize this, it \nis not to characterize it as something that the Democrats are unfairly \ntrying to do, because that is not the case. The objection is to \nallowing you to offer your amendment but preventing anyone else from \noffering their amendment on the tax issue.\n  In conclusion, I expect we will have a very substantial and lengthy \ndebate on the issue of tax reform and tax changes and tax cuts perhaps \nin the month of September. At least that is the way it is shaping up. I \nwant to make sure this is characterized fairly. I don't believe the \nSenator was being fair to us when he was saying we object to your \namendment. That is not what we object to. We object to a process that \nsays you can offer yours but no one on this side can offer their \namendments on the subject of taxation. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the point. I still \nfundamentally disagree with it. If we are talking about the issue of \nfairness, we spent 4 weeks talking about raising taxes on tobacco and \nworking Americans. I don't know how many people were arguing at that \ntime, ``OK, if we spent 4 weeks on that then we ought to talk 4 weeks \nabout tax cuts.''\n  I have only been standing here an hour or two. We spent 4 weeks \ntalking about raising those taxes, vote after vote. Some of the things \nin that policy area I thought were making some legitimate points about \nhow we should try to cut back on teen smoking--which I do not support; \nnobody supports teen smoking--and how we can get at it. If we are going \nto talk about fundamental fairness, we did spend 4 weeks on that \nparticular topic and much of it centered around how we raise taxes.\n  I am talking about on this particular bill, because we are short on \nthe Legislative Calendar, let's talk about a tax cut. We are not \ngetting a vote on that. We are being blocked from getting a vote on a \nvery serious tax policy problem at a very important time in our \ncountry.\n  There was a poll of the American public about what they are most \nconcerned about today. Consistently, people have been getting more and \nmore concerned about what is happening to the values of this country, \nwhat is happening to us. While I don't think this body at all can \ncontrol that sort of, ``Hey, here's what's happening across a civil \nsociety in America,'' we can send signals, and we do send signals \nregularly.\n  When we had the welfare reform bill, we said in the welfare reform \nbill, ``OK, if you're an able-bodied person and you can work, after 2 \nyears, you are going to have to work. If you can do that, we are going \nto make you do that.'' We sent a signal from here.\n  Do you know what is happening in Kansas because of that? We have a \nwelfare roll reduction of nearly 50 percent. I met with a number of \npeople who were on welfare for a long period of time. They said to me, \n``This is a wonderful change. You forced me off it. Welfare was like a \ndrug that I was hooked to. You made me get out and work, and I feel \nbetter about it.''\n  A 50-percent reduction, and the people who were on it feel better \nabout where they are today. It was a signal. One can say, ``Well, we \ndidn't really change that much of welfare reform policy.'' I think we \ndid change a substantial amount, and we sent the right signal.\n  With this, Mr. President, we are sending all the wrong signals. We \nare saying that if you are a two-wage-earner family, you have to pay \nmore in taxes. If you make between $20,000 and $75,000, I am sorry, you \nhave to pay more in taxes. It is the wrong signal. It sends a bad \nsignal. It needs to be corrected, and it can be corrected.\n  We are on the legislative branch appropriations bill. As the Senator \nfrom Utah had noted, this does not include the salaries of individuals \nwho serve in this body, and I misstated that. These are some of the \nthings that it does fund: It funds the operations of Congress. People \ncan see the Superintendent's shops, the various things we fund here, \nand directory of services we have here.\n  The only reason I am pointing this out is that this is basically \nrunning this institution, some of which I am wondering why we don't \nhave contracted out or privatized myself. My point in raising this is, \nI think before we pay these, we ought to give more back to families to \noperate their budget, a mere $1,400.\n  I talked some about the groups who support this elimination of the \nmarriage tax penalty. I noted, too, I hope my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle, when we get a chance to vote on this, will be \nsupportive of this.\n  I think it is important that people understand how this problem works \nand when it went in place and what we can do about it.\n  I have cited the Congressional Budget Office before on this \nparticular problem where they are noting:\n\n       The Federal income tax law generally requires married \n     couples filing a joint tax return based on combined income of \n     husband and wife. As a result, husbands and wives with \n     similar incomes usually incur a larger combined tax liability \n     than they would if they could file individually. At the same \n     time, spouses who have markedly different incomes but file as \n     a couple generally face smaller tax bills than they would if \n     they were single.\n\n  Is that good tax policy? Is that right?\n\n       Those two possibilities often referred to as ``marriage \n     penalties'' and ``bonuses'' result from the conflicting goals \n     of a tax system that attempts to balance fairness between \n     married and unmarried couples among married couples and among \n     taxpayers with differing incomes.\n\n  OK. So we have had a conscious policy here toward marriage for some \nperiod of time. My problem is, why do we penalize a certain group in \nhere, that is, middle-income individuals, struggling greatly in this \nsystem, and we actually have this as a policy? This is according to \nCBO. This is a policy, and we enacted it into law in Congress in 1969--\nbefore I was here, the year of Woodstock, the year of putting a man on \nthe Moon. I do not know if there was a signal that was sent at \nWoodstock that we ought to do these sorts of things, but it went into \nplace then.\n\n       Under the 1996 tax law, married couples could face a \n     Federal tax bill that was more than $20,000 higher than the \n     amounts they would pay if they were not married and could \n     file individual tax returns, whereas, other couples may find \n     that filing a joint tax return reduces their tax bills by \n     more than $4,000.\n\n  Now, surely my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would want \nto redress this issue. And I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota \nsaying, ``Well, we're not opposed to it. We just want to raise a whole \nbunch of other tax bills.'' What we are trying to do with this is to \ndirect and correct the very narrow wrong that applies to 21 million \nAmerican families.\n  I would hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would say \nthat is not something we need trading material for, that ``We will \ntrade you that if you will let us bring up the Patients' Bill of \nRights,'' or some other issue. Or as the Senator from Kentucky said, he \nwanted to do away with the marriage bonus, which I have a problem with. \nI do not want to raise those taxes on individuals. I do not think that \nmost people on the other side of the aisle would say we need to trade \nthis back and forth.\n  Why couldn't we just get a consent from them that we would vote on \nthis amendment? Yet, that is the problem I am having, not being able to \nget consent from Democrat colleagues on this particular issue that we \nwould be able to get a vote on this item.\n  I am willing to have a vote on Senator Ford's proposal that we do \naway with the marriage bonus, which I do not agree with. I will not \nvote with the Senator, but I certainly am willing to agree that we have \na vote on that particular issue. But I do not see why we\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\nwould disagree. I do not see why we would have this particular problem \nat this particular time and in this debate.\n  Let me cite some other materials that people are working with about \nthe particular problems that families are having.\n  CBO again:\n\n       The various ways of defining marriage penalties and \n     bonuses--one broad measure indicates that more than 21 \n     million married couples--\n\n  Twenty-one million married couples; so there are families associated \nwith those married couples--\n\n     paid an average of nearly $1,400 in additional taxes in 1996 \n     alone--\n\n  So $1,400 per couple--\n\n     because they must file jointly, whereas, another 25 million \n     found that the benefits of filing jointly decrease their tax \n     bill an average of $1,300.\n\n  I am glad that people got the decrease on the 25 million. I see no \nreason why we should penalize the other 21 million.\n\n       Marriage penalties totaled about $29 billion in 1996.\n\n  The marriage penalty--listen to this--$29 billion was the size of the \nmarriage penalty in 1996. So $29 billion. That is a negative signal of \ngigantic proportion that we are sending across this Republic and across \nthis country, if we do not deal with this issue. And it is of \nimportance that we deal with it now while we have so few legislative \ndays that remain.\n  I want to quote some people, what working Americans are saying about \nthe marriage penalty as they grow more and more informed about the \nmarriage penalty.\n  This is a gentleman from Union, KY. He said this:\n\n       Before we set a wedding date, I calculated the tax \n     implications.\n\n  There is a scary notion, that before you get married that a person is \ngoing to actually calculate their tax implications to it. I hope more \npeople do not do that.\n\n       Since we each earn in the low $30,000s, the federal \n     marriage penalty was over $3,000.\n\n  This is a gentleman in Union, KY. The marriage penalty was over \n$3,000.\n  He notes:\n\n       What a wonderful gift from the IRS!\n\n  What kind of gift is that? What kind of message is that? What kind of \nsignal is that? It is money that ought to be returned. I encourage \npeople listening and watching--why don't you figure out what your own \nmarriage penalty is to see how you are going to be impacted if we are \nable to get this change and get a vote on it from our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, if they will let us vote on it?\n  This is Bobby and Susan from Marietta, GA, who raised this issue. \nThey said this quote:\n\n       When we figured out our 1996 tax return . . . we figured \n     what our tax would be if we were just living together instead \n     of married.\n\n  Now, that is not a very good notion either that we want to encourage \nwith the tax policy.\n  They said this:\n\n       Imagine our disgust when we discovered that, if we just \n     lived together instead of being married, we would have saved \n     an additional $1,000.\n\n  That is the signal we wanted to send to Bobby and Susan from \nMarietta, GA?\n  ``Imagine our disgust when we discovered that, if we just lived \ntogether instead of being married, we could have saved an additional \n$1,000.''\n  I am standing here thinking, now, is that the signal we wanted to \nsend to them? How many married couples actually figure what their taxes \nare and say, ``You know what? The Federal Government is telling us not \nto get married. Maybe we should not get married, then, if that is the \nsignal that they are sending to us. And we are going to either pay a \npenalty of $1,000 for getting married, or we can continue to live \ntogether. Now, should we pay that penalty or should we just live \ntogether?''\n  Bobby and Susan said they figured it was, for them, going to be an \nadditional $1,000 in taxes.\n  Listen to this quote:\n\n       So much for the much vaunted `family values' of our \n     government. Our government is sending a very bad message to \n     young adults by penalizing marriage this way.\n\n  Here are people that actually sat and figured it out. And people do \nfigure these things out. And they do see the signals that are being \nsent, and they do respond. Fortunately, a lot of people know that these \nare wrong signals, and then they do not act accordingly. But they do \nrespond to those things.\n  Here is Sharon from Indiana, what she said. This is a good one.\n\n       I can't tell you how disgusted we both are over this tax \n     issue. If we get married not only would I forfeit my $900 \n     refund check, we would be writing a check to the IRS for \n     $2,800.\n\n  So she forfeits a $900 refund check. And she would be writing a check \nto the IRS for $2,800.\n\n       Darryl and I would very much like to be married . . .\n\n  ``Darryl and I would very much like to be married.''\n\n       and I must say, it broke our hearts when we found out we \n     can't afford it [when they found out they could not afford to \n     be married because of the tax policy of this country].\n\n  Now, isn't that something we ought to deal with posthaste? Isn't it \nsomething we ought to say right now, let us have a vote on this so we \ncan send the right sort of signal to Sharon and Darryl in Indiana and \nto Philip in Union, KY, and Bobby and Susan in Marietta, GA? They said: \n``We can't afford to get married because of the Federal tax policy.''\n  This is a gentleman from Columbus, OH.\n\n       I am engaged to be married [he says] and my fiancee and I \n     have discussed the fact that we will be penalized \n     financially. We have postponed the date of our marriage in \n     order to save up and have a `running start' in part because \n     of this nasty, unfair tax structure.\n\n  ``Nasty, unfair tax structure.''\n  Those aren't quite the type of words that we use in the Senate all \nthe time. But he has calculated, figured it up, and said, ``Well, OK, I \nwant to get married, and we want to do a lot of things as a family, but \nthe first thing we have to do is pay more in taxes.''\n  Is that the sort of policy that we want to send forward? Is that the \nsort of thing that we want the American public to look at and to hear \nabout? Is that the sort of thing that we want to support as a policy, \nas a family values policy of this Congress?\n  Here is Christopher from Baltimore, MD:\n\n       I am a 23-year-old and a marriage penalty victim for four \n     years now. I am a union electrician who works hard to put \n     food on the table to take care of my family.\n\n  Then he asked the simple question, ``Why is the government punishing \nme just because I'm married?\"\n  Why are we? Why aren't my Democrat colleagues willing to let me have \na vote, let us have a vote, on a bill that most of them would support, \nas well, to do away with the marriage tax penalties? Are they just \nfearful we will give the American public back some of their money and \nwill direct it to families who need it the most, young families just \nstarting out, union electricians, who want a little bit more of their \ntax money back?\n  Two-wage-earner families is who this tax is actually targeted toward. \nWe are actually taxing them more. Aren't we concerned about two-wage-\nearner families struggling heroically? This is a great direct shot at \nhelping them build their family units.\n  Why won't my colleagues from the other side of the aisle let us vote \non this? Let's just have a vote on this and see. I would think we would \nhave a lot of people support it. Don't block this vote.\n  Scott from Palmdale, CA:\n\n       If you want more of something reward it; if you want less \n     punish it monetarily.\n\n  That is a basic principle that is used in the Tax Code frequently.\n\n       If you want more family units, reward them financially. \n     Then maybe the statistic will drop that says 70 percent of \n     divorces are due to money challenges.\n\n  That is a pretty fundamental principle on this basis of how we run \nthis Government.\n  We have places that we can send signals out there. We can send \nsignals out through legislation, we can send signals through \nregulation, and we can send signals through tax policy in this country. \nThe tax policy in this country is that if you tax something more, you \nwill punish it; if you tax something less, you will reward it. We are \nactually taxing two-wage-earner families more. And do we ask them to \nget less of that--is that what we are asking to get less of?\n  This is Christopher, from Fairfield, OH:\n\n       One of the biggest shocks my wife and I had when deciding \n     to get married was how\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\n     much more we would have to give to the government because we \n     decided to be married rather than live together.\n\n  Here are people, figuring, calculating, looking and saying: OK, now \nwhat will we do here?\n\n       It does not make sense that I was allowed to keep a larger \n     portion of my pay on a Friday and less of it on a Monday with \n     the only difference being that I was married that weekend.\n\n  That is pretty succinct, as well.\n\n       The only difference was that I was married that weekend.\n\n  From Andrew and Connie from Alexandria, VA--real close:\n\n       We grew up together and began dating when we were 18. After \n     dating for three years we decided that the next natural step \n     in our lives together would be to get married. I cannot tell \n     you the joy this has brought us. I must tell you that the tax \n     penalty that was inflicted on us has been the only real \n     source of pain that our marriage has suffered.\n\n  So here is a couple that dated for 3 years, when they were 18 they \nstarted dating--much joy; the only pain that has been inflicted is the \ntax increases that they suffered for getting married.\n  Here is Andrew, from Greenville, NC:\n\n       It is unfortunate that the government makes a policy \n     against the noble and sacred institution of marriage. I feel \n     it is unfortunate that it seems to hit young struggling \n     couples the hardest.\n\n  That is great Greenville, NC.\n  If you look at the category of those hitting the marriage tax--and, \nagain, I refer to the chart from the National Center for Policy \nAnalysis--it is couples making, combined, $20,000 and $75,000 of earned \nincome, two-wage-earner couples in that category, frequently young, \nmarried couples, starting their family. So that while this tax penalty \nactually hits 21 million married couples, it is hitting far more in the \nway of children. It is hitting young children at some of the most \nvulnerable times in their lives.\n\n  This is something that really was one of the most perverse signals we \ncould possibly send. It is directed mostly at younger couples. It is \nwhen they are starting their families. It is at a time when people are \ndeciding to get married or not to get married, and we send this \nperverse tax signal that you have to send more money that you are \nmaking to the Federal Government. If anything, we should be sending \nthem a bonus at that particular point in time.\n  Why won't my Democratic colleagues let us vote on this? Why won't \nthey let us do this? That just doesn't seem to make sense, why they \nwouldn't let us vote on this narrow issue. On the issue of fairness, \nthey say we need to bring up other tax policy issues. We brought up a \nlot of tax increase issues. We are finally talking about a tax cut \nissue. We should be willing and able to vote on this sort of issue now.\n  This is Thomas, from Ohio. He writes:\n\n       No person who legitimately supports family values could be \n     against this bill [that is, to eliminate the marriage tax \n     penalty].\n       No person who legitimately supports family values could be \n     against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another \n     example of how in the past 40 years the federal government \n     has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental \n     institutions that were the strength of this country from the \n     start.\n\n  I don't know how any more clearly you could put that as an issue. Why \nwould we continue to propound that? We may have somewhere around 30 or \n40 legislative days left in this Congress.\n  My point in bringing this up at this point in time is, we aren't \nhaving a lot of chance to be able to correct wrongs on other bills \nother than appropriations that are moving through the legislative body. \nWe have to move appropriations bills through. We should move \nappropriations bills through. We will not be getting a lot of these \nother issues up--tax policy, particularly dealing with this most \nonerous tax on married couples, marriage tax penalty. Why won't we deal \nwith this now? We are trying to deal with it on the legislative branch \nappropriations bill, as well. This is a good vehicle to deal with it. \nIt funds the institutions of the Congress here. So we are saying let's \ndeal with this one now on this short legislative calendar that we have \nwhile we have the resources to be able to do it.\n  This is Sean, from Jefferson City, MO. He wrote this:\n\n       I think the marriage penalty is a major cause of the \n     breakdown of the family here in the U.S.\n\n  He is citing it as a major cause of the breakdown of the family here \nin the United States.\n\n       [Ending it] would cut down on the incidence of cohabitation \n     by unmarried couples and give more children two-parent \n     families where there is a real commitment between the \n     parents.\n\n  I am not certain about what he said earlier, but I think it is the \nproper signal for us to send to families, particularly the young and \nstruggling ones.\n  From Houston, TX:\n\n       If we are really interested in putting children first, why \n     would this country penalize the very situation, marriage, \n     where kids do best?\n\n  A lot of single parents struggle heroically to raise children, and we \ndon't want to penalize them. The amendment I want to put forward does \nnot penalize them. It does not penalize them. It simply says a two-\nwage-earner married couple, earning between $20,000 and $75,000, you \nshouldn't penalize either. When parents are truly committed to each \nother through their marriage vows, their children's outcomes are \nenhanced.\n  That is Gary and Carla from Houston, TX.\n  This couple from New Castle, VA:\n\n       I am a 61-year-old grandmother, still holding down a full-\n     time job and I remarried 3 years ago.\n\n  This is astounding.\n\n       I had to think long and hard about marriage over staying \n     single as I knew it would cost us several thousand dollars a \n     year just to sign the marriage license. Marriage has become a \n     contract between two individuals and the Federal Government.\n\n  In this lady's estimation, from New Castle, VA:\n\n       Marriage is a contract between two individuals and the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  She had to think long and hard about whether to stay single or get \nmarried because she couldn't afford the taxes. That is an extraordinary \nsituation and ought to be corrected as soon as possible.\n  Here is from Chicago, IL:\n\n       We read that representative Jerry Weller of Illinois is one \n     of a group of sophomore legislators pushing for an end to the \n     marriage penalty. We do not believe this effort should be a \n     partisan effort and strongly feel that members of both \n     parties should join together to right this wrong and that \n     Congress should do it quickly.\n\n  Well, that is what we are trying to do here today, and to do this \nquickly. It should be done. It can be done. We need to do it. We need \nto do it on this vehicle. That is why we are putting this forward now.\n  This is from Pennsylvania:\n\n       My wife and I have actually discussed the possibility of \n     obtaining a divorce, something neither of us wants or \n     believes in, especially myself, simply because my family \n     cannot afford to pay the price.\n\n  Is that a horrendous statement to have from Jeffrey in \nPennsylvania?--keeping the names somewhat anonymous.\n\n       My wife and I have actually discussed the possibility of \n     obtaining a divorce, something neither of us wants or \n     believes in, especially myself, simply because my family \n     cannot afford to pay the price.\n\n\n  My goodness, that is something we just have to collect. This is the \nOttawa Daily Times.\n  According to Edward McCaffery, a law professor at the University of \nSouthern California and California Institute of Technology and author \nof ``Taxing Women,'' in an article in the University of Chicago Press:\n\n       The marriage penalty is essentially a tax on working wives, \n     because the joint filing system compels married couples to \n     identify a primary earner and a secondary earner, and usually \n     the wife falls into the latter category. Therefore, from an \n     accountant's point of view, the wife's first dollar of income \n     is taxed at the point where her husband's income has left \n     her.\n\n  Or that can be reversed to the category where the wife's income \nexceeds the husband's.\n\n       If the husband is making substantially more money than the \n     wife, the couple may even conclude that it is not worth it \n     for the wife to earn income. In fact, McCaffery's book \n     details the plight of one woman who realized her job was \n     actually losing money for her family.\n\n  Her job was actually losing money for her family. Now, that is a \nhorrid situation that is taking place. This is in the book, ``Taxing \nWomen,'' by Edward McCaffery, a law professor at the University of \nSouthern California and the California Institute of Technology.\n  This next one is from the Ottawa Daily Times:\n\n       You try and be honest to do things straight, and you get \n     penalized for it. That's just not right.\n\n  That was from Illinois.\n  I don't know how better to summarize it than how the people across\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\nAmerica have summarized it in these particular voices from across the \ncountry. Those are pretty good summaries. It raises the point of why I \nam so adamant that we need to deal with this issue now. I cannot \nunderstand why my Democrat colleagues want to block this issue--even \nunder some notion of the fairness of them having a tax bill and us \nhaving a tax bill. I can't believe they would be opposed to this tax \nbill, which is on two-wage-earner families. I don't see this as a \nRepublican or Democrat issue. This is an American issue, an issue of \nfamily values, which we all support, and we have very few legislative \ndays left to deal with it. It needs to be dealt with now.\n  What could couples do with this money if they had the $1,400 that the \naverage couple currently pays? Some people would do different things. \nThey could pay electric bills for 9 months averaging $103 a month. They \ncould pay for 3 or 4 months of day care if they had that $1,400 back--\nin some places it is higher, and in some it is lower. They could pay \nfor a 5-day vacation to Disneyland if they wanted to with that $1,400. \nA package rate concludes a double room, a Disneyland hotel, and entry \ninto the entertainment park for mom, dad, and two kids. I think that is \na much better place to put this money, if people would just take off to \nDisneyland with their family in tow. I don't know if those rates still \napply or not. Or they could make four or five payments on a minivan, \nwhich average $300 to $350 a month. It seems everybody needs a minivan \nanymore. Or they could eat out 35 times in a restaurant, with the meals \naveraging $40. They could buy 1,053 gallons of gasoline at $1.33 a \ngallon. They could purchase 1,228 loaves of bread, with an average loaf \ncosting $1.14.\n  Now, ask anybody here, should these married couples spend the money \non those things, or should they send it to us in penalty? I think they \nhave better places to be able to put their own resources. So that is \nwhy I am so adamant that we not go on to this spending bill until we \nhelp American families with their spending. The ability to pay 9 months \nof electric bills is important.\n  I don't intend to just occupy my colleagues' time with this. This is \nan important issue that I think needs to be raised, and it needs to be \nseen, and it needs to be heard. There hasn't been a whole lot of \ndiscussion on this particular issue. I see other colleagues, and I \nwould be willing to let them speak if they desire. I don't want to \nblock them. I do want to raise this issue of consciousness across the \nAmerican public on this particular issue of the marriage penalty. That \nis why I have been talking on this point and why I raise it on this \nlegislative branch appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, after the Senator's 20 minutes, I \nretain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first, I want to take a couple of minutes, \nMr. President, to compliment my colleague from Kansas on what he is \ndoing in talking about this marriage penalty and advocating more tax \nrelief for American families. He has done a great job. I agree with him \nwholeheartedly, because when you look at the marriage penalty, bottom \nline, this is an unfair tax that has been imposed on something like 21 \nmillion couples in this country. It penalizes them for actually being \nmarried rather than encouraging and supporting the institution of \nmarriage. We have a Tax Code that actually penalizes couples if they \nget married.\n  A couple of months back, President Clinton was asked a question about \nthe marriage penalty. I believe he admitted that it was unfair. Then he \nwas asked, ``Why don't we get rid of it?'' The bottom line is that \nGovernment somehow cannot get along without this money. It is $29.1 \nbillion a year, I believe. The Government can't get along without that \nmoney. Somehow families can get along without it, but the Government \ncan't. Nobody calls up the families and says: If we have this unfair \ntax, are you able to get along without the money? Nobody calls the \nfamilies. They just have to do more with less, or get along without it. \nThe bottom line is that, in our Tax Code, somehow our Government is \nwilling to collect taxes unfairly. I agree with the Senator from Kansas \nthat families can make much better use of this money, as we have been \nadvocating for so long, in reducing the taxes. I strongly support his \nefforts today in talking about the elimination of the marriage tax \npenalty. I just wanted to support him on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8459-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8464-S8466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SOCIAL SECURITY'S COMING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the Senate continues its work on the \nspending bills for the next fiscal year, I rise today to speak about an \nissue that threatens the financial future of this nation: a disaster-\nin-the-making that jeopardizes our ability to fund any of the important \ndiscretionary spending programs we now debate, such as education or \nmedical research. I rise to speak about the coming crisis of the Social \nSecurity program.\n  In my last remarks on this subject before this Chamber, I discussed \nthe history of the Social Security program. Specifically, I talked \nabout how hastily Congress passed the Social Security Act, how poorly \nthe program was designed, and how fallacious its finance mechanism was. \nA Social Security crisis was inevitable--and arrived in the late \n1970's, when the program began running a deficit and Congress raised \ntaxes to shore it up. President Carter claimed Social Security would \nremain solvent for another 50 years. Just five years later, Social \nSecurity was facing another near-term insolvency. That time, after \nagain raising taxes, Congress claimed the system would remain viable \nfor 75 years.\n  Yet, here we are again.\n  Mr. President, as with the previous two crises, the coming retirement \ncrisis is real. All the socioeconomic data suggest it is approaching. \nBoth the government and private sectors are projecting the future \ninsolvency of the Social Security program.\n  However, unlike the last two crises, the coming crisis will have a \nprofound and devastating impact on our national economy, our society, \nand our culture unmatched by any we have faced since the founding of \nthis Nation.\n  Despite all the evidence to the contrary, some Washington politicians \ncontinue to sing the ``don't worry, be happy'' refrain. Social Security \nis not in crisis, they say--it is not broken and will not go bankrupt. \nAll it needs are a ``few minor adjustments'' to fix its problems.\n  Therefore, many of our constituents have only heard the good news and \nthe happy talk: that Congress has balanced the budget for the first \ntime in nearly 30 years and that the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects surpluses growing to $140 billion within a decade. All of this \ngood news is complemented by the fact that the Social Security Trust \nFund boasts an asset balance that tops $600 billion and is expected to \nrun surpluses for the next 13 years. And so the Social Security \nAdministration passionately contends that Social Security benefits will \nalways be there for everyone.\n  Insisting that the Social Security crisis is not real--that we are in \nbetter financial shape today than ever before--is like telling the \ncaptain of the Titanic the waters are clear, with no threat of \nicebergs, and the ship should proceed full speed ahead.\n  That is ``The Big Lie,'' Mr. President, and if we fall for that \nrhetoric, there is nothing but icebergs ahead for Social Security. For \nstarters, the Social Security program's $20 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities have created an economic time bomb that threatens to \nshatter our economy. In addition, the declining rate of return of \nSocial Security contributions means the system will be unable to meet \nthe expectations of future retirees, who seek in retirement the same \nfinancial security they enjoyed in the workplace.\n  Beginning in 2008, 74 million baby-boomers will become eligible for \nretirement and the system will begin to collapse. From that point on, \nwe will have\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\nmore retirees than ever before, and fewer workers paying into the \nsystem. And as medical advances continue to extend life expectancy, \nfuture retirees will be receiving benefits longer than was ever \nanticipated when the program was created.\n  The problem begins with the fact that the current Social Security \nsystem is a ``pay-as-you-go'' entitlement program. The money a worker \npays in today is used to support today's retirees--the government does \nnot hold it for an individual worker until he or she retires--meaning \nthere is no reserve waiting for future retirees.\n  To put it real simply, there is no account in Washington, DC with \nanybody's name on it that has one dollar for your retirement. Not one \ndollar in Washington has been set aside. They rely on the workers today \nto collect the money from them to pay those on retirement today. When \nthe program was originally conceived in 1935, this did not pose a \nthreat. Back then, the average life expectancy for Americans had not \nyet reached age 65 and there were many more workers paying into the \nsystem than were taking out.\n  To put this into perspective, before the ``baby boom'' generation was \nborn, there were 100 workers for every retiree. But as these same baby \nboomers begin to retire, the funding support is projected to eventually \ndrop to merely two workers per retiree--100 for every retiree 50 years \nago and 2 workers for every retiree at the beginning of the next \ncentury. Furthermore, these future retirees are expected to live to \nmore than 75 years of age. We have gone from a program where the \naverage worker died before ever receiving their benefits, to a \nsituation where retirees are living years after they have received all \ntheir contributions back from the program. In fact, the Congressional \nResearch Service estimates today's average Social Security recipient \nreceives back his or her lifetime contributions within the first three \nto five years of retirement.\n  By the way, Mr. President, if we ran our households the way the \ngovernment operates Social Security, we would never be allowed to \nfinance a house, we could never send our kids to college with the help \nof a student loan, we could not even get a car loan; in fact, we could \nnot function in the real world at all. If we ran our companies on a \npay-as-you-go basis, there is a good possibility we would have been \ntossed in jail long ago.\n  When there are fewer workers to support each retiree, it is obvious \nsomething has to give. When Congress attempted to address projected \nshortfalls in the past, the government's response meant either reduced \nbenefits for retirees, higher payroll taxes on workers, or some \ncombination of the two. For workers, that has amounted to 51 tax \nincreases on income or income adjustments in just the last 25 to 30 \nyears; 51 times the government has raised Social Security taxes, or \nadjusted the income on which those taxes were levied. So it comes as no \nsurprise that similar proposals are finding their way into our debate \nagain today.\n\n  Unfortunately, this comes at a time when retirees are growing \nincreasingly dependent upon Social Security benefits as their main \nsource of income. This is in spite of the fact that Congress never \nintended Social Security to become a replacement for personal savings. \nSocial Security was to be a supplement, not the major source of an \nindividual's retirement dollars. According to a report by the \nCongressional Budget Office, though, workers have come to expect that, \nupon retirement, Social Security will provide them with income to \nreplace a significant portion of their previous earnings. As proof of \nthat, in 1996, Social Security made up approximately 40 percent of the \ncash income of the elderly. And as the number of workers covered by \npensions continues to decrease and tax rates continue to complicate the \nability of workers to save for their future and ensure their retirement \nsecurity, dependency will surely grow.\n  The Social Security Trust Fund's unfunded liability makes the long-\nterm budgetary impact of America's changing demographics even more \nsignificant.\n  The government's own data shows that the Trust Funds will begin to \nhave cash shortfalls in less than 12 years. Beginning in 2010, Social \nSecurity will have to pay about $1 billion more than it will collect in \ntaxes.\n  There will be no surpluses in the Social Security fund. In the year \n2015, that number will climb to $90 billion of deficits.\n  In 2035, it will reach $1 trillion and in 2075, the annual shortfall \nwill explode to a staggering $7.5 trillion per year. Even after being \nadjusted for inflation, the total unfunded liability is still \nstaggering--at $20 trillion.\n  On paper, the Trust Fund boasts more than $600 billion in assets. \n``On paper'' is the key, however. For years, Congress has regularly \nraided the Trust Fund to pay for additional federal programs--a \npractice that continues unabated today. Unfortunately, as the baby-\nboomers begin to retire, the government IOUs will become due.\n  Washington will either have to cut government spending, raise taxes, \nor borrow from the public to redeem those IOUs. Obviously, being \nunwilling--or unable--to control its own spending, Washington routinely \nchooses the latter two options. And so beginning by 2013, or maybe even \nearlier, taxpayers will be asked, yet again, to pay up as the IOUs are \ncashed in to fund retiree benefits. I agree with the majority of my \nMinnesota constituents that the government has no business raiding the \nSocial Security Trust Fund to pay for its pet spending projects. The \ntaxpayers have every right to be outraged that such a blatant abuse of \nthe system is allowed to continue.\n  All these factors lead to the conclusion that the Social Security \nTrust Fund will go broke by 2032 if we continue on our present course. \nIf the economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the demographic \nassumptions are too optimistic, the Trust Fund could go bankrupt much \nsooner. And once the cash shortfalls begin, they quickly climb to \nstaggering levels.\n  Washington's fiscal mismanagement means it not only raises taxes, it \nalso must borrow more from the public to cover the shortfall. Without a \npolicy change, the CBO estimates the debt held by the public will \nballoon to nearly $80 trillion in 2050--from under $6 trillion today to \n$80 trillion in 2050. According to the General Accounting Office, the \nestimates are much worse. They say, it could top $158 trillion in debt \nand consuming nearly 200 percent of our national income. A national \ndebt at this level would shatter our economy, and shatter our \nchildren's hopes of obtaining the American dream.\n  Mr. President, we often hear those individuals who want to maintain \nthe status quo argue that by increasing the payroll tax by ``just'' 2.2 \npercent--going from 12.4 to 14.6 percent--we can somehow fix the \nproblem for another 75 years, but that is absolutely false.\n  Based upon the Trustee's Report, the present value of the unfunded \npromise of future benefits totals more than $5 trillion--this is how \nmuch money we would have to collect and invest today to pay for the \nfuture retirees. To collect this much money, the federal government \nwould be forced to impose a tax rate in excess of 100 percent on every \nAmerican. This, of course, is assuming such funds would not be spent \nelsewhere in the interim and replaced with more IOUs, as we have done \nin the past.\n  The Concord Coalition projects that, from now to 2040, the cost of \nSocial Security will rise from 11 to 18 percent of workers' taxable \nincome. Add in Medicare and Medicaid and the taxes on these three \nprograms take 40 percent off our paychecks--not even counting our \nFederal or State or local taxes; just those three programs: Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, would be a 40 percent tax on your \nincome.\n  With federal, state, and local income taxes and other taxes, the tax \nburden will become too high for anyone to bear. These high tax rates \nwill erase all growth in real after-tax worker earnings over the next \nhalf-century. When this occurs, the economy will be destroyed and a tax \nrevolt from younger workers will certainly follow.\n  Mr. President, the only good news is that these problems are down the \nroad and not already upon us. Of course, it would be easier to put off \nthese difficult decisions by waiting until the crisis has actually \narrived before we begin repairing the damage. As members of Congress, \nhowever, it is our responsibility to address the situation now, before \nwe pass this financial nightmare onto our children and grandchildren. \nThat is why I am speaking on this issue today.\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\n  Experts tell us that delaying action would require we take even more \ndrastic measures in the future. Not only would such delays be costly, \nthey would leave Americans with less time to prepare themselves for any \nadjustments to the program. When we consider that Social Security taxes \nconsume approximately one-eighth of an average worker's lifetime \nincome, there is a significant amount of money at stake for every \nindividual. And that could grow, as we said, to one-fifth of all the \nmoney that an individual makes.\n  While Congress cannot change future demographics or merely replace \nthe IOUs it has left sitting in the Social Security Trust Fund, it does \nhold the power to offer retirement security to all Americans by \nimproving the way the Social Security System will operate in the \nfuture. I firmly believe it can be done without breaking the \ngovernment's covenant with current retirees or leaving those about to \nenter the program in fiscal limbo. But it will take an innovative \napproach that breaks from Social Security's ``government-knows-best'' \nroots.\n  We must look to the ingenuity and competitive spirit of the private \nsector to improve and rejuvenate the program if we are to give future \nretirees any promise of retirement benefits.\n  I have often heard today's workers lament they do not think Social \nSecurity will be there for them. Forty-six percent of all young people \nbelieve in UFOs, says a study by Third Millennium, while just 28 \npercent think they will ever see a Social Security check. So more kids \nbelieve in UFO's than Social Security. Still, it is not too late to \nchange that course and prevent the coming Social Security crisis.\n  As the national debate goes forward, Congress has the ability to \nempower workers with the tools to control their own future. If we can \nlearn from our past mistakes and own up to the financial nightmare \nwaiting down the road, we can transform Social Security from a program \nthat threatens financial ruin to one that holds the promise of improved \nretirement security for generations to come.\n  We have much work to do and no time to waste, so I urge my colleagues \nto join me as we begin the transformation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8464-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMF REPLENISHMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, yesterday, as we were debating the best way \nto help our farmers overcome low prices in the Upper Midwest, the \nMinority Leader appropriately called the IMF ``the single best tool \navailable to provide economic stability in Asia, Russia and around the \nworld.'' Unfortunately, he then went on to blame Republicans for \nopposition to IMF replenishment.\n  As one who joined many of my Republican colleagues here in the Senate \nto actively promote the IMF replenishment and pass the full $18 billion \nhere as part of the Supplemental, I would take issue with that \nstatement. It was the Republican leadership in the Senate who worked \nwith the Administration to pass the $18 billion along with a balanced \nreform package designed to make the IMF work more effectively.\n  Yes, I have been disappointed that the House has still not acted on \nthis matter. However, just yesterday, $3.4 billion was reported out of \nthe Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and \nthere are positive statements that the full $18 billion may be included \nin the final Foreign Ops bill reported out of the full Committee next \nweek. That was welcome news to those of us who strongly believe the IMF \ncan play a positive role in addressing financial crises all over the \nworld and restore important markets for US products. Now that new loans \nhave been negotiated for Russia, the IMF's reserves are close to \ndepletion. For the first time in many years, it has had to tap into its \nemergency fund. While I would have preferred the replenishment had been \ndealt with months ago, the logjam appears to have been broken.\n  Of course, there is one complicating factor. The funds are attached \nto the Foreign Operations bill--the appropriations bill that has been \nstymied by an inability of the House and the White House to work out \nthe Mexico City abortion language which is annually attached to this \nappropriations bill.\n  While some may prefer not to have to fight controversial battles on \nappropriations bills, this is an issue that will not just go away. The \nsponsor is committed to bringing it up until it can be resolved to his \nsatisfaction. Last year, a revised version, a substantial compromise, \nwas attached to the State Department Reauthorization Conference Report \nand held up that report because of the veto threat of the President. \nThat effort included a reorganization plan supported by the \nAdministration that had been pursued for several years.\n  That is still being held up, and the IMF funding will likely be held \nup as well until the Mexico City issue is settled. The latest Mexico \nCity compromise was a good attempt at solving this dispute. If the \nPresident really wants the IMF replenishment, he should exercise the \nneeded leadership to work out the Mexico City language with the House \nas soon as possible. My colleagues in the minority can do more to help \nus achieve the replenishment by urging the President to pursue a \nresolution of Mexico City before any other alternative. I ask the \nMinority Leader for this assistance.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the current \ncontroversy over whether Secret Service agents and employees should \ntestify before the grand jury convened by the Independent Counsel, \nJudge Kenneth Starr. At noon today, the Chief Justice of the United \nStates denied the Department of Justice's request for a stay of the \norder compelling Secret Service agents to comply with subpoenas. Thus, \nevery level of the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court, has \nnow rejected the arguments advanced by the Department of Justice in \nsupport of a judicially-created ``protective function'' privilege. I \nsincerely hope that the Service and the Department will abide by these \ndecisions and that the agents will testify truthfully and fully before \nthe grand jury.\n  In my view, the Secret Service's duty to protect the President does \nraise legitimate issues about whether agents should receive special \nprivileges before being forced to disclose what they see or hear as a \nresult of being so physically close to the President. However, the \nDepartment of Justice has taken these legitimate factual concerns and \nused them for political reasons to mount a fruitless legal battle to \nfind a court, any court, to concoct this privilege out of thin air. In \nso doing, at least in my opinion, the Department has squandered its own \ncredibility and acted solely as the defense attorney for the President \nin his personal legal problems.\n  The trial judge and the D.C. Circuit have it right: there is no way \nfor a court to conjure up a ``protective function'' privilege out of \nwhole cloth. The Court of Appeals which rejected the Department's \narguments concluded:\n\n       We leave to Congress the question whether a protective \n     function privilege is appropriate\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\n     in order to ensure the safety of the President and, if so, \n     what the contours of that privilege should be.\n\n  I have offered to lead such an effort in the Congress to craft a \nnarrow privilege, and therefore I am at a loss as to the Department's \nmotivations for so many appeals. I am worried, however, that the \nlengthy obstruction will lead my colleagues to conclude that the \nService is not worthy of our support, and make it much more difficult \nfor me to try to help them.\n  The narrow privilege I envision would address legitimate concerns of \nthe Secret Service, but I am sure it would not be the broad, \nimpenetrable privilege advocated by the Service, nor should it be. But \na Congressional solution which ``splits the baby'' is possible. As the \nWashington Post concluded in an editorial this morning:\n\n       Any protection must recognize the responsibility of law \n     enforcement officers to aid criminal investigations.\n\n  I hope that the circumstances when testimony by Secret Service agents \nis taken are limited to the most serious cases where the testimony is \nunique and directly related to accusations of criminal behavior. I am \nconcerned, for example, that agents should not, under normal \ncircumstances, be forced to testify before Congressional Committees or \nin civil matters. Again, I plan to address these issues when the \nJudiciary Committee holds hearings next year.\n  One particular issue I will address during these hearings is whether \nthe presence of a Secret Service agent at a conversation between an \nattorney and the protected person should negate the attorney-client \nprivilege. Now the law generally is that having another non-lawyer \npresent voids the privilege, at least as to that person. I do not \nbelieve we want this outcome, and I plan to work on creating an \nexception to correct this problem. I should point out that press \naccounts have recounted promises made by Judge Starr that he will not \nattempt to use testimony by Secret Service personnel to pierce \nprotected conversations.\n  I have to also add that if Secret Service Agent Cockell was in the \nPresident's presence because he had to be in the car to protect the \nPresident, and overheard conversations between the President and Mr. \nBennett, his attorney, or between the President and Mr. Kendall, his \nattorney, or any other attorney of the President's, he had to be there \nas much as the seat they sat on had to be there. So I hope, even though \ntechnically the privilege would be waived because of Secret Servant \nAgent Cockell, I hope the Independent Counsel would respect that \nparticular position of the Secret Service agent, and I have no doubt \nthat he would. After all, there is some comity that must occur, even in \nmatters like these.\n  In any event, that is something we can clarify next year, and I \nintend to do so. I have to say, neither attorney Robert Bennett nor \nDavid Kendall is an inexperienced attorney. I doubt if either of them \nwould have discussed crucial secret matters with the President before \nanybody else, including a Secret Service agent. So I think this is a \nmuch overblown point, and I have no doubt that Judge Starr did not \nintend to pierce that type of conversation anyway. But that still does \nnot relieve the Secret Service agents of their duty as law enforcement \nofficers to make sure that criminal activity is not undertaken or, if \nit is undertaken, to make sure that they do everything they can to stop \nit.\n  I should note, however, that the Secret Service has been its own \nworst enemy here. No court is going to create this privilege out of \nthin air, and thus until Congress acts, the Service may have to provide \ntestimony without any exceptions. I am talking about this so-called \n``protective function'' privilege. But rather than come to Congress to \nwork constructively, the Service has fought a futile effort in the \ncourts of this land.\n  Many of the President's apologists have cited this current \ncontroversy as another alleged example of Judge Starr being too \naggressive in his search for evidence related to the Lewinsky matter. \nBut let's look at the record:\n  When Judge Starr sought evidence from White House employees, the \nJustice Department and the White House claimed privilege: the court \nsided with Starr.\n  When Judge Starr sought evidence from government attorneys, the \nJustice Department and the White House claimed privilege: the court \nsided with Starr.\n  When Judge Starr sought evidence from Secret Service agents, the \nService and the Department claimed privilege: the court sided with \nStarr.\n  When Judge Starr sought evidence from Monica Lewinsky's first \nattorney, he claimed privilege: the court sided with Starr.\n  When Judge Starr sought evidence from a bookstore, it claimed \nprivilege: the court sided with Starr.\n  And just over the last 48 hours when Judge Starr sought evidence from \nadditional Secret Service personnel, the Justice Department and the \nWhite House claimed privilege: the District Court, the Court of Appeals \nand the Supreme Court all sided with Starr.\n  I hope when the pundits talk about these controversies, they remember \nthat, when it comes to debates on privileges, Judge Starr has an \nimpressive record. It is easy to criticize a prosecutor for being \noverly-aggressive in seeking evidence, but let us all remember that \nJudge Starr has not only a right, but an obligation, to conduct a \ncomplete investigation within the bounds of the law. As demonstrated by \nhis impeccable record before impartial judges, he has done exactly \nthat.\n  Lastly, it is hard to believe that the same White House that less \nthan six weeks ago fought Judge Starr's request to have the Supreme \nCourt take an expedited appeal of the Secret Service issue--and then \ngloated when the Supreme Court denied the request--resorted to an \nemergency appeal to the exact same court on the same issue. The \nhypocrisy speaks for itself.\n  Mr. President, I have confidence that Judge Starr will do what is \nright here. I have confidence that the Secret Service men and women \nwill do what is right here. There is no excuse for the Justice \nDepartment--nor, I might add, the Treasury Department--to continue to \npursue these fruitless claims. I was willing to go along with the \npursuit of the claims to try to get the court involved en banc--the 11 \nsitting judges of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia--to \nmake a decision on this. But anything beyond that just smacks of delay, \nand I believe that is exactly what is happening, especially since the \nWhite House has been slapped down so hard and the Justice Department \nhas been slapped down in no uncertain terms, a number of times, on this \nvery issue. I think it is time for them to wake up and realize they \nrepresent all of the taxpayers in this country and that they have an \nobligation to live within the law themselves and to not make any \nfurther frivolous appeals of this matter.\n  It is my understanding that they still are asking for the Supreme \nCourt to grant certiorari in this matter. I can't imagine why they \nwould do that after what they have seen in both the district court and \nnow the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and with the rejection of the \nstay by Justice Rehnquist. It seems to me that just smacks of another \nfruitless appeal for delay.\n  I do understand why the head of the Secret Service and others would \nfight for their Secret Service people and would try to take it to the \nnth degree. But that nth degree, it seems to me, ended with the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Anything more than that \nseems to me to be highly frivolous, a delaying tactic that literally \nshould not be done.\n  I think the Secret Service ought to come to us and help us to fashion \na way so they can have certain protections with regard to the closeness \nthat they have to the President of the United States, and we will try \nto give them that kind of protection. We will try to find some way of \ngiving them a privilege from testifying in matters that do not involve \ncriminal activity, among other things.\n  We will have to have hearings, and we will have to look at it very \ncarefully, because it is a broad privilege they are asking for. They \nwill never get exactly what they want, because I think people on both \nsides of the aisle will acknowledge that if it comes to criminal \nactivity, if there is any criminal activity that they have observed or \nthey participated in--and I doubt they have done anything like that, \nand I hope they haven't observed any criminal activity--they have an \nobligation, as law enforcement officers, to cooperate with the courts \nand to cooperate in\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\ngetting to the bottom of these things and getting these matters \nresolved.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues for letting me have this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as every Senator is aware, a number of \nCommittees are investigating the national security impacts of two parts \nof the U.S. relationship with China: the launching of American \ncommercial satellites on Chinese rockets, and the so-called ``China \nPlan'' to influence the American political process through campaign \ndonations.\n  Earlier this week the Majority Leader came to the floor to announce \nwhat he called ``major interim judgments'' of his task force \ncoordinating this investigation. His remarks sparked a round of debate \nand speculation that may have clouded the real issues at hand, and I \nwould like to take a moment to respond.\n  These are unquestionably significant issues that merit serious, \nobjective review. For me and for the Democratic Senators on our \ninvestigation task force, the objective is simple: national security.\n  We want the national security to be enhanced; we want American lives \nand American interests protected.\n  If the Senate's work on the satellite export issue reveals flaws in \nour export controls that endanger national security, we want those \nflaws corrected--now.\n  If the facts warrant, we will gladly join with our Republican \ncolleagues to that end. But there should be no place for politics, for \npartisan political maneuvering, when it comes to national security.\n  We also want U.S. law to be enforced without fear or favor. If the \nlaw was violated in campaign financing for the 1996 election, \nDemocratic Senators want the guilty held accountable. The best way to \nensure this occurs is not to discuss classified information associated \nwith these cases, and thereby avoid impeding or damaging the FBI's and \nthe Justice Department's ability to investigate and build cases.\n  In short, we care about this investigation because we care about \nnational security.\n  One of the most important guardians of national security is the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. This is a unique committee, \nMr. President. It is not set up like others. It has a vice-chairman, \nnot a ranking member. Its makeup gives the majority party just a one-\nvote advantage regardless of the composition of the Senate.\n  We try to keep partisanship out of most things we do, but in the case \nof this Committee, Mr. President, we insist on it, because Americans \nare more safe when Congress can conduct oversight of intelligence \nfunctions in a manner that is not just bipartisan, but nonpartisan.\n  It is for this reason that I agreed with the Majority Leader's \ndecision to assign primary responsibility to the vital China \ninvestigation to the Intelligence Committee. And it is also for this \nreason that I am so gravely disappointed when its nonpartisan tradition \nis violated.\n  That tradition makes the assertion earlier this week that ``interim \njudgments'' had been reached in the China matter particularly \ndisturbing. The Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the \nsenator from Nebraska, said they most assuredly had not, a fact \nsubsequently confirmed by the Chairman.\n  The Democratic priority is national security. National security is a \ncomplex and demanding topic in today's world. While several Senate \ncommittees consider the effect on Chinese ballistic missiles of \nlaunching American commercial satellites in China, this nation faces \nmany other equally grave and immediate threats to our national \nsecurity.\n  For example, Russia, which is now in an economic and military \ntailspin, has thousands of nuclear warheads and many tons of fissile \nmaterial from which warheads could be made at stake and perhaps in \njeopardy.\n  The temptation in Russia today to look the other way while such \nmaterials quietly migrate to rogue states must be acute. That's one way \nin which Russia's problems threaten the United States.\n  Other threats appear in the headlines for a few days and then recede \nfrom public view, but they are still out there: the very unstable \nnuclear confrontation in South Asia, the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction by Iran and other rogue states, the growing conflict in \nKosovo, the growing tension between the Koreas, the still-tense Bosnia \nsituation.\n  We are also threatened today by non-nation state actors, the \nterrorist organizations who plot to kill or kidnap Americans overseas, \nand the crime cartels who use today's increasingly open international \nborders to bring narcotics and other criminal activity to our shores. \nInformation warfare and the relationship between computers and our \nnational infrastructure is another arena in which hostile nations, \nmovements, or even individuals can threaten us.\n  All these threats present greater challenges to the defense, \nintelligence, and law enforcement establishments than they encountered \nduring the cold war.\n  At the same time, the haystack is growing, the needles are as small \nas ever. We need to support and strengthen our capabilities in these \nareas. We need to be able to react quickly to changing threats and \ndevelop the brainpower to master environments ranging from now-obscure \nforeign cultures at one extreme, to global cyberspace at the other.\n  The one thing we should not do is stand pat, as if winning the cold \nwar gives us the right to relax.\n  Congress authorizes and appropriates funds for the elements of \ngovernment that defend against, deter, or counter the threats: the \nworld's most capable military forces, informed by the world's leading \nintelligence services, as well as law enforcement entities which are \nsecond to none. It is our responsibility in Congress to fund these \nactivities, to guide their continued improvement, and to oversee what \nthey do.\n  If these departments and agencies are essential to our national \nsecurity--and they are--then our Congressional authorization, \nappropriation and oversight processes for these activities are also \nessential to national security.\n  The need to address these issues underscores the importance of the \nIntelligence Committee's mandate. To approach these matters in a spirit \nof partisanship arguably puts the national security at risk.\n  As for the China inquiry, to my knowledge, none of the four \ncommittees that have conducted hearings on the matter has reached any \nconclusions, interim or otherwise. Many documents already in the \npossession of Congress have not even been reviewed. Other documents \nhave not yet been received from the administration, which is working \nhard to comply with the sweeping document requests they have gotten \nfrom Congress.\n  So it is premature to reach even interim conclusions. To do so \nsubverts the Congressional oversight process.\n  I would prefer not to be here discussing ongoing investigations. But \nI think it is important to correct the record so that from this point \non we can let the committees do their work.\n  It has been suggested this week on the Senate floor that the Clinton \nadministration's export controls for satellites are wholly inadequate. \nThat statement should be considered in its historical context.\n  The policy of exporting satellites for launch on Chinese rockets was \ninitiated in 1988 under President Reagan and has continued under \nPresidents Bush and Clinton. President Bush authorized the export of 9 \nsatellites to China in three years. Each of these satellites could only \nbe exported after President Bush determined that the transaction was in \nthe U.S. national interest and that the Tianamen sanctions should be \nwaived.\n  President Clinton did make some changes in the licensing process for \nthe export of commercial communications satellites.\n  President Bush transferred licensing authority for over one-half of \nall commercial satellites from State to Commerce and recommended that \nserious consideration be given to moving the rest over to Commerce. \nPresident Clinton completed this transfer and issued\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nan executive order that greatly increased the role of the Defense \nDepartment in these decisions. In recent testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, a witness, otherwise critical of the Clinton \nadministration, acknowledged that the United States has the strongest \nand best export controls in the world!\n  Does this mean the system is perfect? Certainly not. No multi-agency \nprocess involving thousands of decisionmakers and difficult technical \nand political issues can be. In fact, as a result of some of the \ninformation disclosed in the early stages of the hearings, I believe \nsome modification is probably in order. For example, the Departments of \nDefense and State should see the final text of all licenses.\n  However, these are minor fixes in a system that, according to State, \nCommerce, Defense, and the intelligence community, is working well.\n  Second, it has been asserted that sensitive technology related to \nsatellite exports has been transferred to China. Under the Clinton \nadministration, all requests to launch U.S. satellites aboard Chinese \nrockets go through an exhaustive and careful scrutiny. The Departments \nof Defense and State must approve all licenses and always place U.S. \nnational security in the forefront of their decision process. Their \nprimary role in this process is to specifically design procedures to \nensure that China's access to U.S. technology is limited solely to what \nis needed to mate the U.S. satellite to the Chinese launcher.\n  If these procedures are properly followed, the Chinese learn little, \nif anything, about our satellites or the technology they contain. \nIndeed, the Chinese gain no direct access to our satellites and only \ntake ownership of the U.S. satellites they purchase from us after they \nare successfully placed in orbit.\n  Third, it has been charged that China has received military benefit \nfrom U.S. satellite exports, and reference has been made to Chinese \nmissiles pointed at U.S. nuclear cities. These very same missiles were \ndeveloped years before President Reagan decided to allow U.S. \nsatellites to be placed atop Chinese launchers.\n  Furthermore, Intelligence Committee hearings have been held on this \nvery issue. And I might say all of them were closed hearings, and \npublic accounts of those hearings fail to substantiate this sensational \ncharge. There is no public account, to my understanding, that \nsubstantiates the sensational charges made earlier by people on this \nfloor.\n  The final specific charge I will address today is the assertion that \nnew evidence has come to light about a Chinese plan to influence our \npolitical process, and that this new evidence should lead the Attorney \nGeneral to appoint an independent counsel. Unfortunately, the ``new'' \nevidence cited is highly classified and cannot and should not be \ndiscussed publicly.\n  Mr. President, publicly characterizing classified information under \nany circumstance is dangerous. Using it to make charges against which \nthe accused are unable to defend themselves is even more so.\n  Classification is a misunderstood, sometimes frustrating, thing. It \nis difficult to explain and understand why we keep some things secret. \nWell, the reason is simple. Americans, and our friends around the \nworld, quite literally risk their lives to gather this information \nbecause we promise to protect them.\n  When classified information is characterized, the sources who collect \nintelligence and the methods by which they do so are in danger. \nFurthermore, because the information involved was classified, those \nciting it are fully aware that the individuals involved cannot, under \nlaw, use that information to reply.\n  I will resist the temptation to place on the Record my own \ncharacterization of this new classified information. Instead, I will \nsimply make the point that we have heard Republican Members make \nequally ominous proclamations about the China-plot in the past only to \nsee that these facts fail to substantiate their own allegations.\n  Moreover, Attorney General Janet Reno has access to all relevant \ninformation, classified and unclassified. She has not been reluctant to \ncall for a special prosecutor in the past, and I am confident that \nshould the facts warrant, she will not hesitate to do so in this case.\n  These observations cover my concerns about what has been voiced by \ncritics of this administration's export policies. However, my greatest \nreservation is the result of what has not been stated. These critics \nrepeatedly fail to mention that the last six Presidents--Democratic and \nRepublican alike--have each concluded it is in our national interest to \nengage China, not isolate it.\n  Specifically, every President since Ronald Reagan has agreed that our \nnational security is enhanced as a result of allowing the Chinese to \nplace U.S. satellites in orbit.\n  Based on current information, I agree with this assessment. I believe \nit is in our national interest to dominate the world's commercial \nsatellite market. This is a strategic industry vital to our defense. We \nsimply cannot be the dominant power in today's high-tech world without \nthis industry and others like it.\n  This industry also produces tens of thousands of challenging, high-\npaying jobs for Americans. So when the Chinese choose an American \nsatellite instead of a foreign satellite, that is good for our security \nas well as our economy. But the underlying point is that congressional \ncommittees are taking a fresh look at all these issues. Therefore, I \nwill reserve final judgment pending their findings.\n  The China investigations now underway could have significant, \npositive benefit for national security. That is my goal and the goal of \nthe Democratic task force. We look forward to working with Senator Lott \nand Republican members of his task force to get an outcome that makes \nAmerica safer.\n  I applaud many members of our task force and the work done by members \nof the committee. The next speaker, Mr. President, deserves special \ncommendation. He is not only a member of the Intelligence Committee, \nbut he is our ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. I do not \nknow of anyone who has put more time and effort into sifting through \nthese facts and attempting as best as he can, in as objective a manner \nas he can, what the facts are. He has done so in a fashion that is \ncommensurate with his reputation. I commend him again for his studious \nand thoughtful analysis and the work that he has provided not only to \nour task force but to the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, let me thank the Democratic leader for those kind \ncomments.\n  It is my intention just to briefly amplify what the Democratic leader \nsaid here this afternoon. And I am greatly appreciative for the \ntremendous support that he has given to an effort to achieve a \nbipartisan approach to an issue which should be approached in a \nbipartisan manner. There is no justification for partisanizing this \nissue. It will weaken our security if we do so. And the Democratic \nleader's effort to insist that we approach this issue in a bipartisan \nway, I hope, will produce some results.\n  Mr. President, the statement that was released last Tuesday by the \nmajority leader was a highly partisan approach to the multiple hearings \nwhich we have had in the Senate relative to the export of satellites to \nChina.\n  I happen to sit on three of the four Senate committees that have held \nthese hearings, so I speak from personal experience when I say that the \nmajority leader's statement omitted some of the most important \ntestimony that those committees received.\n  His statement also conveyed the false impression that the statement \nwas a bipartisan product, when to the best of my knowledge not a single \nDemocrat was consulted or even knew that the statement was being \nprepared.\n  The majority leader's statements claim that he was being careful not \nto rush to judgment, but then he offered such unequivocal conclusions \nas:\n\n       The Clinton Administration's export controls for satellites \n     are wholly inadequate, [and that] they have not protected \n     sensitive U.S. technology, [and that] national security \n     concerns are regularly downplayed and even ignored, [and \n     that] sensitive technology related to satellite exports has \n     been transferred to China, [and that] China has received \n     military benefit from U.S. satellite exports.\n\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\n\n  To my knowledge, Mr. President, not one of the Senate committees \ninvestigating these issues has reached those conclusions. The evidence \nthat the majority leader offered to support his conclusions ignored \nsome of the most important testimony that we received, obviously, \nbecause it contradicted their conclusions offered.\n  For example, the majority leader's statement ignored testimony by \nsenior Department of Defense and State officials on June 18 and 25 and \non July 8 that the 1996 Clinton Executive order ``strengthened'' the \nDepartment of Defense's role in Commerce export licenses, rather than \nweakening it, and also ignored the fact that those Department of \nDefense and State Department officials believed ``it would be a bad \nthing'' to return to State licensing of commercial satellites.\n  In a June 18 hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security on which I sit, when responding \nto a question on whether commercial satellite export licensing should \nbe returned to the State Department, Department of Defense, Principal \nDeputy Under Secretary for Policy Jan Lodal testified that ``I think it \nwould be a bad thing to do.'' And Assistant Under Secretary of State \nfor International Security John Holum, testified, ``I agree. . . . I \nwould recommend against that.''\n  Mr. President, the statement of the majority leader last Tuesday also \nignored the Department of Defense and State Department letters which \nwere included in the June 18 Governmental Affairs Committee \nsubcommittee hearing record and which stated that each agency has an \nadequate opportunity to revise and support the issuance of all \nsatellite export licenses actually issued by Commerce since 1990.\n  The majority leader's statement ignored testimony on June 18 by \nsenior State and DOD officials, stating that they are unaware of any \ntransfer of sensitive U.S. satellite technology to China that has \nharmed U.S. national security.\n  Mr. Holum testified, ``[W]e do not believe that any launch of a \ncommercial satellite under this policy since 1988 has resulted in a \ntransfer of significant technology or assistance to Chinese either \nspace-launch vehicle capabilities or missile capabilities.''\n  Mr. Lodal testified, ``I agree. We're not aware of any situation in \nwhich such transfer harmed U.S. security.'' Yet the majority leader's \nstatement ignores that kind of testimony.\n  Now, the majority leader's statement cited testimony critical of U.S. \nexport control from a June 25 hearing before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee by an individual that the majority leader described as a \n``senior official of the Defense Trade and Security Administration,'' \nwithout mentioning testimony the following week before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee revealing that this individual, Dr. Peter Leitner, \nhad been demoted by the Bush administration from a senior policy \nposition to a lower-level licensing officer within that office. The \nstatement of the majority leader also omitted testimony on June 25 and \non July 9 by some of Dr. Leitner's current and former superiors at the \nDepartment of Defense contradicting Mr. Leitner's facts and assertions.\n  The majority leader's statement cites testimony by the GAO before the \nSenate Intelligence Committee on June 10, but omitted testimony from \nthe same hearing indicating that the General Accounting Office has not \nreached a conclusion on whether current export controls are adequate to \nprotect national security, and he omitted to say that the Intelligence \nCommittee had requested the General Accounting Office to conclude that \nanalysis. Now, the relevant testimony came from Katherine Schinasi, the \nAssociate Director of the International Affairs Division at the General \nAccounting Office. Responding to a question about Department of \nDefense's ability to effectively advocate national security interests \nin the current export control process, she testified on behalf of the \nGeneral Accounting Office that, ``We have not looked at how that \nprocess has operated.''\n  The majority leader's statement indicates that moving satellites from \nthe State Department to the Commerce Department eliminated the \nrequirement that Congress receive notice of individual export licenses. \nThe statement failed to mention the legal requirement that the \nPresident must notify Congress of all national security waivers \nauthorizing commercial satellite exports to China, whether the export \nlicense is issued by State or by Commerce. The majority leader's \nstatement also failed to note that Congress has, in fact, received \ntimely notice of every waiver granted to export a satellite to China; \nand that Congress has received timely notice of the decisions in 1992 \nand 1996 to transfer satellites from the State Department to the \nCommerce Department. It fails to acknowledge that despite receiving all \nthose notices, Congress took no action to express disagreement with the \ndecisions made.\n  The majority leader's statement also omitted mention of the National \nSecurity Council letter included in the July 9 Senate Armed Services \nCommittee hearing record, stating that the National Security Council \nconducts the same waiver review process for commercial satellite \nexports to China, whether the export license is issued by the State \nDepartment or by the Commerce Department.\n  The majority leader's report omitted testimony on June 18 and July 8 \nbefore the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on international security, \nby senior Defense and State Department officials that, after the 3 \nunmonitored satellite launches took place in China, a policy decision \nwas made in 1996 and remains in effect today, requiring the Defense \nDepartment to monitor all satellite launches, whether or not a \nsatellite contains sensitive technology.\n  Mr. Lodal, speaking for the Defense Department, testified on June 18 \nthat\n\n       Communication [satellite] licenses include strong \n     safeguards, including DOD monitoring . . . DOD currently \n     reviews all communication satellite licenses to ensure that \n     the proposed export would be consistent with U.S. national \n     security interests . . . [A]fter the implementation of the \n     1992 Bush administration decision to transfer to Commerce \n     purely commercial satellites, and before the 1996 revision, \n     there were three launches that were not monitored . . . We're \n     not aware of any transfer of technology from these \n     unmonitered launches that contributed to China's missile and \n     military satellite capabilities.\n\n  He continued, speaking for the Defense Department:\n\n       Nevertheless, DOD did conclude that full monitoring would \n     be a strong safeguard at relatively low cost to the \n     companies, and that it should be applied to all license \n     cases, even those that did not require Department of State \n     licenses. And this was agreed by all agencies and \n     incorporated as a requirement in 1996, when jurisdiction was \n     transferred to Commerce for all commercial communications \n     satellites. . . .''\n\n  The majority leader's statement identified the major ``military \nbenefit'' of China launches of U.S.-made commercial satellites to be \nthe access gained by the Chinese military to an improved commercial \ntelephone system, without acknowledging that that same so-called \nmilitary benefit would have accrued if China had instead launched \nEuropean-made commercial satellites.\n  The majority leader's statement ignored testimony from Clinton \nadministration critics on July 9 before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that the United States export control system is still the \n``best'' and most restrictive in the world.\n  Now, the majority leader has the right to say whatever he wishes on \nthe subject of satellite exports to China. But he is wrong to suggest, \nas his statement did, that his conclusions were bipartisan, or that \nthey were reached by the Senate committees examining this issue. His \nstatement struck a major blow to whatever hopes there were that the \nSenate committees would proceed in this matter in a bipartisan way, \nwith emphasis on the facts rather than on partisan politics.\n  Mr. President, I hope that a bipartisan approach can still be \nsalvaged. But I think it is fair to say that that goal, that effort \nwhich is so important to the national security of this Nation, was \ngiven a set-back by the highly partisan comments of the majority leader \non this floor last Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week the Senate made an important \nstatement that we support Taiwan by passing S. Con. Resolution 107. And \nthat we are committed to her people, to her government and to her \ndemocratic way of life.\n  While we have made countless statements in this body before \nconcerning Taiwan, the circumstances which led to S. Con. Res. 107 were \ndifferent--markedly different--from those in the past. During the \nPresident's trip to China last month, President Clinton ``clarified'' \nhis policy toward Taiwan. He indicated while in Beijing--that the \nUnited States, in agreeing to the One China policy, had agreed with \nChina that reunification would be peaceful. Further, while in Shanghai, \nhe went a step further and, for the first time, uttered that the United \nStates supports the ``Three Noes'' long advocated by the government of \nthe People's Republic of China. That is: the United States does not \nsupport one-Taiwan, one China; the United States does not support \nTaiwan independence; and the United States does not support Taiwan's \nmembership in nation-state based international organizations.\n  To understand why this concerns me, Mr. President, one needs to \nunderstand the nuances of our federal law and policy toward Taiwan. It \nis in the Taiwan Relations Act, which was passed by Congress and signed \ninto law by the President in 1979--back when the United States \nofficially broke off relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan in \nfavor of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Section 2(b)(3) states \nthat ``. . . the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful \nmeans.'' We have also signed Three Joint Communiques with the PRC which \naddress the Taiwan question. While they all speak to the peaceful \nresolution of the Taiwan question, none goes so far to speak to the \nquestion of reunification.\n  Up to now, the saving grace of American policy toward China and \nTaiwan, if there were any grace to it, was the ambiguity. China did not \nknow what the United States would do if Taiwan declared independence; \nor if China attacked. They thought they found out in 1996, when the \nPresident rightly sent two aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Straits to \nshow our strength and resolve--while the Chinese conducted missile \ntests aimed at influencing the national presidential elections in \nTaiwan. But we have a whole new ballgame, now Mr. President. What a \ndifference a day makes.\n  Incredible, Mr. President. The Administration then feigns innocence \nand insists that the President's remarks did not constitute a policy \nchange and that our policy on Taiwan has not changed since 1979--that \nit is the same now as it was then. I'm sorry, but I have to expose this \nfor what it is--a world of make believe. If you repeat something enough \ntimes, eventually people will take it as the gospel. Well not this \ntime.\n  This is a policy change; and a serious one at that. Considered \ncollectively, which I know the Chinese government is doing, it appears \nto be a major concession by the United States on the issue of Taiwan. \nAs I said last Tuesday, I know the Chinese; and understand full well \nthat they will use it to their utmost advantage. They will tell Taiwan \nand the Taiwanese people that if they declare independence, even if by \ndemocratic referendum (one person, one vote), that the United States \nwill not support them. Case in point, the Washington Post article last \nFriday, ``China Tells Taiwan to `Face Reality' Reunification Talks \nUrged.'' Although I brought this to the Senate's attention last week, I \nthink the point needs to be reiterated so that people are on notice. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of this article appear in the \nCongressional Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This article points out that ``Chinese officials have \nsaid they plan to use the remarks as a lever to force Taiwan into \npolitical talks on reunification.'' So let me make sure I understand \nthis--the leader of the greatest democratic society in the history of \nmankind, has tacitly agreed to a policy which, in itself, undermines \ndemocracy. How and why is this possible? Because political expediency \ntook the place of sound policy and support for one of our strongest \nallies in an increasingly unstable Asian Theater. Well, Mr. President, \nI am afraid that these developments may have simply added to the Asian \nuncertainty, rather than clarified it.\n  In agreeing to the ``Three Noes'', President Clinton has effectively \nstated that the United States will not support Taiwan independence even \nif Beijing agrees to it. Is this the message that was intended to be \ndelivered? Think about it--the United States used to maintain the line \nthat peaceful resolution was all that mattered because this in itself \nprotected the rights of the 21 million people in Taiwan. If they could \ncut a deal with Beijing that allowed the two to go their separate ways, \npresumably our earlier policy would be fine with that. Personally, as \nthe PRC becomes more open, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that an \nagreement could be reached. But President Clinton's remarks have ruled \nthis possibility out--because the United States will not support an \nindependent Taiwan. President Clinton just told the Chinese that they \ndon't need to negotiate with Taiwan because so far as we are concerned \nan independent Taiwan is not an option.\n  Although most of my colleagues are not aware of this, there is a \nterrible contagion going through Taiwan right now--it is very similar \nto polio. Estimates are that up to one million people may be carrying \nthis bug in some form or another, but it doesn't impact adults. Only \nthe children. In fact, a number of children in Taiwan have died from \nthis disease which, as I understand it, is exacerbated by the heat.\n  Well, Mr. President, Taiwan has applied for membership in the World \nHealth Organization (WHO)--it is a national priority. But, even this \napplication cannot proceed because membership in the WHO requires \nstatehood. And that huge island off the coast of China, which we \nrecognized officially from 1949 to 1979, doesn't have it. This is \nridiculous, and it is about to get a lot worse. So, Taiwan is suffering \nfrom an epidemic which is killing children, and it can't get access \nfrom WHO specialists who might be able to help because Taiwan is not a \nsovereign government? Although the PRC has never controlled Taiwan, and \ndespite the fact that Taiwan has developed a strong democracy and \nthriving, stable free market economy, it cannot particpate in the World \nHealth Organization. Well, Mr. President, this seems yet another time \nwhen the facts somehow lose out to the politics.\n  Mr. President, we have made statements reiterating our support for \nTaiwan, but it is time for us to back them up. The Senate should pass \nS. Con. Resolution 30 calling on the Administration to support Taiwan's \nbid to take part in international organizations; and we should expand \nit to include the World Health Organization. We should take every \nopportunity in this body to force the issue, so that our commitment to \nTaiwan does not ring hollow as Beijing's steps up the pressure.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     China Tells Taiwan to Face Reality--Reunification Talks Urged\n\n                           (By John Pomfret)\n\n       BEIJING, July 9--China urged Taiwan today to ``face \n     reality'' and agree to talks on eventual reunification with \n     China following comments by President Clinton that the United \n     States will not support an independent Taiwan.\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\n       Taiwan, meanwhile, announced it had agreed to a visit by a \n     senior Beijing negotiator to prepare for resumption of high-\n     level dialogue between the two rivals, separated by the 100-\n     mile-wide Taiwan Strait.\n       The developments indicate that after a three-year freeze, \n     talks could begin as early as this fall between the two \n     sides. They also underscore the important role the United \n     States has played in forcing Taiwan to the bargaining table. \n     Clinton's statement, during his recent nine-day trip to \n     China, was taken as a significant defeat in Taiwan even \n     though U.S. officials contended it was simply a reiteration \n     of U.S. policy.\n       Clinton's June 30 remarks in Shanghai made clear the United \n     States would not support any formal independence bid by the \n     island of 21 million people, or a policy backing ``one China, \n     one Taiwan,'' or ``two Chinas.'' Clinton also said the United \n     States will oppose any Taiwanese bid to join international \n     bodies that accept only sovereign states as members.\n       Although the policy was first enunciated in October, \n     Clinton himself had never said it publicly before. Thus, it \n     was taken as a major defeat in Taiwan, which relies on the \n     United States for most of its political support and weapons. \n     In Washington, Clinton's statement has drawn some criticism. \n     On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) \n     called Clinton's remarks counterproductive, and he threatened \n     unspecified congressional action.\n       The Beijing government, which views Taiwan as a renegade \n     Chinese province, has said it is satisfied with Clinton's \n     remarks, even though it had tried to have Clinton commit them \n     to writing. Chinese officials have said they plan to use the \n     remarks as a lever to force Taiwan into political talks on \n     reunification. Taiwanese officials say they want to limit any \n     new talks to specific issues, such as immigration, cross-\n     border crime, fishing rights and protection of investments. \n     China rejects this limited approach and insists a broader \n     discussion of reunification is necessary for improved ties.\n       Taiwan and China ostensibly have been separated since 1895, \n     when Japan occupied the island following its victory over \n     Imperial China in the Sino-Japanese War. In 1949, Nationalist \n     Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan from the \n     mainland after his forces lost a civil war to Chinese \n     Communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Since then, the two sides \n     have moved further away from each other--in both economic and \n     political development.\n       In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said \n     Clinton's statement has ``positive implications for the \n     resolution of the Taiwan question,'' and he added: ``We hope \n     that Taiwan authorities will get a clear understanding of the \n     situation, face reality and place importance on the national \n     interest.\n       ``Similarly, the official China Daily quoted one of \n     Beijing's top negotiators with Taiwan as saying that \n     Clinton's remarks had helped China. ``This has provided \n     favorable conditions for the development of cross-strait \n     relations,'' said Tang Shubei, vice president of the \n     Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. ``But \n     cross-strait issues will ultimately be solved by the Chinese \n     people.'' Meanwhile, that group's Taiwanese counterpart, the \n     semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, informed the \n     Chinese association that its deputy secretary general, Li \n     Yafei, could visit Taiwan July 24-31. Li's visit is to be \n     followed by a reciprocal trip to China by the leader of the \n     Taiwan foundation, Koo Chen-fu. In June, Beijing invited Koo \n     to visit China sometime in September or October, and Koo said \n     later he plans to go in mid-September.\n       In 1993, Koo and Chinese association leader Wang Daohan met \n     in Singapore in a landmark gathering that signaled warming \n     ties between the old rivals. But after two years of improving \n     relations, the ties collapsed in 1995 when Taiwanese \n     President Lee Teng-hui obtained a visa to visit the United \n     States for the 25th reunion of his Cornell University class.\n       China launched a series of military exercises off the \n     Taiwanese coast in 1995 and 1996, lobbing cruise missiles \n     into the area. In 1996, the United States dispatched two \n     aircraft carrier battle groups to the region as a warning to \n     China not to contemplate a military solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8472-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RUTH E. CROXTON\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have on my right an obituary. This \nobituary is very meaningful to the people of a small village in Alaska \ncalled King Cove.\n  Ruth E. Croxton, 29, was killed July 15, 1981, when her twin-engine \nplane crashed and burned on a hillside. The plane was on approach to \nthe King Cove, Alaska airstrip--in what was called ``typical Aleutian \nweather.'' Five other people died in the accident, including the pilot, \nErnest D. Fife.\n  Ms. Croxton was an anthropologist, a pilot, and a 1974 graduate of \nthe University of Alaska-Fairbanks. Born in Salem, Ore., her family \nmoved to Alaska when she was six years old. She was graduated from \nJuneau-Douglas High School in 1969.\n  Ms. Croxton and her pilot were bringing four cannery workers into \nKing Cove but would have been evacuating a medical case once they \nreached the Aleutian village.\n  She is survived by Mr. and Mrs. Loren Croxton of Petersburg; a \nsister, Mary, of Barrow; and her maternal grandfather, William Older of \nLivermore, Calif.\n  Ms. Croxton died along with her passengers because there is no road \nbetween King Cove and Cold Bay.\n  How many more people must die before we do something about it?\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8473-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8473-S8477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DISPOSAL OF WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, Senator Rod Grams and \nSenator Fred Thompson and I traveled to Russia, preceded by 3 days in \nFrance. Senator Grams accompanied me to France; Senator Thompson, on \nthe Russian part of the trip. We went to France and Russia to do very \ndistinct things. In France, we wanted to talk about nuclear power and \nthe nuclear fuel cycle, and if I have time this afternoon I will \naddress that. If not, I will do that on another day. I would like to \nproceed with what we went to Russia for and what we determined and what \nrecommendations and thoughts I have that come from that trip.\n  Our primary goal when we went to Russia was to explore and develop \noptions for the rapid disposition of Russian weapons-surplus plutonium. \nThese materials represent a potential clear and present danger to the \nsecurity of the United States and the world. The 50 tons that Russia \nhas declared as surplus to their weapons program represents enough \nnuclear material for well over 5,000 nuclear weapons. Diversion of even \nsmall quantities of this material could fuel the nuclear weapons \nambitions of many rogue nations and many nations in general.\n  During our visit, we discovered that there was a very critical window \nof opportunity during which the United States can address the \nproliferation risks of this stock of weapons-surplus plutonium. We have \nurged that the administration, our President and our Vice President, \nseize on this opportunity. No one can reliably predict how long this \nwindow will stay open. We must act while it is open.\n  Unclassified sources estimate that the United States and Russia \ncurrently have about 260 tons of plutonium--100 tons here and 160 tons \nin Russia. Much of this material is in classified weapons components \nwhich could be readily built into weapons.\n  While we saw significant ongoing progress on control of nuclear \nweapons in Russia, much of which was with the assistance of the United \nStates of America through our national laboratories, our visit \nconfirmed the dire economic conditions in their closed cities, the \ncities that they used to provide ample resources on a high priority \nbecause they were the source of their nuclear strength. These \nconditions fuel concerns of serious magnitude.\n  The United States has an immediate interest in ensuring that all \nRussian weapons-grade plutonium, as well as ours, as well as highly \nenriched uranium that is theirs and that is ours, is secure. \nFurthermore, Mr. President, as soon as possible, that material must be \nconverted into unclassified forms that cannot be quickly reassembled \ninto nuclear weapons. Then the materials must be placed in safeguarded \nstorage.\n  These actions, plus a reduction in Russia's large nuclear weapons \nremanufacturing capability, are necessary precursors to future arms \ncontrol limits on nuclear warhead numbers.\n  The United States and Russia have declared 50 tons of weapons-grade \nplutonium as surplus. Current administration plans have asked in the \nbudget for Congress to proceed with a program to use 3 tons per year of \nour surplus as mixed oxide, generally referred to as MOX fuel, for \ncommercial nuclear reactors, while the Russians are focused on a \nprogram that would not use much of their plutonium as MOX. The process \nthat is going on of negotiating between America and Russia is that \nRussia would have only 1.3 tons converted.\n  So to summarize the concerns with the efforts thus far, I state the \nfollowing with very grave concerns. No bilateral agreement is in place \nto control\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\neach country's rate of weapons dismantlement, conversion into \nunclassified shapes, and storage under international safeguards. We \nwere told by the Russians that they were moving faster than the United \nStates in this regard. But we need adequate transparency to assure our \ncitizens on this count.\n  The rates of MOX--mixed oxide--use that we propose and they propose \nare not equal and would in the long run exaggerate the larger Russian \nquantities. The planned mixed oxide use rate of Russian plutonium is so \nslow that it requires more than 30 years to dispose of the 50 tons that \nwe have each declared to be surplus. The potential proliferation risk \nfrom this material exists as long as it is neither under international \nsafeguards nor used in a reactor as MOX fuel. Thirty years is too long \nto wait for verifiable action on this material.\n\n  On our trip, we explored whether other European entities would help \nwith MOX fabrication and use in order to assist in increasing the \nplutonium disposition rate: We did not find a receptive audience that \nwould consider introduction of this weapons plutonium into the European \nnuclear economy, where it would upset their goal of balance within \ntheir civilian nuclear cycle between plutonium recovered from spent \nfuel and plutonium expended as MOX fuel.\n  We also discussed the French-German-Russian plan for relocation of a \nGerman MOX plant to Russia to provide their 1.3 ton capability. While \nthe equipment and expertise are available, funding for this move has \nnot been identified within the G-7 to date.\n  As additional information, we learned from the Russian Minister of \nAtomic Energy Adamov that he would prefer not to use their surplus \nweapons plutonium as MOX. Instead, he favors saving it for use in \nfuture generations of advanced reactors. We learned that MOX \nfabrication and use in Russia will occur only with Western funding of \ntheir MOX plant and compensation to encourage their use of MOX in \npresent reactors.\n  The combination of Minister Adamov's vision combined with the \neconomic situation in Russia provides an important opportunity to \naddress mutual interests. I believe that he would support bilateral \ndismantlement of weapons, conversion from classified shapes to \nunclassified forms, and internationally verified storage. These steps \nmust be accompanied by appropriate levels of transparency.\n  These initial steps could and should occur rapidly, with a target \ngoal of 10 tons per year. I also believe that Russia would accept MOX \ndisposition of their plutonium at the slow rate that is currently \nplanned, leaving most of their plutonium in storage for their \nsubsequent generations of reactors. The United States, as well as other \nG-7 countries, may have to help Russia with resources.\n  The program I've outlined would rapidly reduce potential threats from \nRussian surplus plutonium in a transparent and verifiable way. It could \nmove far faster than our current program that focuses on immediate use \nof converted material in MOX fuel.\n  This new program would shift focus onto the rates of material \ninvolved in the steps preceding MOX fabrication and use. It would still \ncontinue with MOX use, at a slower pace than dismantlement, conversion, \nand safeguarded storage. The final move to MOX would remain part of an \nintegrated disposition program. Minister Adamov strongly noted his \nviews that use of the plutonium as MOX in reactors is the only credible \nfinal disposition route.\n  The United States has failed to fully appreciate the opportunity that \nexists to permanently reduce the threat posed by inventories of \nweapons-grade plutonium in Russia. Furthermore, the United States \nshould not proceed with any unilateral program for disposition of our \nown weapons-surplus plutonium.\n  Leadership from the White House will be essential to ensure success. \nThese issues should be prominently featured at the July Gore/Kiriyenko \nmeeting and the September Clinton/Yeltsin summit. Mr. President, I \nintend to work with you and our Senate colleagues to pursue actions \ntowards these initiatives.\n  One of our primary recommendations to President Clinton is that he \ndesignate a special envoy solely for the vital task of plutonium \ndisposition in order to provide the full-time focused oversight and \ninteragency coordination that is vital to achieving success. This envoy \nshould also coordinate actions among the G-7 countries to ensure their \nparticipation in this challenge.\n  It is evident that efforts in this Administration towards plutonium \ndisposition have not been marked by a suitable level of urgency, \ncommitment and attention. Designation of this special envoy is \nessential to address this serious issue.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in our discussions within Russia, each \nSenator emphasized that many Russian actions are viewed in Congress as \nadding fuel to the fires of global weapons proliferation. We explained \nto our Russian hosts that Congressional concerns over their activities \njeopardize the entire range of U.S.-Russia cooperative programs.\n  These strong expressions of interest and concerns, directly from U.S. \nSenators to Russian leaders, should provide a framework within which \nthe Administration can negotiate bilateral agreements that address \nthese proliferation risks and truly enhance global security.\n  I would just like to discuss with the Senate what went on in Russia, \nand further elaborate on the suggestions that I have. We were \nprivileged to meet with the highest Russian officials who work in the \narea of atomic or nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. In these \nmeetings, I believe it was mutually understood that there is a reason \nto take 50 tons of plutonium that they have from weapons, and 50 tons \nthat we have, and if we cannot agree, and if the world will not \naccommodate efficiently more tons being converted to MOX fuel for reuse \nin nuclear powerplants, that we should establish in each country a \nstorage facility that is internationally monitored, subject to \ninternational controls in both countries, where we will place this \nplutonium in changed forms so that in this new form it will be, as far \nas possible from being usable for military purposes and bomb \nproduction.\n  What a gift we could make to the world if America and Russia could \nagree that, because of dismantlement--which is occurring, we have 50 \ntons of plutonium, and I have just told you the number of weapons it \ncould produce if it was used again for nuclear weapons--that we could \nboth say dismantling the weapons system is working. We agree with each \nother; we are going to have some abiding principles of transparency and \ncontrol, and we are going to start to take this out of circulation.\n  There is one other item that came to our attention as we discussed \nthis proposal. Some of us were familiar with the now-heralded Nunn-\nLugar proposal, whereby the United States helped Russia with some of \nthe problems that it had with nuclear proliferation commodities and \nstorage of fissionable materials in their country. The history of Nunn-\nLugar, although it recently is very successful, was that for a number \nof years it could not get off of center. It stayed kind of stuck \nbecause of the myriad of agency involvements and rules and regulations. \nKnowing of that, we recommend that a special envoy be appointed by the \nPresident to be in charge of this program of attempting to reach a \nbilateral agreement on getting rid of 50 tons of plutonium that could \nbe reused for bombmaking.\n  So, in summary, the recommendations we make to our President and to \nour Vice President as they begin to work anew with Russia are as I have \ndescribed them. Frankly, we believe, the three of us--and one of the \nthree is the occupant of the Chair who attended the entire visit to \nFrance and Russia with reference to nuclear energy and nuclear \nweapons--we recommend that the President engage with and quickly reach \nagreement with the Russians on the disposition of 50 tons of plutonium; \nand that we commit, likewise, from our side, that this ultimately be \ndone in a fashion whereby what cannot be turned, through MOX fuel, to a \nsubstance that cannot be used for bombs, that the remainder be changed \nin shapes and forms, but that the storage be monitored by international \ncontrols and international bodies so as to account for its safekeeping, \nand getting it out of circulation as potential use for nuclear weapons.\n  In that regard, we have written to the President of the United \nStates. The\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\nletter which we wrote, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord, and I ask a similar letter to the Vice President receive \nsimilar treatment. The detailed letter that we prepared to the \nAssistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Honorable \nSandy Berger, which was transmitted to the President and the Vice \nPresident--I ask unanimous consent that all those be printed in the \nRecord so any Senator trying to further assess what we are recommending \nwill have a full display in front of that Senator of the various \nproposals and ideas.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We recently traveled to Russia to \n     explore serious proliferation risks associated with Russian \n     surplus weapons plutonium. We urge that you seize a critical \n     opportunity that we found to dramatically reduce Russian \n     stocks of this material. We recommend that this opportunity \n     be carefully considered in the upcoming Presidential Summit \n     and in the Vice President-Prime Minister meeting.\n       Your leadership will be essential to achieve success in \n     this key area. We will aggressively pursue this issue within \n     the U.S. Senate. We recommend that you appoint a special \n     envoy solely focused on oversight of these disposition \n     efforts to whom you delegate your authority to provide \n     coordination across the multiple agencies involved in a final \n     solution and to develop an integrated G-7 approach to these \n     issues.\n       The attached letter to your National Security Advisor, Mr. \n     Sandy Berger, outlines details of our concerns with weapons-\n     surplus plutonium and the current opportunity.\n       A closely related non-proliferation opportunity arose in \n     our meetings that also deserves your attention. We expressed \n     serious reservations about Russian export of nuclear \n     technologies to nations like India and Iran. In addition to \n     nuclear reactor sales to Iran, serious questions have been \n     raised as to whether or not Russia is complying with its \n     commitments with regard to uranium enrichment technology \n     transfers. Also, reports persist that Russian companies are \n     supplying equipment and materials for the design and \n     manufacture of ballistic missiles. In addition, Russia has \n     rejected our export control assistance.\n       Minister Adamov, of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, \n     discussed their strong concerns with proliferation of nuclear \n     technologies and sought to assure us that any actions on \n     behalf of the Russian government were consistent with the \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n       We discussed with Minister Adamov creation of a Commission \n     to review nuclear export activities of signatories to the NPT \n     for potential proliferation impact. It was suggested that \n     such a Commission could evaluate specific cases, as well as \n     review the structure of the NPT to ensure that its \n     formulation adequately addresses modern international \n     proliferation challenges. We recommend that you pursue this \n     suggestion in your meetings, as well as reiterating that \n     Russia must make major improvements with regard to the export \n     of nuclear technologies and technologies of mass destruction.\n       As we discussed Russian activities that can fuel \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons, we emphasized that \n     Congressional concerns over these activities jeopardize the \n     entire range of U.S.-Russian cooperative programs. We suggest \n     that you reinforce the gravity of these concerns and \n     potential consequences in your meetings.\n       Our visits within Russia served to indicate the interest \n     and concern of the Legislative Branch on these critical \n     proliferation issues. We urge that your future interactions \n     with Russia build upon this foundation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete V.

Domenici.\n     Fred Thompson.\n     Rod Grams.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Sandy Berger,\n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, The \n         National Security Council, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Berger: Our recent visit to Russia uncovered a \n     critical window of opportunity during which the United States \n     can address the proliferation risks of weapons-surplus \n     plutonium. We urge that the Administration seize the \n     opportunity.\n       Unclassified sources estimate that the United States and \n     Russia currently have about 260 tons of such plutonium; 100 \n     tons here and 160 tons in Russia. Much of this material is in \n     classified weapons components, which could be readily rebuilt \n     into weapons. This material could be a significant threat to \n     the national security of the United States.\n       While we saw significant ongoing progress on control of \n     nuclear materials in Russia, our visit confirmed the dire \n     economic conditions in their closed cities. These conditions \n     fuel concerns of serious magnitude.\n       We believe that the United States has an immediate interest \n     in ensuring that all Russian weapons-grade plutonium, as well \n     as their highly enriched uranium, is secure. Furthermore, as \n     soon as possible, that material must be converted to \n     unclassified forms that cannot be quickly re-assembled into \n     nuclear weapons. We believe that conversion of that material \n     and its placement in safeguarded storage, plus a reduction in \n     Russia's nuclear weapons re-manufacturing capability to bring \n     it more in line with our current capability, are necessary \n     precursors to future arms control limits on nuclear warhead \n     numbers.\n       The United States and Russia have each declared 50 tons of \n     weapons-surplus plutonium as excess. Current Administration \n     plans call for a U.S. program to use 3 tons per year as mixed \n     oxide (or MOX) fuel for commercial nuclear reactors, while \n     the Russians are focused on a program that would initially \n     use only 1.3 tons per year as MOX.\n       To summarize our major concerns with the Russian efforts \n     (while recognizing that bilateral progress is essential to \n     enable progress):\n       No bilateral agreement is in place to control each \n     country's rate of weapons dismantlement, conversion into \n     unclassified shapes, and storage under international \n     safeguards. We were told that Russia is moving faster than \n     the U.S. in this regard, but we need adequate transparency to \n     assure our citizens on this.\n       The rates of MOX use are not equal, and only exaggerate the \n     larger Russian quantities.\n       The planned MOX use rate of Russian plutonium is so slow \n     that it requires more than 30 years to dispose of the 50 tons \n     they have declared to be surplus. The potential proliferation \n     risk from this material exists as long as it is neither under \n     international safeguards nor used in a reactor as MOX fuel. \n     Thirty years is too long to wait for verifiable action on \n     this material.\n       On our trip, we explored whether other European entities \n     would assist with MOX fabrication and use to increase the \n     planned disposition rates. We did not find a receptive \n     audience that would consider introduction of this weapons \n     plutonium into the European nuclear economy, where it would \n     upset their goal of balance within their civilian nuclear\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\n     cycle between plutonium recovered from spent fuel and \n     plutonium expended as MOX fuel.\n       We also discussed the French-German-Russian evaluation of \n     relocation of a German MOX plant to Russia to provide their \n     1.3 ton capability. While the equipment and expertise are \n     available, funding for this move has not been identified \n     within the G-7 to date.\n       As additional information, we learned from the Russian \n     Minister of Atomic Energy Adamov that he would prefer not to \n     use their surplus weapons plutonium as MOX. Instead, he \n     favors saving it for use in future generations of advanced \n     reactors. We learned that MOX fabrication and use in Russia \n     will occur only with Western funding of their MOX plant and \n     compensation to encourage their use of MOX in present \n     reactors.\n       However, we believe that he would support bilateral \n     dismantlement of weapons, conversion from classified shapes \n     to unclassified forms, and internationally verified storage \n     (for Russia, at their Mayak facility). These steps must be \n     accompanied by appropriate levels of transparency. These \n     initial steps could and should occur rapidly, with a target \n     goal of 10 tons per year. We also believe that Russia would \n     support MOX disposition of their plutonium at the slow rate \n     that is currently planned, leaving most of their plutonium in \n     storage for their subsequent generations to reactors. We \n     recognize that the United States, as well as other G-7 \n     countries, may have to help Russia with resources.\n       The program we outline would rapidly reduce potential \n     threats from Russian surplus plutonium in a transparent and \n     verifiable way. It could move far faster than our current \n     program that focuses on immediate use of converted material \n     in MOX fuel, by shifting the program focus to the rates of \n     material involved in the steps preceding MOX fabrication and \n     use. And it would still proceed with MOX use, at a slower \n     pace than the dismantlement, conversion, and safeguarded \n     storage. The final use as MOX must remain part of an \n     integrated disposition program; certainly Minister Adamov \n     notes that use of the plutonium in reactors is the only \n     credible disposition route.\n       We believe that the United States has failed to fully \n     appreciate the opportunity that exists to permanently reduce \n     the threat posed by inventories of weapons-grade plutonium in \n     Russia. We also believe that the United States should hot \n     proceed with any unilateral program for disposition of our \n     own weapons-surplus plutonium.\n       We intend to aggressively pursue these initiatives within \n     the Senate. Leadership from the White House will be essential \n     to ensure success. We further recommend that these issues be \n     prominently featured at the July Gore/Kiriyenko meeting and \n     the September Clinton/Yeltsin summit.\n       In addition, we have recommended to the President that he \n     appoint a special envoy solely focused on oversight of this \n     disposition program to whom is delegated authority to provide \n     coordination across the multiple agencies involved in a a \n     final solution and to further coordinate G-7 actions on this \n     issue. We believe that this problem is of sufficient national \n     and global urgency to justify this appointment in the very \n     near future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete V. Domenici.\n     Fred Thompson.\n     Rod Grams.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then, Mr. President, Senator Grams of Minnesota, \nSenator Thompson of Tennessee, and myself have written a letter to all \nof our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whereby we have once \nagain summarized this situation that we find, this hope that we have \nthat our President will pursue negotiations and quickly arrive at a \nbilateral agreement to give the world a gift, a present that says: We \nare now going to get rid of a huge portion of the dismantlement \nsurpluses that can still be used in the future for nuclear bombs, \nridding our world of that potential.\n  We ask that our colleagues read our suggestions, and that they, too, \nbecome interested in this proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: The primary goal of our recent visit to \n     Russia was to explore and develop options for rapid \n     disposition of Russian weapons surplus plutonium. These \n     materials represent a potential clear and present danger to \n     the security of the United States and the world. The 50 tons \n     that Russia has declared as surplus to their weapons program \n     represent enough material for well over 5,000 nuclear \n     weapons. Diversion of even small quantities of this material \n     could fuel the nuclear weapons ambitions of may rogue states.\n       During our visit, we uncovered a critical window of \n     opportunity during which the United States can address the \n     proliferation risks of weapons-surplus plutonium. We have \n     urged the Administration to seize the opportunity. No one can \n     reliably predict how long this window will stay open. We must \n     act while it is open.\n       Unclassified sources estimate that the United States and \n     Russia currently have about 260 tons of such plutonium; 100 \n     tons here and 160 tons in Russia. Much of this material is in \n     classified weapons components, which could be readily rebuilt \n     into weapons.\n       While we saw significant ongoing progress on control of \n     nuclear materials in Russia, our visit confirmed the dire \n     economic conditions in their closed cities.

Efforts to date towards plutonium disposition in \n     this country have not been marked by a suitable level of \n     commitment and attention within the Administration. Progress \n     on this vital area of national security will not occur short \n     of this action.\n       Finally, in our discussions within Russia, each Senator \n     emphasized that many Russian actions are viewed in Congress \n     as adding fuel to the fires of global weapons proliferation. \n     We expressed serious reservations about Russian export of \n     nuclear technologies to nations like India and Iran. In \n     addition to nuclear reactor sales to Iran, serious questions \n     have been raised as to whether or not Russia is complying \n     with its commitments with regard to uranium enrichment \n     technology transfers. Also, reports persist that Russian \n     companies are supplying equipment and materials for the \n     design and manufacture of ballistic missiles. In addition, \n     Russia has rejected our export control assistance. We \n     explained to our Russian hosts that Congressional concerns \n     over their activities jeopardize the entire range of U.S.-\n     Russian cooperative programs.\n       Our visits within Russia served to indicate the interest \n     and concern of the Legislative Branch on these critical \n     proliferation issues. We have urged the Administration to \n     structure future interactions with Russia that built upon our \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete V. Domenici.\n     Fred Thompson.\n     Rod Grams.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will follow this up next week, and \nperhaps my friend who occupies the Chair could join me that day, \nbecause the first part of our visit was a visit to France, ultimately \nto Germany, to talk about the nuclear power fuel cycle. I want, next \nweek, to go into some detail as to how well the French people and the \nFrench Government are handling nuclear power, and how poorly we have \nhandled that issue in America. Just to whet one's appetite about what \nwe visited and what we will be talking about, let me just say the \ncountry of France gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear \npowerplants--80 percent. It is the cleanest country, in terms of \nemissions. It is the least contributor to atmospheric pollution, which \nmany in our country and around the world are concerned is causing \nglobal warming, because they don't burn any coal, they don't burn any \noil. They produce most of their electricity from nuclear power.\n  Isn't it interesting that they do not seem to be afraid? They have \nhad no accidents of any consequence whatsoever. And we in America, who \nstarted this great technology, invented it, had the companies that were \nbest at it--we sit idly by and claim we want to rid the atmosphere of \nthe pollutants that might cause global warming and we essentially, \nthrough regulation and otherwise, have eliminated the prospect of \nnuclear power for some time in the United States. We will speak about \nthat in more detail later.\n  Mr. President, with reference to completing the Senate's business and \nthen letting my good friend Senator Jeffords proceed with his speech as \nin morning business, I am going to proceed with the wrapup, which will \ninclude a privilege to the Senator to continue even after we have \nfinished.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I welcome the recent statement of the \ndistinguished Senior Senator from New York on the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor last Friday, July 10. I have been concerned for several \nmonths that consideration of this nomination was being unnecessarily \ndelayed. I am encouraged that Senator Moynihan's evaluation of this \njudicial nomination for the longstanding vacancy in the Second Circuit \nis similar to mine.\n  I know that the Senator from New York support this nomination and \nrecall his statement of support to the Judiciary Committee at her \nhearing back in September 1997, almost 10 months ago.\n  I appreciated his joining with me and all the Senators from States \nwithin the Second Circuit when we wrote to the Majority Leader on April \n9, 1998 urging ``prompt and favorable action on the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor.'' We noted then the extraordinary action that had to \nbe taken by the Chief Judge of our Circuit due to the vacancies crisis \nplaguing the Circuit. Since March 23, he has had to cancel hearings and \nproceed with 3-judge appellate panel that contain only one Second \nCircuit judge. Indeed, Chief Judge Winter has had to issue such orders \nin connection with matters heard this week.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a well-qualified nominee. She was reportedly \nbeing held up by someone on the Republican side of the aisle because of \nspeculation that she might be nominated this month by President Clinton \nto the United States Supreme Court. Last month a column in The Wall \nStreet Journal discussed this secret basis for the Republican hold \nagainst this fine judge. The Journal revealed that this delay was \nintended to ensure that Sonia Sotomayor was not nominated to the \nSupreme Court. That was confirmed by a report in The New York Times on \nJune 13.\n  How disturbing and how shameful. I am offended by this anonymous \neffort to oppose her prompt confirmation by stealth tactics. Here is a \nhighly-qualified Hispanic woman judge who should have been confirmed to \nhelp end the crisis in the Second Circuit more than four months ago.\n  Judge Sotomayor rose from a housing project in the Bronx to \nPrinceton, Yale and a federal court appointment by President Bush. She \nis strongly supported by the Senator from New York and has had \nbipartisan support.\n  The excuse that had been used to delay consideration of her \nnomination has been removed. Perhaps now that the Supreme Court term \nhas ended and Justice Stevens has not resigned, the Senate will proceed \nto consider Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the Second Circuit on its \nmerits and confirm her without additional, unnecessary delay. There is \nno vacancy on the Supreme Court. The nominee has been held hostage over \nfour months on the Senate calendar. It is past time to consider and \nconfirm this nomination to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nSecond Circuit.\n  Unfortunately, this past weekend the Republican Leader of the United \nStates Senate indicated on television that he has decided to move all \nnominations to the ``back burner.'' A spokesperson for the Republican \nLeader indicated that the Senate will not be considering any more \nnominations this year. That is wrong. I hope that the Republican \nleadership of the Senate will reverse itself and proceed to consider \nthe nomination of Judge Sotomayor and those of all 10 judicial \nnominations now stalled on the Senate calendar.\n  In his annual report on the judiciary this year on New Year's Day, \nthe Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: ``Some \ncurrent nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate \nJudiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed \nonly 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it \nconfirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under \nno obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the \nnecessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' I \nwould add vote her up or vote her down.\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees in the 104th and \n105th Congresses, the Senate is shirking its duty. This is wrong and \nshould end.\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\n  Today is the anniversary of the Judiciary Act of 1789. Pursuant to \nits constitutional responsibilities, the Senate gave meaning to the \nprovisions of article III of our Constitution and established the lower \nfederal courts as a means to implement the exercise of the judicial \npower of the United States. That was an historic act and created the \nfoundation for our federal court system. The Senate was led in that \neffort by a Senator from what is now the Second Circuit, Senator Oliver \nEllsworth of Connecticut.\n  Likewise, when the Senate established the Judiciary Committee 27 \nyears later, it was first chaired by a Senator from the Second Circuit, \nSenator Dudley Chase of Vermont.\n  It is sadly ironic that on this the 209th anniversary of the \nJudiciary Act of 1789, when the Second Circuit needs the Senate's help, \nthe Senate majority is, instead, holding off taking action on a \nqualified nominee without explanation or justification.\n  The Senate should consider the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \nthe Second Circuit without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8477-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8478-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8478-S8480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BLOCKING GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AND \n   PROHIBITING TRANSACTIONS WITH THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA \n      (SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO)--MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 144\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On May 30, 1992, by Executive Order 12808, President Bush declared a \nnational emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States \nconstituted by the actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia \nand Montenegro, blocking all property and interests in property of \nthose Governments. President Bush took additional measures to prohibit \ntrade and other transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S)''), by Executive Orders 12810 \nand 12831, issued on June 5, 1992, and January 15, 1993, respectively.\n  On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order 12846, blocking the \nproperty and interests in property of all commercial, industrial, or \npublic utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the FRY \n(S), and prohibiting trade-related transactions by United States \npersons involving those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \ncontrolled by the Bosnian Serb forces and the United Nations Protected \nAreas in the Republic of Croatia. On October 25, 1994, because of the \nactions and policies of the Bosnian Serbs, I expanded the scope of the \nnational emergency by issuance of Executive Order 12934 to block the \nproperty of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the \nterritory that they controlled within the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, as well as the property of any entity organized or located \nin, or controlled by any person in, or resident in, those areas.\n  On November 22, 1995, the United Nations Security Council passed \nResolution 1022 (``Resolution 1022''), immediately and indefinitely \nsuspending economic sanctions against the FRY (S). Sanctions were \nsubsequently lifted by the United Nations Security Council pursuant to \nResolution 1074 on October 1, 1996. Resolution 1022, however, continues \nto provide for the release of funds and assets previously blocked \npursuant to sanctions against the FRY (S), provided that such funds \nand assets that are subject to claims and encumbrances, or that are the \nproperty of persons deemed insolvent, remain blocked until ``released \nin accordance with applicable law.'' This provision was implemented in \nthe United States on December 27, 1995, by Presidential Determination \nNo. 96-7. The determination, in conformity with Resolution 1022, \ndirected the Secretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the \napplication of sanctions imposed on the FRY (S) pursuant to the \nabove-referenced Executive Orders and to continue to block property \npreviously blocked until provision is made to address claims or \nencumbrances, including the claims of the other successor states of the \nformer Yugoslavia. This sanctions relief was an essential factor \nmotivating Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of the General Framework \nAgreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina initiated by the parties \nin Dayton on November 21, 1995 (the ``Peace Agreement'') and signed in \nParis on December 14, 1995. The sanctions imposed on the FRY (S) and \non the United Nations Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia were \naccordingly suspended prospectively, effective January 16, 1996. \nSanctions imposed on the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities and on the \nterritory that they controlled within the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina were subsequently suspended prospectively, effective May \n10, 1996, in conformity with Resolution 1022. On October 1, 1996, the \nUnited Nations passed Resolution 1074, terminating U.N. sanctions \nagainst the FRY (S) and the Bosnian Serbs in light of the elections \nthat took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina on September 14, 1996. \nResolution 1074, however, reaffirms the provisions of Resolution 1022 \nwith respect to the release of blocked assets, as set forth above.\n  The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and \n1703(c) and covers the period from November 30, 1997, through May 29, \n1998. It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related \nto the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration \nof a national emergency in Executive Order 12808 as expanded with \nrespect to the Bosnian Serbs in Executive Order 12934, and against the \nFRY (S) contained in Executive Orders 12810, 12831, and 12846.\n\n  1. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was \nmade pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, including the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of \nthe United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the \nCongress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the \nexpansion of that national emergency under the same authorities was \nreported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions \nset forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the \nauthority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States, including the statutes cited above, section 1114 of the \nFederal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United \nNations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c).\n  2. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), acting under \nauthority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury, implemented the \nsanctions imposed under the foregoing statutes in the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Bosnian Serb-Controlled Areas \nof the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Sanctions Regulations, 31 \nC.F.R. Part 585 (the ``Regulations'').\n  To implement Presidential Determination No. 96-7, the Regulations \nwere amended to authorize prospectively all transactions with respect \nto the FRY (S) otherwise prohibited (61 FR 1282, January 19, 1996). \nProperty and interests in property of the FRY (S) previously blocked \nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States remain blocked, in \nconformity with the Peace Agreement and Resolution 1022, until \nprovision is made to address claims or encumbrances, including the \nclaims of the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia.\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\n  On May 10, 1996, OFAC amended the Regulations to authorize \nprospectively all transactions with respect to the Bosnian Serbs \notherwise prohibited, except with respect to property previously \nblocked (61 FR 24696, May 16, 1996). On December 4, 1996, OFAC amended \nAppendices A and B to 31 chapter V, containing the names of entities \nand individuals in alphabetical order and by location that are subject \nto the various economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, to \nremove the entries for individuals and entities that were determined to \nbe acting for or on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). These assets were blocked on the \nbasis of these persons' activities in support of the FRY (S)--\nactivities no longer prohibited--not because the Government of the FRY \n(S) or entities located in or controlled from the FRY (S) had any \ninterest in those assets (61 FR 64289, December 4, 1996).\n  On April 18, 1997, the Regulations were amended by adding a new \nSection 585.528, authorizing all transactions after 30 days with \nrespect to the following vessels that remained blocked pursuant to the \nRegulations, effective at 10:00 a.m. local time in the location of the \nvessel on May 19, 1997: the M/V MOSLAVINA, M/V ZETA, M/V LOVCEN, M/V \nDURMITOR and M/V BAR (a/k/a M/V INVIKEN) (62 FR 19672, April 23, 1997). \nDuring the 30-day period, United States persons were authorized to \nnegotiate settlements of their outstanding claims with respect to the \nvessels with the vessels' owners or agents and were generally licensed \nto seek and obtain judicial warrants of maritime arrest. If claims \nremained unresolved 10 days prior to the vessels' unblocking (May 8, \n1997), service of the warrants could be effected at that time through \nthe United States Marshal's Office in the district where the vessel was \nlocated to ensure that U.S. creditors of a vessel had the opportunity \nto assert their claims. Appendix C to 31 CFR, chapter V, containing the \nnames of vessels blocked pursuant to the various economic sanctions \nprograms administered by OFAC (61 FR 32936, June 26, 1996), was also \namended to remove these vessels from the list effective May 19, 1997. \nThere have been no amendments to the Regulations since my report of \nDecember 3, 1997.\n\n  3. Over the past 2 years, the Departments of State and the Treasury \nhave worked closely with European Union member states and other U.N. \nmember nations to implement the provisions of Resolution 1022. In the \nUnited States, retention of blocking authority pursuant to the \nextension of a national emergency provides a framework for \nadministration of an orderly claims settlement. This accords with past \npolicy and practice with respect to the suspension of sanctions \nregimes.\n  4. During this reporting period, OFAC issued two specific licenses \nregarding transactions pertaining to the FRY (S) or property in which \nit has an interest. Specific licenses were issued (1) to authorize U.S. \ncreditors to exchange a portion of blocked unallocated FRY (S) debt \nobligations for the share of such obligations assumed by the obligors \nin the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and (2) to authorize certain \nfinancial transactions with respect to blocked funds located at a \nforeign branch of a U.S. bank.\n  During the past 6 months, OFAC has continued to oversee the \nmaintenance of blocked FYR (S) accounts and records with respect to: \n(1) liquidated tangible assets and personalty of the 15 blocked U.S. \nsubsidiaries of entities organized in the FRY (S); (2) the blocked \npersonalty, files, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions \nin New York previously placed in secure storage; (3) remaining blocked \nFRY (S) tangible property, including real estate; and (4) the 5 \nYugoslav-owned vessels recently unblocked in the United States.\n  On September 29, 1997, the United States filed Statements of Interest \nin cases being litigated in the Southern District of New York: \nBeogradska Banka A.D. Belgrade v. Interenergo, Inc., 97 Civ. 2065 \n(JGK): and Jugobanka A.D. Belgrade v. U.C.F. International Trading, \nInc. et al., 97 Civ. 3912, 3913 and 6748 (LAK). These cases involve \nactions by blocked New York Serbian bank agencies and their parent \noffices in Belgrade, Serbia, to collect on defaulted loans made prior \nto the imposition of economic sanctions and dispensed, in one case, to \nthe U.S. subsidiary of a Bosnian firm and, in the other cases, to \nvarious foreign subsidiaries of a Slovenian firm. Because these loan \nreceivables are a form of property that was blocked prior to December \n27, 1995, any funds collected as a consequence of these actions would \nremain blocked and subject to United States jurisdiction. Defendants \nasserted that the loans had been made from the currency reserves of the \ncentral bank of the former Yugoslavia to which all successor states had \ncontributed, and that the loan funds represent assets of the former \nYugoslavia and are therefore subject to claims by all five successor \nstates. The Department of State, in consultation with the Department of \nthe Treasury, concluded that the collection of blocked receivables \nthrough the actions by the bank and the placement of those collected \nfunds into a blocked account did not prejudice the claims of successor \nstates nor compromise outstanding claims on the part of any creditor of \nthe bank, since any monies collected would remain in a blocked status \nand available to satisfy obligations to United States and foreign \ncreditors and other claimants--including possible distribution to \nsuccessor states under a settlement arising from the negotiations on \nthe division of assets and liabilities of the former Yugoslavia. On \nMarch 31, 1998, however, the Court dismissed the claims as \nnonjustifiable. Another case, D.C. Precision, Inc. v. United States, et \nal., 97 Civ. 9123 CRLC, was filed in the Southern District of New York \non December 10, 1997, alleging that the Government had improperly \nblocked Precision's funds held at one of the closed Serbia banking \nagencies in New York.\n\n  5. Despite the prospective authorization of transactions with the FRY \n(S), OFAC has continued to work closely with the U.S. Customs Service \nand other cooperating agencies to investigate alleged violations that \noccurred while sanctions were in force. On February 13, 1997, a Federal \ngrand jury in the Southern District of Florida, Miami, returned a 13-\ncount indictment against one U.S. citizen and two nationals of the FRY \n(S). The indictment charges that the subjects participated and \nconspired to purchase three Cessna propeller aircraft, a Cessna jet \naircraft, and various aircraft parts in the United States and to export \nthem to the FRY (S) in violation of U.S. sanctions and the \nRegulations. Timely interdiction action prevented the aircraft from \nbeing exported from the United States.\n  Since my last report, OFAC has collected one civil monetary penalty \ntotaling nearly $153,000 for violations of the sanctions. These \nviolations involved prohibited payments to the Government of the FRY \n(S) by a U.S. company.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from November 30, 1997, through May 29, 1998, that are directly \nattributable to the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nthe FRY (S) and the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities are estimated \nat approximately $360,000, most of which represents wage and salary \ncosts for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in OFAC and its Chief \nCounsel's Office, and the U.S. Customs Service), the Department of \nState, the National Security Council, and the Department of Commerce.\n  7. In the last 2 years, substantial progress has been achieved to \nbring about a settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia \nacceptable to the parties. Resolution 1074 terminates sanctions in view \nof the first free and fair elections to occur in the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, as provided for in the Peace Agreement. In reaffirming \nResolution 1022, however, Resolution 1074 contemplates the continued \nblocking of assets potentially subject to conflicting claims and \nencumbrances until provision is made to address them under applicable \nlaw, including claims of the other successor states of the former \nYugoslavia. The resolution of the crisis and conflict in the former \nYugoslavia that has resulted from the actions and policies of the \nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro), and of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the \nterritory\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nthat they controlled, will not be complete until such time as the Peace \nAgreement is implemented and the terms of Resolution 1022 have been \nmet. Therefore, I have continued for another year the national \nemergency declared on May 30, 1992, as expanded in scope on October 25, \n1994, and will continue to enforce the measures adopted pursuant \nthereto.\n  I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal with respect \nto the measures against the Government of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and the Bosnian Serb forces, civil \nauthorities, and entities, as long as these measures are appropriate, \nand will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 120\n\n       Whereas, Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, provides in part that ``. . . The Judges, both \n     the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices \n     during good Behaviour, . . .''; and\n       Whereas, this clause has been interpreted to mean that ``. \n     . .

Judges of federal ``constitutional'' courts which \n     have been invested with the judicial power of the United \n     States pursuant to this article are guaranteed life tenure \n     during good behavior and compensation which may not be \n     reduced during their term of office. . . .'' Montanez v. \n     U.S., 226 F.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 60\n\n       Whereas, in an amazingly short time, the Internet has \n     become a key means of communicating in this country. It is \n     already a prominent vehicle for doing business through \n     selling goods and services and providing information leading \n     to commercial transactions. The business value of selling \n     access to the Internet is in itself a multi-billion-dollar \n     enterprise. The growth projections for the Internet and for \n     its impact on commerce are very high; and\n       Whereas, as with any new aspect of commerce, there are \n     numerous tax implications associated with the Internet. The \n     new technology and capabilities can be used to avoid local \n     taxes. Numerous transactions involve automatic transfers of \n     money for goods and services. Borders and jurisdictions have \n     become far less significant in this new marketplace; and\n       Whereas, with the rise of the Internet, state and local \n     policymakers have suggested various ways to tax this \n     activity. Some states have explored telecommunications taxes \n     and taxes on Internet service providers. Industry observers \n     are concerned that implementing a ``modem tax'' could disrupt \n     the development of a new tool for commerce and economic \n     development; and\n       Whereas, with the complexity of issues involved and the \n     constant changes in this new technology as it takes shape, \n     imposing taxes specific to the Internet would likely be \n     harmful. Any possible gains in revenues would be more than \n     offset by long-term changes in the evolution of the Internet. \n     Greed should not drive policy or taxation decisions; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact legislation to create a moratorium on new \n     national, state, and local taxes on the Internet; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-513. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 240\n\n       Whereas, the federal income tax system includes deductions \n     and credits for a wide variety of personal and business \n     expenses. These exceptions from certain calculations of \n     taxation reflect public policy values that elected officials \n     have established over many years; and\n       Whereas, in determining federal tax liability, most state \n     and local taxes are deductible, including income taxes and \n     property taxes. These policies recognize the value of taxes \n     paid to finance state and local government activities. For \n     many years, state sales taxes were also deductible. Federal \n     tax laws were changed in 1986 to discontinue the \n     deductibility of state sales taxes; and\n       Whereas, it is inconsistent for the federal government to \n     allow citizens to deduct some taxes paid for state and local \n     government, such as property and income taxes, and not allow \n     deductions for state sales taxes. State sales taxes, in \n     Michigan as elsewhere, finance the same types of public \n     purpose programs financed through other state and local taxes \n     that are fully deductible. The current situation is very \n     inconsistent and frustrating to taxpayers across our state \n     and throughout the country; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact and \n     the President to sign legislation to allow state sales taxes \n     to be deductible from federal income taxes and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-514.

The Congress of the United States is respectfully \n     memorialized to enact H.R. 334 of 1997, the ``Fair Indian \n     Gaming Act,'' into law.\n       2.

A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe \nregulations to protect the privacy of personal information collected \nfrom and about children on the Internet, to provide greater parental \ncontrol over the collection and use of that information, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          the children's online privacy protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today the chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and I are introducing ``the Children's Online Privacy \nProtection Act of 1998.'' Commercial Web sites are currently collecting \nand disseminating personal information collected from children that may \ncompromise their safety and most certainly invades their privacy. This \nlegislation will ensure that commercial Web sites that collect and use \npersonal information from children will have safeguards in place to \nprotect you and your family.\n  The Internet is quickly becoming an significant force in the lives of \nour children as it moves swiftly into homes and classrooms around the \ncountry. Currently more than 3 million children under the age of 18 are \nonline and the number is expected to grow to 15 million by the turn of \nthe century.\n  I think all would agree that proficiency with the Internet is a \ncritical and vital skill that will be necessary for academic \nachievement in the next century. The benefits of the Internet are \nextraordinary. Reference information such as news, weather, sports, \nstock quotes, movie reviews, encyclopedia and online airline fares are \nreadily available. Users can conduct transactions such as stock \ntrading, make travel arrangements, bank, and shop online.\n  Millions of people communicate through electronic mail to family and \nfriends around the world, and others use the public message boards to \nmake new friends and share common interests. As an educational and \nentertainment tool, users can learn about virtually any topic or take a \ncollege course.\n  Unfortunately, the same marvelous advances in computer and \ntelecommunication technology that allow our children to reach out to \nnew resources of knowledge and cultural experiences are also leaving \nthem unwittingly vulnerable to exploitation and harm by deceptive \nmarketers and criminals.\n  Earlier this spring, I held several meetings in Nevada with educators \nand parents' representatives to alert them of some of the deceptive \npractices found on the Internet. Representatives of the FBI and Federal \nTrade Commission informed Nevadans about some of the Internet's \npitfalls. I found it extremely informative and enlightening and to some \nextent frightening.\n  You may be startled to learn what information other people are \ncollecting about you and your family may have a profound impact upon \ntheir privacy and, indeed, their safety.\n\n  Once what may seem to be harmless information has made its way onto \nthe Internet, there is no way of knowing what uses may be put to that \ninformation.\n  Senator McCain and I wrote to the FTC asking them to investigate \nonline privacy issues. Recently, the FTC completed the survey of a \nnumber of web sites and found that 89 percent of children's sites \ncollect personal information from children, and less than 10 percent of \nthe sites provide for parental control over the collection and use of \nthis personal information.\n  I was, frankly, surprised to learn the kinds of information these web \nsites are collecting from our children. Some were asking where the \nchild went to school, what sports he or she liked, what siblings they \nhad, their pet's name, what kind of time they had after school alone \nwithout the supervision of parents.\n  Others were collecting personal financial information like what the \nfamily income was, does the family own stocks or certificates of \ndeposit, did their grandparents give them any financial gifts?\n  Web sites were using games, contests, and offers of free merchandise \nto entice children to give them exceedingly personal and private \ninformation about themselves and their families. Some even used cartoon \ncharacters who asked children for personal information, such as a \nchild's name and address and e-mail address, date of birth, telephone \nnumber, and Social Security number.\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\n  Much of this information appears to be harmless, but companies are \nattempting to build a wealth of information about you and your family \nwithout an adult's approval--a profile that will enable them to target \nand to entice your children to purchase a range of products.\n  The Internet gives marketers the capability of interacting with your \nchildren and developing a relationship without your knowledge.\n  Where can this interactive relationship go? Will your child be \nreceiving birthday cards and communications with online cartoon \ncharacters for particular products?\n  Senator McCain and I believe there must be safeguards against the \nonline collecting of information from children without a parent's \nknowledge or consent. If a child answers a phone and starts answering \nquestions, a parent automatically becomes suspicious and asks who they \nare talking to. When a child is on the Internet, parents often have no \nknowledge of whom their child is interacting.\n  That is why we are introducing legislation that would require the FTC \nto come up with rules to govern these kind of activities. The FTC's \nrules would require commercial web sites to:\n  (1) Provide notice of its personal information collection and use \npractices;\n  (2) Obtain parental consent for the collection, use or disclosure of \npersonnel information from children 12 and under;\n  (3) Provide parents with an opportunity to opt-out of the collection \nand/or use of personal information collected from children 13 to 16;\n  (4) Provide parents access to his or her child's personal \ninformation;\n  (5) Establish and maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the \nconfidentiality, security, accuracy, and integrity of personal \ninformation on children.\n  The FTC must come up with these rules within 1 year. The FTC may \nprovide incentives for industry self-regulatory efforts including safe \nharbors for industry created guidelines. The bill permits States' \nattorneys general to enforce the act.\n  I believe these represent reasonable steps we should take to protect \nour privacy. Although time is short in this session, I hope we can find \na way to enact these commonsense proposals this Congress.\n  Most people who use online services have positive experiences. The \nfact that deceptive acts may be committed on the Internet, is not a \nreason to avoid using the service. To tell children to stop using the \nInternet would be like telling them to forgo attending college because \nstudents are sometimes victimized on campus. A better strategy is for \nchildren to learn how to be street smart in order to better safeguard \nthemselves from potentially deceptive situations.\n  The Internet offers unlimited potential for assisting our child's \ngrowth and development. However, we must not send our children off on \nthis adventure without proper guidance and supervision.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, the legislation offered today by the \nsenior Senator from Arizona and I provides those reasonable guidelines. \nI hope colleagues will join with me in making sure this legislation is \nenacted in this situation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COATS (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2327. A bill to provide grants to grassroots organizations in \ncertain cities to develop youth intervention models; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n           national youth crime prevention demonstration act\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, America currently struggles with a \ndisturbing and growing trend of youth violence. Between 1985 and 1994, \nthe arrest rate for murders by juveniles increased 150 percent, while \nthe rate for adults during this time increased 11 percent. Every day, \nin our communities and in the media, we see horrific examples of this \ncrime. A 13-year-old girl murders her 3-year-old nephew and dumps him \nin the trash. A 13-year-old boy is stabbed to death while sitting on \nhis back porch. A group of teenagers hails a cab and, after the driver \ntakes them to their destination, they shoot him dead in an armed \nrobbery.\n  I did not have to look far for these examples. Each occurred in \nIndiana, a State generally known as a safe State, a good place to raise \na family, not a dangerous place, yet a State where arrests for violent \njuvenile crimes have skyrocketed 19 percent in the early 1990's. \nJuvenile violence is no longer a stranger in any ZIP code.\n  Yet, the problem is expected to grow worse. Crime experts who study \ndemographics warn of a coming crime wave based on the number of \nchildren who currently are younger than 10 years old. These experts \nwarn that if current trends are not changed, we might someday look back \nat our current juvenile crime epidemic as ``the good old days.'' This \nspiraling upward trend in youth crime and violence is cause for grave \nconcern. So one might ask, what is driving this epidemic?\n  Over 30 years ago, our colleague Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an \nofficial in the Johnson administration, wrote that when a community's \nfamilies are shattered, crime, violence and rage ``are not only to be \nexpected, they are virtually inevitable.'' He wrote those words in \n1965. Since then, arrests of violent juvenile criminals have tripled.\n  Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Children and Families, which I \nchair, held a hearing about the role of government in combating \njuvenile crime. The experts were clear: while government efforts are \nimportant, they are also fundamentally limited and incomplete. \nGovernment is ultimately powerless to form the human conscience that \nchooses between right and wrong.\n  Locking away juveniles might prevent them from committing further \ncrimes, but it does not address the fact that violence is symptomatic \nof a much deeper, moral and spiritual void in our Nation. In the battle \nagainst violent crime, solid families are America's strongest line of \ndefense. But government can be an effective tool if it joins private \ninstitutions (families, churches, schools, community groups, and non-\nprofit organizations) in preventing and confronting juvenile crime with \nthe moral ideals that defeat despair and nurture lives.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the National Youth Crime Prevention Act \nwhich will empower local communities to address the rising trend in \nyouth violence. Specifically, this legislation authorizes the Attorney \nGeneral to award $5 million annually for five years to the National \nCenter for Neighborhood Enterprise to conduct national demonstration \nprojects in eight cities. These projects would aim to end youth crime, \nviolence and family disintegration by building neighborhood capacity \nand linking proven grassroots organizations within low-income \nneighborhoods with sources from the public sector, including local \nhousing authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other public \nentities. The demonstration projects will take place in Washington, DC; \nDetroit, Michigan; Hartford, Connecticut; Indianapolis, Indiana; \nChicago, Illinois; San Antonio, Texas; Dallas, Texas; and Los Angeles, \nCalifornia.\n\n  With these funds, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise \nwill work with the grassroots organizations in the demonstration cities \nto establish Violence Free Zone Initiatives. These initiatives would \ninvolve successful youth intervention models in partnership with law \nenforcement, local housing authorities, private foundations, and other \npublic and private partners. To be eligible for the grants, the \nnonprofit organizations within the demonstration cities must have \nexperience in crime prevention and youth mediation projects and must \nhave a history of cultivating cooperative relationships with other \nlocal organizations, housing facilities and law enforcement agencies.\n  Funds may be used for youth mediation, youth mentoring, life skills \ntraining, job creation and entrepreneurship, organizational development \nand training, development of long-term intervention plans, \ncollaboration with law enforcement, comprehensive support services, \nlocal agency partnerships and activities to further community \nobjectives in reducing youth crime and violence.\n  The success of this approach has already been demonstrated. Last \nyear, The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise assisted The \nAlliance for Concerned Men in creating a ``Violence Free Zone'' in \nBenning Terrace in Southeast DC. The Alliance of Concerned Men brokered \npeace treaties among the gangs that inhabit, and frequently dominate, \nthe city's public\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\nhousing complexes. Benning Terrace in Southeast Washington, known to \nthe DC police department as one of the most dangerous areas of the \ncity, has not had a single murder since the Alliance's peace treaty \nwent into effect early last year. Subsequently, the National Center for \nNeighborhood Enterprise brought the Alliance, the youths, and the DC \nHousing Receiver together to develop and implement a plan for jobs and \nlife skills training for the young people and the community itself.\n  Grassroots organizations are the key to implementing the most \neffective innovative strategies to address community problems. Their \nefforts help restore hardpressed inner-city neighborhoods by developing \nthe social, human and economic capital that is key to real, long-term \nrenewal of urban communities. The National Youth Crime Prevention \nDemonstration Act will provide critical assistance to our Nation's \ninner-cities as they combat the rising trend in youth violence by \nlinking proven grassroots organizations with established public sector \nentities.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the National \nYouth Crime Prevention Demonstration Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to enhance \nthe portability of retirement benefits, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             the retirement portability account (rap) act.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 2329, the \nRetirement Portability Account (RAP) Act. This bill is a close \ncompanion to H.R. 3503 introduced by our colleagues Earl Pomeroy of \nNorth Dakota and Jim Kolbe of Arizona earlier this year. In addition, \nit contains certain elements of H.R. 3788, the Portman-Cardin bill, \nwhich relate to increased pension portability. Generally this bill is \nintended to be a further iteration of the concepts embodied in both of \nthose bills. It standardizes the rules in the Internal Revenue Code \n(IRC) which regulate how portable a worker's retirement savings account \nis, and while it does not make portability of pension benefits perfect, \nit greatly improves the status quo. Consistent with ``greatly improving \nthe status quo'', this bill contains no mandates. No employer will be \n``required'' to accept rollovers from other plans. A rollover will \noccur when the employee offers, and the employer agrees to accept, a \nrollover from another plan.\n  Under current law, it is not possible for an individual to move an \naccumulated retirement savings account from a section 401(k) (for-\nprofit) plan to a section 457 (state and local government) deferred \ncompensation plan, to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), then to a \nsection 403(b) (non-profit organization) plan and ultimately back into \na section 401(k) plan, without violating various restrictions on the \nmovement of their money. The RAP Act will make it possible for workers \nto take their retirement savings with them when they change jobs \nregardless of the type of employer for which they work.\n  This bill will also help make IRAs more portable and will improve the \nuses of conduit IRAs. Conduit IRAs are individual retirement accounts \nto which certain distributions from a qualified retirement plan or from \nanother individual retirement account have been transferred. RAP \nchanges the rules regulating these IRAs so that workers leaving the \nfor-profit, non-profit or governmental field can use a conduit IRA as a \nparking spot for a pre-retirement distribution. These special accounts \nare needed by many workers until they have another employer-sponsored \nplan in which to rollover their savings.\n  In many instances, this bill will allow an individual to rollover an \nIRA consisting exclusively of tax-deductible contributions into a \nretirement plan at his or her new place of employment, thus helping the \nindividual consolidate retirement savings in a single account. Under \ncertain circumstances, the RAP Act will also allow workers to rollover \nany after-tax contributions made at his or her previous workplace, into \na new retirement plan.\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\n  Current law requires a worker who changes jobs to face a deadline of \n60 days within which to roll over any retirement savings benefits \neither into an Individual Retirement Account, or into the retirement \nplan of his or her new employer. Failure to meet the deadline can \nresult in both income and excise taxes being imposed on the account. We \nbelieve that this deadline should be waived under certain circumstances \nand we have outlined them in the bill. Consistent with the Pomeroy-\nKolbe bill, in case of a Presidentially-declared natural disaster or \nmilitary service in a combat zone, the Treasury Department will have \nthe authority to disallow imposition of any tax penalty for the account \nholder. Consistent with the additional change proposed by the Portman-\nCardin bill, however, we have included a waiver of tax penalties in the \ncase of undue hardship, such as a serious personal injury or illness \nand we have given the Department of the Treasury the authority to waive \nthis deadline, as well.\n  The Retirement Account Portability bill will also change two \ncomplicated rules which harm both plan sponsors and plan participants; \none dealing with certain business sales (the so-called ``same desk'' \nrule) and the other dealing with retirement plan distribution options. \nEach of these rules has impeded true portability of pensions and we \nbelieve they ought to be changed.\n  In addition, this bill will extend the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation's (PBGC) Missing Participant program to defined benefit \nmultiemployer pension plans. Under current law, the PBGC has \njurisdiction over both single-employer and multiemployer defined \nbenefit pension plans. A few years ago, the agency initiated a program \nto locate missing participants from terminated, single-employer plans. \nThe program attempts to locate individuals who are due a benefit, but \nwho have not filed for benefits due to them, or who have attempted to \nfind their former employer but failed to receive their benefits. This \nbill expands the missing participant program to multiemployer pension \nplans.\n  I know of no reason why individuals covered by a multiemployer \npension plans should not have the same protections as participants of \nsingle-employer pension plans and this change will help more former \nemployees receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. This \nbill does not expand the missing participants program to defined \ncontribution plans. Supervision of defined contribution plans is \noutside the statutory jurisdiction of the PBGC and I have not heard \nstrong arguments for including those plans within the jurisdiction of \nthe agency.\n  In a particularly important provision, the Retirement Account \nPortability bill will allow public school teachers and other state and \nlocal employees who move between different states and localities to use \ntheir savings in their section 403(b) plan or section 457 deferred \ncompensation arrangement to purchase ``service credit'' in the plan in \nwhich they are currently participating, and thus obtain greater pension \nbenefits in the plan in which they conclude their career. However, the \nbill does not allow the use of a lump sum cash-out from a defined \nbenefit plan to be rolled over to a section 403(b) or section 457 plan.\n  As a final note, this bill, this bill does not reduce the vesting \nschedule from the current five year cliff vesting (or seven year \ngraded) to a three year cliff or six year graded vesting schedule. I am \nnot necessarily against the shorter vesting schedules, but I feel that \nthis abbreviated vesting schedule makes a dramatic change to tax law \nwithout removing some of the disincentives to maintaining a pension \nplan that businesses--especially small businesses--desperately need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Increasing Portability for Pension Plan Participants: Facilitating \n                               Rollovers\n\n       Under current law, an ``eligible rollover distribution'' \n     may be either (1) rolled over by the distributee into an \n     ``eligible retirement plan'' if such rollover occurs within \n     60 days of the distribution, or (2) directly rolled over by \n     the distributing plan to an ``eligible retirement plan.'' An \n     ``eligible rollover distribution'' does not include any \n     distribution which is required under section 401(a)(9) or any \n     distribution which is part of a series of substantially equal \n     periodic payments made for life, life expectancy or over a \n     period of ten years or more. An ``eligible retirement plan'' \n     is another section 401 plan, a section 403(a) plan or an IRA. \n     (If the distributee is a surviving spouse of a participant, \n     ``eligible retirement plans'' consist only of IRAs.) Under \n     these rules, for example, amounts distributed from a section \n     401(k) plan may not be rolled over to a section 403(b) \n     arrangement.\n       In the case of a section 403(b) arrangement, distributions \n     which would be eligible rollover distributions except for the \n     fact that they are distributed from a section 403(b) \n     arrangement may be rolled over to another section 403(b) \n     arrangement or an IRA. Under these rules, amounts distributed \n     from a section 403(b) may not be rolled over into a section \n     401(k) plan.\n       When an ``eligible rollover distribution'' is made, the \n     plan administrator must provide a written notice to the \n     distributee explaining the availability of a direct rollover \n     to another plan or an IRA, that failure to exercise that \n     option will result in 20% being withheld from the \n     distribution and that amounts not directly rolled over may be \n     rolled over by the distributee within 60 days.\n       Under ``conduit IRA'' rules, an amount may be rolled over \n     from a section 401 or 403(a) plan to an IRA and subsequently \n     rolled over to a section 401 or 403(a) plan if amounts in the \n     IRA are attributable only to rollovers from section 401 or \n     403(a) plans. Also under conduit IRA rules, an amount may be \n     rolled over from a section 403(b) arrangement to an IRA and \n     subsequently rolled over to a section 403(b) arrangement if \n     amounts in the IRA are attributable only to rollovers from \n     section 403(b) arrangements.\n       In the case of a section 457 deferred compensation plan, \n     distributions may not be rolled over by a distributee; \n     however, amounts may be transferred from one section 457 plan \n     to another section 457 plan without giving rise to income to \n     the plan participant.\n       A participant in a section 457 plan is taxed on plan \n     benefits that are not transferred when such benefits are paid \n     or when they are made available. In contrast, a participant \n     in a qualified plan or a section 403(b) arrangement is only \n     taxed on plan benefits that are actually distributed.\n       Under this proposal, ``eligible rollover distributions'' \n     from a section 401 plan could be rolled over to another \n     section 401 plan, a section 403(a) plan, a section 403(b) \n     arrangement, a section 457 deferred compensation plan \n     maintained by a state or local government or an IRA. \n     Likewise, ``eligible rollover distributions'' from a section \n     403(b) arrangement could be rolled over to the same broad \n     array of plans and IRAs. Thus, an eligible rollover \n     distribution from a section 401(k) plan could be rolled over \n     to a section 403(b) arrangement and vice versa. (As under \n     current law, if the distributee is a surviving spouse of a \n     participant, the distribution could only be rolled over into \n     an IRA.)\n       Eligible rollover distributions from all section 457 \n     deferred compensation plans could be rolled over to the same \n     broad array of plans and IRAs; however, the rules regarding \n     the mandatory 20% withholding would not apply to the section \n     457 plans. A section 457 plan maintained by a government \n     would be made an eligible retirement plan for purposes of \n     accepting rollovers from section 401(k), section 403(b) and \n     other plans.\n       The written notice required to be provided when an \n     ``eligible rollover distribution'' is made would be expanded \n     to apply to section 457 plans and to include a description of \n     restrictions and tax consequences which will be different if \n     the plan to which amounts are transferred is a different type \n     of plan from the distribution plan.\n       Participants who mix amounts eligible for special capital \n     gains and averaging treatment with amounts not so eligible \n     would lose such treatment.\n       A participant in a section 457 plan would only be taxed on \n     plan benefits that are not transferred or rolled over when \n     they are actually paid.\n       These changes would take effect for distributions made \n     after December 31, 1998.\n       The reason for this expansion of current law rules \n     permitting rollovers is to allow plan participants to put all \n     of their retirement plan savings in one vehicle if they \n     change jobs. Given the increasing mobility of the American \n     workforce, it is important to make pension savings portable \n     for those who change employment. This proposal contains no \n     mandates requiring employers to accept rollovers from their \n     new employees. A rollover occurs when the employee makes an \n     offer to move his/her money and the employer accepts the \n     funds.\n       Because of the rule that taxes section 457 plan \n     participants on benefits made available, section 457 plans \n     cannot provide plan participants with the flexibility to \n     change benefit payments to fit their changing needs. There is \n     no policy justification for this lack of flexibility.\n\n\n     rollovers of individual retirement accounts to qualified plans\n\n       Under current law, a taxpayer is not permitted to roll \n     amounts held in an individual retirement account (IRA) (other \n     than a conduit IRA), to a section 401 plan, a 403(a) plan, a \n     403(b) arrangement or a section 457 deferred compensation \n     plan. Currently, the maximum direct IRA contribution is \n     $2,000. Since 1986, generally only individuals with income \n     below certain limits are able to fully deduct\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\n     IRA contributions. For others, IRA contributions have been \n     nondeductible or partially deductible in some or all years. \n     To the extent that IRA contributions are non-deductible, they \n     have ``basis'' which is not taxed the second time upon \n     distribution from the IRA. The burden of maintaining records \n     of IRA basis has been the taxpayer's, since only the taxpayer \n     has had the information to determine his or her basis at the \n     outset and as an ongoing matter.\n       IRAs are generally subject to different regulatory schemes \n     than other retirement savings plans, such as section 401(k)s \n     or section 457 deferred compensation plans, although the 10 \n     percent tax penalty on early distributions applies to both \n     qualified plans and IRAs. For example, one cannot take a loan \n     from an IRA, although a recent change in law will make it \n     easier to make a penalty-free withdrawal from an IRA to \n     finance a first-time home purchase or higher-education \n     expenses.\n       Under the bill, rollovers of contributory IRAs would be \n     permitted if and only if the individual has never made any \n     nondeductible contributions to his or her IRA and has never \n     had a Roth IRA. The IRA may then be rolled over into a \n     section 401 plan, a section 403(a) plan, a 403(b) arrangement \n     or a section 457 deferred compensation plan. Since the vast \n     majority of IRAs contain only deductible contributions, this \n     change will allow many individuals to consolidate their \n     retirement savings into one account. For those who have both \n     nondeductible and deductible contributions, they may still \n     have two accounts, one containing the majority of funds \n     consolidated in one place and one containing the \n     nondeductible IRA contributions. Once IRA money is rolled \n     over into a plan however, the IRA contributions would become \n     plan money and subject to the rules of the plan except that \n     participants who mix amounts for special capital gains and \n     averaging treatment with amounts not so eligible would lose \n     such treatment. Employers will not be required to accept \n     rollovers for IRAs.\n       These changes would apply to distributions after December \n     31, 1998.\n       The reasons for this change is to take another step toward \n     increased portability of retirement savings. While this \n     proposal would not guarantee that all retirement savings \n     would be completely portable, it will increase the extent to \n     which such savings are portable and fungible. Other rules and \n     requirements affecting IRAs and their differences and \n     similarities to plan money will continue to be the subject of \n     Congressional scrutiny.\n\n\n rollovers of after-tax contributions and rollovers not made within 60 \n                            days of receipt\n\n       Under current law, employees are allowed to make after-tax \n     contributions to IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other plans. They \n     are not permitted to roll over distributions of those after-\n     tax contributions to an IRA or another plan.\n       Rollovers from qualified plans to an IRA (or from an IRA to \n     another IRA) must occur within 60 days of the initial \n     distribution. Income tax withholding rules apply to certain \n     distributions that are not direct trustee-to-trustee \n     transfers from the qualified plan to an IRA or another plan.\n       The proposal would allow after-tax contributions to be \n     included in a rollover contribution to an IRA or other types \n     of retirement plans, but it does not require the receiving \n     trustee to track or report the basis. That requirement would \n     be the responsibility of the taxpayer, as in the case of \n     nondeductible IRA contributions.\n       The IRS is given the authority to extend the 60-day period \n     where the failure to comply with such requirements is \n     attributable to casualty, disaster or other events beyond the \n     reasonable control of the individual subject to such \n     requirements.\n       These changes would generally apply to distributions made \n     after December 31, 1998. The hardship exception to the 60-day \n     rollover period would apply to such 60-day periods expiring \n     after the date of enactment.\n       These changes are warranted because after-tax savings in \n     retirement plans enhance retirement security and are \n     particularly attractive to low and middle income taxpayers. \n     Allowing such distributions to be rolled over to an IRA or a \n     plan will increase the chances that those amounts would be \n     retained until needed for retirement.\n       Often individuals, particularly widows, widowers and \n     individuals with injuries of illnesses, miss the 60-day \n     window. In other instances, individuals miss the 60-day \n     rollover period because of the failure of third parties to \n     perform as directed. Finally, victims of casualty or natural \n     disaster should not be penalized. A failure to satisfy the \n     60-day rule, by even one day can result in catastrophic tax \n     consequences for a taxpayer that can include immediate \n     taxation of the individual's entire retirement savings (often \n     in a high tax bracket), a 10% early distribution tax, and a \n     substantial depletion of retirement savings. By giving the \n     IRS the authority to provide relief from the 60-day \n     requirement for failures outside the control of the \n     individual, the proposal would give individuals in these \n     situations the ability to retain their retirement savings in \n     an IRA or a qualified plan.\n\n\n                   Treatment of Forms of Distribution\n\n       Under current law, section 411(d)(6), the ``anti-cutback'' \n     rule generally provides that when a participant's benefits \n     are transferred from one plan to another, the transferee plan \n     must preserve all forms of distribution that were available \n     under the transferor plan.\n       Under this proposal, an employee may elect to waive his or \n     her section 411(d)(6) rights and transfer benefits from one \n     defined contribution plan to another defined contribution \n     plan without requiring the transferee plan to preserve the \n     optional forms of benefits under the transferor plan if \n     certain requirements are satisfied to ensure the protection \n     of participants' interests. This proposal would also apply to \n     plan mergers and other transactions having the effect of a \n     direct transfer, including consolidation of benefits \n     attributable to different employers within a multiple \n     employer plan.\n       These changes would apply to transfers after December 31, \n     1998.\n       The requirement that a defined contribution plan preserve \n     all forms of distribution included in transferor plans \n     significantly increases the cost of plan administration, \n     particularly for employers that make numerous business \n     acquisitions. The requirements also causes confusion among \n     plan participants who can have separate parts of their \n     retirement benefits subject to sharply different plan \n     provision and requirements. The increased cost for the plan \n     and the confusion for the participant brought about by the \n     requirement to preserve all forms of distribution are based \n     on a rule intended to protect a participant's right not to \n     have an arbitrary benefit reduction. The current rule sweeps \n     too broadly since it protects both significant and \n     insignificant rights. Where a participant determines the \n     rights to be insignificant and wants to consolidate his or \n     her retirement benefits, there is no reason not to permit his \n     consolidation. This consolidation increases portability and \n     reduces administrative costs.\n\n\n  Rationalization of Restrictions on Distributions, The ``Same Desk'' \n                                  Rule\n\n       Generally, under current law, distributions from 401(k) \n     plans are limited to separation from service, death, \n     disability, age 59\\1/2\\, hardship, plan termination without \n     maintenance of another plan, and certain corporate \n     transactions. The term ``separation from service'' has been \n     interpreted to include a ``same desk'' rule. Under the ``same \n     desk'' rule, distributions to a terminated employee are not \n     permitted if the employee continues performing the same \n     functions for a successor employer (such as a joint venture \n     owned in part by the former employer or the buyer in a \n     business acquisition). The same desk rule also applies to \n     section 403(b) arrangements and section 457 plans, but does \n     not apply to other types of plans such as defined benefit \n     plans.\n       Under this proposal, the ``same desk rule'' would be \n     eliminated by replacing ``separation from service'' with \n     ``severance from employment''. Conforming changes would be \n     mad in the comparable provisions of section 403(b) \n     arrangements and eligible deferred compensation plans under \n     section 457. This change would apply to distributions after \n     December 31, 1998.\n       Under this proposal, affected employees would be able to \n     roll over their 401(k) account balance to an IRA or to their \n     new employer's 401(k) plan. Modifying the same desk rule so \n     that all of a worker's retirement funds can be transferred to \n     the new employer after a business sale has taken place will \n     allow the employee to keep his or her retirement nest egg in \n     a single place. It will also coordinate the treatment of \n     defined benefit plan benefits with the treatment of 401(k) \n     plans in these types of transactions. Employees do not \n     understand why their 401(k) account must remain with the \n     former employer until they terminate employment with their \n     new employer, especially since this restriction does not \n     apply to other plans in which they participate. The corporate \n     transaction exception provides some relief from the same desk \n     rule but is inapplicable in numerous cases.\n\n\n    Purchase of Service Credit in Governmental Defined Benefit Plans\n\n       Under current law, employees of State and local governments \n     often have the option of purchasing service credits in their \n     State defined benefit plans in order to make up for the time \n     spent in another State or district. These employees cannot \n     currently use the money they have saved in their section \n     403(b) arrangements or section 457 plans to purchase these \n     service credits.\n       This proposal would permit State and local government \n     employees the option to use the funds in their section 403(b) \n     arrangements or section 457 deferred compensation plans to \n     purchase service credits.\n       These changes would apply to trustee-to-trustee transfers \n     after December 31, 1998.\n       This change will permit employees of State and local \n     governments, particularly teachers, who often move between \n     States and school districts in the course of their careers, \n     to buy a larger defined benefit pension with the savings they \n     have accumulated in a section 403(b) arrangement or section \n     457 deferred compensation plan. The greater number of years \n     of credit that they purchase would reflect a full career of \n     employment rather than two or more shorter periods of \n     employment in different States or districts. Allowing the \n     more flexible use of existing account balances in 403(b) \n     arrangements or section 457 plans will allow more of these \n     employees to purchase service credits and earn a full defined \n     benefit pension.\n\n\n                      Missing Participants Program\n\n       Under current law in the case of certain terminated single \n     employer defined benefit plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation (PBGC) will act as a clearinghouse for benefits \n     due to participants who cannot\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\n     be located (``missing participants''). Under the program, \n     when a plan is terminated and is unable to locate former \n     workers who are entitled to benefits, the terminating plan is \n     allowed to transfer these benefits to the PBGC which then \n     attempts to locate the employees in question. The missing \n     participants program is limited to certain defined benefit \n     plans.\n       This proposal would expand the PBGC's missing participant \n     program to cover multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. \n     The program would not apply to governmental plans or to \n     church plans not covered by the PBGC, however. If a plan \n     covered by the new program has missing participants when the \n     plan terminates, at the option of the plan (or employer, in \n     the case of a single employer plan), the missing \n     participants' benefits could be transferred to the PBGC along \n     with related information.\n       This change would take effect with respect to distributions \n     from t4erminating multiemployer plans that occur after the \n     PBGC has adopted final regulations implementing the \n     provision.\n       By permitting sponsors the option of transferring pension \n     funds to the PBGC, the chances that a missing participant \n     will be able to recover benefits could be increased.\n\n\n       Disregarding Rollovers for Purposes of the Cash Out Amount\n\n       Under current law, if a terminated participant has a vested \n     accrued benefit of $5,000 or less, the plan may distribute \n     such benefit in a lump sum without the consent of the \n     participant or the participant's spouse. This $5,000 cash-out \n     limit is not indexed for inflation. In applying the $5,000 \n     cash-out rule, the plan sponsor is under regulations required \n     to look back to determine if an individual's account every \n     exceeded $5,000 at the time of any prior distribution. \n     Rollover amounts count in determining the maximum balance \n     which can be involuntarily cashed out.\n       This proposal would allow a plan sponsor to disregard \n     rollover amounts in determining eligibility for the cash-out \n     rule, that is, whether a participant's vested accrued benefit \n     exceeds $5,000.\n       This proposal would apply to distributions after December \n     31, 1998.\n       The reason for this change is to remove a possible reason \n     for employers to refuse to accept rollovers.\n\n\n                            Plan Amendments\n\n       Under current law, there is generally a short period of \n     time to make plan amendments that reflect the amendments to \n     the law. In addition, the anti-cutback rules can have the \n     unintentioned effect of preventing an employer from amending \n     its plan to reflect a change in the law.\n       Amendments to a plan or annuity contract made pursuant to \n     any amendment made by this bill are not required to be made \n     before the last day of the first plan year beginning on or \n     after January 1, 2001. In the case of a governmental plan, \n     the date for amendments is extended to the first plan year \n     beginning on or after January 1, 2003. Operational compliance \n     would, of course be required with respect to all plans as of \n     the applicable effective date of any amendment made by this \n     Act.\n       In addition, timely amendments to a plan or annuity \n     contract made pursuant to any amendment made by this Act \n     shall be deemed to satisfy the anti-cutback rules.\n       The reason for this change is that plan sponsors need an \n     appropriate amount of time to make changes to their plan \n     documents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Nickles, for himself, Mr. Frist, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Roth, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Gramm, Mr. Coats, Mr. Lott, Mr. Mack, Mr. Craig, Mr. Coverdell, \n        Mr. Abraham, Mr. Allard, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bond, \n        Mr. Brownback, Mr. Burns, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Helms, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Kempthorne, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Smith \n        of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Thurmond, \n        and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2330. A bill to improve the access and choice of patients to \nquality, affordable health care; read the first time.\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Republican \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Joining me in this effort are 46 of my \ncolleagues who recognize the importance of ensuring that all Americans \nare able to not only receive the care they have been promised, but also \nreceive the highest quality of care available. The foundation of this \nproposal was to address some of the very real concerns that consumers \nhave about their health care needs.\n  We know that many Americans have believed they were denied coverage \nthat their plans were supposed to cover. We recognize that some \nindividuals fear that their health care plans will not give them access \nto specialists when they need them. We know that some Americans think \ntheir health care plans care more about cost than they do about \nquality.\n  In contrast, we also know that many Americans are happy and satisfied \nwith their health care plan. We know that 81 percent of managed care \nenrollees are satisfied with their current health care plan. Another \nrecent analysis suggest that 79 percent of consumers in HMOs would \nrecommend their coverage. In addition Americans are leery of Washington \nsolutions and increased federal intervention.\n  Last January, the Leader asked me to put together a group of \ncolleagues to address the issue of health care quality. For the past \nseven months, Senators Frist, Collins, Hagel, Roth, Jeffords, Coats, \nSantorum, and Gramm worked tirelessly to put together a responsible, \ncredible package that would preserve what is best about our Nation's \nhealth care while at the same time determine ways to improve upon--\nwithout stifling--the quality of care our nation delivers. We set out \nto rationally examine the issues and develop reasonable solutions \nwithout injuring patient access to affordable, high quality care.\n  This was no easy task. We spent month after month talking to experts \nwho understand the difficulty and complexity of our system. We met with \nrepresentatives from all aspects of the industry including the Mayo \nClinic, the Henry Ford Health Systems, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Hospital Association, the National Committee \nfor Quality Assurance, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of \nHealthcare Organizations, Corporate Medical Directors, Commissioners \nfrom the President's Quality Commission, Purchasers, Families USA, the \nEmployee Benefit Research Institute and many others.\n  After many, many months of dissecting serious questions about our \nsystem we determined that there were indeed some areas in which we \ncould improve patient access and quality.\n  We have put together an innovative plan that will answer the problems \nthat exist in the industry while at the same time preserving \naffordability, which is of utmost importance. Mr. President, I think \nyou agree that if someone loses their health insurance because a \npolitician playing doctor drives prices to an unaffordable level, you \nhave hardly given them more rights or better quality health care.\n  We are proud of what we have been able to accomplish. For the first \ntime, patients can choose to be unencumbered in their relationship with \ntheir doctor. They will be able to choose their own doctor and get the \nmiddle man out of the way. There will be no corporate bureaucrat, no \ngovernment bureaucrat and no lawyer standing between a patient and \ntheir doctor.\n  Mr. President, the bill we introduce today:\n  Protects consumers in employer-sponsored plans that are exempt from \nstate regulation. People enrolled in such plans will have the right to:\n  Choose their doctors. Our bill contains both ``point-of-service'' and \n``continuity of care'' requirements that will enhance consumer choice.\n  See their ob-gyns and pediatricians without referral. Our bill will \ngive patients direct access to pediatricians and ob-gyns without prior \nreferral from a ``gatekeeper.''\n  Have a ``prudent layperson'' standard applied to their claims for \nemergency care. The GOP alternative will require health plans to \ncover--without prior authorization--emergency care that a ``prudent \nlayperson'' would consider medically necessary.\n  Communicate openly with their doctors without ``gag'' clauses.\n  Holds health plans accountable for their decisions.\n  Extends to enrollees in ERISA health plans and their doctors the \nright to appeal adverse coverage decisions to a physician who was not \ninvolved in the initial coverage determination.\n  Allows enrollees to appeal adverse coverage determinations to \nindependent medical experts who have no affiliation with the health \nplan. Determinations by these experts will be binding on the health \nplan.\n  Requires health plans to disclose to enrollees consumer information, \nincluding what's covered, what's not,\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\nhow much they'll have to pay in deductibles and coinsurance, and how to \nappeal adverse coverage decisions to independent medical experts.\n  Guarantees consumers access to their medical records.\n  Requires health care providers, health plans, employers, health and \nlife insurers, and schools and universities to permit an individual to \ninspect, copy and amend his or her own medical information.\n  Requires health care providers, health plans, health oversight \nagencies, public health authorities, employers, health and life \ninsurers, health researchers, law enforcement officials, and schools \nand universities to establish appropriate safeguards to protect the \nconfidentiality, security, accuracy and integrity of protected health \ninformation and notify enrollees of these safeguards.\n\n  Protects patients from genetic discrimination in health insurance. \nProhibits health plans from collecting or using predictive genetic \ninformation about a patient to deny health insurance coverage or set \npremium rates.\n  Promotes quality improvement by supporting research to give patients \nand physicians better information regarding quality.\n  Establishes the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research (AHQR), whose \npurpose is to foster overall improvement in healthcare quality and \nbridge the gap between what we know and what we do in healthcare today. \nThe Agency is built on the platform of the current Agency for Health \nCare Policy and Research, but is refocused and enhanced to become the \nhub and driving force of federal efforts to improve the quality of \nhealthcare in all practice environments--not just managed care.\n  The role of the Agency is not to mandate a national definition of \nquality, but to support the science necessary to provide information to \npatients regarding the quality of the care they receive, to allow \nphysicians to compare their quality outcomes with their peers, and to \nenable employers and individuals to be prudent purchasers based on \nquality.\n  Supports research, screening, treatment, education, and data \ncollection activities to improve the health of women.\n  Promotes basic and clinical research for osteoporosis; breast and \novarian cancer; and aging processes regarding women.\n  Expands research efforts into the underlying causes and prevention of \ncardiovascular diseases in women--the leading cause of death among \nAmerican women.\n  Supports data collection through the National Center for Health \nStatistics and the National Program of Cancer Registries, which are the \nleading sources of national data on the health status of women in the \nU.S.\n  Supports the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \nProgram, which provides for regular screening for breast and cervical \ncancers to underserved women.\n  Requires that the length of hospital stay after a mastectomy, \nlumpectomy or lymph node dissection be determined only by the \nphysician, in consultation with the patient, and without the need to \nobtain authorization from the health plan. If a plan covers \nmastectomies, it also must cover breast reconstruction after a \nmastectomy.\n  Makes health insurance more accessible and affordable by:\n  Allowing self-employed people to deduct the full amount of their \nhealth care premiums.\n  Making medical savings accounts available to everyone.\n  Reforming cafeteria plans to let consumers save for future health \ncare costs.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a comprehensive bill of rights that will \nbenefit all Americans, and I am proud to join with so many of my \ncolleagues in introducing it.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to address some criticisms \nthat have been made of our bill. These criticisms highlight some \nsignificant differences between our bill and the health care bill \nintroduced by Senate Democrats. Mr. President, our bill does differ \nsignificantly from the Senate Democrats' bill.\n  Our bill is the ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' Theirs is the \n``Lawyers' Right to Bill.''\n  Our bill lets doctors decide whether care is medically necessary. \nTheirs lets lawyers decide.\n  Our bill empowers an independent medical expert to order an insurance \ncompany to pay for medically necessary care so that patients suffer no \nharm. Theirs allows trial lawyers to sue health plans after harm is \ndone.\n  Mr. President, when my insurance company tells me that they won't \ncover a service for my family, I want the ability to appeal that \ndecision to a doctor who doesn't work for my insurance company. And I \nwant that appeal handled promptly, so that my family receives the \nbenefit. That is what our bill requires.\n  The Democrats' bill creates new ways for trial lawyers to make money. \nAccording to a June 1998 study by Multinational Business Services, the \nDemocrats' bill would create 56 new Federal causes of action--56 new \nreasons to sue people in Federal court.\n  That's fine for trial lawyers, but it doesn't do much for patients. \nPatients want their claim disputes handled promptly and fairly. \nAccording to a study by the General Accounting Office, it takes an \naverage of 25 months--more than two years--to resolve a malpractice \nsuit. One cause that the GAO studied took 11 years to resolve! I'm sure \nthe lawyers who handled that case did quite well for themselves. But \nwhat about the patient?\n  Under our bill, patients can appeal directly to an outside medical \nexpert for a prompt review of their claim--without having to incur any \nlegal expenses. In medical malpractice litigation, patients receive an \naverage of only 43 cents of every dollar awarded. The rest goes to \nlawyers and court fees.\n  Our bill assures that health care dollars are used to serve patients. \nTheir bill diverts these dollars away from patients and into the \npockets of trial lawyers.\n  Another big difference between our bill and the one introduced by \nSenate Democrats is that their bill takes a ``big government'' approach \nto health reform.\n  Mr. President, it was just four years ago that we debated Clintoncare \non the Senate floor. President Clinton wanted government-run health \ncare for all Americans. He wanted it then; he wants it still.\n  Just last September, President Clinton told the Service Employees \nUnion that he was ``glad'' that he had pushed for the federal \ngovernment to take over health care. ``Now if what I tried to do before \nwon't work,'' the President said, ``maybe we can do it another way. A \nstep at a time until we eventually finish this.''\n  The Democrats' bill would take us a step closer to the President's \ndream of a health care system run by federal bureaucrats and trial \nlawyers. The study I cited earlier by Multinational Business Services \nfound that their bill would impose 359 new federal mandates, 59 new \nsets of Federal regulations, and require the government to hire 3,828 \nnew federal bureaucrats.\n  Our bill relies on State Insurance Commissioners to protect those \nAmericans who are enrolled in state-regulated plans. We protect the \nunprotected by providing new federal safeguards to the 48 million \nAmericans who are enrolled in plans that the states are not permitted \nto regulate.\n  Their bill imposes a risky and complicated scheme that relies on \nfederal bureaucrats at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \nto enforce patients' rights in states that do not conform to the \nfederal mandates in their bill.\n  HCFA is the agency that oversees the federal Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms. Last year, in the Balanced Budget Act, Congress created new \nconsumer protections for Medicare beneficiaries--a ``Patients' Bill of \nRights'' for the 38.5 million senior citizens and disabled Americans \nwho rely on Medicare for their health care.\n  We asked HCFA to protect those rights. How have they done? I regret \nto say, Mr. President, that they have not done very well at all.\n  On July 16, a GAO witness testified before the Ways and Means \nCommittee on how well HCFA was doing in enforcing the Medicare \npatients' bill of rights. According to GAO, HCFA has ``missed 25 \npercent of the implementation deadlines, including the quality-of-care \nmedical review process for skilled nursing facilities. It is clear\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\nthat HCFA will continue to miss implementation deadlines as it attempts \nto balance the resource demands generated by the Balanced Budget Act \nwith other competing objectives.''\n  Mr. President, I won't detail all of the ways that HCFA has failed--\nthe fact that it is delaying implementation of a prostate screening \nprogram to which Medicare beneficiaries are entitled, the fact that it \nhas failed to establish a quality-of-care medical review process for \nskilled nursing facilities, the fact that it is far behind schedule in \ndeveloping a new payment system for home health services. The list goes \non and on.\n  But let me focus on one failure that is especially relevant. All of \nus agree that people have the right to information about their health \nplans. When they have the choice of more than one plan, accurate \ninformation that compares the plans is critical.\n  Last year, Congress allocated $95 million to HCFA to develop an \ninformation and education program for Medicare beneficiaries. This \nmoney was to be used for publishing and mailing handbooks containing \ncomparative plan information to seniors, establishing a toll-free \nnumber and Internet website, and sponsoring health information fairs.\n  Well, there haven't been any information fairs and the toll-free \nnumber isn't operational. They do have a website, but they've decided \nto mail comparative information handbooks only to seniors in 5 states: \nWashington, Oregon, Ohio, Florida and Arizona. So for the princely sum \nof a $95 million, only about 5.5 million seniors will receive important \ninformation about their health plans, leaving 32.5 million seniors \nwithout these handbooks. At that rate, HCFA would need more than $1 \nbillion each year just for handbooks.\n  Mr. President, if this agency is struggling to protest the rights of \n38.5 million Medicare beneficiaries, how can we ask it to protect the \nrights of up as many as 100 million people enrolled in private health \nplans?\n  We believe that consumer protections are too important to entrust to \na cumbersome and inefficient federal government. State governments have \nlong been in the business of insurance regulation and the federal \ngovernment should not usurp their role.\n  The federal government should protect those who are enrolled in plans \nthat are exempt from state regulation and those enrolled in the \nprograms it runs, like Medicare and Medicaid. The federal government \nshould start protecting the rights of senior citizens under Medicare, \ninstead of meddling in areas where it doesn't belong.\n  Mr. President, our bill is a truly comprehensive bill of rights for \npatients, providing new consumer protections for the 48 million \nAmericans who are unprotected by state law, giving the 124 million \nAmericans enrolled in employer-sponsored plans new rights to appeal \nadverse coverage decisions, protecting the civil rights of consumers to \ngain access to their medical records, protecting consumers against \ndiscrimination based on genetic tests, promoting quality improvement, \nestablishing a new women's health initiative, and giving millions of \nAmericans access to affordable health insurance through medical savings \naccounts.\n  The doctor-patient relationship is one of the most important in \npeople's lives. Our legislation preserves and protects that \nrelationship, while taking many common-sense steps forward to affirm \nand expand quality and access. I look forward with my colleagues and \nmany cosponsors, to the floor debate on this vital issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the \n``Patients' Bill of Rights'' with my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator \nDon Nickles, the members of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health \nCare Quality, and our distinguished Majority Leader, Senator Trent \nLott.\n  This bill is a product of several months of thoughtful discussion and \ndebate among Republican members to reach a consensus proposal to \nimprove health care quality.\n  As a physician who has practiced medicine for twenty years, I know \nthat health care is delivered best when the relationship between doctor \nand patient is given the highest priority. My goal is to provide the \nnecessary support to empower doctors and patients to make important \nhealth care decisions.\n  This proposal includes a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' which offers \nprotection for patients by insuring them full access to information \nabout their health plan; making sure patients receive necessary \nemergency care; allowing patients to keep their doctor during a \npregnancy or extended illness, even if their doctor is dropped by their \nplan; and allowing patients direct access to obstetric and \ngynecological care and pediatric care without having to obtain a \nreferral from a gatekeeper.\n  Many consumers fear that their health care plans will not give them \naccess to care when they need it most, that they will be denied the \nbenefits they have paid for and been promised, and that their health \nplans care more about cost than they do about quality. A critical \nmeasure of this bill is to hold health plans accountable for the \ncoverage decisions they make and to take the power of denial of care \nout of the hands of HMOs and place it in the hands of independent \nmedical experts. Our bill requires health plans to make coverage \ndeterminations in less than 72 hours if a doctor determines that \nfurther delay could jeopardize the life or health of a patient. We want \nto protect patients before harm occurs by setting up a process for \npatients and their families to get an immediate answer. Furthermore, we \nrequire health plans to provide quick internal grievance and \nindependent external appeals processes in cases where a plan may deny \ncoverage for necessary medical action or because it is an experimental \nprocedure.\n  Our bill fills a need by providing protections for patients who rely \non plans that states cannot touch. Our bill provides independent review \nof health plans for 125 million Americans without lining the pockets of \ntrial lawyers in the process. Further litigation serves to divert \nbillions of dollars away from health care and puts in the pockets of \ntrial lawyers.\n  Our bill guarantees patients the right to have access to their own \nmedical information and the right to amend their medical information if \nmistakes are made. We require health plans to inform a patient of the \nplan's practices to protect the confidentiality of their medical record \nand requires health plans to establish safeguards to protect the \nconfidentiality and security of health information.\n  Our bill has a strong focus on quality and a firm commitment to \nimprove quality. Some believe that quality can be legislated. Some here \nin Washington believe they know how to define quality. Yet the risk of \nwriting today's concept of quality into law, is that it is an evolving \nscience and if we are too rigid, we fail to capture the innovation that \nimproves quality of care and our ability to measure it.\n  Our legislation promotes quality improvement by supporting research \nto give patients and physicians better information regarding quality. \nThe ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' establishes an Agency for Health Care \nQuality Research (AHQR), whose purpose is to foster overall improvement \nin health care quality through supporting pertinent research and \ndisseminating information. The Agency is built on the platform of the \ncurrent Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, but is refocused \nand enhanced to become the hub and driving force of federal efforts to \nimprove quality of health care in all practice environments--from \nmanaged care to solo private practice, from urban to rural settings, \nand from federal to non-federal programs.\n  The role of the Agency is not to mandate a national definition of \nquality, but to support the science necessary to provide information to \npatients regarding the quality of the care they receive; to allow \nphysicians to compare their quality outcomes with their peers; and to \nenable employers and individuals to be prudent purchasers based on \nquality.\n  The new Agency will build public-private partnerships to advance and \nshare quality measures. Quality means different things to different \npeople. Therefore, in collaboration with the private sector, the Agency \nshall conduct research that can figure out what quality really means to \npatients and clinicians, how to measure quality, and what actions can \nimprove care.\n  It will promote quality by sharing information. While proven medical \nadvances are made daily, patients wait too long to benefit from these \ndiscoveries. We must get the science to the people by better sharing of \ninformation and more effective dissemination. The Agency is required to \ndevelop evidence-rating systems to help people judge the quality of \nscience.\n  The Agency plays an important role in facilitating innovation in \npatient care with streamlined assessment of new technologies. Patients \nshould benefit from breakthrough technologies sooner, while inefficient \nmethods should be phased out faster. The Agency will be accessible to \nboth private and public entities for technology assessments and will \nshare information on assessment methodologies.\n  Currently, quality measurement too often requires manual chart \nreviews for such simple data as frequently of procedures, infection \nrates, or other complications. Improved computer systems will advance \nquality scoring and facilitate decision-making in patient care.\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\nThe Agency will aggressively support the development of state-of-the-\nart information systems systems for health care quality.\n  While most policy discussions this year are targeting managed care, \nquality improvement is just as important to the solo private \npractitioner. The Agency will focus on primary care delivery research \nto examine how science is translated in the doctor's office. The agency \nwill specifically address quality in rural and other underserved areas \nby advancing telemedicine services and other distance technologies.\n  Most of the many federal health care programs today support some kind \nof health services research and conduct various quality improvement \nprojects. The Agency shall coordinate these initiatives to avoid \ndisjointed, uncoordinated, or duplicative efforts.\n  Finally, this debate is due to the fact that patients want to know if \nthey receive quality health care. But compared to what? Statistically \naccurate, sample-based national surveys will efficiently provide \nreliable and affordable data--without excessive, overly intrusive, and \npotentially destructive, mandatory reporting requirements. This is \naccomplished through an expansion of the current Medical Expenditure \nPanel Survey to require that outcomes be measured and reported to \nCongress so the public may better determine the state of quality, and \ncost, of the nation's health care.\n  The role of the AHQR is not to mandate national standards of clinical \npractice. Definitions and measures of quality are an evolving science, \na science critically important to making educated and appropriate \nchoices in a rapidly changing and dynamic health care system. This bill \nwill go a long way in bridging the gap between what we know and what we \ndo in health care today.\n  The bill we are introducing today has a strong focus on women's \nhealth issues. On March 6, 1998, I introduced S. 1722, the ``Women's \nHealth Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998'' with our Majority \nLeader, Senator Trent Lott, to increase awareness of some of the most \npressing diseases and health issues that women in our country face. \nThese provisions, which have been included in the Patients' Bill of \nRights Act, focus on women's health research and prevention activities \nat the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. The goal of these provisions is to create \ngreater awareness of women's health issues and to highlight the \ncritical role our public health agencies, the NIH and CDC, play in \nproviding a broad spectrum of activities to improve women's health--\nincluding research, screening, prevention, treatment, education, and \ndata collection.\n  Among others, these provisions promote basic and clinical research \nfor osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer. We expand our research \nefforts into the underlying causes and prevention of cardiovascular \ndiseases in women--the leading cause of death in U.S. women. The bill \nreauthorizes the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program \nwhich provides for crucial screening services for breast and cervical \ncancers to underserved women and supports data collection through the \nNational Center for Health Statistics and the National Program of \nCancer Registries which are the leading sources of national data on the \nhealth status of U.S. women.\n  The reauthorization of these research programs will help assure \nscientific progress in our fight against these diseases and will lessen \ntheir burden on women and their families. We have the support of nearly \nthe full Senate Labor and Human Resources committee and many members of \nthe United States Senate from both sides of the aisle for these \nprovisions. The level of support for these programs is a testament to \nthe need to combat the disease affecting women and to maintain the \ncrucial health services that help prevent these diseases.\n  One of the provisions I am most proud to include in this bill is the \nprohibition on genetic discrimination in healthy insurance practices. \nWe as a nation must face the fear of discrimination in health insurance \npractices based on our increasing ability to gather genetic information \nabout ourselves and our families. Our ability to predict what diseases \nindividuals may be at risk for in the future has caused great concern \nthat this powerful information--the information we all carry in our \ngenes--may be used against us.\n  I am deeply troubled when I hear from the Tennessee Breast Cancer \nCoalition that genetic counselors are facing women everyday who are \nafraid of the consequences of genetic testing. Women are avoiding \ngenetic testing due to concerns about loss of health insurance coverage \nfor themselves or their families--even though a genetic test might \nreveal that a woman is not at high risk and therefore allow her to make \nmore informed health care choices.\n  I am a strong advocate for legislation which would prohibit \ndiscrimination in health insurance against healthy individuals and \ntheir families based on their genetic information. We all carry genetic \nmutations that may place us at risk for future disease--therefore we \nare all at risk for discrimination. If I receive a genetic test which \nshows I am at risk for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, should this \npredictive information be used against me or my family? Particularly \nwhen I am currently healthy and, in fact, may never develop the \nillness? I think the American public has answered quite clearly, \n``no.''\n  The Senate Republican Task Force made the same decision to say \n``no.'' Not only are we addressing the rights of patients today--but we \nare thinking forward to future concerns of patients. I must commend the \nefforts of my colleague Senator Snowe whose original bill, S. 89, has \nprovided a framework and the sound principles for the basis of the \nlegislation. She has supported the Task Force effort and worked with us \nstep by step to craft this legislation. I must also commend the members \nof the Task Force, particularly Senator Jeffords, who had the foresight \nto include these provisions.\n  Our bill prohibits health insurers from collecting genetic \ninformation about a patient; prohibits health insurers from using \npredictive genetic information to deny coverage; prohibits health \ninsurers from using predictive genetic information in setting premiums \nor rates; and requires health insurers to inform patients of the health \nplans' confidentiality practices and safeguards in place if a patient \nwishes to disclose genetic information for purposes of treatment.\n  Preventing genetic discrimination has enormous implications for \nimproving the quality of care patients receive. As a physician and \nresearcher, I am particularly concerned that the fear of discrimination \nwill prevent individuals from participating in research studies and \ntherefore hinder the scientific answers we need which hold the promise \nof higher quality medical care. I am concerned that individuals feel \nsafe taking advantage of new genetic technologies to improve their \nmedical care.\n  The goal of our bill is to provide the public with peace of mind. If \nfamilies or individuals want to undergo genetic testing, this bill will \nensure that insurance companies cannot discriminate based on this \ninformation. We must act now. Only with these measures can we ensure \nthat knowledge about our genetic heritage will be used to improve our \nhealth--and not force us to hide in fear that this information will \ncause us harm.\n  Finally, our bill enhances access and choice of health insurance \ncoverage by increasing access to and affordability of health care. The \nbill includes provisions to allow self-employed individuals to fully \ndeduct their health care expenses; provides greater flexibility to \nemployees who utilize flexible spending accounts to pay for health \ncare; and gives incentives to individuals to have control over their \nhealth care decisions and costs through expansion of the use of Medical \nSavings Accounts. This option will allow a patient to access the \nphysician of their choice and choose the medical treatment they need \nwithout any interference from a gatekeeper.\n  The ``Patient's Bill of Rights'' offers all Americans: quality \nimprovement built on a foundation of science, patient protection to \naccess the care they need from the provider of choice, trust in the \nhealth care delivery system, and access to affordable health insurance \ncoverage. I am pleased that this bill represents a forward-looking \napproach to provide for continuous improvement in health care quality. \nIt meets our goal of assuring that the doctor and patient define \nquality, not HMOs, not bureaucrats and not trial attorneys.\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending Senator \nNickles and all of the Members who participated in putting the \n``Patients' Bill of Rights'' legislation together. I think it is solid \nlegislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system \nfor Americans and I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the ``Patients' Bill \nof Rights.''\n  As always, there has been a flurry of work over the past few weeks as \nwe have put this legislation together. But this last minute work is \nonly possible because we have laid a solid foundation throughout the \nentire 105th Congress.\n  Over the past 14 months, the Labor and Human Resources Committee has \nheld 11 hearings related to the issues of health care quality, \nconfidentiality, genetic discrimination and the Health Care Financing \nAdministration's (HCFA) implementation of its new health insurance \nresponsibilties. Senator Bill Frist's Public Health and Safety \nSubcommittee has also held three hearings on the work of the Agency of \nHealth Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). Each of these hearings helped \nus in developing the separate pieces of legislation that are reflected \nin our ``Patients'' Bill of Rights.''\n  Other colleagues here and on the House side, have worked ont this \nsubject for an extended period of time. Many of the protections that \nare included in the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' are similar to those \nfashioned by Senator Roth and the Finance Committee last year when we \nprovided many of these same protections to plans that serve Medicare \npatients.\n  As we prepared this legislation we had three goals in mind. First, \ngive families the protections they want and need. Second, ensure that \nmedical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their \npatients. And finally, keep the cost of this legislation low so it does \nnot displace anyone from being able to get health-care coverage.\n  Information about products or services is the keystone to any well \nfunctioning market. This bill requires full information disclosure by \nan employer about the health plans he or she offers to employees. \nPeople need to know what the plan will cover and what their out-of-\npocket expenses will be. They need to know where and how they will get \ntheir health care and who will be providing those services. They also \nneed to know how adverse decisions by the plan can be appealed, both \ninternally and externally to an independent reviewer.\n  This aspect of our bill, that gives enrollees a new ERISA remedy of \nan external grievance and appeals process, is one of which I am \nparticularly proud since it is the cornerstone of S 1712, the Health \nCare QUEST Act, that I introduced with Senator Lieberman. Under the \n``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' enrollees will get timely decisions about \nwhat will be covered. Furthermore, if an individual disagrees with the \nplan's decision, that individual may ultimately appeal the decision to \nan independent external reviewer. The reviewer's decision will be \nbinding on the part of the health plan. But, the patient maintains his \nor her current rights under ERISA to go to court.\n  The medical records provisions, which my committee has also worked on \nfor the past year and are contained in S. 1921, the Health Care PIN \nAct, which I introduced with Senator Dodd, will give people the right \nto inspect and copy their personal medical information and it will \nallow them to amend the record if there is inaccurate information. The \nbill will ensure that the holders of the information safeguard the \nmedical records. It requires them to share, in writing, their \nconfidentiality policies and procedures with individuals.\n  The 104th Congress enacted the Kassebaum/Kennedy legislation, also \nknown as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n1996 (HIPAA) Many consider this legislation to be the most significant \nfederal health insurance reform of the past decade. During this \nCongress, I have tried to closely monitor the impact of HIPAA over the \npast year to ensure its successful implementation and consistency with \nlegislative intent.\n  The federal regulators at HCFA have faced an overwhelming new set of \nhealth insurance duties under HIPAA. In the five states that have \nfailed to or chosen not to pass the legislation required by HIPAA \n(California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Missouri), the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services is now required to act as \ninsurance regulator for the state HIPAA provisions.\n  Based on the findings of a GAO report that I will be releasing next \nweek, our experience under HIPAA demonstrates that HCFA is ill equipped \nto carry out the role of insurance regulator. Building a dual system of \noverlapping state and federal health insurance regulation is in no \none's best interest. The principle that the states should continue to \nregulate the private health insurance market guided the design of our \n``Patients' Bill of Rights'' legislation.\n  Our legislation creates new federal managed care standards to cover \nthose 48 million Americans covered by ERISA plans that the states \ncannot protect. We feel that it would be inappropriate to set federal \nhealth insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 \nstate insurance departments and have HCFA enforce them.\n  A recent example demonstrates why this is such a concern. The \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 establishes a prospective payment system \n(PPS) for home health care in fiscal year 2000. The payment system \ndesigned for the interim period is proving to be an intolerable burden \nfor the home health agencies that serve Vermont's Medicare \nbeneficiaries. At a July 16th House Ways and Means hearing, HCFA's \nadministrator stated that she intended to postpone the development of a \nMedicare prospective payment systems for home health services. Her \nstatement that she is delaying this mandate will result in many home \nhealth providers not receiving the reimbursement that they deserve and \nputs many of those providers at risk.\n  Given HCFA's inability to carry out its current responsibilities, I \nbelieve it would be irresponsible to promise the American people that \nthey will be able to receive new federal guarantees in the private \nhealth insurance system if we are relying on HCFA to enforce these \nrights.\n  Our proposal, by keeping the regulation of health insurance where it \nbelongs--at the state level--provides the American people with a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights that they can have the confidence in knowing \nwill be enforced.\n  I am afraid that the political battle over this legislation will be \nthe subject that dominates the headlines. But the real issue here is to \ngive Americans the protections they want and need in a package that \nthey can afford and that we can enact. That is why I and others here \nhave been working on this legislation since the beginning of this \nCongress, and why I hope the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' we have \nintroduced today will be adopted before the end of the Congress and \nsigned into law by the President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2331. A bill to provide a limited waiver for certain foreign \nstudents of the requirement to reimburse local educational agencies for \nthe costs of the students' education; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n       limited waiver of costs requirements for foreign students\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \npermit local school districts to waive the cost requirements of foreign \nstudents studying in our public high schools in the United States on F-\n1 visas. The law now mandates that all foreign students who are not in \na government-funded exchange program must pay or reimburse the costs of \ntheir education in American public schools.\n  In those public school districts flooded with foreign students who \npay no taxes, this requirement makes good sense. However, in those \nschool districts which enroll a small number of foreign students and \nbear a tolerable burden there may be no need or desire for \nreimbursement. The decision to enroll and to require cost reimbursement \nshould be made at the local level. Current law, however, does not \npermit this local discretion. The bill I am introducing will allow \nlocal school districts to waive the requirement that foreign students \nmust pay for the cost of their education. The decision to waive or not \nwaive this requirement should be made at the grass roots level, not in \nWashington and my bill seeks to preserve this principle. It would amend \nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n(IIRIRA).\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\n  Foreign exchange students bring knowledge, cultural exposure and \nunderstanding to American students, schools and communities. I have \nbeen a proponent of cultural and educational exchanges and have \nsupported most international exchange programs over the years--both \nthose which bring foreign visitors here and those which send American \nstudents, scholars and practitioners abroad. I remain committed to \nthese programs.\n  In 1996, I supported the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act. This law states that as of November 30, 1996, \nIIRIRA prohibits any alien from receiving an F-1 student visa to attend \na public elementary school, grades K-8, or a publicly-funded adult \neducation program unless they pay the unsubsidized, per capita cost of \ntheir education in advance. My bill would not change current law \nrelating to elementary schools or adult education. It would not pertain \nto students on formal, government-funded international exchanges. It \nwould simply allow high school officials to waive the cost of education \nof high school-level foreign students in order to enroll an exchange \nstudent, should they wish to do so. I believe this has been an \nunintended consequence of IIRIRA.\n  Several cities have ``Sister City'' arrangements between American \ncities and cities in foreign countries. One valuable component of these \narrangements is an exchange program for high school students enabling \nAmerican youth to spend a year in a foreign high school while students \nfrom abroad spend a year in a high school here. No tuition is generally \nexchanged under the sister city agreement, but current U.S. law states \nthat visitors to our country must pay the unsubsidized cost of their \neducation, even though American students are exempted from the cost \nrequirement.\n  Along the Alaska-Yukon, Alaska-British Columbia and U.S.-Mexican \nborders there are schools serving very remote communities on both sides \nof the border. After enactment of the 1996 law, Canadian or Mexican \nstudents were no longer eligible to enter the United States to attend \nthe local public school even though governments and the local school \ndistricts agreed to enroll the students.\n  Many school districts prefer to enroll one or two exchange students a \nyear. Reciprocal exchange agreements are beneficial and host families \nenjoy these students in their homes. American exchange students \nattending schools in Germany, for example, are not subjected to the \nsame tuition requirements for their schooling, yet they gain an \nunderstanding of German history and culture and benefit from their \ntravels. Currently, U.S. law requires foreign students to pay tuition \nbefore they arrive in the United States. The extra paper work, the up-\nfront costs and the extra burden these requirements place on foreign \nstudents tend to undermine the purposes of cultural exchanges.\n  I remain mindful to past abuses of F-1 visas and am sympathetic to \nthe burden that large enrollments of foreign students place on American \npublic schools. My purpose in introducing this bill today is not to \nweaken the law as it currently reads, but to provide an outlet for our \nschools to give an educational opportunity for enrolling international \nexchange students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8482-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 358\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain] was added as a cosponsor of S. 358, a bill to provide for \ncompassionate payments with regard to individuals with blood-clotting \ndisorders, such as hemophilia, who contracted human immunodeficiency \nvirus due to contaminated blood products, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nMcCain] was added as a cosponsor of S. 852, a bill to establish \nnationally uniform requirements regarding the titling and registration \nof salvage, nonrepairable, and rebuilt vehicles.\n\n\n                                S. 1459\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Mack] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1459, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a 5-year extension of the \ncredit for producing electricity from wind and closed-loop biomass.\n\n\n                                S. 1464\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, his name was added as a cosponsor \nof S. 1464, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1482\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coats, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1482, a bill to amend \nsection 223 of the Communications Act of 1934 to establish a \nprohibition on commercial distribution on the World Wide Web of \nmaterial that is harmful to minors, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2154\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2154, a bill to \npromote research to identify and evaluate the health effects of \nsilicone breast implants, and to ensure that women and their doctors \nreceive accurate information about such implants.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 97\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from New \nYork [Mr. Moynihan] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 97, a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress \nconcerning the human rights and humanitarian situation facing the women \nand girls of Afghanistan.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 105\n\n  At the request of Mr. Biden, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 105, a concurrent resolution expressing \nthe sense of the Congress regarding the culpability of Slobodan \nMilosevic for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in the \nformer Yugoslavia, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 189\n\n  At the request of Mr. Torricelli, the names of the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Enzi] and the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] were \nadded as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 189, a resolution honoring the \n150th anniversary of the United States Women's Rights Movement that was \ninitiated by the 1848 Women's Rights Convention held in Seneca Falls, \nNew York, and calling for a national celebration of women's rights in \n1998.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3199\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman his name was added as a cosponsor of \nAmendment No. 3199 proposed to S. 2168, an original bill making \nappropriations for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and \nUrban Development, and for sundry independent agencies, commissions, \ncorporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n1999, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8512-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8512-S8513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 108--RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n             THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Frist) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 108\n\n       Whereas in 1948 the Congress, by its enactment of the \n     National Heart Act and creation of the National Heart \n     Institute, recognized the urgent need to establish a national \n     program of research and demonstration projects relating to \n     the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases \n     of the heart and circulation;\n       Whereas the Congress has consistently and generously \n     supported the purposes of the National Heart Act;\n       Whereas, since the creation of the National Heart \n     Institute, the Congress changed the name of the Institute to \n     the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and expanded \n     and clarified the Institute's role in advancing human \n     understanding or awareness of diseases of the heart and blood \n     vessels, diseases of the lungs, diseases of the blood, the \n     use of blood and blood products, the management of blood \n     resources, and sleep disorders through research, research \n     training, demonstration projects, and public education \n     activities;\n       Whereas June of 1998 marks the 50th anniversary of the \n     creation of the National Heart Institute which was \n     established to lead a national effort to prevent, diagnose, \n     and treat heart diseases;\n       Whereas research supported by the National Heart, Lung, and \n     Blood Institute has\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\n     led to the identification of risk factors for coronary heart \n     disease such as high cholesterol level, high blood pressure, \n     obesity, physical inactivity, and cigarette smoking;\n       Whereas the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has \n     conducted and supported studies that resulted in lifesaving \n     procedures for heart disease patients, including open-heart \n     surgery, balloon angioplasty, heart transplants, and \n     insertion of pacemakers and other devices to improve heart \n     function;\n       Whereas patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and other \n     lung diseases are receiving better treatment with an improved \n     quality of life because of research supported by programs of \n     the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;\n       Whereas the work of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute has provided significant bases for progress in the \n     treatment of inherited blood diseases such as sickle cell \n     anemia and hemophilia, and in gene therapy research which \n     suggests the possibility of cures for such diseases;\n       Whereas the work of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute has provided significant bases for advances in \n     molecular genetics, gene therapy, and other new technologies, \n     which offer opportunity and promise of further advances \n     against such devastating diseases as coronary heart disease, \n     asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, and cystic \n     fibrosis;\n       Whereas the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \n     national education programs have significantly raised public \n     awareness about the dangers of elevated cholesterol levels \n     and high blood pressure, the importance of early response to \n     heart attack symptoms, and asthma prevention and treatment;\n       Whereas the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \n     efforts to promote research and education have contributed to \n     a dramatic decline over the past 50 years in death rates from \n     coronary heart disease and stroke;\n       Whereas researchers, professional societies, voluntary and \n     public health organizations, and patient groups have all \n     contributed to the National Heart Act's goals of advancing \n     research and increasing public awareness;\n       Whereas the Congress intends that the National Heart, Lung, \n     and Blood Institute continue its contribution to public \n     awareness by disseminating its research findings to health \n     professionals and the public; and\n       Whereas the Congress intends that the National Heart, Lung, \n     and Blood Institute continue to aggressively pursue efforts \n     to improve the health of the people of the United States by \n     conducting and supporting research and demonstration projects \n     on the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of \n     diseases of the heart and blood vessels, diseases of the \n     lungs, and diseases of the blood while also conducting or \n     supporting research and demonstration projects on the use of \n     blood and blood products, the management of blood resources, \n     and sleep disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the 50th \n     anniversary of the enactment of the National Heart Act and \n     the creation of the institute that became the National Heart, \n     Lung, and Blood Institute;\n       (2) recognizes heart, lung, and blood researchers, \n     professional societies, voluntary and public health \n     organizations, and patient groups for their active \n     participation in the activities of, or promoted by, the \n     National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and for their \n     many, varied contributions toward the achievement of the \n     goals of the National Heart Act and subsequent related Acts; \n     and\n       (3) reaffirms its support of the National Heart Act and \n     subsequent related Acts and their primary goal of \n     establishing and implementing a national effort to prevent, \n     diagnose, and treat diseases of the heart and blood vessels, \n     lungs, and blood.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be submitting today a \nSenate Concurrent Resolution recognizing and honoring the 50th \nanniversary of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. I am \njoined in this effort by our esteemed colleague from Tennessee, Dr. \nFrist, who by profession is a heart and lung transplant surgeon and \nmedical researcher. An identical resolution has already been introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Representative Bill Young.\n  Heart disease is our country's No. 1 killer and a leading cause of \ndisability. Chronic lung disease is the fourth leading cause of death. \nVirtually all of us have a friend or a loved one who has been affected \nby heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, other cardiovascular \ndiseases, asthma, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, or hemophilia.\n  The NHLBI is the Federal Government's leading supporter of heart \nresearch, as well as research into diseases of the blood vessels, \nlungs, and blood. There have been wonderful discoveries made through \nresearch and wonderful treatments that are provided in our hospitals in \nthese areas. For instance, the first open heart surgery did not occur \nuntil 1954. Today, surgeons routinely perform double, triple, and even \nquadruple heart bypass procedures.\n  Yet there is so much we still do not know. It seems to me more and \nmore research can unlock these mysteries and give us the opportunity to \nsave more and more lives in this country.\n  I might also add that there is another organization devoted to the \nreduction of death and disability from heart attack, stroke, and other \ncardiovascular diseases that is also celebrating its 50th birthday--the \nAmerican Heart Association. The American Heart Association has worked \nclosely over the years with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute in the fight against cardiovascular diseases.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have become increasingly concerned \nabout what has been happening to the amount of money spent on heart and \nstroke research by the federal government. Even with the significant \nincreases that Congress has been giving to the National Institutes of \nHealth over the past decade, funding for heart research has simply not \nkept pace even though it kills more Americans than any other disease.\n  In fact, funding for heart research at the NHLBI appears to be losing \nmore and more ground. It constant dollars from FY 1987 to FY 1997, \nfunding for the NHLBI heart program has decreased by 7.6 percent in \nconstant dollars, while funding for the Heart Program has increased by \n27.5 percent.\n  We can do better, and we must do better. Our Nation must do a better \njob than this in the battle against America's No. 1 killer.\n  During the commemoration of this 50th anniversary of the 1948 Heart \nAct, which created the National Heart Institute, I hope we can make \nmore progress against cardiovascular and other insidious diseases by \nproviding a significant increase in funding for the National Heart, \nLung, and Blood Institute and particularly for research against heart \ndisease and stroke.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8512-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               RELATIVE TO SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC CULPABILITY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   D'AMATO AMENDMENTS NOS. 3212-3213\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO proposed two amendments to the concurrent resolution (S. \nCon.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House for passing the Senate/House \nagreement on S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998. This \nlegislation, which I introduced last year, will put an end to forced \npayments by thousands of middle-class homeowners for unnecessary \nprivate mortgage insurance. These unnecessary premiums--which in some \ncases amount to over $1,000 per year--benefitted no one, other than the \nPMI companies that raked-in risk-free money. This legislation will make \nit thousands of dollars cheaper for struggling middle-class home \nbuyers--as well as co-op and condominium buyers--to share in the \nAmerican dream of home ownership without limiting this opportunity for \npeople who do need PMI coverage.\n  Mr. President, the House passed this legislation late last night, so \nthis bill will be sent to the White House for the President's \nsignature. Today, requiring unnecessary PMI is unethical--when the \nPresident signs S. 318 into law, this fleecing of homeowners will \nbecome illegal.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging the important and \nbeneficial role PMI plays in our mortgage markets. Traditionally, \nlenders have required 20% down for home mortgage loans. PMI was \ndeveloped to allow home buyers purchase with less than 20% down. PMI is \ntypically required when a home buyer cannot make the standard 20% down \npayment. In many areas, such as my home region of Long Island, housing \nprices are so high that many middle class home buyers, particularly \nfirst-time buyers, can't come up with a 20% down payment. The problem \nfaced by these home buyers arises because while PMI benefits one party, \nthe lender, it is paid for by the home owner. As a result, the lenders \nand servicers have no vested interest in pursuing cancellation, and the \nhomeowner who was paying for the PMI could not, or did not know, that \nthe coverage could be canceled.\n  By passing this legislation, Congress is helping to make the American \ndream of home ownership more affordable for many home buyers--\nparticularly struggling working families and people in areas with high \nhousing costs--who needed PMI because they don't have a lot of cash on \nhand for a down payment.\n  Some industry proponents have questioned whether this is a problem. \nMr. President, the numbers speak for themselves. Every year, \napproximately 1 million mortgage loans are made with PMI coverage.\n  In hearings in front of the Senate Banking Committee, even the \nprivate mortgage insurance industry was forced to admit that at least \n250,000 homeowners have at least 20% equity in their homes and are \nstill paying for unnecessary insurance. PMI premiums vary from $20 to \n$100 or more monthly. This means that working families are losing \nanywhere from $240 to $1200 or more per year in unnecessary payments. \nAt $100 per month, the savings for 250,000 homeowners would be $300 \nmillion yearly.\n  And these are just low-ball estimates of the extent of this problem--\na 1997 analysis of a 20,000 loan portfolio indicated that 1 out of 5 \nhomeowners were still paying for PMI, despite the fact that they had \naccumulated equity in excess of 20 percent.\n  S. 318 will remedy this market anomaly by requiring automatic \ncancellation of PMI once a homeowner has accumulated 22% home equity if \nhomeowner is current on payments. In addition, homeowners with good \npayment histories can initiate cancellation at 20% equity. This bill \nwill prohibit life-of-the-loan PMI coverage by requiring that coverage \nbe canceled half-way through the loan, regardless of circumstances.\n  S. 318 also provides that current and future homeowners be given \nnotice of their cancellation rights on an annual basis. S. 318 will \naccomplish these goals without adding to the regulatory bureaucracy. \nThis legislation is self-effecting and does not have a federal \nregulator.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Senate that \nhave worked tirelessly on this legislation--Senator Lauch Faircloth, \nSenator Rod Grams, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Senator Richard Bryan, \nSenator Christopher Dodd, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and all \ncosponsors of the bill.\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\n  I would also like to commend Chairman Leach of the House Banking \nCommittee for his tireless leadership on this issue, and Representative \nRick Lazio who chairs the Housing Subcommittee in the House.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Representative Jim Hansen of Utah. \nRepresentative Hansen first discovered the problem confronting \nhomeowners when he tried to cancel the PMI on his condominium. It was \nRepresentative Hansen who brought this abuse to our attention and first \nintroduced PMI legislation in the House. I think we all owe \nRepresentative Hansen a debt of gratitude for his work on this issue.\n  One more point that needs to be addressed is what is meant by the \nterm ``single-family dwelling.'' This is a defined term in the bill, \nand is incorporated in defined terms ``residential mortgage'' \n``residential mortgage transaction.'' It the intent of the Congress \nthat this term, as used in this legislation, apply to condominiums and \ncooperatives as well as more traditional single-family detached homes. \nMany coops and condos are single family dwelling units within multiple \ndwelling unit structures; however, they are still single family \ndwelling units as described in the definition of ``single family \ndwelling'' in this bill (as opposed to multi-family dwellings that \ninclude rental units). In fact this issue came to the Congress' \nattention when Representative Hansen tried to cancel the PMI on his \ncondominium. The authors of this legislation realize that within real \nestate industry the term ``single-family dwelling'' is frequently used \nto refer to detached single family homes alone, and not to the full \nspectrum of single family housing units (including Condos and coops). \nNevertheless, this industry usage was not what we were attempting \ncodify in this bill--in this legislation ``single family dwelling'' \nincludes all single family dwelling units, including condominiums and \ncooperatives, and owners of all single family residences, and are \nintended to be covered under this act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8514-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes \ntoday to talk about the mounting evidence of climate change. No one is \nsaying that there will be an end to the four seasons or that the oceans \nare about to start boiling. But as we consider the new data, it is \nbecoming increasing clear that we are being warned about the enormous \npower of humanity to affect our environment. We can either respect our \nsurroundings and work in concert with nature, or we can pollute at our \nperil.\n  Here are some of the facts from data collected by the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration:\n  June 1998 was the warmest June on record. Temperatures averaged more \nthan 1 degree Fahrenheit above the 1880-1997 long-term mean. \nTemperatures over land were even more astonishing--averaging nearly one \nand three quarters of a degree above the long term mean, exceeding the \nold record by several tenths of a degree Fahrenheit.\n  June continued an unprecedented string of record breaking \ntemperatures. Each month this year has set new all-time record global \nnear-surface temperatures.\n  The period January-June 1998 was the warmest on record.\n  Even though there was a cooling of the Central Pacific Ocean \ntemperatures due to the end of El Nino, global ocean temperatures \nduring June were still at record high levels.\n  Given the high degree of persistence of ocean temperature anomalies, \nscientists tell us it is quite possible that during July we will \nexperience the warmest monthly temperatures ever observed on the planet \nfor the past 600 years.\n  What has this trend meant for the United States? Essentially, \nthroughout our country we have been experiencing patterns of weather \nextremes.\n  The South experienced record dry conditions, with the driest April \nthrough June period on record for New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and \nFlorida. The drought was most severe in Texas and Florida, where it \nadversely impacted crops, ranges and pastures, and contributed to the \nburning of nearly one-half million acres of Florida land.\n  The drought and heat wave has resulted in a number of new records. \nFor example, Amarillo Texas had 13 days in June where temperatures were \nover 100 F. With a stable climate, the probability of this recurring is \nonce in 200 years, but with continued increases in greenhouse gases, \nthe probability would change to a 1 in 6 year event.\n  On the other hand, there have been unusually wet conditions in the \nnortheast and parts of the midwest during June. For example, rainfalls \nof 5 to 22 inches were observed across most of the central and \nnortheastern states with totals exceeding 200 percent of normal across \nthe Ohio Valley, New England the upper Mississipi Valley. Parts of the \nMidwest have experienced above normal rainfall since April, and the \nrains frequently fell from strong to severe thunderstorms, leading to \nabnormally frequent episodes of tornadoes, hail, managing winds and \nflash floods. The National Severe Storm Prediction Center reports that \n372 tornadoes were recorded during June in the country, which is nearly \n200 more than average. NOAA's National Hydrologic Information Center \nreports 63 flood-related fatalities for 1998 so far.\n  Numerous rainfall records have been broken. For example, more than 17 \ninches of rain fell during June at Blue Hill Observatory in \nMassachusetts, breaking all records.\n  For the April-June period as a whole, rainfall totals were the \nhighest in the historical record dating back to l895 in Rhode Island \nand Massachusetts, the third highest in Tennessee, and the fourth \nhighest in Iowa. Rivers in 17 states were near or above flood state as \nof July 6.\n  Mr. President, I believe this new data is additional evidence that we \nmust act to invest in an insurance policy to reduce the threat of \nglobal warming.\n  President Clinton has proposed to Congress a balanced program to \narrest greenhouse gases over 5 years through tax credits for energy-\nefficient purchases and renewable energy investments, and through new \nresearch and development programs targeted towards building, industry, \ntransportation and electricity. It is a well-conceived plan, and I'm \ndisappointed that the Senate bill on EPA appropriations reduces the \nPresident's request for EPA's portion of this initiative by $91 \nmillion.\n  Unfortunately, the efforts of many here in Congress seem to be aimed \nat preventing the government from taking any action on climate change--\neven for programs that would be good for our environment and public \nhealth regardless of whether you believe that climate change will \nhappen. The report accompanying the House EPA appropriations bill would \neven prohibit EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality from \n``conducting educational outreach or informational seminars on policies \nunderlying the Kyoto Protocol'' until or unless it is ratified.\n  Mr. President, let me take a final moment on the floor today to take \nsome pride in the path that Connecticut's largest employer, United \nTechnologies, is taking in this area. Some of you may have seen the \nfull page ad in July 16's Roll Call by UT entitled, Responding to the \nChallenge of Climate Change. ``Our generation's challenge,'' declares \nthe ad ``is addressing global climate change while sustaining a growing \neconomy--a challenge that demands a serious response from government, \nas well as industry and the public.'' United Technologies has taken a \nmajor step forward to reduce emissions. By 2007, the company commits to \ncutting its energy and water consumption per dollar sales by 25 percent \nbelow 1997 levels, with approximately the same reduction in its \nemissions that cause climate change. I congratulate United Technologies \nand its president George David for this great leap forward and urge us \nall to accept the challenge the company has put forth. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8515-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8515-S8516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNUM ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE STATEMENT\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the UNUM \nCorporation on its 150th Anniversary.\n  UNUM is based in Portland, Maine, has offices across America and \naround the globe, and enjoys a reputation for excellence throughout the \nworld.\n  July 17, 1998 marks the 150th Anniversary of the UNUM Corporation, a \ncompany incorporated in Maine in 1848 as Union Mutual Life Insurance \nCompany.\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\n  Throughout the past 150 years, UNUM has stayed true to the charge of \nits founder Elisha B. Pratt to ``find the better way'' and is known \ntoday as the company that ``sees farther.''\n  UNUM has become the world leader in disability insurance and \nconsistently ranks among the best places to work in America.\n  UNUM has chosen to celebrate its July 17 anniversary by having \nthousands of its employees volunteer a ``Day of Sharing'' to more than \n200 community service projects in six countries.\n  UNUM's ``Day of Sharing'' builds on a record of community partnership \nthat includes contributing more than 75,000 employee volunteer hours \nduring each of the past five years and the UNUM Foundation contributing \n$2 million to community programs last year alone.\n  Not only is UNUM an outstanding and exemplary business leader, \nproviding insurance protection to its customers, it is also an \ninvaluable community partner, improving the communities where its \nemployees have lived and worked for 150 years.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating \nand commending UNUM on its 150th anniversary and its outstanding \nachievements as a business leader and community partner.\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have spoken here many times in \nthe past expressing strong support on the issues of pension reform and \npension portability, and I would like to do so again today.\n  I believe that the accumulation and availability of retirement \nsavings is one of the most significant issues we face in our new \neconomy. Yet while much of the current debate is focused on the \nviability of the Social Security system--and rightly so--we must not \nforget that this is only part of the administrative mechanisms we have \nin place that allow people to move from job to job and take care of \ntheir families. As my good friend and colleague from Vermont has \nalready outlined in detail the specifics involved in our Retirement \nPortability Account bill, I will limit my own comments at this time to \nsome issues I consider to be of special importance.\n  Currently, employers and employees face three specific problems as \nindividuals attempt to take their retirement funds with them as they \nchange jobs over their career.\n  The first problem is the specialized rules that have been established \nfor the various kinds of accounts now available to employees. 401(k) \nplans for the private sector, 403(b) plans for non-profit \norganizations, 457 plans for state and local government employees, and \nso on all possess unique characteristics that are beneficial to \nindividual employers and employees, but also make administrative \ncompatibility between the plans problematic.\n  The second problem concerns control of the funds accumulated by the \nemployee, that is who is responsible for the paperwork as employees \nchange jobs. This has been one of the foremost concerns of small \nbusiness owners as they create accounts for a highly-mobile workforce.\n  The third problem involves the ability of employees to ``park'' their \naccumulated funds somewhere until they have a new retirement plan. \nHere, the key has been to find a convenient way to use so-called \n``conduit IRA's'' as a transfer mechanism into which funds can be \ntransferred on their way to a different retirement savings plan.\n  The Retirement Account Portability bill offered by Senator Jeffords \nand I has been developed to remedy these problems and more. This bill--\na companion bill to the bipartisan bill introduced by our House \ncolleagues, Representatives Earl Pomeroy and Jim Kolbe--is designed to \naccomplish two very specific and very important goals.\n\n  First, the bill will begin the removal of the all too numerous and \noverly complex barriers that prevent employees from taking their \nretirement savings with them as they switch jobs. By both eliminating \nthe redtape in the IRS Tax Code that unduly compartmentalizes various \nplan options and enhancing the effectiveness of conduit IRA's, it will \nallow individuals to roll their accumulated funds over into accounts at \ntheir current place of employment.\n  This offers two tangible outcomes. First, it allows employees to keep \ntrack of their savings in an efficient manner. Second, it alleviates \nthe burden placed on employers in terms of tracking and managing \naccounts of individuals that have moved on to other jobs. Based on \ndiscussions with my constituents, these represent dramatic improvements \nto current law, and, most significantly, allows individuals the \nopportunity to take advantage of the best investment options available \nto them.\n  The second goal of the bill is, in my view, equally important. As you \nknow, I believe that an internationally competitive economy entails \nfirst and foremost an effective diffusion of knowledge between firms \nand within regions. In the most dynamic regions in our country--Silicon \nValley, Route 128, the Research Triangle--this is accomplished \nprimarily by the movement of individuals from firm to firm and the \niterative and cumulative interaction that results. This activity should \nbe encouraged in every way possible, and the elimination of \nrestrictions that prevent pension portability will assist in this \neffort.\n  In conclusion, let me say that I consider this bill to be an initial \nbut very important step to where we want to go in this country in terms \nof our savings policy. Our overarching goal is to increase the \nfinancial security of all Americans and create an economic environment \nwhere each and every individual can prosper.\n  I would like to thank Senator Jeffords on the effort he has expended \nin crafting this bill, and I look forward to working with him in the \nfuture on ever more effective legislation.\n\n

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Bandelier National Monument (hereinafter, the Monument) \n     was established by Presidential proclamation on February 11, \n     1916, to preserve the archeological resources of a ``vanished \n     people, with as much land as may be necessary for the proper \n     protection thereof. . .'' (No. 1322; 39 Stat. 1746).\n       (2) At various times since its establishment, the Congress \n     and the President have adjusted the Monument's boundaries and \n     purpose to further preservation of archeological and natural \n     resources within the Monument.\n       (A) On February 25, 1932, the Otowi Section of the Santa Fe \n     National Forest (some 4,699 acres of land) was transferred to \n     the Monument from the Santa Fe National Forest (Presidential \n     Proclamation No. 1191; 17 Stat. 2503).\n       (B) In December of 1959, 3,600 acres of Frijoles Mesa were \n     transferred to the National Park Service from the Atomic \n     Energy Committee (hereinafter, AEC) and subsequently added to \n     the Monument on January 9, 1991, because of ``pueblo-type \n     archeological ruins germane to those in the monument'' \n     (Presidential Proclamation No. 3388).\n       (C) On May 27, 1963, Upper Canyon, 2,882 acres of land \n     previously administered by the AEC, was added to the Monument \n     to preserve ``their unusual scenic character together with \n     geologic and topographic features, the preservation of which \n     would implement the purposes'' of the Monument (Presidential \n     Proclamation No. 3539).\n       (D) In 1976, concerned about upstream land management \n     activities that could result in flooding and erosion in the \n     Monument, Congress included the headwaters of the Rito de los \n     Frijoles and the Canada de Cochiti Grant (a total of 7,310 \n     acres) within the Monument's boundaries (Public Law 94-578; \n     90 Stat. 2732).\n       (E) In 1976, Congress created the Bandelier Wilderness, a \n     23,267 acres area that covers over 70 percent of the \n     Monument.\n       (3) The Monument still has potential threats from flooding, \n     erosion, and water quality deterioration because of the mixed \n     ownership of the upper watersheds, along its western border, \n     particularly in Alamo Canyon.\n       [(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to] (b) \n     Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to modify the boundary \n     of the Monument to allow for acquisition and enhanced \n     protection of the lands within the Monument's upper \n     watershed.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \ntoday passed S. 1510, the Rio Arriba, New Mexico Land Conveyance Act of \n1998. This legislation will provide long-term benefits for the people \nof Rio Arriba County, New Mexico.\n  Seventy percent of Rio Arriba County is in federal ownership. \nCommunities find themselves unable to grow or find available property \nnecessary to provide local services. This legislation allows for \ntransfer by the Secretary of the Interior real property and \nimprovements at an abandoned and surplus administrative site for the \nCarson National Forest to Rio Arriba County. The site is known as the \nold Coyote Ranger District Station, near the small town of Coyote, New \nMexico.\n  The Coyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes, \nincluding a community center, and a fire substation. Some of the \nbuildings will also be available for the County to use for storage and \nrepair of road maintenance equipment, and other County vehicles.\n  Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of \nno further use to them, since they have recently completed construction \nof a new administrative facility for the Coyote Ranger District. The \nForest Service reported to the General Services Administration that the \nimprovements on the site were considered surplus, and would be \navailable for disposal under their administrative procedures. At this \nparticular site, however, the land on which the facilities have been \nbuilt is withdrawn public domain land, under the jurisdiction of the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  I have worked closely with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land \nManagement since introducing this bill in November. The Administration \nis supportive of the legislation and the changes made to the bill.\n  Mr. President, since neither the Bureau of Land Management nor the \nForest Service have any interest in maintaining Federal ownership of \nthis land and the surplus facilities, and Rio Arriba County desperately \nneeds them, passage of S. 1510 is a win-win situation for the federal \ngovernment and New Mexico. I look forward to the House's agreement and \nPresidential signature soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8538-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LAKE CHELAN NATIONAL RECREATION AREA\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 1683) to transfer \nadministrative jurisdiction over part of the Lake Chelan National \nRecreation Area from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of \nAgriculture for inclusion in the Wenatchee National Forest, which had \nbeen reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, with \nan amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in \nlieu thereof the following:\n\n                                S. 1683\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This has been, to me, one of the more important days of \nthis session. I believe that is true because of the introduction \nearlier by Senator Lott of the Republican health care bill.\n  First, I commend the majority leader for the dexterous way in which \nhe handled both allowing the members of a committee, a standing \ncommittee, to work, and then to join them with a leadership task force, \nformed by the majority leader, to put together a bill which could be \nbacked by all Members of the Republican side.\n  That was no easy task, but I am happy to say that by working together \nI think we have provided, for the Senate's review, an outstanding piece \nof legislation. I also want to begin by commending Senator Nickles and \nall the Members who participated in putting this legislation together \non the task force, and in my committee. I think it is solid legislation \nthat will result in a greatly improved health care system for \nAmericans. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  As always, there has been a flurry of work over the past few weeks as \nwe have put this legislation together. But this last-minute work is \nonly possible because we laid a sound foundation throughout the entire \n105th Congress through many hearings.\n  In particular, there are members on my committee, who also served on \nthe task force, who I think were key in bringing about a consensus.\n  First, Senator Frist, who, obviously, from his valuable expertise as \na physician, as well as a masterful legislator, has assisted in helping \nus provide a bill which we can be proud of and which we can be assured \nwill be in the best interest of all patients as well as the health care \nsystem.\n  Senator Collins, who came here after being a State regulator in the \nhealth care area, provided tremendous knowledge and insight into how we \ncould weave in and out the very complicated aspects of what should the \nFederal Government do and what should the States do, with leaving an \nemphasis primarily on allowing the States--which I will talk about \nlater.\n  Over the past 14 months, the Labor and Human Resources Committee has \nheld 11 hearings related to issues of health care quality, \nconfidentiality, genetic discrimination, privacy, and HCFA's \nimplementation of its new health insurance responsibilities.\n  Senator Bill Frist's Public Health and Safety Subcommittee has also \nheld three hearings on the work of AHCPR. That has to do with trying to \nensure that we have adequate information about outcomes and to try to \nutilize that information to better equip our professional people to be \nthe best in the world in health care. Each of these hearings helped us \nin developing the separate pieces of legislation that are reflected in \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Other colleagues here and on the House side have worked on this \nsubject for an extended period of time, as well. Many of the \nprotections that are included in the Patients' Bill of Rights are \nsimilar to those fashioned by Senator Roth in the Finance Committee \nlast year when we provided many of these same protections to plans that \nserve Medicare patients.\n  As we prepared this legislation, we had three goals in mind: first, \ngive families the protections they want and need; second, ensure that \nmedical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their \npatients; and, finally, keep the cost of this legislation low so it \ndoes not displace anyone from being able to get health care coverage.\n  As we all know, the number of people who participate is extremely \nsensitive\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\nto the cost of health care. Information about products or services is \nthe keystone to any well-functioning market. The bill requires full \ninformation disclosure by an employer about the health plans that he or \nshe offers employees. People need to know what the plan will cover and \nwhat their out-of-pocket expenses will be. And this should be in clear \nand obvious language which is readily available for the patient or the \nprospective purchaser of the insurance to review so they do not \nsuddenly realize they have run out of money as far as the plan is \nconcerned or they find that many aspects are not covered.\n  They need to know where and how they will get their health care, and \nwho will be providing these services. They also need to know how \nadverse decisions by the plan can be appealed, both internally and \nexternally, to an independent reviewer. This is an extremely important \npart of this bill. This aspect of the bill which gives employees a \nbrand new ERISA remedy of an external grievance and appeals process is \none of which I am particularly proud since it is the cornerstone of S. \n1712, my Health Care QUEST Act, which, incidentally, was a bipartisan \nbill.\n  Under our bill, patients will get timely decisions about what will be \ncovered. Further, if an individual disagrees with the plan's decision \nabout coverage, that individual may ultimately appeal the decision to \nan independent, external reviewer after an internal review decision. \nAnd this can be done in an expedited situation, if it is necessary.\n  The reviewer's decision will be binding on the part of the health \nplan, and the patients maintain their rights under ERISA to go to \ncourt. This is extremely important. This will be binding on the plan. \nSo there will be no appeal by the plan through the courts or elsewhere \nfrom the decision by the reviewer.\n  It is infinitely better to be able to get the care needed than to sue \nto recover damages because he or she could not get the care they \nneeded, and the fact that that care was not being granted resulted in \ngrievous situations for them.\n  The medical records provision, which my committee also worked on for \nthe past year, will give people the right to inspect and copy their \npersonal medical information, and it will also allow them to append the \nrecord if there is inaccurate information. The bill will ensure that \nthe holders of the information safeguard the medical records and \nrequires them to share, in writing, their confidentiality policies and \nprocedures with individuals. This is part of what was called the PIN \nAct, the Privacy Act, which also was a bipartisan bill.\n  I want to again mention the task force. Senator Nickles started out \nsome months ago desiring to provide the Republicans with a bill with \nwhich they could be pleased. A lot of work went into that. Many, many \nmeetings were held. Many hours were spent trying to decide and make \nfinal decisions. I was a member of that task force, as was Senator \nFrist and Senator Collins from our committee.\n  We had the ability to be able to utilize the expertise of the \ncommittee and the professional staff involved with them. I would like \nto mention Paul Harrington, in particular, and Karen Guice, of my \nstaff, who is also a pediatrician and a fellow, for their incredibly \ngood determinations on what the bill should have and their assistance \nin putting it together.\n  I praise Senators Snowe and Domenici, who worked together to give us \na portion of the bill which has to do with genetics and the protections \nthat a patient should have, or an enrollee in a plan should have, to \nensure that the genetic information--that genetic information--is not \nused against them to screen them.\n\n  What I want to get to now, and I know there will be a lot more \ndiscussion next week, is the question of whether or not it is better to \nhand over much of the regulation to the Federal Government or whether \nit is better to leave it with the States.\n  The 104th Congress enacted the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation known as \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, fondly \nreferred to as HIPAA. Many consider this legislation to be the most \nsignificant Federal health insurance reform of the past decade. During \nthis Congress, I have tried to closely monitor the impact of HIPAA over \nthe past year to ensure its successful implementation consistent with \nlegislative intent.\n  The Federal regulators at HCFA have faced an overwhelming new set of \nhealth insurance duties under HCFA. What we said was that if the States \nwanted to--and almost all of them did--they could take control and \nimplement the provisions of HIPAA. But five decided not to--California, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Missouri.\n  So what happened is that enforcement was handed over to the Federal \nGovernment. That is the point I want to make as to what has happened \nbecause of that. The Department of Health and Human Resources is now \nrequired to act as the insurance regulator for the State HIPAA \nprovisions.\n  Based on the findings of the GAO report that will be released next \nweek, HCFA is ill equipped to carry out the role of insurance \nregulator. Building a dual system of overlapping State and Federal \nhealth insurance regulation is in no one's best interest, and the \nprinciple that States should regulate private health insurance guided \nthe design of our legislation to get out of the problems created by \nHIPAA.\n  Our legislation creates new Federal managed care standards to cover \nthose 48 million Americans covered by ERISA plans that the States \ncannot protect. That is the second point. There are areas that the \nState is preempted from by ERISA which was passed in 1976. Under ERISA, \nit stated that those plans for self-insured or those that are \nmultistate situations are under Federal order to provide uniformity in \nthe regulation. We feel it would be irresponsible to set health \ninsurance standards that duplicate their responsibility to the 50 State \ninsurance departments and have HCFA enforce them.\n  In a July 16 House Ways and Means committee hearing, HCFA's \nadministrator stated she intended to postpone, among other things, \nprospective payment systems for home health services. To Members who \nwill note this, this is a real blow to many States, Vermont in \nparticular, who are being damaged severely by the present situation \nwith respect to the home health care services and payments.\n  The balanced budget amendment of 1997 establishes a prospective \npayment system, or PPS, for home health care in fiscal year 2000. The \npayment system designed for the interim period is proving to be an \nintolerable burden for the home health agencies that service Vermont's \nMedicare beneficiaries. They have already written to urge HCFA to urge \na PPS by the October 1999 deadline set by Congress, thus minimizing the \ntime an interim payment system will be in place. Her statement that she \nhas delayed will result in many home health providers not receiving the \nreimbursement that they deserve. Given HCFA's inability to carry out \nits current responsibilities, I believe it would be irresponsible to \npromise the American people that it will be able to guarantee other \nrights by regulating the private health insurance industry.\n  I will not offer Americans a promise that experience tells us will be \nbroken, a hope that I believe won't be met. Our proposal, by keeping \nthe regulation of health insurance where it belongs--at the State \nlevel--provides the American people with a real Patients' Bill of \nRights that they can have the confidence in knowing that they will be \nthere when they need it.\n  I am afraid that the political battle over this legislation will be \nthe subject that dominates the headlines. But the real issue here is to \ngive Americans the protections they want and need in the package that \nthey can afford and that we can enact, and also that they will have a \nremedy which will allow them to expeditiously get the care they need by \nhaving outside professionals give them that opportunity. That is why I \nand others have been working on this legislation since the beginning of \nCongress and why I hope it will be adopted before the end of Congress \nand signed into law by the President.\n  This is too important of an issue for us to get bogged down in \npartisanship. I know the Democrats, and many of them on my committee, \ntoo, have worked very hard on their own bills.\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\n But let us not try to find out whose bill is better. Let us join \ntogether and make sure we can put together in the final analysis, \nthrough the legislative process, a bill which we all can be proud of \nand which the American people will be pleased with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/17/senate-section/article/S8540-10", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M., MONDAY, JULY 20, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
