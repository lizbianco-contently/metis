There are 11 first-degree amendments, 1 motion to waive \na point of order, and possible second-degree amendments and final \npassage votes that could occur today. If everybody asks for a vote, \nthat means we could have 15 votes, Senator McCain. At an average of 15 \nminutes a vote, even though we said 10, it would be at least 4 hours of \nvoting.\n  I think we can do better. I think at least half of these amendments \ncan be voice-voted, cutting the 4 hours to 2. We will try our best to \nsee if the proponents will accept voice votes. I hope we can encourage \nSenators not to demand a vote.\n  I thank Senator McCain, who I am just told will take a voice vote on \namendment No. 327. During this first vote, staff will try to determine \nwhich ones can be voice-voted.\n  I yield the floor to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Hollings, proposes an amendment numbered 326.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997)\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 10 seconds to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, on this amendment, I am heartily \nsupporting this, especially because not supporting the amendment would \nbe irrational, knowing that the blueprint is in front of us that \nspectrum does not have the value that is put into this bill. So, if we \nhave a track record that proves that it does not, it is outrageous that \nwe would accept the figures in this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is important, as the Senator from \nMontana said, that we be on record on this issue because there are \nthree pertinent facts that we cannot forget here. Over $26 billion is \nassumed to be raised from the spectrum auction in the budget. Both the \nranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, and myself \nseriously question whether raising that much money is possible.\n  Unlike fees or taxes, as we all know, spectrum auctions are a \nfunction of the free market, and its value is determined solely by \nsupply and demand. Due to the volatility of this market, as we have \nseen recently, it is virtually impossible to accurately know what \nspectrum is worth and, since it is planned to be auctioned 5 years from \nnow, what it will be worth. Even the expert agencies, CBO and FCC, have \nnot been able to accurately gauge spectrum value.\n  I understand the task of the budgeteers here on this issue, but it is \nvery, very questionable, these figures.\n  This amendment has been offered by both myself and my good friend, \nthe ranking member and former chairman of the Commerce Committee, Mr. \nHollings. Simply, this amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that \nif the estimates regarding spectrum auctions contained in this \nresolution prove not be accurate that spending will be adjusted \naccordingly.\n  The budget agreement before the Senate relies heavily on spectrum \nrevenues, particularly spectrum auctions, to reduce the deficit and \nachieve balance by the year 2002. If this resolution passes as \ncurrently drafted, the Commerce Committee will be asked to raise \nbetween $26 to $28 billion. With the exception of some ancillary fees, \nthe bulk of what the Commerce Committee will be asked to raise is \nassumed to come from spectrum.\n  Of the total $26.3 billion in estimated spectrum revenues, about 95 \npercent, or $24.3 billion, would be derived specifically from spectrum \nauctions.\n  The problem is this: experience demonstrates that it's very difficult \nto reliably estimate what a given block of spectrum is likely to bring \nat auction. And therefore, as the chairman of the Commerce Committee, I \nam very concerned that the assumptions contained in the budget \nresolution will not actually raise the money needed.\n  In a letter to me last February 26, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, a \nstaunch proponent of spectrum auctions, said this about predicting \nspectrum auction values:\n\n       Determining the value of spectrum in advance of an auction \n     is very difficult, and not something the Commission \n     ordinarily does.\n       One of the benefits of the auction is that the value of \n     spectrum is not determined by government, but by a \n     marketplace in which businesses have actual plans to develop \n     and use spectrum. The value of any block of spectrum in the \n     market thus depends on a number of factors, [including] the \n     location of the spectrum, its technical characteristics, the \n     amount of spectrum to be assigned with each license, the \n     availability of technology suitable for a given band, the \n     amount of spectrum already available for provision of similar \n     services, the number of incumbents presently occupying the \n     spectrum, and whether incumbents will remain licensed in that \n     spectrum or will be relocated to other spectrum.\n  Not surprisingly, therefore, auction estimates have been inaccurate \non both the high side, as well as the low side, ever since the FCC was \ngiven spectrum auction authority in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct of 1993.\n  For example, the very first estimates of the revenue spectrum \nauctions would generate were very low. At that time Congress predicted \nthat spectrum auctions would generate approximately $10 billion over 5 \nyears. The actual amount generated was over $22 billion in 3 years.\n  Similarly, the auction of digital broadcast satellite spectrum was \nestimated to raise less than $40 million. That auction raised $683 \nmillion.\n  Other spectrum auction estimates, however, have been very high. The \nrecent auction of wireless communications spectrum, which we estimated \nin\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\nAugust of 1996 would generate $3 billion, raised only $14 million.\n  All these estimates were based on information provided by a cross-\nsection of experts, including telecom providers, the financial \ncommunity, and the FCC and NTIA--the expert agencies in this area. I \ndon't fault their expertise, nor am I suggesting that spectrum isn't a \nvaluable commodity and shouldn't be auctioned. To the contrary, it is \nan extremely valuable natural resource, owned by the public, and \nallocation should occur by auction.\n  What I am saying, however, is that just because auctions assign \nspectrum efficiently to its most valued use does not mean that they can \nbe guaranteed to produce a certain dollar figure. They are not, and \nwere never intended to be, the functional equivalent of cash machines. \nThey function as a component of the free market and therefore are \nsubject to great highs and lows.\n  As Chairman Hundt recognizes, it is impossible, even for experts, to \nreliably predict the value that a given block of spectrum is likely to \nbring at auction. Despite this fact, however, this budget places \nsubstantial reliance on these inherently unreliable predictions of \nspectrum auction revenues to balance the budget.\n  Here are my specific concerns with the spectrum auction budget \nassumptions:\n  First, revenues from auctioning 100 MHz of spectrum formerly used by \nbroadcasters for electronic news gathering are estimated to total $9.7 \nbillion between 1998 and 2002. This estimate is based on the spectrum \nbeing roughly comparable in potential usefulness to the lucrative PCS \nspectrum. Now, however, FCC and NTIA say that this spectrum is not \ncomparable to PCS spectrum because it's already occupied and not \nsuitable for a wide range of potential uses. Thus, a critical element \nin estimating the spectrum's $9.7 billion value is not accurate.\n\n  Second, another $6 billion is estimated to come from the auction of \nspectrum left over from the reallocation ordered in 1993, plus the \nauction of new spectrum at now-available higher frequencies. The \nproblems here are that the leftover 1993 spectrum, standing alone, \nisn't expected to generate all that much, and nobody yet knows \nprecisely what the new high-frequency spectrum is usable for. Thus, \nwhat anybody might realistically be expected to bid for it is, at best, \na guess. Technology may prove us wrong. But no companies, based on \ncurrent technology--are clambering for this spectrum.\n  Third, $5.4 billion more is estimated to come from the auction of \nanalog broadcast channels in the year 2002--even though most of these \nchannels won't even be available for use until 2006. That's tantamount \nto speculating in spectrum futures.\n  Moreover, given the broadcasters' vehement objections to being \nrequired to give the channels back by 2006 or any other date, we simply \ncannot be sure when--if ever--these channels will actually be freed up. \nAs Chairman Hundt correctly noted in his February 26 letter,\n\n       When incumbent licensees are present, these licensees often \n     have incentives to oppose the use of auctions to assign \n     licenses in that band.\n\n  Thus, the value to bidders of essentially nonexistent channels has \ngot to be seriously questioned.\n  Fourth, even the projections surrounding the comparatively modest \n$700 million estimated to come from auctioning so-called 888 telephone \nnumbers are flawed. The $700 million estimate was made before these \nnumbers began being handed out for free some time ago. Based on the \nquantity of numbers left to auction now, however, the probable revenue \nwould be perhaps half the original $700 million estimate.\n  Fifth, the impact of these potentially flawed estimates is made worse \nby the large proportion of spectrum auction revenues that this budget \nscores in 2001 and 2002. Altogether 70 percent of the total spectrum \nauction revenues are called for to be generated during these 2 years. \nHowever, it is during these outyears that the most spectrum can be \nexpected to be on the market, and the more spectrum you put on the \nmarket, the less you are likely to get for it--simple supply and \ndemand.\n\n  Finally, there's also a potential problem with the $2 billion lump \nsum tied to broadcasters' use of their digital TV channels for non-HDTV \nuses. This $2 billion represents about a 7-percent hit on the $30 \nbillion television broadcast industry. I am not one to protect the \nbroadcast industry, but I am concerned about this fee. In the past, \nSenator Dole and I had advocated auctioning the digital spectrum before \nit was given to the broadcasters. That auction alone is estimated to \nhave raised between $20 to $70 billion. However, we were unsuccessful \nand that spectrum was given free of charge to the broadcasters.\n  Madam President, balancing the budget is critically important to the \nfuture of our country's economy, and spectrum auction revenues have \nbeen made critically important to balancing the budget. We must \ntherefore be extremely concerned about the considerable uncertainty \ninherent in accurately predicting the amount of money spectrum auctions \nwill generate, and we must have an insurance policy against the very \nreal likelihood that these estimates will turn out to be too high.\n  Madam President, I hope this amendment will pass. Voting for it does \nnot mean that Senators oppose the budget resolution itself. However, \nsupporting this amendment does recognize that the auction numbers \nassumed in this resolution are subject may not produce the revenue \nnoted and that therefore, the Congress may need to act on this matter \nin the future.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise in support of the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. The resolution points out the unreliability of the \nbudget resolution's assumptions about future spectrum auctions. At \nissue here is the credibility of the entire budget itself. The budget \nassumes $26.3 billion from spectrum auctions by the year 2002. Such \nassumptions are not supported by the record. The only explanation is \nthat the Budget Committee and the administration have crafted these \nassumptions out of thin air.\n  We are told by CBO that our budget problems can be solved by \nauctioning the spectrum. People around here continue to think spectrum \nis a canned good sitting on a shelf at the FCC. These budget numbers \nare absolutely irresponsible and CBO knows there is no justification \nfor these estimations. Just look at the most recent auction that was \nheld last month. Last fall, the budget negotiators fell short in their \noffsets and decided to auction a specific 30 MHz of spectrum. CBO told \nus the auction would yield $2.9 billion. The auction only yielded $13.1 \nmillion. Is this how you balance a budget?\n  I must remind the budget negotiators that the law requires the FCC to \nassign licenses to use the spectrum by auction and that the assignments \nshall not be based on revenue considerations. Every time the Congress \nmandates an auction as a budget offset we are violating our own law. \nAnd every time we mandate a specific frequency to be auctioned, we are \nmicromanaging in an area we have no expertise in. The spectrum simply \nis not a canned good sitting on a shelf. Management of the public's \nspectrum should not be determined on budget numbers.\n  Just look at the status of the market for start-up wireless \ncompanies. Wall Street is saying there is a glut in the marketplace. \nThere is no financing available for the recent ``C'' block licensees. \nHow can CBO possibly justify $26.3 billion when you look at the April \nauction in combination with the problems in the ``C'' block?\n  The FCC recently suspended the interest payments for several of the \n``C'' block licensees because they were unable to meet their \nobligations to the Treasury. How can CBO justify $26.3 billion when \n``C'' block licensees are going into bankruptcy and being bailed out by \nthe FCC. The Treasury is not receiving any moneys from these auctions. \nEven the licensees, such as Nextwave, that violated the law are not \nbeing required to make payments. This is a complete disregard for the \nlaw. This is nothing more than an effort to prop up this charade that \nauctions are good.\n\n  Look at the case of Nextwave. This company bid several billions of \ndollars for licenses nationwide. When it came time to file complete \ndocumentation of their financial backing, the FCC found that this \ncompany was in violation of the foreign ownership limits of the \nCommunications Act. To its credit, the\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\nFCC issued an order requiring Nextwave to divest itself of certain \nforeign financial commitments and come into compliance with the law. \nNow, several months later, Wall Street is still showing no confidence \nin these wireless ventures, so Nextwave has been unable to raise any \ncapital.\n  So, what does the FCC do? The FCC could not afford another \nembarrassment on the heels of the April fiasco. So the FCC simply waves \nits previous order and says, don't worry Nextwave, you are in violation \nof the law but there are more important issues involved here--we must \ncontinue the charade that the auctions are working. How can an agency \nof this Government be so cavalier in its execution of the law is beyond \nme. Clearly, it pays to be perceived as being too big a player that the \nFCC cannot let the company go under.\n  Tell that to Rocky Mountain Solutions and Carolina PCS. Where was the \nFCC's consistency in applying the law here? Rocky Mountain Solutions \nand Carolina PCS had difficulty in raising capital just as the other \nlicensees. Were they in violation of the foreign ownership limits of \nthe law. The answer is ``no.'' Were they a small company and not \nperceived as a big player? The answer is ``yes.'' Where's the \nconsistency? The FCC held to a strict interpretation of their own \nauction rules--there was no statutory violation--in denying Rocky \nMountain Solutions and Carolina PCS request for more time. When a large \ncompany violates the law, there is always a creative interpretation of \nthe law in order to keep up the charade.\n  How can we have any confidence in the results of these auctions? News \nreports also indicate that the Department of Justice is investigating \ncollusion and illegal bidding practices in some of the auctions. \nObviously, some of the potential bidders think the auctions can be \nfixed as easily as the budget assumptions.\n  The Treasury is not going to get the money CBO had projected. The \nbudget cannot be balanced in this way. Why does the Budget Committee \nand CBO continue to keep their heads stuck in the sand. How can CBO \njustify not $26.3 billion in light of these recent events? The auctions \nare not the solution the rhetoric holds them out to be. Clearly the \nBudget Committee and CBO must have budget blinders on. Their denial of \nthese recent events is further evidence that there is no integrity to \nthese numbers.\n\n  Just look at a breakdown of the budget assumptions and the problems \nwith each item.\n  Auction of the returned analog spectrum: The budget proposal requires \nan auction of 78 MHz of analog spectrum in 2002 with a mandatory return \nof the analog spectrum in 2006. CBO scores the analog auction at $5.4 \nbillion. There are many practical problems involved here. First, will \nthere really be an interest in this auction when the winning bidders \nwill not have access to the spectrum for at least 4 years? What about \npossible delays that may occur from zoning ordinances and tower \nconstruction problems? In addition, there remains the question of \nwhether there will be widespread demand for digital TV.\n  Auction of 36 MHz of spectrum from CH.60-69: This spectrum was \noriginally set aside for the transition to HDTV. No one knows if the \nFCC plan will actually work. All we have if a computer model from the \nFCC. All indications are that the FCC'S table of allocations will be \nchallenged at the FCC and possibly in the courts. The budget deal will \nenshrine the FCC'S plan before we know its implications and possibly \nforeclose revisions to the FCC'S plan. Such a result would be \nunacceptably shortsighted. It is highly unlikely this proposal will \nresult in a free and clear nationwide block of spectrum by 2002.\n  Spectrum penalty: The Budget Committee Assumes $2 billion from a \npenalty fee that would be levied against those entities who received \n``free'' spectrum for advanced, advertiser-based television services, \nbut failed to utilize it fully. This is the most incredulous proposal \nof all. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorized the FCC to assess \nfees on a broadcaster's flexible use of the spectrum--if the \nbroadcaster elects to offer additional services in addition to its free \nover-the-air programming. CBO staff has no basis to score this \nprovision. There is no evidence in the record to assume the \nbroadcasters will be capable of offering a subscription-based service \nby 2002.\n  Auction of additional 120 MHz: CBO assumes $9.7 billion but where's \nthe spectrum coming from? How can they justify it when the recent \nauction raised only $13 million when CBO had scored it at $2.9 billion?\n  Auction 800 and 888 numbers: Here's a small business tax if you ever \nsaw one. The administration's proposal is simply unrealistic. Large \ncompanies will simply outbid all the small players and warehouse \npopular numbers. Furthermore, the FCC does not have sole jurisdiction \nof toll free numbers. The United States participates with Canada in the \nNorth American numbering plan.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there are going to be high priority \nprojects in the transportation bill that passes the Congress this year.\n  As long as there has been a U.S. House of Representatives, there have \nalways been demonstration projects. The House is showing no signs of \ngiving them up this year.\n  There is no chance that the House will pass a transportation bill \nwithout earmarks for individual Members' projects.\n  Given that knowledge, do we, as the Members of the Senate, really \nwant to unilaterally disarm? If there are going to be demonstration \nprojects, are we merely going to defer to the House?\n  Rather than slipping projects into the final bill during the \nconference, wouldn't it be better to have an open discussion of the \nrelative merits of these projects in committee than on the floor?\n  At least give the House credit for having a process. The House \ncommittee of jurisdiction required that a 14-point check list be filled \nout for each demonstration project this year. Only a very few projects \nfrom that list will be selected for funding.\n  If the original ISTEA legislation is an indication, well under 10 \npercent of the final dollar amount will be earmarked for demonstration \nprojects. The original ISTEA bill provided $6.5 billion for \ndemonstration projects out of a total authorization of $155 billion.\n  I dispute the Senator's notion that all demonstration projects are \nmerely glorified pork. In my home State of Nevada, one of the fastest \ngrowing areas in the Nation, we have used earmarks to keep up with the \nexplosion in transportation needs.\n  The I-15/U.S. 95 Spaghetti Bowl Interchange in Las Vegas, one of the \nbusiest interchanges in one of the fastest growing cities in the United \nStates was built with earmarked funding far more quickly than if it \nneeded to go through a traditional funding process.\n  Nevada's capital, Carson City, remains one of a handful of State \ncapitals in the United States that is not linked to the Interstate \nSystem. An earmark in the original ISTEA funded the first leg of this \ncritical link.\n  Mr. McCain. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I have a minute to respond. I don't \nthink I will use that. But I want to ask Senator McCain, in the \ninterest of helping us with the management here, could we now set this \namendment aside and do his amendment we are going to accept?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask consent the pending McCain \namendment be temporary set aside so Senator McCain can offer his second \namendment, which will be determined by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 327\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask to call up amendment No. 327.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Mack, proposes an amendment numbered 327.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the amendment is very simple. It just \nsays we will not have highway demonstration projects. The Senate is on \nrecord. I wanted to get the Senate on record again, and I will before \nwe take up ISTEA. We have seen this very unseemly situation over in the \nother\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\nbody, where tens of billions of dollars are special projects called \nhighway demonstration projects, which are really only gauged by the \ninfluence of the Members of Congress as opposed to merit. I am very \npleased that this body is opposed to highway demonstration projects, \nand I want the Senate on record as reflecting that deal.\n  The amendment I offer today is cosponsored by Senator Mack. My \nresolution states that Congress should not divert limited highway trust \nfund resources away from State transportation priorities by authorizing \nnew highway projects and Congress should not authorize any new \ndemonstration projects or other similarly-titled projects.\n  Its a simple proposal, embodying a principle endorsed by three-\nquarters of the Senate less than 2 years ago. The principle is \nelementary, fair, and sound. The principle is--No new highway \ndemonstration projects.\n  Why is this amendment necessary? It is necessary because the largest \ndomestic public works program, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nand Efficiency Act [ISTEA], must be reauthorized this year. As my \ncolleagues know, the lion's share of Federal highway and transit \nfunding comes under the ISTEA umbrella. Through a Byzantine set of \nformula calculations, Federal gas taxes are collected by our States, \nsent into Federal coffers, and then are redistributed to the States.\n  Some of us question the necessity of requiring State-collected gas \ntaxes to be sent to Washington. I am one of those individuals. But that \nis an issue for another debate. Today, I want to focus on a clear abuse \nin the current highway funding distribution process.\n  ISTEA funds are governed by a statutory distribution formula with a \nfew limited exceptions. One major exception is funding for highway \ndemonstration projects. It is this exception my amendment seeks to \neliminate. This exception is neither necessary nor fair.\n  What has been said about highway demonstration projects? Let me \nhighlight a few comments.\n  Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, had this to say during \nhis confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation in February:\n\n       The administration has taken a firm position in opposition \n     to demonstration projects * * * [they] take resources from \n     the [highway] trust fund.\n\n  He further remarked that ending highway demonstration projects would \n``result in greater investment of resources * * * for general \ndistribution based on formula.''\n  Let me reiterate. The highway allocation process is policy driven. \nBut as the Secretary said, highway demonstration projects are not. The \nCongressional Research Service [CRS] states:\n\n       The demonstration project approach is often constituent-\n     driven and focuses on increasing Federal outlays allocated to \n     a particular State or district * * * When earmarking occurs, \n     allocation stems less from concerns over marginal social and \n     economic benefits, and more from marginal political benefit.\n\n  The Heritage Foundation is strongly against highway demonstration \nprojects. In its ``Balancing America's Budget, Ending the Era of Big \nGovernment,'' the Heritage Foundation says:\n\n       Projects earmarked by Congress are classic examples of \n     political favoritism obtained by powerful Senators and \n     Representatives for public works spending in their states and \n     districts. Federal ``demonstration projects'' are even more \n     questionable . . . purely local projects funded by the \n     federal government cannot be justified as being in the \n     national interest.\n\n  These are not new sentiments--they have been voiced for years. In \nfact 2 years ago, the President's budget submission called for the \ncancellation of some demonstration projects stating:\n\n       Such projects have been earmarked in congressional \n     authorization and appropriations laws. These projects limit \n     the ability of the States to make choices on how to best use \n     limited dollars to respond to their highest priorities.\n\n  Pork-barrel highway demonstration projects were discussed in Vice \nPresident Gore's Reinventing Government report. It states:\n\n       GAO also discovered that 10 projects--worth $31 million in \n     demonstration funds--were for local roads not even entitled \n     to receive Federal highway funding. In other words, many \n     highway demonstration projects are little more than Federal \n     pork. Looking specifically at the $1.3 billion authorized to \n     fund 152 projects under the 1987 Surface Transportation and \n     Uniform Relocation and Assistance Act, GAO found that ``most \n     of the projects . . . did not respond to States' and regions' \n     most Federal aid needs.\n\n  One might have hoped that Federal budget constraints would curb \nhighway pork barreling. But it has not.\n  In 1982, 10 demonstration projects totaling $362 million were listed \nfor special line-item funding in the Surface Transportation Assistance \nAct of 1982. The 1982 Federal Budget deficit was $127 billion, and it \njumped to $221 billion by 1986.\n  In 1987, 152 demonstration projects totaling $1.4 billion were named \nin the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of \n1987. The 1987 Federal budget deficit was $149 billion, but it jumped \nto $269 billion in 1991.\n  Then in 1991, the mother lode of all demo project bills was signed \ninto law: 538 location-specific projects totaling $6.23 billion were \nincluded in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n1991.\n  If the budget deficit has not curbed demonstration projects, maybe \nfairness will.\n  It is 1997 and time once again to authorize funding for our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. Funding for highway, bridge, and transit \nneeds remain great. Congress should give States the maximum amount of \nflexibility available to spend their highway dollars in whatever manner \nbest meets their critical transportation needs. The States do not need \nCongress to micro-manage the transportation planning process. And the \ntraveling public certainly is not well served when Washington forces \nlimited funding to be spent on unnecessary road projects.\n  Two years ago, the Senate adopted my amendment to prohibit the \nfunding for future demonstration projects. That amendment was \ncosponsored by Senators Feingold and Smith. It passed by a vote of 75 \nto 21.\n  We need to reaffirm Senate opposition to new demonstration projects. \nThere are reports that more than 400 Members in the other Chamber \nsubmitted requests to the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure for highway, bridge, or transit projects. I am informed \nthese requests include more than 1,000 projects. These requests could \ntotal hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars \nthat would be siphoned away from formula-driven allocations, and poured \ninto individually designated State or local projects.\n  Past highway demonstration projects took almost $8 billion away from \nformula-driven allocations to the States. While we can't recapture this \n$8 billion, we can end the practice. My amendment states that \n``Congress should not divert limited highway trust fund resources away \nfrom State transportation priorities by authorizing new highway \nprojects and Congress should not authorize any new demonstration \nprojects or other similarly titled projects.''\n  Mr. President, most Senators want to raise the amount of highway \nfunding for our States and to assure an equitable distribution of that \nfunding. One way to provide more money is to end the practice of \ndesignating highway demonstration projects or innovative projects, or \nany other creative description of pork-barrel projects.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nprovides the Senate shall not authorize any new highway demonstration \nprojects during the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act.\n  We have no objection to the amendment. We are willing to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, we tried to expedite things and it\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nturned out we did not. What I would like to do now is ask unanimous \nconsent that we return to the first McCain amendment on which the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and that immediately thereafter we return \nto the second McCain amendment. We will have further discussion on that \nduring the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 326\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 326, \noffered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms. Collins). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced, yeas 84, nays 15, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 86 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--84\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--15\n\n     Boxer\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Durbin\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Dorgan\n       \n  The amendment (No. 326) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 327\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I believe we are going to be able to \navoid a rollcall vote on the second McCain amendment, No. 327, if \nSenator Reid is permitted to speak for one moment indicating his \nopposition. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case, after which \ntime we will return to the amendment, and there will not be a rollcall \nvote on it.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. There will be demonstration projects in the transportation \nbill that passes Congress this year. As long as there has been a House \nof Representatives and we have had highways, there have been \ndemonstration projects. The House is showing no signs of giving them up \nthis year. There is no chance --no chance--that the House will pass a \ntransportation bill without earmarks for individual Member projects.\n  Given that knowledge, do we, as Members of the Senate, really want to \nunilaterally disarm? There are going to be demonstration projects, \nwhich there will be. Are we merely going to defer to the House? \nWouldn't it be better, rather than slipping projects into the final \nbill going to conference, that we have an open discussion of the merits \nhere on the floor?\n  At least the House--we should give them credit for having a process. \nThe House committee of jurisdiction required that a 14-point checklist \nbe filled out for each demonstration project this year. If you do not \nmeet all 14, you do not get your project.\n  Only a few projects from the list will be selected for this funding. \nIn the original ISTEA legislation, under 10 percent of the projects had \nearmarks. So $6.5 billion for demonstration projects out of the total \nauthorization of about $160 billion.\n  I dispute the notion of the Senator from Arizona that all \ndemonstration projects are glorified pork. That is not true in rapidly \ngrowing areas. It is very important to the State of Nevada. We should \noppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that we should not have any special projects. I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n327.\n  The amendment (No. 327) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If Senators will just bear with me. There is a lot of \nagreement now on amendments. So I am going to get rid of some of them \nbefore we take the next vote, thus eliminating a lot of votes we might \nhave had to have.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 347, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I send to the desk Senator Coverdell's \namendment No. 347, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 347), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN \n                   PREVENTION OF DRUG USE BY CHILDREN.\n\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the provisions of this resolution assume that, from resources \n     available in this budget resolution, a portion should be set \n     aside for a national grassroots volunteer effort to encourage \n     parental education and involvement in youth drug prevention \n     and to create a drug-intolerant culture for our children.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It has been cleared on the other side. We accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 347), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 333\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have also worked out Senator Moseley-Braun's \namendment No. 333.\n  This amendment is a sense of the Senate that entitlement savings in \nthe budget resolution should be used to protect the long-term future of \nSocial Security and Medicare and maintain Federal discipline.\n  This is also a sense of the Senate. We urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n333.\n  The amendment (No. 333) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 334\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I call up Moseley-Braun amendment No. 334.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Ms. \n     Moseley-Braun, proposes an amendment numbered 334.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this amendment is also a sense of the \nSenate that no change in Social Security should be made to reduce the \nvalue of the Social Security system for future generations. It is a \nsense of the Senate. I urge its adoption.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, I rise to make brief statements \nconcerning two of my amendments to the congressional budget resolution \nthat the Members on both sides of the aisle have agreed to support.\n  These two amendments are of vital importance. They concern the value \nof\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\nthe Social Security program and the use of budget savings in the \nmandatory spending areas. These are vitally important amendments \nbecause they relate to that important issue of retirement security that \nshould be a part of any discussions about the Federal budget.\n  The first amendment, which is amendment No. 333, expresses a sense of \nthe Senate that the budget savings in the mandatory spending areas \ncontained in this budget resolution should be used:\n\n       to protect and enhance the retirement security of the \n     American people by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     social security system;\n       to protect and enhance the health care security of senior \n     citizens by ensuring the long-term future of the Medicare \n     program and,\n       to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline to ensure \n     that the level of private investment necessary for long-term \n     economic growth and prosperity is available.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment is important because:\n\n       twenty-two percent of every dollar spent by the federal \n     government goes to the social security program,\n       another eleven percent of every dollar spent by the federal \n     government goes to the Medicare program,\n       currently, spending on the elderly accounts for a third of \n     the federal budget, and\n       while the federal budget deficit has dropped for the fourth \n     straight year to $67 billion in 1997, measures need to be \n     taken to ensure that this trend continues.\n\n  I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted this amendment and once \nagain, reaffirmed our commitment to protecting Americans' retirement \nsecurity and also reducing the deficit.\n  My second amendment, which is amendment No. 334, is one about which I \nknow many Members of this body are also concerned. It has to do with \nthe value of the Social Security program. I have begun to hold forums \nin my State as a means of starting the dialog with my constituents \nabout the future of Social Security. I know that other Members have \nheld similar forums in their States as well.\n  The amendment simply expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nbudget resolution does not assume any legislative changes that would \nreduce the value of the Social Security program for future generations \nof retired citizens. This is an important amendment because we have an \nobligation to ensure that this program which has allowed a generation \nof Americans to retire with dignity must be preserved.\n  Madam President, a few facts will highlight the importance of the \nSocial Security program to Americans.\n  First, 13 percent of the population is over age 65 and that \npercentage will increase to over 20 percent of the population by 2030;\n  Social Security provides over 80 percent of retirement income for 60 \npercent of seniors;\n  More than half of all senior citizens do not receive any private \npension income;\n  Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest levels since we \nbegan collecting the data due in a large part to Social Security; and\n  Finally, the average Americans retiring in 2015 will have paid \n$250,000 in payroll taxes during their working career.\n  There is no question that current retirees rely heavily upon Social \nSecurity and future retirees expect the value of the program not to be \ndiminished when they need it. Therefore, I am again happy that my \ncolleagues support this amendment. I think we can all agree that we \nmust protect the value of the Social Security program for future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 334) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I believe Senator Gramm of Texas is \ngoing to make a point of order.\n\n\n                     Motion To Waive The Budget Act\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, under section 601(b) of the Congressional \nBudget Act, I raise a point of order against the pending budget \nresolution, as it violates the discretionary spending caps for fiscal \nyear 1998 as previously set in the 1993 budget resolution and \nreconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator has 2 \nminutes to speak on his point of order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I think this is a defining moment for the \nCongress. I think it is a defining moment for those who believe in less \nGovernment and more freedom. I think it is a defining moment for people \nwho are concerned about spending.\n  In 1993, on the floor of the Senate, on a straight party-line vote, \nwith a Democrat majority in both Houses of Congress, and a Democrat \nPresident, we set out spending totals, including a cap on spending for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  Today, in this budget, we are going to bust that spending total by \n$8.795 billion. As far as I am aware, this will be the first time ever \nthat a Democrat Congress has set a spending cap that a Republican \nCongress has come along and waived and violated, in this case by almost \n$9 billion.\n  I think that nothing could say more clearly what the problem is with \nthis budget than the fact that we, as the first act in this budget, \nwill be busting a spending cap and setting it aside, violating the \nrules of the budget in order to bring to the floor a new budget that \nspends more than the budget it seeks to replace.\n  I think it tells you something about our commitment to enforcing \nthese numbers that our first act in adopting this budget is going to be \nto break the very caps that we claim will enforce the new budget.\n  So I simply want to ask my colleagues to remember, in 1993, when we \nhad another budget on the floor, when it was adopted, we set out a \nprocedure to enforce that budget by setting a cap on spending. Today, \nwe are going to vote, on this vote, whether we are going to waive that \nspending cap or whether we are going to live up to it.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the motion to waive this \nbudget point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it in order \nfor me now to move to waive the point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may make the motion to waive.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 601(b) of the \nBudget Act, and pursuant to section 24(b) of House Concurrent \nResolution 218, fiscal year 1995 budget resolution, I move to waive \nsection 24(a) of House Concurrent Resolution 218 for the consideration \nof this concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1998 as reported, \nany amendment to the House companion, and any conference report \nthereon.\n  Madam President, do I have 2 minutes to argue my case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr DOMENICI. When the 2 minutes is up, we vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that the yeas \nand nays have not yet been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The first thing you have to understand is that if this \npoint of order is not waived the budget resolution that we propose for \nthe next 5 years falls. It is gone. For those who would like it to \ndisappear and we would have no budget resolution, we can start over, \nthen vote for Senator Gramm.\n  Actually, the problem we are confronted with is not one of \noverspending. It is one of technical estimating, nothing more. Two-\nthirds of this overage is because we underestimated the outlays--CBO \ndid--the outlays of the expenditures on the Defense Department. \nActually, there is no question that we have been operating under a very \ntight lid, and I do not believe we should be held responsible for a \ntechnical error made in the estimating of the costs of the Defense \nDepartment.\n  I believe we should waive this. As one who has been working on \nbudgets, I put it this way. I do not waive the budget\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\neasily but the better thing to do is to get this 5-year budget rather \nthan to kill it over a point of order that, to me, makes little or no \nsense in the context of the next 5 years.\n  Whatever time I have remaining I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.

I would like to proceed to Senator Abraham's amendment \nnext, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President. I will be very brief. This \namendment is great straightforward. It is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that says that if during the next 5 years the money sent to \nWashington by our taxpayers back home exceed the projections which we \nhave made in this budget resolution--and I believe they might--that \nthose excess additional revenues may only be spent for tax cuts or to \nreduce the deficit and cannot be used for more Federal spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we are opposed to this amendment. It \nsays that if the current balance results in better than expected \neconomic growth that we ought to go back to the lopsided approach \nadvocated by the majority. I, frankly, think it is illogical. Tax cuts \nand deficit reductions are not the only policies that can benefit the \nNation. And unexpected tax revenue may well be put to good use funding \nessential Government programs. I don't think that we ought to get \nlocked in at this juncture to insist that any excess revenues would go \nto tax cuts or deficit reduction. I think we ought to make our judgment \nat the time that these things occur.\n\n\n            Economic Growth Dividend Protection Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, let me begin by praising Senator \nDomenici and the other negotiators for their hard work and diligence. \nThey have worked for almost 4 months to put this resolution together \nand end the 18-month stalemate between the President and Congress over \nspending and taxes. Given these circumstances, I believe this agreement \nis a step in the right direction and I look forward to seeing many of \nits provisions enacted into law. On the other hand, while I intend \nsupport this budget resolution as a whole, I want to express \nreservations regarding some of its specifics.\n  First, I consider this resolution to be just a down-payment--not a \nsolution--to the entitlement reforms that will be necessary to ensure \nthe Federal Government's solvency going into the next century. As we \nall know, the baby boom generation will soon begin to retire, which \nwill place enormous pressure on our Federal entitlement programs. \nAccording to the CBO, ``. . . outlays for government programs that aid \nthe elderly (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) will burgeon as \nthe number of people eligible to receive benefits from these programs \nshoots up.''\n  Medicare is the first program to experience this problem and this \nresolution allows for important reforms to extend its solvency. That \nsaid, I believe these reforms neither go far enough nor call for the \nkinds of fundamental changes that will help Medicare stay solvent past \nthe 10 years targeted by this resolution. I encourage the Finance \nCommittee to embrace reforms like MSA's, Medicare Choice, HMO's, and \nPPO's as options that will increase patient options even as they hold \ndown costs.\n  I am also concerned that Congress' historical bias toward ever-\nincreasing spending is once again on display. While Senator Domenici \nand others have worked hard to reject the myriad of new spending \nproposals requested by the administration, the bottom line is 5-year \nspending under this resolution will increase by 17 percent between \ntoday and 2002. That increase is faster than the rate of inflation, and \nwell above the growth rates encompassed in the past two budget \nresolutions.\n  By creating new Federal entitlements, this resolution opens the door \nfor huge, unexpected spending increases down the road. I applaud \nefforts to improve the health of this Nation's children, but I believe \nthe provision to make such funding mandatory is conterproductive to our \nefforts to restrain the growth of government spending. For that reason, \nI support efforts to make this funding discretionary.\n  Finally, I am concerned that the tax cuts called for in this \nresolution are so modest, especially in comparison to the spending \nincreases included. In particular, I am concerned that, where, \naccording to a USA Today poll from this March, 70 percent of the \nAmerican people believe that they need a tax cut, under this \nresolution, Federal spending will grow 17 percent over 5 years while \nthe net tax cuts are less than 1 percent of the total tax burden. \nBalancing the budget is one of my top priorities, but reducing the \nburden of government on Americans is my ultimate goal.\n  Why do Americans need a tax cut? According to the President's own \neconomists, the tax burden on Americans is the highest ever--31.7 \npercent. According to the National Taxpayer Union, the average American \nfamily now pays almost 40 percent of their income in State, local, and \nFederal taxes. For all the talk about the ``end of big government,'' \nthe tax burden today is the highest ever. And while we address that \nburden in a small, incremental way with this budget resolution, we are \nalso creating the possibility for ever-more spending later on.\n  I believe we need to tilt the playing field away from more spending \nand toward more tax reduction. Toward that end, I have offered \namendment number 316 along with Senators Brownback, Coverdell, Kyl, \nAshcroft, Sessions, Allard, Hutchinson, and Faircloth in order to focus \nthe attention of the Senate on the plight of American taxpayers. I am \nalso introducing legislation today which would codify this rule change \ninto law.\n  Madam President, as we all know, on May 2d the Congressional Budget \nOffice provided budget negotiators with a gift of sorts. In a letter to \nSenator Domenici, the CBO report that for this year, the deficit would \nbe $45 billion less than previously reported. Instead of $112 billion, \nthe deficit this year would be closer to $67 billion.\n  Moreover, the CBO suggested that this $45 billion windfall would \nextend over the next 5 years, so that the total devicit over that time \nwould be reduced by $225 billion.\n  From my perspective, Madam President, this windfall can be viewed as \na mixed-blessing. On the one hand, the continued strong performance of \nthe\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\neconomy means more jobs and opportunity for Americans--as well as \nadditional revenues to the Government.\n  On the other, coming as it did at literally the last possible moment \nin the budget negotiations, the windfall resulted in opening up \nopportunties for the administration to demand even higher levels of \nspending in 1998 and beyond. It is my understanding that all sorts of \nspending issues that had previously been closed were reopened following \nthe CBO's surprise announcement.\n  One area that remained closed, however, was the issue of tax cuts. \nWhile the last 2 weeks have been filled with one announcement after \nanother about increases in this program, and new funding for that \nprogram, the net tax cut number has remained stubbornly fixed at $85 \nbillion.\n  I am going to support this resolution because I believe its net \neffect will be to reduce both the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment. I am also going to support this resolution because, \naccording to all accounts, the tax cuts incorporated in the plan will \ninclude significant incentives for economic growth and job creation--\nincentives like reducing the rate on which we tax capital gains and \nincreasing the allowable contributions to IRA's.\n  These incentives will, I believe, result in higher economic growth \nover the next 5 years and increase--not decrease--revenues to the \nFederal Treasury.\n  Which brings me to my amendment.\n  What I am proposing is that, to the extent that tax revenues under \nthis budget agreement--tax cuts and all--exceed the projections by the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, that extra revenue should be reserved for \ntax cuts and/or deficit reduction--not additional Government spending.\n  This is not an idle proposition--history shows that pro-growth tax \ncuts like cutting the capital gains tax rate result in large bonuses \nfor the Treasury. Between 1978 and 1985, while the top marginal rate on \ncapital gains was cut almost in half--from 35 to 20 percent--total \nannual Federal receipts from the tax almost tripled. They rose from \n$9.1 billion annually to $26.5 billion annually.\n  Conversely, when Congress raised the rate in 1986, revenues actually \nfell well below what was anticipated. Capital gains revenues actually \nfell following the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Economists across the board \npredict that cutting the capital gains rate will result in a revenue \nwindfall for the Treasury. These windfalls should be given back to the \ntaxpayers.\n  In pursuit of that goal, I am offering today, a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment which in support of future tax cuts. It says, ``To the extent \nthat actual revenues exceed the revenues projected under this \nresolution, that revenue windfall should be reserved exclusively for \nadditional tax cuts and deficit reduction.''\n  Madam President, 2 years ago, a Readers Digest poll asked Americans: \n``What is the highest percentage of income that is fair for a family of \nfour making $200,000 to pay in all taxes?'' The median response, \nregardless of whether the respondent was rich or poor, black or white, \nwas 25 percent.\n  A similar Grassroots Research poll last March discovered that a \nmajority of Americans would favor a constitutional amendment that would \nprohibit Federal, State, and local taxes from taking ``a combined total \nof more than 25 percent of anyone's income in taxes.''\n  Yet, the Tax Foundation tells us that a dual-income family today pays \nan average 38.4 percent of their income in taxes to State, local, and \nFederal Governments.\n  This budget starts us down the long road toward reducing the tax \nburden on American families--but it is just the beginning. I intend to \ncontinue that fight. I hope my colleagues will support my amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I just seek unanimous consent to add \nSenators Faircloth, Allard, and Hutchison of Texas as additional \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't believe I have any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Michigan yield back the \nremainder of his time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Michigan. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 88 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 316) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, I believe we are ready to go to \nSenator Wellstone's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Madam President. May I have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, the budget----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senate is not in order. We have to hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Senators desiring \nto converse will retire to their cloakrooms. Senators will take their \nseats. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President and Senators, the budget is all about \npriorities. This amendment speaks to priorities. This amendment says \nthat we invest in crumbling schools all across our country $5 billion, \nthat we should do that now. This amendment says that, while we have \nmade progress with Head Start in this budget agreement, still only half \nthe children, if you consider early Head Start, are covered and we \nshould cover more of these children. This amendment says that last year \nwe made cuts in the school breakfast program, we made cuts in the child \nnutrition programs for Family Head Start Centers, and therefore we \nought to restore that nutritional funding for poor children in America.\n  Madam President, altogether this amendment says we make investments \nin these areas to the tune of about $20 billion over the next half \ndecade, and the offset is to make sure that the cuts in taxes are \ntargeted to middle income and small business, not the top 2 percent of \nthe economic profile in the country, and that we look at all of these \nloopholes and deductions in corporate welfare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  It is the Chair's understanding that the Senator is calling up \namendment No. 313?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this amendment would reduce tax relief \ncontained in the resolution by $16 billion in order to increase \nspending in programs that the Senator would like to see increased. It \nhappens, in the programs that he would like to see increased, such as \nHead Start, this budget resolution has an increase of $2.7 billion. It \nmakes it a priority program, so it will most probably be funded at that \nextraordinarily high level. That was agreed upon. But sometimes, no \nmatter how much you do, it is not enough. In this case, the President \nbrags about the fact that Head Start is going up and going up \nappreciably, $2.7 billion, yet the Senator would reduce our tax cut for \nthe American people in order to add yet more to that program.\n  I do not believe that is what we ought to do. I yield back any time I \nhave. Does the Senator from any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \nhas expired.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 357 to Amendment No. 313\n\n (Purpose: To provide children who have been victims of violent crime \nthe ability to transfer to another school by allowing States and local \neducational agencies to use Federal education funds in the jurisdiction \n of the Labor Committee to assist such victims in attending any other \n     school of their choice, whether public, private, or sectarian)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

In too many schools across our Nation the \nfocus for our children is not on education but survival. Just 2 days \nago, as I read from the Washington papers, four teenagers were arrested \nand charged with gang raping a 14-year-old girl last month by luring \nher from a cafeteria at a public high school in Queens to an unused \nclassroom to carry out the attack, the authorities said yesterday. This \namendment would allow local school districts, agencies, the right to \nuse a voucher system to allow a victim of a crime to escape this kind \nof environment.\n  Madam President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my colleagues on the other side do \nnot want to have an up-or-down vote on whether or not they are willing \nto invest in child nutrition programs and whether or not they are \nwilling to invest in rotting schools. Instead of this increased \ninvestment, they want to now vote on the proposition that we have funds \nthat go in an unlimited, unconditional way through a private voucher \nplan. That is what this vote is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we are talking now about a whole \ndifferent program outside the budget resolution. Vouchers --vouchers do \nnot deserve to be debated in this context. We ought to absolutely \noppose it. I hope we will find some of our friends on the Republican \nside who will also oppose the notion of transferring these funds into \nschool vouchers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 346.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be brief, but I will try \nto talk loudly.\n  This is a simple and straightforward amendment, and it will address \njust two of the weaknesses of the budget agreement; namely, big \nspending for the Government and small tax relief for working Americans.\n  All it does is to require that we use half of the $225 billion of the \nCBO revenue windfall for tax relief and half for deficit reduction and \nkeep nondefense discretionary spending at the cap freeze baseline \nlevel.\n  If the $225 billion in extra money is, indeed, real, it did not fall \nmysteriously from the sky. It is money that belongs, first and \nforemost, to the American taxpayers, and it should be put to proper \nuse. Keeping nondefense spending at freeze baseline levels would reduce \ntotal spending by only 1.5 percent over the next 5 years. If American \nworkers are working harder and producing more, they should be able to \nkeep it, not send it to Washington.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank you \nvery much, Mr. President.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, it is with \nregret that I have to oppose this amendment. Essentially, this would \ntotally break the budget agreement. We would be back at ground zero. \nThis would propose to take another $134 billion in cuts out of the \ndomestic programs beyond that which we did in this budget, another $134 \nbillion cut off the discretionary programs that are only growing at \nhalf a percent.\n  I also must tell you the so-called windfall was used in the following \nmanner: Only $30 billion of it was used for spending over the 5 years, \nand that went for defense, transportation, and dropping the per capita \ncap on Medicare.\n  I believe that we had to do that. I believe it was in everybody's \ninterest that we do that. That is where it went, and that is what we \ndid. So if time has expired, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So we ought to be finished in reasonably short \norder, although I want to remind everyone that in the morning \nannouncement the leader said we might have votes in the remainder of \nthe day on judges and a treaty. So before you assume there will be no \nadditional votes, you better check with the hot line or with the \nleadership office.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The next amendment is Wellstone amendment No. 314.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 314\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I call up amendment No. 314.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Moynihan, proposes amendment \n     numbered 314.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I proposed the amendment with Senator Reed, and also \nas cosponsors are Senator Bingaman and Senator Moynihan.\n  This amendment, I say to my colleagues, expands the Pell grant \nprogram. It takes it up to $3,500. It is authorized up to $4,500 right \nnow. It is a commitment of about $6 billion over 5 years. This will \nhelp thousands of families.\n  This will make a huge difference, especially to families with incomes \nof about $25,000 to $30,000 who, more or less, fall between the cracks \non some of the other assistance that we are giving. So it is very \ntargeted. It is very effective. The money comes from loopholes and \ndeductions.\n  We could be talking about tens of billions, if not hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, in that. Just invest a little more in the Pell \ngrant program. This is extremely important to working families in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask the Senator, do you yield back your time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Reed was going to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 seconds remaining under his \ntime.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thought we had 2 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator that there was 1 \nminute for each side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it was my mistake, I say to my \ncolleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed have 30 seconds to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. I will make two very brief points.\n  First, in 1972, we passed the Pell grant. If we simply indexed that \ngrant for inflation, the maximum Pell grant today would be $4,300. We \nare asking for an increase from $3,000 in this budget to $3,500. \nSecond, back in 1980, the maximum Pell grant covered 72 percent of the \ncost of a 4-year public college. Now it covers roughly 20 percent. We \nneed more. That is what the Wellstone-Reed amendment asks us to do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Moseley-Braun be \nadded as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment should be defeated. The \nbudget resolution before the Senate increases Pell grants from $2,700 \nto $3,000. Even the President of the United States says that is \nadequate. This will be a very healthy increase. We have already done \nthat. I do not believe we ought to add further moneys to the Pell \ngrants and take it away from the taxpayers of this country. It is that \nsimple. There is adequate funding already in this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 358 to Amendment No. 314\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the provisions of this resolution assume that \nany higher education tax relief are consistent with the objectives set \n forth in this resolution and shall include provisions that encourage \n  parents and students to save for higher education expenses and that \n provide relief from the debt burden associated with borrowing to pay \n                     for a postsecondary education)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of Senator Snowe and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Ms. Snowe, \n     for herself and Mr. Coverdell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     358.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I thank Senator Domenici.\n  I understand the intent of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMinnesota in terms of expanding the Pell Grant Program, and I am \npleased the budget agreement includes increasing the maximum grant by \n$300.\n  Unfortunately, the Senator's amendment is in violation of the budget \nagreement, so I am offering an amendment that says we shall include two \ntypes of tax cut proposals in the $35 billion postsecondary educational \ntax cut package in this budget agreement. One proposal would provide \nincentives for parents and students to save for a postsecondary \neducation. The other proposal would be to try to offset the debt that \nis incurred by students as a result of borrowing to attend college.\n  My amendment is consistent with the objectives that were put forward \nin the budget agreement, as agreed to by President Clinton and the \nnegotiators, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, the budget resolution provides for $85 \nbillion in net tax relief over the coming 5 years. In a May 15, 1997, \nletter to President Clinton, the Speaker of the House and the Senate \nmajority leader agreed that the tax package ``must include tax relief \nof roughly $35 billion over 5 years for postsecondary education, \nincluding a deduction and a tax credit.'' The letter further stipulated \nthat this package of postsecondary education tax cuts ``should be \nconsistent with the objectives put forward in the HOPE scholarship and \ntuition tax proposals contained in the administration's fiscal year \n1998 budget.''\n  Now, even before that letter was crafted, there had been concerns \nabout the inclusion of any type of education tax cuts in the balanced \nbudget plan. For some, the inclusion of such targeted tax cuts would \nundermine the overall effort to provide broad-based tax relief for as \nmany Americans as possible. For others, the postsecondary tax cut \nproposals put forward by President Clinton were viewed as potentially \ncounter-productive because they might actually encourage tuition \nincreases or grade inflation.\n  Regardless of how one feels about educational tax cuts in general--or \nPresident Clinton's postsecondary education tax cut proposals \nspecifically--I think we can all agree that the objective of the $35 \nbillion education tax cut package in this resolution, and President \nClinton's fiscal year 1998 educational tax cut proposals, are clear: \nPostsecondary educational tax cuts must promote access to a higher \neducation while addressing the needs of parents and students.\n  And the amendment I am offering today would encourage that we do \nboth. It is an amendment stating that our $35 billion postsecondary tax \ncut package shall provide tax incentives that encourage students and \nparents to save for a postsecondary education, and provide relief from \nthe debt burden associated with borrowing to pay for a postsecondary \neducation. These two proposals--and my amendment--are not only \nconsistent with the objectives laid out by President Clinton in his own \nbudget proposal, but also with the objectives outlined in the May 15 \nletter from the Speaker of the House and our majority leader.\n  Mr. President, a strong commitment to education is included in this \nbudget agreement because of a recognition that education is the great \nequalizer in our society that can give every citizen of our Nation--\nregardless of race, income, or geographic background--the same \nopportunity to succeed in the global economy of the 21st century. It's \nthe same reason I decided to make education a priority during the 1995 \nand 1996 balanced budget debate, and fought to preserve funding for the \nStudent Loan Program--a program that ensures access to higher education \nfor lower-income students. A bipartisan majority of the Senate shared \nthat commitment, and we now have the opportunity to further strengthen \naccess to higher education through the crafting of sound tax proposals \nwithin this balanced budget package.\n  As we seek to identify proposals that would improve access to a \nhigher education, it is critical that we first recognize the primary \nbarrier that stands between a student and a post-secondary education: \nrising costs. According to the Institute of Higher Education Policy, \nstudents at the undergraduate level have seen tuition increases outpace \ninflation for more than a decade. As a result of these increasing \ncosts, an estimated 7.6 million students will require and receive aid \nin 1997--and this number is expected to increase to 8.1\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\nmillion in 1998. Similarly, due to the significant costs of graduate \nand professional school training, borrowing by these students is \nincreasing even faster than the record rate of increase in total \nstudent loan borrowing overall.\n\n  How much money is borrowed by students to meet these rising costs? \nAccording to a 1996 analysis by USA Group Loan Services, the typical \nstudent loan borrower--including undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral \nstudents--now accumulates more than $10,000 in educational debt. By the \nsame token, the interest paid on this borrowing is enormous. In Maine \nalone, students pay $25 million in interest on their student loan debts \nevery year. Clearly, these rising costs and accumulating debts place \nthe future of our children and our Nation at stake. Many students may \nwonder if they will ever be able to pay off the debt burden they will \nabsorb if they go to college--and others will simply drop the idea of \npursuing a higher education altogether in light of these numbers.\n  Mr. President, Congress must remain committed to ensuring that every \nindividual has the opportunity to pursue a higher education while \nadopting policies that ensure students are not dissuaded from attending \na post-secondary institution for financial reasons. While no tax cut \ncan completely remove financial barriers to a higher education, we can \ncertainly endorse sound policies as part of this resolution that adhere \nto the agreement reached with the White House and move us in the right \ndirection. I believe that providing incentives for parents and students \nto save for a higher education, and providing tax relief for the debt \naccumulated by those who need to borrow, is among the policies we \nshould adopt to move us in that direction.\n  While the amendment I am offering today does not endorse any specific \nbill or plan, I would like to note that I offered legislation on May 1 \nthat would accomplish both of these goals. S. 680, the ``Go to \nCollege!'' Tax Incentives Act, would promote savings by young Americans \nand their parents to prepare for the rising cost of a higher education, \nand ensure that students are not discouraged from applying for students \nloans simply because of the debt burden they would incur in seeking a \nhigher education.\n  First, the legislation provides an incentive for parents and children \nto put aside as much as $1,000 per child annually in an education \nsavings account that would be allowed to grow tax free. Planning for \nthe future is critical when one considers the rising cost of tuition, \nand my incentive to save would make such planning less difficult. \nSecond, the legislation provides a tax credit of $1,500 for the \ninterest paid on student loans, thereby encouraging students to borrow \nas necessary to go to college--not balk at the cost of a higher \neducation and the related debt they need to incur.\n  Many Members of this body have supported restoring the deduction for \ninterest paid on student loans--as evidenced in both of the Republican \nand Democratic leader bills, S. 1 and S. 12 respectively. While I, too, \nhave long supported the restoration of this deduction, the credit I am \nproposing in S. 680 would be even more beneficial. Simply put, a tax \ndeduction lowers a student's gross income on the Federal income tax \nform--but a tax credit actually reduces the tax liability of a student. \nAlthough this provision would not benefit students immediately, they \nwould be assured of substantial tax relief once they begin to pay off \nthe student loan debt they accumulated when they chose ``go to \ncollege'' in the first place.\n  Again, the amendment I am offering today does not call for the \nadoption of the ``Go to College!'' Tax Incentives Act--rather, I \nmention my bill only to show that there are proposals on the table that \nwould achieve the objectives sought by President Clinton, and that can \nbe further reviewed during budget reconciliation. Ultimately, any \nnumber of these proposals could effectively meet the objectives set \nforth by President Clinton and the majority leader, and I am hopeful \nthat we will adopt the best such approaches during the reconciliation \nprocess. Therefore, although the amendment I am offering today does not \nendorse a specific bill, it ensures that we at least adopt two types of \nproposals that will move us in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, we must ensure that our nation's students do not turn \naway from pursuing a higher education due to rising costs and \nincreasing debt burdens. This amendment would ensure that we address \nthese issues during the ongoing reconciliation process, while remaining \nconsistent with the objectives laid out in this balanced budget \nagreement, and I urge its adoption. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we will agree to a voice vote on this \namendment.\n  With all due respect to my colleague, whom I greatly respect, No. 1, \nthis second-degree amendment strikes out all the investment, so as \nopposed to plugging some of the loopholes in corporate welfare we make \nno investment in the expansion of Pell grants. That is what this vote \nis about.\n  No. 2, you can talk about savings. Families with incomes under \n$20,000 a year--since 1979, 8 percent of them, women and men from those \nfamilies, have been able to graduate from college. Do you not think we \nought to make sure they get assistance?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, no one objects to Pell grants. This should \nbe a vote about expanding the Pell grants so we can change the reality \nthat faces working families in this country.\n  In 1975, 80 percent of Federal financial assistance was in the form \nof grants and 20 percent in loans. Today, those numbers are reversed. I \nbelieve we should expand the Pell grants along the lines of the \nWellstone-Reed amendment.\n  I hope we can do that sometime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question now is on \nagreeing to the second-degree amendment of the Senator from Maine.\n  The amendment (No. 358) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 314\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The question now occurs on the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 314), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Specter has an amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 340\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call for a vote on amendment No. 340.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 340.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is a very important amendment \nbecause it will determine whether we will have an increase in NIH \ngrants and, in fact, whether we will have NIH grants at their current \nlevel.\n  Night before last, by a vote of 98 to 0, this body passed a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution which increased NIH grants by $2 billion. But the \nfact is that the 550 account on health is cut by $100 million. This \namendment asks the Senate to put its money where its mouth is. If the \nsense of the Senate which passed two nights ago is to have any sense, \nthis amendment has to be agreed to.\n  I understand that the leadership is opposed to this amendment. I \nunderstand that there is an argument that nothing we do here on this \nbudget resolution amounts to anything; that it is all up to the \nappropriators. In a sense, that is correct. But I believe the \nappropriators will be influenced by a positive vote here, especially \nwhen the leadership is going to try to defeat this amendment.\n  If this amendment is defeated, I can explain to the constituency \ngroups who come to me as chairman of the subcommittee that there was no \nmoney. But if this sense-of-the-Senate resolution for $2 billion is to \nbe understood, this amendment has to pass.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield time in opposition to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask Senators to do something \nirregular--that is, pick up the bill and look at what this amendment \ndoes to the Appropriations Committee. On page 23, you will see on line \n9 an increase of $137.8 billion for health. If you look at page 35 \nwhere this amendment touches, it has ``new budget authority for \nallowances''--no new budget, no outlays.\n  What it means is we would have to go into every other account and \npull out money to put it in this one account, an account that is \nalready increased under this budget by $137.8 billion.\n  The Senator came to me and asked me if I would be bound by this. I \nchecked with Senator Byrd. We cannot be bound by this. Some of those \naccounts--by the way, this is an absolute across-the-board cut--cannot \ntake that.\n  For those of you in agriculture, agriculture has already been cut. \nSpace and technology has already been cut. We have to go in and cut \nthose further in order to put this money into an account that has \nalready a $137.8 billion increase under this budget.\n  I urge you to vote against it, because we do not want to have to go \nagainst the sense of the Senate. But we would have to under this \nbecause we cannot comply with this.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Alaska to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.

Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nSenate, everybody is asking where we are on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order? The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to Senators I have about five \ncleanup matters and one amendment we are going to accept, and then we \ngo right to final passage. That should not be longer than 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 359\n\n                (Purpose: To make technical corrections)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a managers' technical corrections \namendment to the desk. It has been approved by both sides. It is \nnothing but numbers, number changes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment 309. This amendment \ncreates a reserve fund with no money in it for childhood education. I \nurge we adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Kerry, \n     for himself, proposes an amendment numbered 309.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997)\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 309) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 319 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand, Senator Gramm, you withdraw amendment \n319?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 319) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith Senator Domenici regarding the investment in transportation that \nis included in this budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, I am a strong believer \nin increasing investment in transportation, whether for roads, bridges, \nrail systems, aviation, or mass transit. All modes of transportation \nare important, and all need to be supported.\n  We have been working hard in the negotiations to increase total \ninvestment in transportation, and we have had some success. We have \nincreased total transportation outlays over the President's request by \nmore than $8 billion over the next 5 years. That is not as much as I \nwould like, but it is a start.\n  I would like to clarify one element of the budget agreement as it \nrelates to\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\nspending the estimated revenues of the highway trust fund over the next \n5 years. That is a goal with which I agree. In an ideal world, I would \nsupport even higher spending levels from the highway trust fund.\n  However, it is important to clarify that, while this agreement \nincludes an assumption that we will spend from the highway trust fund \nthe amounts equivalent to receipts currently estimated to come into the \ntrust fund, the possibility that receipts will grow beyond the levels \ncurrently estimated could endanger our ability to comply with other \nequally important assumptions in this agreement including increased \nspending for mass transit and Amtrak.\n  In the end, the Appropriations Committee will have to set ceilings \nfor individual subcommittees and funding levels for specific \ntransportation programs, and I want to clarify that increases in \nhighway trust fund spending will not negatively impact other modes of \ntransportation, especially mass transit and Amtrak.\n  I therefore would ask my good friend, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, do you agree that nothing in this agreement, nor in the \nbudget resolution, requires the Senate to spend all gas tax revenues \nwithout regard for the potentially negative impact on other modes of \ntransportation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Lautenberg is correct.\n  The budget resolution contains an assumption that the Appropriations \nCommittee will provide adequate funding to spend all gas tax revenues \ninto the highway trust fund. In addition, the budget resolution also \ncontains an assumption which provides increased funding for mass \ntransit and Amtrak, in addition to the increase in highway trust fund \nspending. Therefore, I am optimistic that this agreement provides \nenough funding to accomplish our mutual goals of spending all trust \nfund revenues while maintaining our commitments to other modes of \ntransportation, including increased funding for mass transit and \nAmtrak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a \nshort colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. \nMr. Domenici, I understand that the budget resolution assumes \nreinstatement of the aviation excise taxes, which fund important \naviation safety and security programs, and include the 10 percent tax \non the price of domestic airline tickets.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As you know, the National Civil Aviation Review \nCommission has undertaken a review of the appropriate funding structure \nfor the national aviation system, and is scheduled to report its \nlegislative recommendations at the end of this summer. The commission \nmay develop an acceptable alternative to the traditional aviation \nexcise tax system. Am I correct in assuming that the budget resolution \ndoes not preclude substituting an alternative funding mechanism for the \ncurrent aviation excise taxes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is my understanding, as well. The budget \nresolution assumes reinstatement of the aviation excise taxes. This \nassumption should not be read to preclude replacement of the taxes with \nan alternative means of funding the national aviation system, as long \nas that alternative is consistent with the budget resolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, when it comes to our budget deliberations, \nthe temptation of politics has often made our search for a balanced \nbudget a difficult one. For a long time, I think all Members of this \nbody would agree that too much time was spent aggressively defending \nnarrow or partisan interests. Personal political interests were \nsometimes placed above pressing national interests. And common, \nbipartisan objectives were too seldom charted or pursued. The result \nfor our Nation is now as widely known as it was troublesome: Spending \nkept expanding. Deficits kept rising. And confidence in Government kept \ndiminishing.\n  But here today, Mr. President, with a balanced budget plan before us \nfor the first time in 28 years, it's encouraging to think that we may \nbe reaching a new beginning. Much of the credit for bringing us to this \npoint belongs to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Pete Domenici. \nThe chairman has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to a balanced \nbudget during his years of service on the Budget Committee, and, \nultimately, it was his leadership that brought both sides to the table \nand made this day possible. For his ongoing efforts, I believe that the \nchairman is deserving of our thanks--and the thanks of generations of \nAmericans to come.\n  Let me also thank our majority leader, Trent Lott, for his effort and \ncommitment to making this agreement possible, and the President of the \nUnited States for his willingness to negotiate and compromise. I know \nthat it is the hope and expectation of most Americans that President \nClinton will continue to stay focused on the balanced budget goal and \nsee this plan through to fruition.\n  And, finally, we should also recognize the other leaders of the House \nand the Senate who were engaged in this process. They, too, pursued \nthis resolution with determination and vigor--and forged consensus on \nsome very divisive issues. We would not be here today without their \nleadership.\n  But Mr. President, we have also reached this encouraging point in our \nbudget deliberations because--at last--there is a widespread \nrecognition that deficits threaten this Nation in unacceptable ways--\nand that decisive action is needed now to ward off economic crisis. The \nnumbers speak for themselves. According to estimates from the \nPresident's own Office of Management and Budget, if we do nothing, the \ndeficit will double in 15 years, then double again every 5 years \nthereafter. Left unchecked, according to OMB, the deficit would reach \n$2 trillion by 2025.\n  We also know that such a scenario would prove intolerably costly to \nthis Nation. OMB forecasts that if we fail to reign in the deficit now, \nfuture generations will suffer an 82-percent tax rate and a 50-percent \nreduction in benefits in order to pay the bills we are leaving them \ntoday. And the Congressional Budget Office has issued a similarly grave \nwarning, arguing a year ago that: ``* * * current U.S. budget policies \ncannot be sustained without risking substantial economic damage.''\n  Eighty-two-percent tax rates. Fifty-percent reductions in benefits. \nSubstantial economic damage. This is not some futuristic nightmare, Mr. \nPresident. This is the economy that lies ahead for America unless we \nact now, unless we lay the groundwork for long-term deficit elimination \nby adopting this resolution.\n  Mr. President, this agreement provides us with an historic \nopportunity to place our country back on the right fiscal path. But it \nalso provides the American people some assurance that our political \nprocess can work. After more than 2 years of competing proposals, \nacrimonious debates, and fruitless negotiations, many Americans have \nbecome understandably cynical of our ability and even willingness to \never agree on a plan to balance the budget. But this agreement should \ngive us some hope. It proves that we can compromise on specifics \nwithout compromising on principle--that when an agreement indisputably \nbenefits the American people, we can set aside partisanship and get the \njob done.\n  Of course, while the resolution before us today is an encouraging one \nand should be celebrated, we should also recognize what it is not. This \nis only a first step, Mr. President, and no Member of this body can say \nwith certainty that this resolution signals a conclusive end to the \nfailed budget politics of old. Indeed, I believe that only a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution can ensure that fiscal prudence \nand responsibility will be exercised indefinitely into the future.\n  And let me be clear about another matter. The budget resolution \nbefore us is not perfect. Are there flaws in it? Yes, Mr. President, I \nthink there are. In fact, I suspect that every Member of this body \ncould find aspects that trouble them in this resolution--aspects that \nthey may have written in a slightly or even greatly different manner.\n  For instance, some may criticize this resolution because it expands \nnew entitlements or does too little to reform existing entitlements \nbefore the baby boom generation begins to retire. In fact, it is with \nthe latter concern in mind that I am particularly troubled by the \nassumption of home health care being shifted from part A to part B of \nMedicare. I fear that this shift may actually imperil this vital \nprogram even as it masks the true problems of the\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\nMedicare trust fund, which must be addressed if we are to preserve and \nprotect the Medicare Program for senior citizens in the future. Still \nothers may criticize this plan as being insufficient in terms of \ndeficit reduction because it would cut the deficit by only 1 percent of \ntoday's GDP over the next 5 years, or because it provides what they \nconsider to be too much of an increase in discretionary spending. To \nput these types of concerns in the words of one analyst from the CATO \nInstitute: ``On balance, this is a bad deal. Republicans should just \nsay no.''\n  Conversely, there are those who may see the cuts quite differently \nand argue that this agreement goes too far in cutting certain programs \nand does too little to fund new initiatives. Still others do not \nsupport the tax relief included in this resolution, or argue that the \npackage of tax cuts being discussed would disproportionately benefit \nhigher income individuals or families.\n  But Mr. President, after 28 years of deficit spending, we can \nno longer let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We can no longer \nlet politics drive our budget decisions because for 2 years--2 years, \nMr. President--Republicans and Democrats have squared-off over a \nvariety of issues, while offering competing plans. And the result has \nbeen wholly unimpressive. There has been no agreement. No plan for a \nbalanced budget. And I think it's worth noting that the only reason \nthat we have this resolution before us today is that competing budget \nplans were unsuccessful. It is compromise that offers us this chance to \nreach agreement and lay the groundwork for long-term balance. But if \neach Member of this body rejects such compromise and demands instead \nthat the plan do exactly what he or she would want in the ideal world, \nthen only one thing is for sure: This plan will be derailed--and our \nhistoric opportunity will be lost.\n\n  And lest we focus only on those parts of the budget that are less \nthan perfect, let's not overlook the incredibly positive aspects of \nthis plan. For instance, not only will this plan balance the budget in \nthe year 2002, if its policies are continued, OMB tells us that it will \nlead to a surplus of $34 billion in the year 2007. And while many have \ncited the fact that the total deficit reduction in this plan will be \nonly $204 billion over the next 5 years, they fail to mention that \nthere will be more than $700 billion in additional savings during the 5 \nyears thereafter. Consider for a moment the two dramatically different \nfutures that potentially lie ahead for this Nation: If we reject this \nplan and continue with the status quo, we will add another $1.1 \ntrillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. On the other \nhand, if we use the 2002 to 2007 surpluses to buy-down the debt, this \nplan will ensure that more than $800 billion would be available for \nuseful investments, and not eaten up by the national debt.\n  Perhaps most importantly, by putting us on a course to balance the \nbudget in 5 short years, this plan will also allow us to address the \nsignificant long-term threats described by OMB and CBO because we will \nhave laid the groundwork for even larger reforms in the coming years. \nAnd it will also hold future Congresses accountable to maintain this \nsame level of fiscal responsibility.\n  And let's not forget the important impact that a balanced budget will \nhave on economic growth. I know that there are those who say that our \neconomy is doing well. They point to the growth rate for the last \neconomic quarter and the fact that we now have had continuous growth \nfor 6 straight years, and they say things could not be rosier. And it's \nat least partly true, Mr. President. We are now approaching the post-\nWorld War II record for the longest period of growth without a \nrecession. But no one is projecting that the economy will maintain this \npace, and the average annual rate of growth during the current 6-year \nstreak has been an unimpressive 2.5 percent--the lowest level of growth \nduring a recovery in this century.\n  But, tragically, even this lethargic annual rate of growth is not \npredicted to last--and cannot last--unless we tackle the deficit now. \nLook out to future years and we see that the economy is anticipated to \ngrow at even more anemic rates; 2.0 percent in 1998; 2.1 in 2000. The \nnumbers are not impressive. However, with the enactment of a balanced \nbudget plan, CBO tells us that potential growth will be enhanced \nbecause resources now devoted to consumption can instead be used for \ninvestment. So, Mr. President, this resolution presents us with our \nmost direct and tangible means of stimulating economic growth in the \nshort-term, even as we seek to extend our current economic expansion \nfor another 5 years.\n\n  And, finally, to those concerned with various details of the plan, \nlet's remember this: Within the framework of this resolution, there are \nspecific levels of savings in various programs, specific levels of tax \ncuts and the resolution even includes some of the policies that should \nbe used to achieve these targets. But, appropriately, this resolution \ndoes not spell out all of the details, and it leaves opportunities for \nthe authorizing and appropriating Committees to fulfill the parameters \nand benchmarks that have been set. So let's remember that the goal of \nthis resolution--a balanced budget in 2002--is in ink, but some of the \ndetails are still in pencil. And that's OK. The administration will \ncontinue to have the opportunity to encourage specific spending \npriorities, and Members of this body will also have their opportunity \nto influence and mold these decisions.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me address one final question. Whenever there \nis a political initiative as significant as the one before us, pundits \nbegin to ask: ``Who is the political winner in this agreement? Is it \nRepublicans? Or is it Democrats?'' Well, let me suggest an answer: The \nwinner in this resolution is our Nation and its people. Deficits have \ndamaged this Nation and its citizens for 28 years and set us on an \ninevitable economic crash course. But today, with this resolution, we \nhave an opportunity to avert this crash by ending these deficits in the \nshort-term, which lays the groundwork for eliminating them completely \nin the long-term. What lies before us is a framework for achieving a \nbalanced budget by 2002 and holding off the pending disaster that \ninaction invites.\n  So I think our goal could not be more clear: We cannot let this \nopportunity slip through our hands. We must begin anew--never again \npermitting our Nation to be recklessly endangered by deficits and \ndeficit spending. We must move forward with a recognition that our \nbudget belongs to the people--and, as such, it must always be handled \ncarefully and responsibly. These are our challenges--and, together, we \ncan and must meet them.\n  Mr. President, ``a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first \nstep.'' I am reminded of this Chinese proverb today because this \nresolution represents such a monumental first step in our journey to a \nbalanced budget. To be sure, our journey is not complete. And it will \nnot be complete unless Members of this body, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the President maintain a strong commitment in the \ncoming years to follow through and make this balanced budget goal a \nreality. We cannot falter in these coming challenges. But, in the \nmeantime, we should celebrate today for all that it represents. Mr. \nPresident, this resolution places our Nation on the right path and, \nagainst a future of uncontrolled deficits and all that the dangers and \nproblems that these deficits entail, this resolution gives us hope for \na new beginning of fiscal sanity, economic growth, and prosperity.\n  So I think our choice should be clear. We need to take this path--and \nwe need to adopt this resolution. The benefit of doing so, Mr. \nPresident, is too great. The cost of failing to do so, conversely, is \nsimply too severe.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, like many I recognize that this budget \nagreement is a good faith effort. It shows a recognition by Republicans \nthat their past plans were extreme and unpopular. Indeed, the agreement \nacknowledges, to a degree, that Americans want us to invest in \npriorities.\n  However, for all its positive steps, I do not believe it is the right \nbudget outline for our future. I support a balanced budget plan, but I \ncannot support a resolution which sets in motion a questionable package \nof unfair tax cuts and other misguided priorities.\n  The agreement contains a number of laudable elements. The welfare \nact's excesses are curbed. It takes a small first step toward health \ncare coverage for children, and important education tax credits are \nprovided. And it does purport to continue the march toward a balanced \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\n  Indeed, we would not be able to consider this agreement without the \n1993 budget agreement. With only Democratic votes, that package has cut \nthe deficit for 4 years in a row and brought the deficit to its lowest \npoint as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] since 1974. \nIronically, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle predicted the \n1993 budget would cause economic collapse and ruin. Yet, today, the \neconomic growth generated, in part, by the 1993 budget has brought us \nto the point where it is conceivable to reach budget balance. Today's \nnational economy is a marvel of low inflation, low unemployment, and \nstrong revenues, which is good news for many although it has yet to \nreach some in my State of Rhode Island.\n  Again, there are sound elements of this plan, but I would caution \nthat a budget resolution is short on specifics, long on figures, and \ntends to obscure the magnitude of what is under consideration. While \nthe budget resolution is nonbinding, it imposes an austere procedural \nand fiscal discipline on what the Senate can and cannot do. Certainly \nthe defeat of the Hatch-Kennedy amendment showed that this budget \nresolution can, and could continue to be, used to thwart efforts to \nmeet even the health care needs of America's children.\n  Mr. President, for all its effort, I believe this agreement falls \nshort in a number of key areas.\n  First, the deal's economic assumptions are optimistic, and are based \non a $225 billion midnight revenue windfall estimate from the \nCongressional Budget Office. Sadly, the accuracy of these estimates is \nnot guaranteed. Since 1980, CBO's revenue estimates have been wrong 11 \ntimes, and, on several occasions, these estimates have been off by more \nthan $50 billion. I would also add that try as the Senate might, the \nbusiness cycle cannot be legislated out of existence. My sincerest hope \nis that the current economic growth continues, however, history shows \nthat what goes up usually comes down. If we experience a downturn, this \nagreement could need massive retuning, which would probably not include \nthe elimination of tax breaks for the well-to-do, but would mean pain \nfor society's most vulnerable.\n  Second, and, most important, I believe the agreement's nontargeted \ntax breaks are the wrong direction for an agreement which claims to \nbalance the budget. When we are engaged in the task of trying to \nbalance the budget, we should not make the job more difficult by \nenacting questionable tax breaks for those individuals who are already \nbenefiting handsomely from the current economic growth.\n  This agreement calls for tax cuts totaling $250 billion over 10 \nyears. When it comes to taxes, what starts small, explodes later. \nIndeed, 44 percent of the cost of the agreement's tax breaks are packed \ninto the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. Indeed, the cost of these tax cuts \ngrows 32 percent in the final 2 years of the deal. What does this \nportend for the second 10 years of the agreement? According to the \nnonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the revenue loss \ncould reach up to $650 billion from 2008 to 2017. I would hasten to \nremind my colleagues that this is the time when the baby boom retirees \nwill begin to place enormous pressure on already strained entitlement \nprograms.\n  In contrast, targeted, middle-class tax breaks, like the Hope \nScholarship, are supportable because they help working families afford \ncollege and prepare their children for the competitive international \neconomy. Unfortunately, the agreement lacks even the attractiveness of \nclosing corporate welfare loopholes that subsidize the shipment of jobs \noverseas and other questionable business activities to pay for tax \nbreaks.\n  Mr. President, the specifics of the tax bill this agreement calls for \nare questionable to say the least. As the resolution's year-by-year \nrevenue loss tables show, there is plenty of budgetary room for time \nbombs and gimmicks. Indeed, after the revenue loss from the tax breaks \ndoubles between 1999 and 2000, it falls in 2001 and 2002, but it keeps \nrising and explodes after 2007. As others have pointed out, the pattern \nis not accidental. Instead, it is designed to permit a number of \nquestionable tax gimmicks to give the appearance of fairness and fiscal \npropriety. One such revenue trick is to phase in the capital gains \nindexation which conveniently hides the first 5 year revenue loss and \nassumes more revenue early on in the second 5 years as investors rush \nto cash in on capital gains indexing. According to experts, capital \ngains indexing will cost three times as much in the second 5 years as \nin the first 5 years of the budget deal.\n\n  Some may argue that if gimmicks are employed and subsequently wreak \nhavoc on deficit reduction, Senators will do the right thing and repeal \nthese taxes. Mr. President, I am not so sure that you can put the tax \ncut genie back in the bottle. This agreement contains no commitment to \ncontrol a revenue loss explosion. Indeed, all of the President's \nrequests for such assurances were rejected by Republicans. The word \n``permanent'' is used to describe the capital gains tax cuts, but not \nthe President's education tax incentives. I would also add that it is \nvery difficult to repeal taxes both politically and practically. For \nexample, phased-in capital gains indexing and other revenue games are \nhard to repeal or modify because taxpayers will have accepted the \nGovernment's tax cut offer on which the Senate would be hard pressed to \nrenege.\n  But, I am not simply concerned with revenue loss and tax cut \nchicanery. I believe that many of the tax cuts called for in this \nagreement are of dubious merit and value. The best example of this fact \nis an across the board capital gains tax cut. Such a proposal is not \ninvestment oriented. There will be no holding period or connection to \ninvestments in small businesses. As Paul Volker, former head of the \nFederal Reserve said before the Senate Finance Committee:\n\n       ``. . . a near-term reduction in the capital gains tax rate \n     from present levels does not strike me as a pressing matter, \n     especially given the current performance of the economy and \n     the medium and longer-term budgetary prospects . . . [A] very \n     large across the board reduction of capital gains taxes poses \n     serious problems of equity and complexity, of revenue loss \n     and of distortion of decision making.\n       If public policy is to make a serious effort to raise the \n     level of savings and investment, and do so equitably, the \n     priorities seem to me clear. We should move as fast as we can \n     toward a surplus in the Federal budget.''\n\n  There are those who would argue that a capital gains cut would help \nmillions of Americans. However, the typical beneficiary of a capital \ngains cut is not a middle-income family. Indeed, households with \nincomes over $100,000 receive about three-quarters of all capital gains \nincome, and as the Joint Tax Committee reported--JCS-4-97:\n\n       ``. . . [W]hile many taxpayers may benefit from an \n     exclusion or indexing for capital gains, the bulk of the \n     dollar value of any tax reduction will go to those taxpayers \n     who realize the bulk of the dollar value of gains.''\n\n  In other words a capital gains tax cut benefits the wealthy who \nactually have capital gains.\n  There are other questionable tax cuts in this plan, such as the \nestate tax cut which would only benefit the top 1.2 percent of estates \nand the backloaded IRA proposal which aims to increase savings for \nretirement, but causes a revenue loss explosion when the pressure on \nentitlements is most acute due to the baby boomers. Again, the \nPresident had tax proposals which were better and helped family \nbusiness owners without significantly adding to the deficit.\n  Third, while the agreement correctly focuses on education through a \n$35 billion targeted tax incentives for college costs, a commitment to \nincrease the Pell grant for fiscal year 1998, a commitment to \ntechnology in the classroom, and a minimal commitment to improving \nliteracy, the need may exceed what this plan allows due to its 10 \npercent reduction in domestic investment in real terms. Groups like the \nCommittee for Education Funding are greatly concerned about the \nrestrictive discretionary spending caps in the agreement which could \nseverely thwart efforts to invest in our education needs. The agreement \ncontains no school construction funds and little room in budget caps \nfor such an initiative. There is no room for further Pell grant \nincreases, as the defeat of my amendment to increase Pell grant funding \ndemonstrates. There are scarce resources for the estimated $4.8 billion \nprice tag to reform schools as suggested by the National Commission on \nTeaching and America's Future. Moreover, there is no commitment to fund\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\nGoals 2000, School to Work, national service, or the burgeoning need \nfor research into early childhood development\n  Fourth, the agreement makes very modest room for health care needs, \nand, as I have stated there was no room in this agreement for a more \nrobust children's health care program paid for with a tax on tobacco. I \nam also concerned that there are limited resources available for the \nNational Institutes of Health's fight against cancer and HIV.\n  Fifth, I am concerned that the $115 billion in Medicare cuts called \nfor in the agreement may exceed what is absolutely needed to preserve \nMedicare. Indeed, the level of cuts in the years 2001 and 2002 total \n$69 billion. I am also disturbed that no solid estimates are available \nfor the premium increases that many seniors face. The agreement also \nignores the long-term-solvency issues of the Medicare program and may \nleave some with the mistaken impression that Medicare is guaranteed to \nbe there for them. There are even those in the other body who would \nlike to add the dubious concept of medical savings accounts to this \nplan.\n  Sixth, the agreement ignores our investment deficit, and even its new \ninitiatives lose ground due to inflation and in relation to the growing \ntax cuts. Specifically, infrastructure investment is frozen at a time \nwhen the U.S. Department of Transportation estimates we need $50 \nbillion each year just to properly maintain our transportation system. \nLast week, a Rhode Island television station ran a series on the poor \nroad conditions of my State, but sadly this agreement provides only \nminimal assistance to fix Rhode Island's roads. In the area of housing, \nthe agreement notably extends essential section 8 contracts for senior \nhousing, but leaves little for other affordable housing programs. Last, \nmy colleagues should ask themselves whether the budget caps employed to \noffset the cost of unsound tax cuts will crowd out important programs \nand hamstring the Senate's ability to respond to the needs of all \nAmericans in an increasingly competitive world?\n  The agreement does not continue the path of deficit reduction begun \nby the 1993 budget agreement. Indeed, the deficit actually increases in \neach of the next 3 years from $67 billion this year to $90 billion in \n1998 to $90 billion in 1999 to $83 billion in 2000. Then miraculously, \nthe deficit falls as the Congress starts to cut $69 billion from \nMedicare, $49.7 billion from domestic investments, $46 billion from \ndefense, and $10 billion from Medicaid. All these reductions fall in \njust 2 years, leaving little margin for unsound budget estimates or \nexploding tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, on balance there is much in this agreement that should \nbe applauded, and the bipartisanship it displays is laudable. It \nacknowledges that the Contract With America embodied the wrong policies \nand priorities for our future. It provides for some investments in \nhealth care and education. It restores some benefits for legal \nimmigrants hurt by last year's welfare act, and it builds on the \nsuccess of the 1993 deficit reduction package.\n  However, the fundamental question is, Does this agreement meet the \nchallenges of the future? Will it allow us to truly reform education? \nWill it help more working families afford college? Will it rebuild our \nroads, bridges, and rails? Will it provide opportunities for those \nmaking the transition from welfare to work? Most important, is this \nagreement fair or does it ask too much of those who can least afford \nit?\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution is not the plan for our future. \nIt is too generous where fiscal discipline is required and too tight-\nfisted where investment is direly needed. And, sadly, it fails to meet \nthe test of fairness and honesty we owe hard working American families.\n  Mr. President, as the specific legislation to implement this \nagreement is developed, I am hopeful that its excesses can be curbed, \nand I would urge my colleagues to accept amendments which would make \nthis plan worthy of greater support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the revenue provisions in the budget \nresolution which is before the Senate reflects the bipartisan budget \nagreement entered into by the President and the congressional \nleadership. I quote from the Budget Committee's report accompanying \nthis resolution:\n\n       The Bipartisan Agreement assumes the net tax cut shall be \n     $85 billion over the next five years and not more than $250 \n     billion over the next ten years, to provide tax relief to \n     American families. Under the Agreement, revenues would \n     continue to grow, from $1554.9 billion in 1997 to $1890.4 \n     billion in 2002, an increase of $335.5 billion over the five \n     year period.\n       As always, the Ways and Means Committee in the House and \n     the Finance Committee in the Senate will determine the \n     specific amounts and structure of the tax relief package. The \n     tax-writing committees will be required to balance the \n     interests and desires of many parties (while protecting the \n     interests of taxpayers generally) in crafting the tax cut \n     within the context of the goals adopted by the Bipartisan \n     Budget Agreement.\n\n  I also want to read those guidelines from the letter sent to the \nPresident on May 15, 1997, from the Speaker of the House and the Senate \nmajority leader:\n\n       It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion \n     through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007. We \n     believe these levels provide enough room for important \n     reforms, including broad-based permanent capital gains tax \n     reductions, significant death tax relief, $500 per child tax \n     credit, and expansion of IRAs.\n       In the course of drafting the legislation to implement the \n     balanced budget plan, there are some additional areas that we \n     want to be sure the committees of jurisdiction consider. \n     Specifically, it was agreed that the package must include tax \n     relief of roughly $35 billion over five years for post-\n     secondary education, including a deduction and a tax credit.\n\n  Would the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee agree \nthat this agreement and this budget resolution leave great flexibility \nfor the Congress to shape the tax reconciliation bill?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do agree with the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator agree that within the parameters of an \n$85 billion net tax cut through the year 2002 and no more than $250 \nmillion over the next 10 years, including $35 billion in tax relief \nover 5 years for post-secondary education, including a deduction and a \ntax credit, there is significant flexibility in the size and the \ntargeting of a permanent capital gains tax reduction and in the size \nand the specifics of death tax relief included in the package?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Again, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator agree that the term ``broad-based'' as \napplied to permanent capital gains reductions as in the agreement \nletter, and in the committee report is subject to a reasonable debate \nas to its interpretation?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And does the Senator agree that the term ``significant'' \nas it is applied to estate tax relief in that same letter and in the \nreport is subject to reasonable interpretation as to the size and \nspecific provisions of any change in the estate tax?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do agree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I read the table summarizing the agreement, entitled \n``Long Range Summary, 1997-2007,'' on page 77 of the committee print, \nthere is an agreement regarding net tax figures for the years 1997 \nthrough 2002. The word ``agreement'' appears above the columns for \nthose years. The word ``projections'' appears above the columns for the \nyears 2003 through 2007. Am I correct then that the net tax cut figures \nfor the years 2003 through 2007 are not agreements on specific numbers, \nbut the numbers in those years are simply OMB projections?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Michigan is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. I ask these questions to reflect my concern that any tax \nbill produced pursuant to the budget agreement and this budget \nresolution not set in motion tax policies which will create large \ndeficits in the next decade. Also, I strongly believe we must carefully \nstudy the effect of any tax provisions which we include in the revenue \nreconciliation legislation to assure that it is fair, and not weighted \nto benefit principally those who need it least.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with reluctance, I oppose this budget \nresolution. It has many worthwhile features, and I am hopeful that as \nthe process continues, it can be significantly improved. In its current \nversion, it has too many obvious defects.\n  It contains excessive tax cuts that are likely to balloon in the \nfuture and lead to massive new deficits that make\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\nthe pledge of a genuinely balanced budget a hollow promise. It fails to \nask the rich to make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit, and \nrewards them with massive tax breaks instead. It threatens the system \nthat delivers health care to the elderly. It contains excessive \nreductions in the needed level of public investment. And it does not do \nenough to provide health insurance coverage to the 10 million children \nwithout such coverage today.\n  The last time a budget promised balance and large, ballooning tax \ncuts at the same time was the Reagan budget of 1981. And the tax cuts \nin this budget do balloon in the future. As a May 21 study by the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, the tax cuts in the \nbudget are growing at a rate of 32 percent in the final 2 years of the \nfirst 10-year period. That study also indicated that the tax cuts are \nlikely to cost about $650 billion, nearly two-thirds of a trillion \ndollars in the second 10-year period, from 2008 through 2017.\n  The budget also asks too little sacrifice from corporate tax \nsubsidies.\n  Our recent budget history should teach us that we only have so much \nmoney for tax cuts. We should target those scarce tax cut dollars to \nworking families and the middle class. But too many of the tax cuts \nthat the Republican majority brags about in this budget would benefit \nthe very wealthiest individuals and corporations.\n  As part of the bipartisan budget agreement, Speaker Gingrich and \nSenator Lott wrote to the President, ``We believe these levels provide \nenough room for * * * broad-based permanent capital gains reductions, \nsignificant death tax relief, * * * and expansion of IRAs.'' President \nClinton will be hard-pressed to preserve his important tax cuts for \neducation if the Republican majority in Congress holds to its present \ncourse.\n  The capital gains tax cuts in S. 2, the Republican leadership tax \nbill, would cost $33 billion in the first 5 years and fully $96 billion \nin the second 5 years. More than 85 percent of its benefits would go to \nthose with incomes greater than $100,000 a year, according to an \nanalysis by Citizens for Tax Justice. Fully two-thirds of the benefits \nfrom lowering the capital gains tax rate would go to the top 1 percent \nof taxpayers--those with incomes above $241,000. This wealthy elite \nwould get an average tax cut of about $6,800 from the capital gains tax \ncut, while families in the middle fifth of the population would get an \naverage tax cut of $4.\n  The estate tax cuts in S. 2, the Republican leadership tax bill, \nwould cost $18 billion in the first 5 years and $48 billion in the \nsecond 5 years. All of the benefits of these tax cuts would go to the 1 \npercent of estates larger than $600,000 in value.\n  A 1989 Joint Tax Committee analysis of an IRA provision similar to \nthat in the Republican leadership tax bill found that 95 percent of the \nbenefits went to the top fifth of taxpayers.\n  Reasonable restrictions on the tax cuts for capital gains and estate \ntax relief place much less of a burden on the deficit. The Democratic \nleader, for example, has introduced targeted capital gains tax cuts \nthat cost $4.5 billion, and estate tax cuts that cost $3 billion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  In addition, this budget takes only modest steps to control the \nmassive subsidies that the tax laws now bestow on the wealthy. It has \nbeen estimated that over four-fifths of tax subsidies go to the richest \nfifth of the population. At a time when billions of dollars of budget \ncuts are being proposed in health benefits for the elderly, it makes no \nsense to provide tax breaks to billionaires who renounce their \ncitizenship.\n  The tax expenditures listed in a December 1996 Senate Budget \nCommittee report add up to more than $2.7 trillion over the next 5 \nyears. That's more than 30 percent of the cost of running the entire \nFederal Government over the same time period. These tax entitlements \nrepresent a larger share of the Federal budget than Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, or any spending program.\n  Together with Senator John McCain and other Senators, I have joined \nin a bipartisan effort to reduce corporate subsidies using a base-\nclosing type Federal commission. Cutting corporate subsidies would \nintroduce a needed element of fairness in the budget. When so many \nindividuals and families are being asked to bear a heavy burden of \nbudget cuts, there should be no free rides for special interest groups \nand their cozy subsidies.\n  Medicare cuts, at $115 billion, make up nearly two-fifths of the \ntotal spending cuts in this budget. These Medicare cuts grow to $155 \nbillion over 6 years, and $215 billion over 7 years. Even though this \nbudget does not ask as much of beneficiaries as did the Republican \nbudgets of the last 2 years, cuts of this size raise serious questions \nabout the continued willingness of Medicare providers to participate in \nthe system.\n  Defense did not sacrifice to make its contribution. The levels in the \nbudget are essentially the higher of either the President's or the \nRepublicans' proposals. The Republicans' levels were higher in the \nshort run, and the President's levels were higher in the long run.\n  Domestic appropriations contribute $61 billion over 5 years and are \nassumed to contribute $273 billion over 10 years to keep the budget in \nbalance. Coming after the 1990 budget, which essentially froze total \nappropriations, these cuts seriously reduce the pool of money from \nwhich education, research, and other needed investments are made to \nensure the future growth of the economy.\n  The budget does make a worthwhile start for children's health, by \nallotting $16 billion--$3.2 billion a year on average--over the next 5 \nyears. But the budget also takes $14 billion out of Medicaid at the \nsame time, leaving doubts about how much net funding will actually \nreach children in need.\n  We should be realistic about what $3.2 billion a year can and cannot \ndo. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal cost of \nproviding Medicaid coverage to one child in 1997 will be $860. At $860 \nper child, $3.2 billion dollars a year will cover about 3.7 million \nchildren. This level is only one-third of the number of uninsured, just \nenough to cover those children below poverty with a little left over. \nIf we stop at the $16 billion in the budget agreement, we will be \nleaving out almost 7 million children in working families who earn too \nmuch for Medicaid but not enough to buy the health insurance their \nchildren need.\n  The $20 billion over the next five years in the Hatch-Kennedy CHILD \namendment was designed to help these families, and I regret that it was \nnarrowly defeated. Senator Hatch and I continue to believe that is \nshould be included in the budget, and we intend to offer it as part of \nthe reconciliation bill later this year.\n  The debates ahead will offer realistic opportunities to improve the \nbudget package in all of these areas and eliminate its worst \nprovisions. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact a \nbalanced budget that truly reflects the Nation's needs and priorities.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27, the Concurrent Budget Resolution for fiscal \nyear 1998. This resolution charts the course to achieve the goal that \nthe people of America and Idaho want and deserve--a balanced budget. \nWith the spending targets set forth in this resolution Congress will \nbalance the federal budget for the first time in nearly 30 years.\n  This accomplishment has a very personal perspective for me because \nthe last we had a balanced budget, in 1969, I was a junior in high \nschool. Now, almost 30 years later, as we are on the verge of balancing \nthe budget again, I have two children in high school who have never \nseen a balanced budget. An entire generation of Americans has lived \ntheir entire lives under the burden of a national debt that is now \nalmost $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. Our \nchildren deserve a better future than having to pay the interest on a \n$5 trillion debt. This budget resolution offers them hope for a better \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to support this monumental budget \nresolution not only because it achieves a balanced budget and \neliminates the national debt, but because it accomplishes these goals \nwhile providing significant tax relief to working American families. \nThis resolution confirms that the money in the Federal budget belongs \nto the taxpayers of this country, not the government, and it s about \ntime we start leaving more of it where it belongs, in the taxpayers \npocket.\n  This resolution provides families with a $500 per child tax credit, \ncuts\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nthe estate tax, provides a capital gains tax reduction and allows tax \nrelief for education costs. And the resolution provides for these tax \ncuts while reducing Federal spending more than one trillion dollars \nover the next decade.\n  This resolution doesn't forget our commitment to the elderly. We \naccomplish these tax cuts and spending reductions without making any \nlegislative changes to Social Security, and we shouldn't, Social \nSecurity is not the problem. This budget also insures the solvency of \nMedicare by simply slowing the rate of growth while still allowing \nspending to increase 28 percent, more than twice the rate of inflation. \nThis is an increase from $209 billion this year up to $280 billion in \n2002. Without this reform the Medicare Trustee s report estimated that \nthe Medicare Part A trust fund would be bankrupt by 2001.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution before us is a strong plan for \nreversing the decades old Washington habit of spend, spend, and spend \nsome more. It won't be easy to stop this out of control deficit train \nand turn it around, but Republicans are determined to get the job done, \nand we will.\n  I am proud to vote for this resolution and with it a brighter \ntomorrow for our children. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 27.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the important \nresolution before us today, the concurrent budget resolution. This is \ntruly a remarkable occasion. We are considering the outlines of a plan \nthat will balance the budget over the next 5 years.\n  This bipartisan proposal achieves a number of important \naccomplishments. The most significant of course is balancing the budget \nby 2002. I believe that the Budget Committee Chairman Domenici and \nranking member Lautenberg have done an outstanding job in their work to \nbring this agreement to the floor of the Senate.\n  Without a constitutional amendment, this agreement will balance a \nbudget that has been the focal point of national debate and a goal \nsupported by most every candidate for President and Senator for at \nleast as long as I have been in office.\n  Four years ago we proposed cutting the budget deficit in half. After \nmany difficult and contentious votes, Senate Democrats along with a tie \nbreaking vote from Vice-President Gore helped enact a program that set \nus on a course of real deficit reduction. Many criticized that effort \nand predicted economic disaster. But now after 4 years of economic \ngrowth and reduced deficits we are in a position to finish the job. \nAfter 4 years, our deficit has been reduced from $290 billion down to \n$67 billion.\n  This proposal outlines a plan to extend the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund for at least a decade. It will expand beneficiaries' choice \nof private health plans by allowing preferred provider plans and \nprovider sponsored plans to compete in the managed care programs in \nMedicare. Additional preventive health benefits are provided and \nbeneficiary copayments for outpatient services are limited. Part B \npremiums are maintained at 25 percent of program costs and any \nincreases necessary for home health care benefits are phased in over 7 \nyears. Low income seniors are protected from any potential home health \npremium increases.\n  In order to ensure that important areas of service are adequately \nprotected this agreement identifies priorities such as education \nreform, Pell grants, child literacy, and Head Start.\n  Two very important initiatives are anticipated in this agreement. The \nfirst provides $16 billion to expand health coverage to up to 5 million \nchildren who do not now have health insurance. The second revises last \nyear's welfare reform to restore necessary benefits to disabled \nimmigrants. I believe that the President's initiatives on these issues \nare commendable.\n  Although important progress is made in this agreement, I want to make \nclear that I have a number of concerns.\n  I have worked on and voted on budget agreements before and I \nrecognize some of the pitfalls. My first concern is the question of tax \ncuts. If the first priority of this agreement is to balance the budget, \nI do not believe that we should make that job any harder. This \nagreement calls for a net tax cut of $85 billion over 5 years. Why \ncan't we eliminate these cuts and balance the budget sooner? Why can't \nwe apply those funds to establish a budget surplus and apply it to debt \nreduction?. Or at least, why can't we wait to determine if this \nagreement and its underlying assumptions prove successful? What happens \nto our deficit reduction and balanced budget efforts in the event of an \neconomic downturn? There is no assurance that this agreement will be as \nsuccessful as the one 4 years ago.\n  I recognize that tax incentives have historically been employed to \nstimulate a sluggish economy. Although some may argue our economic \ngrowth could be even higher, last quarter's 5.6 percent growth is the \nhighest in 10 years. The stock market is at record highs, a core \ninflation rate of 2.5 percent in the last year is the best in 30 years, \nthe monthly unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is at a 25 year low. I am \nnot convinced that this is time to use tax cuts to stimulate the \neconomy. I believe that deficits should be reduced in good economic \ntimes. If tax cuts are to be used in good economic times what tools \nwill we have in a less favorable economy?\n  The tax cuts anticipated in this resolution are calculated to cost a \nnet $85 billion over 5 years. I am concerned, however, that beyond the \nscope of the 5 year resolution the cost of these tax cuts will go even \nhigher. Indeed the agreement expects that the 10 year cost will rise to \n$250 billion.\n  Even though this agreement provides for a balanced budget in 2002, \nentitlement spending is expected to soar beyond the turn of the \ncentury. Yes, we improve the solvency of Medicare in this budget and \nput it on a firm footing for 10 years, but beyond that time frame \nMedicare costs will rise. This agreement continues to use the surplus \nprovided by the Social Security system to reach a balance. Beyond the \nturn of the century the surpluses will provide retirements benefits for \nbaby boomers. I am concerned that again we are putting off finding a \nsolution to these problems when relatively small steps taken now can \navoid much larger steps that will undoubtedly need to be taken later.\n  During the consideration of the resolution I supported efforts to \nprovide additional support for children without health insurance, \nadditional support for early childhood development, and additional \nsupport to rebuild crumbling schools. Although we were unsuccessful on \nthese amendments, this will not be the end of the work. Those battles \nwill continue throughout the reconciliation and appropriations process \nand I am hopeful that we will have some success.\n  Let me say further that I recognize that just because this agreement \ndoes not solve each and every problem is no reason to oppose it. The \nperfect then becomes the enemy of the good. Important progress is made \nhere and although not perfect I intend to vote for the good.\n\n\n                              growth wins\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr President, it is no coincidence that the first balanced \nbudget agreement in a generation has come about at a time when the \neconomy is red hot and when joblessness has dropped below 4.9 percent. \nThe expanding economy has been shrinking the deficit as well as the \ngulf between both sides of the budget debate.\n  Any lingering distance between Congress and the administration was \nswept away on the eve of the budget agreement when the Congressional \nBudget Office predicted that a tidal wave of new money would flood the \ntreasury in the next 5 years.\n  These new CBO estimates project that even without a budget agreement, \nincreased revenues and decreased outlays would shrink the deficit an \nadditional $225 billion.\n  Perhaps even more important than the first balanced budget in a \ngeneration, this tidal wave of new money has washed away the ground \nunderneath opponents of growth. Nothing signified the victory of growth \nover zero-sum, class-warfare politics more clearly than the words of \nPresident Clinton's former Labor Secretary Robert Reich when he told \nthe New York Times a few weeks ago, ``The fact is, a lot of the deficit \nsolved itself. It was the one solution that no one thought of.''\n  Actually, it was the guiding philosophy of the Kemp-Roth tax cut. If \nI may quote Jack Kemp, ``Even with spending\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\nrestraint, we cannot balance the budget consistently without economic \ngrowth.''\n  Mr President, on this point the record is quite clear. Following the \ntax cuts in the early eighties the economy did soar. But so did the \ndeficit. The problem was, while revenues to the Federal Government \ndoubled during the decade, spending more than doubled.\n  In short, growth did its job--we just asked too much of it. The \namount of wealth produced by our country was astounding and continues \nto be astounding. However, it is not limitless. So neither can our \nspending be limitless.\n  We can protect the elderly and offer a helping hand to the poor, but \nonly with solid growth in the economy. Without growth, the poor and \nelderly are pitted against each other in competition for meager \nresources, while the rich are vilified for their success. Left \nunchecked, these battles corrode the American dream.\n  Mr President, I believe this budget represents a new coalition, bound \nby the common objective of higher growth. Because growth is the key to \nfunding worthwhile social programs without unfairly burdening middle-\nclass families. It is the key to providing a strong defense and a clean \nenvironment. It is the key to rebuilding the American dream.\n  Growth has won the debate because it has proven itself. Even the more \nardent opponents of growth oriented policies must realize that to raise \n$225 billion from taxpayers would require a typical middle-class family \nto pony up an additional $450 per year\n  Some will argue that the huge Clinton tax increase of 1993 is \nresponsible for the low deficit, high growth, low unemployment economy \nwe now enjoy. But that ignores the fact that this economic expansion \nbegan during the Bush administration. Others say it is the information \nage, along with deregulation and corporate restructuring that \nstrengthened our economy.\n  Regardless of who is right, and I do have some thoughts on the \nsubject, I relish such a debate about the connection between taxes and \ngrowth. What is no longer debatable is that growth is the key to higher \nincome for all Americans as well as higher revenues for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Look how far we have come in just 5 years. When President Clinton \ntook office, he offered a $19 billion dollar stimulus package \npredicated on the notation that private enterprise could not produce \nthe jobs our country needed. We no longer harbor fears about the \nability of America to produce for her citizens.\n  Some make the point that this budget will only be balanced for 5 \nyears. And this is true. It is also true that we face additional \nchallenges beyond 2002 in both Social Security and Medicare, especially \nwhen the baby boom begins to retire. But the seeds of a solution to \nthese long-term problems can also be found in this budget. Explicitly \nit restrains spending. Implicitly, it acknowledges that growth is the \nkey to finding revenue for popular programs.\n  Both sides of the American political conversation are now committed \nto playing within the bounds of fiscal restraint, while searching for \nways to promote growth. This formula has served us well in the past and \nit will serve us well in the future.\n  The old bromide is true. A rising tide does lift all boats. And the \nsame tidal wave that has lifted millions of Americans to unprecedented \nnew heights of prosperity in the past 6 years has also finally sunk \nthat leaky old boat, class warfare.\n  There are only two roads we can travel. One is to downsize the \nAmerican dream and learn to live in a slow growth world; the other is \nto grow the economy up to level that makes the American dream possible. \nWith this budget agreement, Congress and the President have decided its \nbetter to grow up.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the budget \nresolution. I support this resolution for two reasons. First, it \ncontinues the progress we have made since 1993 in moving toward a \nbalanced budget. Second, it protects priorities which are vital to our \nNation's future.\n  It is not a perfect plan. There are parts of it that give me serious \npause. I am especially concerned by the deep cuts in Medicare. I know \nthat this budget resolution only provides a blueprint for other \ncommittees to follow. So, I reserve the right to vote against the final \nMedicare package if the cuts threaten health care for our senior \ncitizens.\n  With this resolution, we are finally taking the historic step of \nbalancing the Federal budget for the first time since 1969. In 1993, I \nwas proud to support President Clinton's economic plan. Since that plan \nwas enacted, our deficit has been reduced from $290 billion to less \nthan $70 billion.\n  The 1993 vote was strong medicine. But it was the right medicine for \nour economy. Today, we have an opportunity to finish the job we began \nin 1993. We can adopt this resolution which will bring us to a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  But, unlike previous attempts to balance the budget, this resolution \nprotects crucial investments in our future. Balancing the budget must \nbe based on principles. First and foremost, it must meet families' day-\nto-day needs.\n  I believe this resolution succeeds in putting families and children \nfirst. It makes major investments in education--from adding 1 million \nchildren to the Head Start Program to making it possible for millions \nof students to receive a college education.\n  This resolution expands health care coverage to 5 million uninsured \nchildren. I want to do more. This resolution still leaves another 5 \nmillion children with no health insurance. I am supporting the Kennedy-\nHatch CHILD bill which would make sure that every child has access to \nimmunizations, early detection screening, and basic health care. I view \nthe commitment made in this budget resolution to children's health as a \ndownpayment on the job. I hope we will finish the job by enacting the \nCHILD bill later this year.\n  The bill before us will continue our progress in making our \nneighborhoods safe. It ensures that the programs of the 1994 crime \nbill, which have been so effective in bring down crime rates, will be \ncontinued.\n  I am particularly pleased that the budget resolution protects the \nviolent crime reduction trust fund, including the community policing or \nCOPS Program. The COPS Program has already put over 1,200 new police \nofficers on the streets in my State of Maryland.\n  Under this budget agreement, environmental protection will also be \nstrengthened. It ensures that another 500 Superfund sites can be \ncleaned up by the end of 2000, and provides funding to help communities \nclean up brownfield areas so that they can be redeveloped.\n  Under this balanced budget agreement, we will also be taking \nimportant steps to move people from welfare to work and to provide tax \nrelief for working families. It will enable us to provide help for \nthose who practice self help.\n  As the Finance Committee begins putting together the tax component \noutlined in this budget agreement, I hope they make tax relief for \nmiddle income families their priority. I want to enact capital gains \nrelief. I think we owe it to those who have invested in their community \nthrough purchasing and maintaining a home. They should be able to \nrealize the full gain on their investment, and not have it taken away \nthrough capital gains taxes.\n  I hope we can do something to provide capital gains relief for other \ntypes of investments as well. I believe that the longer you hold an \ninvestment, the less you should pay in capital gains. That rewards \nthose who invest in our economy for the long run, without rewarding \nthose who are just out to make a fast buck.\n  I want us to have estate tax relief, so that a car dealer in \nFrederick can pass on the business to the next generation, or a small \nfamily farm in western Maryland or the Eastern Shore can stay in the \nfamily.\n  I hope the Finance Committee will put together a tax package that \nputs families first. If the tax package is unfairly tilted toward the \nwell-to-do, I will oppose it.\n  Although I will support this budget resolution, I must be clear that \nthere are parts of it that give me great pause. I am particularly \ntroubled by the $115 billion in cuts in the Medicare Program. If we \nwere given the opportunity to vote separately on each of the major \ncomponents of this package, I would oppose the Medicare component.\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\n  In the last Congress, when the majority party was attempting to push \nthrough $270 billion in cuts to the Medicare Program to provide tax \ncuts for the wealthy, I opposed them. I said at the time that we did \nnot have a $270 billion solvency problem in the Medicare Program, \nrather we had a $89 billion solvency problem. I was joined by the \nmajority of my Democratic colleagues in that point.\n  So to see a resolution which calls for $115 billion in cuts to \nMedicare is of deep concern to me. I acknowledge this is much better \nthan plans that were before us over the last 2 years. However, I am \nstill concerned about the impact on seniors and on health care \nproviders of this magnitude of cuts.\n  I realize that the budget resolution does not cut a single dollar \nfrom the Medicare Program. It only provides a guideline for the \nauthorizing committee to follow. We are a long way from making any \nactual changes in Medicare. So I hope that the Finance Committee will \nexercise extreme care in crafting the Medicare piece of the budget \nreconciliation bill. I believe we can ensure the solvency of Medicare \nwithout creating a financial burden for seniors or providers.\n  Let me acknowledge one final area of concern. America owes a special \ndebt to our veterans. We have a sacred commitment to honor all of our \npromises to them. I want to ensure that we provide adequately for \nveterans' health care.\n  I am pleased that we passed an amendment to express the sense of the \nSenate that we must provide sufficient funding for veterans programs \nand benefits. This amendment includes language to urge that third party \npayments--that is, payments from private insurers--be used only to \nsupplement, not supplant veterans health care funding. It makes clear \nthat the Senate intends to keep our faith with America's veterans. I \nwon't stand for anything less than that.\n  Despite these reservations, I will support this resolution. It plots \nour course toward a balanced budget and puts families and children \nfirst. I believe this budget resolution will make a real difference in \nthe lives of working Americans, and I will support it as a framework \nfor future action.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senate Concurrent \nResolution 27, the Budget resolution. The budget resolution before us \nhas gone through an incredible amount of negotiating to get to this \npoint. I commend the Budget Committee chairman and the ranking member \nfor working so diligently on this budget.\n  As we began our work on the blueprint for our Nation's future, I had \ncertain criteria in mind the budget resolution had to meet in order for \nme to support it. Unfortunately, this budget does not meet enough of my \ncriteria to justify my support.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to explain my position and \nthose provisions which I feel leaves this agreement short of the mark.\n  I feel that a good budget agreement should balance the budget before \nthe year 2002. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $225 billion \nwindfall of unexpected revenues over the next 5 years. We should be \ngiving this unexpected revenue back to the American people and use it \nto reduce the deficit.\n  It also concerns me that there are no enforcement measures in place \nto ensure that the budget will remain in balance after the year 2002, \nlet alone before that.\n  Finally, the spending cuts are back loaded in the last 2 years of the \nagreement, and will take place after President Clinton leaves office. \nThat isn't right. I believe the American working families expect action \nfrom us today--not promises for a better tomorrow.\n  I voted for amendments that I felt would make the budget more \nenforceable and realistic. Without these meaningful amendments, the \nresolution does not go far enough. The amendments would ensure that the \ndebt limit would not be increased, and that these additional unexpected \nFederal revenues and the projected $225 billion revenue windfall would \ngo toward tax cuts and deficit reduction.\n  If we don't produce a balanced budget, we lose, and generations to \ncome will lose right along with us. A balanced budget only gets more \ndifficult to achieve the longer we wait.\n  If we are genuinely concerned about the welfare of our children, we \nshould first look at balancing the budget while it is still realistic \nand possible for us to do so. The longer we wait the more we turn our \nchildren's dreams and hopes for a brighter future into a terrible \nnightmare. They look to us for leadership. They look to us to pass a \nbudget that actually balances, and continues to balance the budget \nevery year. I have no intention of letting them down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the budget resolution which the Senate is \nnow considering represents the next step forward in a process begun in \n1993. It reflects a considerable bipartisan accomplishment of the \ncongressional leadership and the President. While I don't agree with it \nin every specific, it represents the best opportunity to reach a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002, in a way which protects Medicare, \nMedicaid, funding for education and environmental protection.\n  In 1992, the deficit in the Federal budget was $290 billion which \nrepresented 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product. The most recent \nestimate of the deficit for fiscal year 1997 is $67 billion, \napproximately eight-tenths of one percent of the gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Over the 5 years from 1993 to 1998, the deficit has been reduced by \nabout 1 trillion dollars from the deficit for those 5 years projected \nat the time. This remarkable progress has come about in large part as a \nresult of the deficit reduction package which President Clinton \npresented in 1993, and which this Senate passed, without a single \nRepublican vote, by a margin of one vote, the Vice-President's.\n  The economy has responded to the steady reduction of the deficit. The \neconomy grew for the first quarter of 1997 at a 5.6 percent rate, with \nan inflation rate of 2.7 percent. The unemployment rate is now 4.9 \npercent, the lowest in 24 years. This compares to an unemployment rate \nin 1992 of 7.5 percent. More than 12 million new jobs have been created \nsince President Clinton took office. Now, this budget agreement, \nreflected in the budget resolution before us, holds the promise of \nbringing us even closer to finishing the job.\n  This budget gets many of the nation's priorities right. It protects \nMedicare and Medicaid--while assuring the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund for another decade--it includes an important new initiative \nfor children's health insurance, assures necessary funding for the \nprotection of our natural environment, and perhaps most importantly, it \nincludes the largest increase in investment in the education of our \nchildren in over 30 years. The agreement includes the commitment to \npass $35 billion of postsecondary education tax cuts and funding for \nthe President's initiatives in child literacy, school technology, Head \nStart, and an increase in the maximum Pell Grant to $3,000. Overall, \nthis represents a 13 percent increase over the five years of the \nbudget, and a 36 percent increase in education and training from last \nyear's budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, the resolution before us also makes room in the budget \nfor $250 billion in net tax cuts over the next 10 years, and $85 \nbillion in net tax cuts over the next 5 years. This could provide an \nopportunity, within the confines of a budget which balances in 2002, to \nprovide investment in our Nation's future growth and tax relief to \nmiddle income families. This will require, however, that the Congress \nshow the discipline and the determination to shape the tax legislation \nwhich this budget resolution will make possible in such a way as to \nmeet these objectives.\n  Toward that end, providing they are part of a real package that gets \nus to a zero deficit by 2002, I intend to support the education tax \ncuts which the President has proposed, a $500-per-child tax credit \nadequate to provide tax relief to middle income families with children, \nand capital gains relief for homeowners. Also, I believe that, if \nconsistent with the deficit reduction goals laid out in the resolution, \nthat targeted capital gains relief for long-term investments and an \nincremental approach to estate tax relief should be used.\n  We must be careful, as we stand on the threshold of a balanced \nbudget, not to set in motion tax policies which will create large \ndeficits in the next decade.\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\n For that reason, I hope that the tax-writing committees will consider \ntying tax reductions to actually accomplished milestones of deficit \nreduction.\n  Second, we must carefully study the effect of any tax provisions \nwhich we include in the final tax reconciliation legislation to assure \nthat it is fair, and not weighted to benefit those who need it least. \nMany of the capital gains and estate tax proposals which we have seen \nproposed over the last several years would clearly have mostly \nbenefited the top 10% of income earners.\n  The budget resolution before us leaves great flexibility to the tax-\nwriting committees, and ultimately to the House and Senate to fashion \nan equitable tax bill that provides not only tax relief, but investment \nin our nation's future, particularly through education. Also, and very \nimportantly, the resolution provides for the tax provisions to be \nconsidered separately in a reconciliation bill after the other elements \nof the balanced budget have been enacted. This will provide the Senate \nwith the opportunity to reject a tax bill which is inconsistent with \nbalancing the budget and keeping it balanced in the years beyond 2002, \nand/or a tax bill which does not focus its relief on middle-income \nfamilies and investment in education. It will also provide the \nPresident with the opportunity to veto such legislation. While I hope \nthat course will prove unnecessary, it does provide greater assurance \nthat the budget agreement that we will soon ratify in this budget \nresolution will produce an outcome of which we can be truly proud.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend all of those who worked to produce \nthis bi-partisan budget resolution. It is with hope that we are finally \napproaching a balanced budget which protects the nation's priorities \nthat I will support this resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27, the 1998 concurrent budget resolution, which \noutlines the bipartisan budget agreement between the President and the \nCongress. While I acknowledge the legislation's shortcomings, I support \nthe overall agreement because it is a step in the right direction for \nour country.\n  Before I begin, I want to commend Senator Domenici and the other \nnegotiators for their tireless and unwavering commitment to reaching \nthis agreement. Their leadership serves the American people well.\n  Today, this bipartisan balanced budget resolution fulfills a series \nof promises that we made to the American people. We promised to pass a \nbalanced budget by 2002--reflecting our commitment to economic growth, \nfiscal responsibility, and the simple principle that our Government \nshould live within its means. Today, the plan before us will achieve \nthat goal. We promised to strengthen Medicare--reflecting our \ncommitment to the health care of senior citizens. Today, the plan \nbefore us will extend the solvency of Medicare's part A hospital \ninsurance trust fund for 10 years and make structural reforms that will \npreserve the program in the future.\n  We promised tax relief to help families and promote economic growth--\nreflecting our belief that the American people, rather than the Federal \nGovernment, should make decisions about how to spend, save, or invest \ntheir hard-earned income. Today, the agreement before us includes $250 \nbillion in permanent tax cuts over 10 years including a $500-per-child \ntax credit, capital gains relief, death tax reform, expanded individual \nretirement accounts [IRA's], and education tax incentives. For every $1 \nin new spending, we cut taxes $3.50.\n  We also promised to reduce the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment. Today, the agreement before us reduces total Government \nspending $320 billion over 5 years and more than $1 trillion over 10 \nyears. That's savings of $1,200 over 5 years and $3,800 over 10 years \nfor each man, woman, and child in America. In fact, for every new $1 \nadded to this budget, we reduce spending $15.\n  In constructing this budget, we promised to reject gimmicks and rosy \neconomic scenarios in our assumptions. Unlike the President's past two \nbudgets, the agreement before us does not include mechanisms that \nautomatically and arbitrarily impose one-time spending cuts or tax \nincreases to eliminate budget shortfalls. It is also based on the \nconservative economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office \n[CBO], which forecasts economic growth even more conservatively than \nmost private economists at about 2.1 percent annually over the next 5 \nyears. We chose these assumptions so we could err on the side of \ncaution.\n  However, even the most conservative assumptions involve a \nconsiderable degree of uncertainty. Forecasting the performance of a \nmulti-trillion-dollar economy is far from an exact science. I believe \nwe have done the best we could with the information we have available. \nBut if the agreement does not produce the expected results due to \nunforeseen circumstances, I will not be discouraged as long as we \nmaintain our focus on a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility.\n  Finally, we promised to reject rhetoric and partisan rancor to work \ntogether--Republicans and Democrats alike--to achieve results for the \nAmerican people. In this spirit, we have worked to accommodate the \nPresident's priorities, and he has worked to accommodate ours. Today, \nthe agreement before us is the product of countless hours of \nnegotiations between a Democratic President and a Republican Congress. \nI hope we can continue working in a bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. President, I cannot express my support without also outlining my \nconcerns in four particular areas. First, this agreement does not \nadequately restrain long-term entitlement spending growth to prepare \nfor the Baby Boomers' retirement just over a decade away. In fairness, \nthe authors of this agreement do not claim that it does. But as we \napproach this new demographic era, we must be acutely aware of this \nsituation.\n  Today, 200,000 Americans turn 65 every year. By 2011, 1.5 million \nAmericans will turn 65 every year, a trend that will continue for 20 \nyears. As the elderly population increases, our younger working \npopulation will shrink. Today, there are 4.9 workers paying for every \nretiree's benefits in programs like Social Security and Medicare. In \n2030, when we will have many more retirees to support, there will only \nbe 2.8 workers to support each beneficiary.\n  This dramatic demographic shift will bring significant economic, \npolitical, social, and cultural changes that will transform our \nsociety. If we continued on our current spending course, entitlements--\nour automatic spending programs--and interest on the debt would consume \nall federal revenues in just 15 years--leaving not a single dollar for \nroads, education, national parks, medical research, defense, or other \nbasic government functions. I believe this agreement will help ease \nthis demographic pressure, but more work lies ahead. We must begin \nsooner rather than later to deal with these problems fairly and \neffectively.\n\n  This week, I joined with Senator Kerrey in offering a Sense of the \nSenate amendment on the need for entitlement reform. Specifically, it \nencouraged Congress and the President to work to enact structural \nreforms in entitlement spending in 1997 and beyond which sufficiently \nrestrain the growth of mandatory spending in order to keep the budget \nin balance over the long term, extend the solvency of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds, and to avoid crowding out funding \nfor basic government functions, and that every effort should be made to \nhold mandatory spending to no more than 70 percent of the Federal \nbudget. I am pleased that the Senate adopted this amendment \nunanimously. While a Sense of the Senate amendment is not binding, I \nbelieve it will help lay the foundation for more substantive reforms in \nthe future.\n  Medicare is my second concern. As the second largest entitlement in \nthe budget serving more than 38 million seniors, Medicare will have a \nprofound impact on our long-term fiscal health. When we consider that \nthe average two-earner couple receives $117,000 more in benefits than \nthey paid in taxes and premiums and factor in that Medicare is \nprojected to be bankrupt before the baby boomers retire, we see the \nurgent nature of this problem. While I am encouraged by the bipartisan \nattempt to modestly restrain Medicare growth, we must redouble our \nefforts to save and strengthen this vital program through true \nstructural reform.\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\n  In addition to the demographic pressures outlined earlier, Medicare \nalso faces the challenge of delivering 21st century health care through \na bureaucratic 1960's delivery system. Clearly, piecing together fair \nand balanced policy options that achieve the required $115 billion in \nsavings should not be our only goal. Working within the framework of \nthis budget agreement, Congress should adopt structural reforms that \ntailor the program specifically to seniors' needs.\n  These reforms should give beneficiaries more choices among competing \nhealth plans--similar to the ChoiceCare proposal introduced by Senator \nGregg and my Provider Sponsored Organizations [PSO] bill--while \nretaining the current fee-for-service option for any senior who wants \nit. With these options, seniors could choose a plan that covers \nprescription drugs, a benefit not available under the current program. \nWe also need to educate our young people about the benefits of long-\nterm-care insurance. By changing the structural dynamics of the system, \nwe truly can prepare Medicare for the challenges that await us.\n  My third concern involves our investment in research and development. \nAdvances in technology have been responsible for one-third to one-half \nof our long-term economic growth through improved capital and labor \nproductivity and the creation of new products and services. Despite \nthis important relationship, our Federal investment in research and \ndevelopment has been falling as a percent of our gross national product \n[GNP] compared to other advanced nations. Unfortunately, this budget \nagreement does not reverse this troubling trend.\n  While some research and development investments such as the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH] and the National Science Foundation [NSF] \nare protected, many others are cut. Total Federal research and \ndevelopment funding could fall up to 14 percent over the next 5 years. \nAs a percentage of GNP, it will have dropped more than 30 percent from \n1994 to 2002. As a research scientist and chairman of the Commerce \nScience, Technology, and Space Subcommittee, I believe that \nunderfunding research and development risks our national security and \nour economic competitiveness. If this trend continues, we will be \nretreating from investments with a proven record of returns that have \nmade us healthier, wealthier, more productive, and more secure than \nalmost any civilization in world history.\n  Finally, my fourth concern is education. Time after time in this \nChamber, we have stressed the importance of a balanced budget to our \nchildren. With a balanced budget, they can leave the deficit spending \nof the past behind and look forward to a future of better economic \nopportunities. To take advantage of these opportunities, our children \nwill need a quality education. I am pleased that education is a \npriority in this agreement. However, we are not targeting our resources \nwhere they are needed most--elementary and secondary education.\n  In the President's budget, about 85 percent of the new education \nspending and tax initiatives are directed toward higher education. This \nbudget agreement is structured in a similar way. These facts are \ntroubling when you consider that only 28 percent of fourth graders are \nproficient in reading, only 21 percent of eighth graders are proficient \nin math, and about 30 percent of college freshman must take remedial \ncoursework.\n  Our higher education institutions are the envy of the world, but \nwithout a stronger K-12 education system, this academic superstructure \nrests on a foundation of quicksand. I am concerned that our academic \nsuccess will not last if we do not target our resources where there is \nthe greatest need and greatest potential. Ultimately, we should \nconsider targeting at least 50 percent of new education resources \ntoward elementary and secondary education in the future. I urge my \ncolleagues to focus more on this problem.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have mentioned, my vote today is not the final \nsolution to our budget problems. My vote today is merely a down payment \non a long-term commitment to my constituents in Tennessee and to all \nAmericans--a commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n  The issues raised by this agreement will not disappear if this \nresolution passes. In fact, we will debate them again and again this \nyear as we implement the agreement in the appropriations and \nreconciliation process. However, we can build on the momentum of this \nagreement to recommit ourselves to the discipline and diligence \nnecessary to free our children from debt and unlock the doors of \neconomic opportunity for our future. I look forward to meeting this \nchallenge.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nblueprint our nation will follow to reach fiscal balance by the year \n2002. I commend the efforts of the President and the Congressional \nleadership to reach this agreement. It is clear that unless we get our \ndeficit under control, we will be leaving our children--and our \nchildren's children--a legacy of debt that will make it impossible for \nthem to achieve the American Dream.\n  This budget resolution reflects public opinion. This is a bipartisan \nagreement because of clear public opposition to continued deficit \nspending.\n  Although the deficit has been reduced in the past few years, our \nNation's debt still obscures our ability to focus on the issues that \nmost impact Americans' daily lives. The deficit under President Carter \nwas $73.8 billion when he left office. Under President Reagan it \nballooned to $221 billion, and reached $290 under President Bush. When \nPresident Clinton took office, he inherited a $290 billion deficit. The \nnational family was in debt $4.4 trillion.\n  Under President Clinton's leadership, however, the deficit has been \nreduced to $67 billion, the lowest nominal level since 1981. During the \nBush administration, private sector growth averaged 1.3 percent \nannually, but under President Clinton, growth has averaged 3.5% per \nyear. Furthermore, last year's deficit was 1.4 percent of the size of \nour economy, well below the deficits of other major economies, and the \nsmallest level since 1974. This year, it will fall to about 1 percent \nof the economy.\n  President Clinton's 1993 economic budget plan gave the signal to the \nworld's financial markets that Democrats were committed to fiscal \nresponsibility and that we would put our country on a glide path to \nbalance. Our Nation is now in our 6th straight year of economic growth. \nUnemployment was 7.5 percent in 1992. Last month it fell to 4.9 \npercent, the lowest level in a quarter century.\n  During the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at an annual \nrate of 5.6 percent, the best in a decade. And since President Clinton \ntook office, more than 12 million new jobs have been created.\n  The best news about this resolution is that it continues the trend \nbegun in 1993: this budget makes strides toward balance. Balance was a \nprecondition of this agreement. While I regret that we did not pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, the proof of the pudding \nis in the eating: the President and congressional leaders have reached \na consensus and agreed that this budget should reach balance in the \nyear 2002. And this budget has achieved that.\n  Mr. President, an area where the nation has reached a consensus is \ntax cuts. Everybody likes tax cuts. Public opinion is always in favor \nof tax cuts and this budget resolution provides for a net tax cut of \n$85 billion over 5 years.\n  The tax cuts include: a child tax cut; about $35 billion in higher \neducation tax cuts; a capital gains tax cut; a cut in the estate tax; \nand a variety of other tax proposals included in the President's \nbudget, including the welfare-to-work tax credit.\n  But this budget resolution only outlines the overall framework of the \nbudget. The tax cuts that were agreed upon must be finalized in \nreconciliation in the Finance Committee. But these are the likely ones.\n  While I support the concept of these proposals, I would have \npreferred to finish balancing the budget first.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution also reflects the popular \nsupport for health care and Medicare. And the changes contained in the \nMedicare Program will not hurt seniors.\n  The agreement calls for $115 billion in Medicare savings, keeping the \nMedicare trust fund secure for another decade. It expands seniors' \nchoices of private health plans by allowing preferred provider \norganizations and provider-sponsored plans to compete in Medicare's \nmanaged care program.\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n  Furthermore, this agreement will make some fixes to the Medicaid \nProgram. While the resolution does not contain a per-capita cap, which \nwould have hurt Illinois, it calls for $13.6 billion in net Medicaid \nsavings. It restores Medicaid coverage for certain legal immigrants. It \nprovides food stamps to individuals subject to last year's welfare \nreform bill time limits, who are seeking work but have not been able to \nfind a job. And it provides a welfare-to-work initiative.\n\n  The other good news is that this budget also provides for: expansion \nof the funding for Superfund hazardous waste cleanups; help up for to \nfive million children, who currently lack health insurance, receive \nhealth insurance coverage by 2002; and it provides for the largest \nincrease in education spending in 30 years.\n  This budget resolution does however, contain a few disappointments. \nIt does not come to grips with the fundamental challenges our Nation \nfaces in the coming years. Instead of confronting these challenges and \ntaking steps to meet them, it is the budgetary equivalent of the scene \nfrom ``Casablanca'' when Claude Rains says ``Round up the usual \nsuspects.'' In this case, the ``usual suspects'' are domestic \ndiscretionary spending and cuts in reimbursements for Medicare and \nMedicaid health providers.\n  Like Captain Renault, this agreement is more concerned with the \nappearance of action than with actually achieving something. And unlike \nthe situation in ``Casablanca'', where the captain's inaction produced \na good result, the failure to address our fundamental retirement \nsecurity and investment challenges now, makes the future more difficult \nfor all of us.\n  Since 1991, discretionary spending has remained relatively flat. \nWhile the President has resisted deeper cuts this year, this budget \nresolution nonetheless short-changes domestic spending. The agreement \ncuts investments in non-defense discretionary programs by at least $61 \nbillion below the level needed to maintain the current level of \nservices. This agreement represents roughly a 10 percent cut in real \nterms in non-defense discretionary programs. This translates into less \nmoney for cops on the streets, less money for sewers, and less money \nfor our highways--fundamental public investments needed to keep our \ncountry strong.\n  The squeeze is being put on discretionary funding to pay for tax \ncuts. Furthermore, nothing is being done to address entitlement \nspending. This budget resolution does nothing to address the ominous \nlong-term issue facing our country: changing demographics and its \neffect on our ability to maintain retirement security for future \ngenerations.\n  I was a member of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax \nReform. The Commission made it clear that unless we get the deficit \nunder control, by the year 2003, mandatory spending--most of which goes \nto Medicare and Social Security--plus interest on the national debt, \nwill account for fully 73 percent of the total Federal budget.\n  Though the current economic news is generally good, and the economy \ncontinues to expand, this trend may not continue. The Congressional \nBudget Office's report entitled ``The Economic and Budget Outlook: \nFiscal Years 1998-2007,'' points out that ``Despite the improved \noutlook through 2007 . . . the budget situation will start to \ndeteriorate rapidly only a few years later with the retirement of the \nfirst baby boomers and the continued growth of per-person health care \ncosts.''\n  By the year 2012, the Social Security trust fund will begin spending \nmore than it takes in. And by the year 2029, the trust fund will have \nexhausted all of its resources. After 2012, when there are no more \nsurpluses, Federal deficits will really begin to explode, an explosion \nfueled by the looming retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  The fact that for the next 15 years Social Security will be running a \nsurplus, works to disguise the extent of the problem, as does the fact \nthat the retirement security budget is currently roughly in balance. \nSocial Security and Medicare payroll taxes, Medicare part B premiums, \nand interest earned by the Social Security and Medicare trust funds \nroughly equal the spending by those two programs, at least for the \nmoment.\n  The long-term prognosis, however is nowhere near as favorable and the \nproblem with this budget resolution is that it does nothing to address \nthese problems now, while there is still time. Granted, the proposed \nset of Medicare reductions will extend the solvency of the trust fund \nuntil 2008. There are also some true systematic reforms to the Medicare \nProgram that will move many of the program features toward prospective \npayment systems.\n  However, this is not nearly enough. This budget resolution does not \neven extend the Medicare Program solvency to the year 2010 when the \nbaby-boom generation begins to retire. Think about this: Currently, 13 \npercent of the population is over age 65, and that number will double \nby the year 2030. The problem of fixing Medicare for the long run is \nonly going to get more difficult. If we wait until the next millennium \nto deal with Medicare, it is going to take a lot more than $115 billion \nover five years to fix the problem. If we want Medicare to exist for \nour children and for many of us, we have to seize this opportunity to \noverhaul the program in a long-lasting way.\n\n  Equally depressing is our complete ignoring of needed Social Security \nreform. There has been a lot of talk over the last few years about tax \ncuts and the need to give Americans some relief from the burden of \nexcess taxation. As you may know, 70 percent of Americans pay more in \npayroll taxes than income taxes. The average worker retiring in 2015 \nwill pay $250,000 in payroll taxes over her working career.\n  People pay these taxes into a system that they believe will provide \nthem with some measure of retirement security. They expect Medicare to \nbe there to cover health care costs and they expect Social Security to \nbe around to provide a measure of income support. Eighty percent of \nAmericans get more than 50 percent of their retirement income from \nSocial Security.\n  The Social Security system, just like Medicare, is not prepared for \nour future changes in demographics. Current retirees can expect to get \nback in benefits what they paid in taxes plus interest within eight \nyears.\n  For the vast majority of past and current retirees, Social Security \nhas been a great value. They paid into the system with the promise that \nwhen it was their turn to retire, Social Security would be there. Well, \nthe outlook is not as good for future generations of retirees. Already, \nthe probability of getting back what they will pay into the system is \ndiminishing. In the year 2015, it will take the average worker 13 years \nto recover what he pays in payroll taxes.\n  This already eroding value of Social Security is compounded by the \nfacts that we are planning to reduce the consumer price index which \nwill lengthen the time it takes to recoup taxes and even more \nproblematic, the trust fund is expected to become insolvent in 2029.\n  A lot of work has been left undone by this budget resolution. This \nresolution does not even begin to make the reforms necessary to ensure \nthat the next generations of Americans can retire with the same dignity \nas their grandparents and parents. Cutting $115 billion from Medicare \nis simply a quick fix to get past the initial 2001 exhaustion date. \nFuture seniors should not have to worry about whether Medicare will pay \ntheir doctor's bill or whether their Social Security check will arrive \non time.\n  Mr. President, I was particularly disappointed that this proposal did \nnot invest in education infrastructure. It is a sad fact of life that \nin thousands upon thousands of classrooms all across the country, our \nschools are not physically up to the task of educating all Americans \nfor the 21st century. Too many of our schools are literally falling \ndown around our children.\n  Too many of our schools are overcrowded to the point where students \ncannot learn effectively. Too many of our schools do not have the \nphysical infrastructure necessary to support the integration of \ncomputers into classrooms.\n  According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, which at my request \nconducted an intensive, 2-year study of the condition of America's \nschools, 14 million children attend schools in such poor condition they \nneed major renovations or outright replacement; 7 million children \nattend schools with life-\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\nthreatening safety code violations; and it will cost $112 billion just \nto bring schools up to what the GAO calls good, overall condition--in \nother words--up to code. This budget resolution does nothing to address \nthese concerns.\n  Mr. President, education does not just provide benefits to \nindividuals. Education benefits the public. Every single American \nbenefits from improvements to our elementary and secondary education \nsystem.\n  It is unfortunate, then, that we continue to pay for our education \nsystem as though its benefits were individual and local in nature. In \norder to remain the world's economic leader, we must reform our \neducation funding system that was designed to meet the needs of \nyesterday's economy.\n  Our reliance on local property taxes to pay for elementary and \nsecondary education causes wide disparities in the abilities of school \ndistricts to adequately fund education. Under our current system, \nwealthy communities with low tax rates can often generate sufficient \nrevenues to build the finest facilities, while poor communities with \nvery high tax rates often cannot raise enough to support even mediocre \nschools. While many poor districts try their hardest, and have the \nhighest tax rates, the system works against them.\n  According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, poor and middle-\nclass school districts in 35 States make a greater local tax effort \nthan wealthy districts. In my home State of Illinois, the poorest \ndistricts tax themselves at an average rate of 43 percent higher than \nthe wealthiest districts. This phenomenon is our school finance \nsystem's greatest irony: the lowest-income areas often have the highest \nproperty tax rates and the schools with the fewest resources.\n  The GAO found that although most states make some attempt to \nsupplement local funding in poor districts, wealthy school districts in \n37 states have more total funding per pupil than poor districts. These \ndisparities exist even after adjusting for differences in geographic \nand student need-related educational costs. In Illinois, the wealthiest \n20 percent of districts have almost two-thirds as much to spend per \npupil than the other 80 percent.\n  Because we rely on the local property tax to fund education, the \nopportunities available to our children are subject to the vagaries and \ndisparities of local property wealth. Children in wealthy communities \nare able to attend the best schools and have the most opportunities, \nwhile children in poor and middle-class communities often have access \nto second-rate facilities and lesser opportunities. This budget \nresolution does nothing to reverse these trends.\n  In conclusion, I believe that our Nation's budget, reduced to its \nessentials, is very much like the budget of any family. It should \nbalance revenues and spending, it should address the needs and \npriorities of the various family members, it should be fair in the \napportionment of spending and sacrifice, and it should lay a foundation \nfor the future well-being of its members.\n  It should address the looming needs of the American family, \nespecially in regards to health care and retirement security, as well \nas reinvestment in the infrastructure which is in progressively worse \nshape.\n  The agreement reached can be thought of as a decision to pay off \nsome, but not all, of the old bills, to give more support to a variety \nof family activities, and to give up a part time job. Because the \neconomy is so robust, those decisions represent the cashing in of a \nprosperity dividend.\n  Mr. President, Congress must not only look at the 5 and 10 year \neffect of the policies we enact. We need to look at how the policies we \nchange today affect the future. It is true that long-term economic \nestimates are notoriously unreliable, but having said that, long-term \nbudget problems are in no small part related to long-term demographic \ntrends. And long-term demographic trends are reliable.\n  Our actions now will impact future generations, our grandchildren. \nFor example, if Social Security were examined under the requirements of \nprivate pension funds, you would find that it is underfunded by \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Congress should look outside the \nbudget horizon, particularly at the long-term budgetary consequences of \ntax cuts. Tax cuts are back-loaded in this resolution.\n  Mr. President, in Alice in Wonderland, Alice asked the Cheshire Cat, \n``Which way should I go?'' And the Cheshire Cat responded ``It depends \non where you want to go.'' Congress must decide which way to go. Mr. \nPresident, this budget resolution will balance the budget. But more \nwork needs to be done to meet our obligations to future generations of \nAmericans, to invest in people and to protect their retirement \nsecurity. Every generation of Americans has addressed and resolved \nchallenges unique to their time. That is what makes our country great. \nNow is the time to take steps toward ensuring that our generation will \nhonestly address its needs so that future generations will have at \nleast the same opportunity.\n  Our generation should leave no less than we inherited.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to voice my \nconcerns about the budget resolution we debate here today. Since the \nannouncement of a budget deal earlier this month, I have carefully \nexamined the plan, contemplated its effect on our economy and the \nfuture of our children, and pondered the advice of many. I have also \nobserved the floor debate and statements of my colleagues, and have \nheard the views of many of my constituents in New Hampshire. After much \ndeliberation, I must oppose this budget.\n  While I do not support the resolution, I would like to commend my \ncolleagues who have worked so hard to try to craft a good plan. I \nappreciate their efforts and the difficult discussions they have \nendured. Most importantly, I realize that negotiating with the White \nHouse is no easy task. However, my concerns about the deficit, the \nexploding growth of entitlements, and the huge tax burden on Americans, \nfar outweigh the temptation of a politically appealing agreement with \nthe President. History has taught us that the most politically \nexpedient solution is not always good for Americans.\n  What happened to the Republican Congress that came into town in 1995, \nready to attack the problems in our economy that had been ignored for \ndecades? Where is the spirit of dedication that accompanied our success \nand the commitment to our principles that led to our win? Where are \nthose voices that denounced Washington's business as usual? I cannot \nanswer these questions, but I do know that we should not disappoint the \nvoters who trusted us.\n  For a minute, allow me to set aside the rhetoric that surrounds this \ndebate and look at the facts. Fact 1: Under the plan, the era of big \ngovernment is not over. This budget deal proposes to spend $5 billion \nmore than even President Clinton requested for fiscal year 1998. In \nfact, spending for 1998 increases about $70 billion from 1997--a bigger \nincrease than any budget passed by Democrat-controlled Congresses in \nrecent years. Over 5 years, this plan spends $189 billion more than \nCongress proposed in last year's budget resolution. The so-called \nsavings that have been celebrated by proponents are just reductions \nfrom the inflation-adjusted baseline that rises each year.\n  Fact 2: All the pain is in the out-years. Since Congress revisits the \nbudget resolution every year, we cannot count on anything past 1998 and \nwe have no assurance that the cuts in spending will ever be achieved in \n2001 and 2002. At the very least, we must cease the fairy tale rhetoric \nabout savings that will be achieved over the next decade.\n  Fact 3: The deficit goes up! While the deficit for this year is \nprojected to be $67 billion, under this plan, it is estimated to grow \nto $90 billion for the next 2 years and then drop slightly to $83 \nbillion in 2000. Not until 2001, does the deficit drop to below today's \nlevel. If we can reduce the deficit from $53 billion in 2001 to 0 in \n2002, why can't we reduce it by $53 billion this year? Furthermore, the \ndeficit reduction is due, in large part, to suspicious economic \nassumptions. Overnight, the Congressional Budget Office discovered a \n$225 billion ``fiscal dividend'' of new tax revenues that may or may \nnot be realized in the out-years.\n  Fact 4: The tax cuts will not provide noticeable relief. While we \nmust vote on the spending increases now, we have but a skeleton of a \ncommitment on tax relief for Americans--legislation which won't be \ndiscussed until next month. Since we have already promised away\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\n$35 billion for the President's education credit, the tax writing \ncommittees are left with very little room to accommodate the equally \nimportant capital gains tax reductions, death tax reform, the $500 per \nchild tax credit, expansion of individual retirement accounts [IRA's] \nand other relief provisions. For instance, $100 billion would not even \ncover the full $500 credit. These restrictions will produce scaled-\ndown, phased-in, and barely noticeable adjustments.\n  Fact 5: The proposal contains no real entitlement reform. This budget \nproposes $115 billion in Medicare savings, but does absolutely nothing \nto fundamentally restructure the ailing program. In fact, the biggest \nreform is an accounting change that we condemned as a ``gimmick'' just \nlast year--and rightly so. Worse yet, the plan wipes out many of the \nreal reforms we enacted in last year's welfare reform legislation by \nrestoring welfare payments to legal immigrants and expanding Food Stamp \nwork slots.\n  Fact 6: The budget deal protects additional money for Presidential \npriorities, but no programs are terminated. While the resolution \nguarantees that spending will go up for programs such as Head Start and \nbilingual education, there is not one word about reforming or \neliminating arts funding, AmeriCorps, or corporate welfare programs. \nSince total discretionary spending increases in this legislation, I \nhold out little hope that wasteful spending programs will be tackled \nthis year.\n  A legitimate balanced budget plan should shrink the size of \nGovernment, reduce the deficit, and reform entitlement programs. The \nbudget must be accompanied by a credible tax package that includes \ncomplete repeal of the estate tax; a 50 percent cut in the capital \ngains tax rate; an immediate $500 per child tax credit available to \nall, regardless of income; and creation of an ``IRA-Plus'' plan. These \ntax cuts should be financed by reducing spending, not increasing other \ntaxes.\n  Although this plan contains many serious flaws, it is my hope that we \ncan renegotiate a plan that meets but one condition: it must be a good \ndeal for Americans. In its current form, I cannot, in good conscience, \nsupport this budget resolution.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 27, the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan budget agreement represents a hard-\nfought achievement for our nation. It is neither the perfect plan, nor \nis it the plan that I would write if I were solely responsible for this \nenormous task. What this plan does represent, however, is a compromise \nbetween two parties, a compromise between Congress and the \nadministration, and a delicate balance of important national investment \nand tax priorities. Under the circumstances, no plan could be perfect. \nThis plan, nevertheless, is a good plan.\n  Mr. President, this plan is the culmination of more than 2 years of \ndebate. During the course of this debate we have witnessed several \ncritical events: the shutdown of the Federal Government, the death of \nthe so-called Contract With America, and the emergence of a group of \ncentrists committed to a sensible approach to balancing the Federal \nbudget.\n  In order to understand this agreement in its proper context, we \nshould take a moment to remember that this agreement today would not be \npossible without tough votes cast by Democrats on the Omnibus \nReconciliation Act of 1993. The success of that deficit reduction \npackage is indisputable. When President Clinton took office in January \n1993, the Federal budget deficit stood at $290 billion. Experts are now \nprojecting a deficit for this year in the range of $67 billion. We have \nseen, for the first time in a century, declining deficits for 5 years \nin a row, and the deficit as a percentage of the size of the economy is \nat its lowest in decades. Not a single Republican supported the 1993 \ndeficit reduction bill. Not one. Yet, without this enormous \nachievement, we could not be finishing the job today.\n  It is also vitally important that we remember the great battle over \nthe shape of Government that has taken place over the past 2 years. At \nthe beginning of the 104th Congress, we heard talk of a revolution. We \nwere told that we needed to cut Medicare by $270 billion over 7 years. \nWe were told that Medicaid should be reduced by $170 billion, and that \nFederal Government would no longer guarantee health care coverage for \nthe poorest Americans. And we were told that the earned income tax \ncredit--a program that reduces the tax burden on low- to moderate-\nincome working families--should be cut by $32 billion. Speaker \nGingrich's revolution also called for massive reductions in \ndiscretionary spending, leading to cuts in critical education programs, \nveterans' programs, and environmental protection.\n  These large-scale reductions would be necessary because Speaker \nGingrich's plan contained a massive tax cut of $280 billion over 7 \nyears. The majority of the tax cuts would be of little benefit to \ntypical American families. In fact, with the cuts in the EITC, many \nfamilies needing the most help would have paid higher taxes.\n\n  Democrats knew that there was a better way. We said that we could \nbalance the budget by 2002, but we had to do it with the right \npriorities. We said that we could balance the budget while enacting a \nmodest package of tax cuts that would be targeted to typical American \nfamilies. We said that we could preserve Medicare, invest in education, \nand balance the budget. This budget agreement proves that we were \nright.\n  With a better-targeted tax cut package, this agreement allows us to \nbalance the budget while making investments in critical priorities. The \nagreement provides $35 billion in tax cuts for education, funding for \nthe child tax credit, and still leaves room for relief in estate and \ncapital gains taxes.\n  The agreement would increase funding for Pell grants by $8.6 billion \nover 5 years. This funding boost would increase the maximum Pell grant \nto $3,000--which is a $300 increase--and it would expand eligibility so \nthat more students can be provided assistance.\n  The agreement will provide $16 billion over 5 years for innovative \nnew programs to provide health care coverage for 5 million children who \nhave no health insurance. This achievement stands in stark contrast to \nproposals in the Contract With America that would have removed the \nFederal guarantee of health care coverage under Medicaid.\n  The bipartisan agreement allows for the largest expansion of \neducation programs since the time that Lyndon Johnson was President. \nHead Start will be expanded by $2.7 billion, allowing for 1 million \nchildren to be enrolled in this critical program by 2002. This is a \nvast improvement over the Contract With America, which called for the \nelimination of the Department of Education, cuts in student loans, and \nreductions in Head Start.\n  The agreement provides for growth in Federal student loan programs, \nincreasing student loan volume by $7 billion by the year 2002. In \ncontrast, the Contract With America would have added to student debt \nburdens by charging interest while the students were still in school.\n  The agreement will reform Medicare to extend the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund for 10 years. Rather than receive benefit reductions, \nMedicare beneficiaries will be eligible for new preventive care \nbenefits, such as mammography coverage, other cancer screening, and \ndiabetes management.\n  The agreement will implement President Clinton's proposed budget for \nthe National Park Service, producing an increase of $57 million over \ncurrent budget levels.\n  The budget plan provides key funding for crop insurance programs, \nallocating $200 million necessary from discretionary funds to reimburse \ncrop insurance agents for the cost of administering the program.\n  The agreement will fund the President's budget request for tribal \npriority allocations, which pay for law enforcement, child protection, \neducation, and road maintenance on our Nation's reservations. This \nprovision will boost funding by $200 million for the next fiscal year, \nand by $800 million over 5 years.\n  I do want to take a moment, however, to express my concern that the \ntax-writing committees in both the House and the Senate take \nconsiderable care as they fill in the details of the agreement to \nreduce taxes by a net $85 billion over 5 years and $250 billion over 10 \nyears. There may be great temptation to structure these tax cuts so \nthat their full cost to the Treasury is not felt until the years beyond \nthe 10-year path laid out by this agreement. It would be a grave \nmistake, and\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nhighly irresponsible, to pass into law a tax cut package that could not \nbe sustained over the long term. Our goal should be to keep this budget \nin balance for good. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues on these \ncommittees to keep long-term fiscal considerations in mind.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank all those on both sides of the aisle \nthat spent countless hours negotiating this agreement. We have not yet \nfinished the job, but the passage of this resolution is a crucial step \ndown the road to balanced budget.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I reluctantly have to rise in \nopposition to this balanced budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, this agreement will balance the budget in 5 years. \nBut, we are already $5 trillion in debt. We can't wait 5 years. We \ncan't go deeper into debt, just to spend more on domestic programs.\n  In the last 40 years, the Government has grown too big--it is time \nfor our national debt to get smaller. In fact, this budget could \nactually be balanced by the year 2000 rather than 2002, and still \nprovide tax relief for working families, were it not for the first 3 \nyears of higher spending which the President insisted upon. I want to \ncommend my colleagues who negotiated with the President, and I have no \ndoubt it was difficult to persuade the President to agree to a budget \nthat ever achieves balance. But I simply cannot support the spending \nincreases and tax increases in this budget.\n  If this budget resolution is enacted, spending will grow--that's \nright, grow--by $267 billion over 5 years, rising from $1.622 trillion \nthis year to $1.692 trillion in 1998, $1.753 trillion in 1999, $1.809 \ntrillion in 2001, and $1.889 trillion in 2002. Under this budget deal, \ndeficits will grow next year alone by 35 percent, from $67.2 billion to \n$90.4 billion. In fact, deficits will be above this year's level for \neach of the next 3 years. This budget deal allows spending to balloon \nover the next 3 years, and it does not begin to control spending until \nthe year 2001, which of course will be after the end of the President's \nsecond term.\n  In fact this agreement will actually produce the largest increase in \nsocial spending in the last 15 years.\n  While we're spending at records levels, the agreement gives little in \nthe way of tax relief. And much of the tax relief that is provided is \nreally robbing Peter to pay Paul. The agreement includes a gross tax \ncut of $135 billion, but let's take another look at that so-called tax \ncut. If you look elsewhere in the agreement, you'll see that it \nactually includes $50 billion in new tax increases, including $34 \nbillion in tax increases from the airport and airway trust fund tax.\n  In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will adjust the Consumer \nPrice Index downward by 0.25 percent. That's another $6 billion in tax \nincreases. In other words we are cutting taxes with one hand, and \nraising them with another, so the Government can keep spending and \ndeficits can keep growing.\n  Most of the deficit reduction in this bill comes not from tough \nchoices and policy changes that control Government spending, but from \nrosey-scenario assumptions made by economists. We are assuming that \neconomic growth will be strong enough, and inflation will be low enough \nthat all the hard choices will be taken care off for us. In fact, 99 \ncents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in this bill is simply \nassumed. As my good friend, Senator Gramm has noted, only 1 cent out of \nevery dollar, or $3 billion out of $350 billion, comes from changes in \npublic policy.\n  Congress and the President should tell the American people the hard \ntruth about the Nation's deficit. A balanced budget requires hard \nchoices. It cannot be achieved simply by wishing it away.\n  Even though I cannot support this budget agreement, I must note that \nthis is perhaps the best agreement that could be achieved, considering \nthat we have been negotiating with a President who is dedicated to \nincreasing the size of the Federal Government.\n  In fact, I find it very instructive to compare this budget agreement \nwith the budget produced in 1993, when the President and a Democratic \nCongress unveiled their own budget plan. That 1993 budget raised taxes \nby $241 billion, provided absolutely no net tax relief, and never \nachieved balance, but continued deficit spending as far as the eye \ncould see. The Clinton budget of 1993 provided spending reductions of \n$193 billion, as against a net total of $241 billion of tax increases. \nThe current balanced budget agreement of 1997 provides $320 billion of \nspending reductions, and gives the American people a net total of $85 \nbillion in tax relief.\n  Without the current balanced budget agreement, it is likely that the \nFederal Government would face another Government shutdown. This \nagreement should prevent that from happening.\n  Is this a perfect agreement? No, it is not. Unfortunately, no \nagreement which attempts to reconcile a philosophy of tax and spend \nGovernment growth with one of tax relief and fiscal restraint is likely \nto be perfect. Perhaps it is the best that can be achieved under this \nPresident.\n  Although it is perhaps the best that Congress can get from this \nPresident, the Nation deserves much better, and for that reason I plan \nto vote against the budget agreement. With that, Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Gen. George S. Patton once said, ``if \neverybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.''\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that this budget is going to pass. \nThere appears to be a lot of sentiment on both sides of the aisle that \nthe deal must be approved even though it is flawed in many respects. \nBut, like General Patton, I hope each of us and every American will \nactually evaluate the budget agreement on its merits before deciding \nwhether or not to go along. I, for one, have concluded that the deal--\non its merits--should not be supported, and there are several reasons \nwhy.\n  First, consider the deficits that are projected under the budget \nagreement. The deficit this year is expected to total $67 billion. We \nare trying to get a zero deficit--to balance--by the year 2002. But \nunder this budget, the deficit goes up, not down. It climbs 34 \npercent--to $90 billion next year--and then remains in that range for 2 \nmore years. Only in the final 2 years of the 5-year plan--in 2001 and \n2002--would the deficit drop dramatically.\n  Think about that. We are at a $67 billion deficit now, and we are \ntrying to get to balance in 5 years. This budget lets Congress and the \nPresident go on a spending binge for 3 years, and then requires us to \neliminate a $90 billion deficit in just 2 years. It cannot be done.\n  It is as if you decided to go on a diet and lose 20 pounds by the \nFourth of July. But instead of losing the weight gradually, you decided \nto put on 10 more pounds and then started the diet in earnest on July \n1. You would fail to achieve your goal. The same is the case regarding \ndeficit reduction. If it is going to take 5 years to eliminate a $67 \nbillion deficit, how can we possibly eliminate a $90 billion deficit in \njust 2 years? The answer is that we will not.\n  Second, consider tax relief. Of course, the budget itself does not \ninclude a family tax credit, capital gains relief, relief from death \ntaxes, on an education tax credit. It merely establishes the overall \nsize of the tax cut that will be written later. But the amount of tax \nrelief we will be able to provide is very small: a net total of $85 \nbillion over 5 years--about 1 percent of the $8.6 trillion in tax \nrevenue that will be collected over that time period. A tax cut of 1 \npercent. It is minuscule.\n  It is going to be impossible to provide all of the tax cuts that we \nhave promised within that small amount.\n  Mr. President, the tax relief we promised to working families--to \nhelp small businesses create jobs and provide better wages--will total \n$188 billion alone. President Clinton's education credit will cost \nanother $35 billion. And there are a variety of other tax cuts as well.\n  What that means is that a single mother probably cannot count on a \nfull $500-per-child tax credit. It probably will be something less, \nphased in over a period of time. And maybe only some parents will \nqualify.\n  It means that small businesses, including those started by women and \nminorities,  cannot count on the tax relief that would enable them to \nexpand, hire new people, pay better wages, and do the things necessary \nto become more competitive.\n\n  It certainly will not be significant enough to prolong the economic \nexpansion, which is already reaching historic\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\nlengths. That means the economy will probably slow, and people would be \nhurt be recession. We can prevent that by providing the economy with \nthe shot in the arm that it needs to keep on growing. But that will \nrequire a larger, more meaningful tax cut.\n  Third, consider whether or not this budget preserves Medicare for our \nseniors today and for those who will count on it in the future. Instead \nof going bankrupt in 2 years, this budget lets Medicare go bankrupt in \nless than 10 years. We need to make sure Medicare is safe and solvent \nfor the long haul, particularly when the first wave of the Baby Boom \ngenerations begins to retire in 2010. This budget does nothing to \nprotect Medicare for the next generation.\n  It merely delays insolvency, mainly by reducing provider \nreimbursements, which will either diminish the quality of care provided \nto today's generation of older Americans or drive more doctors and \nhospitals out of the Medicare Program altogether, leaving seniors with \nlimited health-care choices.\n  It shifts the costs of home health care from part A to part B--a \ngimmick that we roundly denounced when the President proposed it \nbefore.\n  Fourth, consider whether or not this budget makes good on the \nPresident's pledge that ``the era of big government is over.'' It does \nnot. In fact, there are 13 new mandatory and entitlement programs in \nthis agreement. And their costs will explode early in the next century.\n  Fifth, and this may be the most telling of all, to pass this budget \nagreement we will first have to waive the discretionary spending caps \nfor fiscal year 1998 that were established by the Democrat Congress and \nthe Democrat President in 1993. Outlays will actually exceed the \nstatutory cap by about $7 billion. In other words, the Republican \nmajority, which was sent to Washington to try to curb spending, will \nallow spending to grow even more than the free-spending Congress of the \nearly 1990's.\n  Mr. President, this budget will not produce the intended results. It \nmerely postpones all of the tough decisions until a new President and a \nnew Congress are elected early in the next century. It is, as Yogi \nBeara once said, deja vu all over again--a remake of the 1990 and 1993 \nbudget deals that simply yielded more spending, bigger government, and \nmore taxes.\n  I intend to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Budget Resolution before us today is \nnothing more than a blueprint that, if implemented in its entirety \nthrough subsequent reconciliation and tax legislation, purports to \nbalance the federal budget by 2002. Whether or not a balanced budget \nwill actually be achieved in five years, Heaven only knows. Having said \nthat, this agreement must nevertheless be recognized as the byproduct \nof a reasonable compromise between a Democratic President and a \nRepublican Congress. Such bipartisan cooperation has not been witnessed \nin recent years, when two government shutdowns have highlighted the \npaucity of compromise in our federal government.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend the leaders from both parties \nwho have worked hard to forge a balanced-budget agreement that will \nlikely pass both houses of Congress. However, I also want to remind all \nSenators that most of us did not sign the Bipartisan Budget Agreement \nannounced by the President and the Congressional leadership on May 2, \n1997, and we are not thereby bound to its individual components. As \nmuch as we want to jump on this budgetary bandwagon, we must be careful \nnot to subject this Budget Resolution to any less scrutiny than would \nbe applied to a strictly partisan budget proposal.\n  Mr. President, the Budget Resolution before us today purports to \nachieve a budget surplus of $1 billion in FY 2002. To accomplish this \ntask, discretionary spending will be cut by a total of $138 billion \nover five years, Medicare and Medicaid will be cut by $129 billion, and \nother mandatory programs will be reduced by approximately $40 billion. \nIn addition, the proposal would amend budget rules to extend the \nstatutory caps for discretionary spending and the pay-as-you-go \nrequirements for mandatory spending through 2002. While I am concerned \nabout the depth of the spending cuts targeted towards discretionary \nspending, which has been declining sharply as a percentage of the \nfederal budget since the 1960's, I cannot ignore the substantial \nimprovement in discretionary funding that this Budget Resolution \nachieves over its immediate predecessors. Furthermore, this plan places \nspending priorities on many needed investments in transportation \ninfrastructure, educational assistance, environmental protection, and \ncrime-prevention programs.\n  Mr. President, if the Budget Resolution included only the \naforementioned spending reductions, I would likely be standing on the \nfloor today declaring my unequivocal support for its passage. However, \nthe Budget Resolution before us also includes certain provisions that \nhave nothing to do with balancing the budget. In fact, these \nprovisions--namely, the $85 billion in net tax cuts included in Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27--take us in the opposite direction and make it \nmore difficult to balance the budget. In essence, Mr. President, if we \napprove these tax cuts, we are with one hand digging deeper the very \nhole our other hand is trying so hard to fill. Such ambidexterity \nshould not be relied upon to balance the budget. We should eschew all \ntax cuts until after we firmly erase the budget deficits that have so \nplagued our nation in recent years. Tax cuts were, after all, the \nprimary culprit for the rapid escalation in the federal budget deficit \nin the 1980's. It is all too easy to enact tax cuts and save the pain \nfor later. We have done it before, and the lessons learned from that \nexercise should instruct us not to do it again.\n  Mr. President, some may guarantee that the Budget Resolution before \nus today will balance the budget in five years and still provide such \ntax relief. If the economy continues to perform at close to its current \npace, that very well may be true. However, if the economy turns sour in \nthe next five years, the tenuous $1 billion surplus projected for FY \n2002 under this Budget Resolution may be worth less than the paper on \nwhich it is printed here today. We may never see that surplus, or \nanything close to it, if we combine the contradictory goals of tax \ncutting and budget balancing in this resolution. Suppose, for example, \nthat we provide these tax cuts today and then find ourselves in the \nyear 2000 well above the deficit targets proposed by this resolution. \nWill we be able to repeal these foolhardy tax cuts to bring us closer \nto balance? Will we be able to tell those beneficiaries of these tax \ncuts to give them up? I have served in this body long enough to \nrecognize that tax cuts such as the ones included in this Budget \nResolution are virtually a one-way street; there is no turning back. We \nshould steer clear of this diversion and stay focused on the course of \nbalancing the budget.\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks, I want to remind all \nSenators of the actions that have helped to bring us to this point, \nwhere balancing the federal budget is well within our reach. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, the FY 1997 budget deficit will be \napproximately $67 billion, or less than one percent of Gross Domestic \nProduct (GDP). Just five years ago, many Senators will remember that we \nwere facing a budget deficit of $290 billion, or about 4.7 percent of \nGDP. This considerable improvement in the fiscal order of our nation \ndid not occur by accident. Rather, it can be traced directly to the \npassage in 1993 of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (OBRA-93) \nby the 103rd Congress, with the support of President Clinton. That \nlandmark legislation combined responsible spending cuts and revenue \nincreases to begin the painful--but necessary--process of eliminating \nthe deficit. There can be no doubt of the success of OBRA-93 in \nbringing down the deficits and stimulating economic growth. We are \ncurrently in our sixth consecutive year of economic growth, \nunemployment has dipped below five percent, and inflation has remained \nin check. The Budget Resolution before us today continues the task of \nbalancing the budget from the propitious starting point made possible \nby OBRA-93, and it relies on projections of similar economic conditions \nin the future. Mr. President, it is safe to say that, were it not for \nOBRA-93, the task of balancing the budget by FY 2002 would be \nsubstantially more difficult, and the Budget Resolution before us today \nwould not come close to balance.\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\n  After discussing what actions have made this Budget Resolution \npossible, however, I believe it is also important to focus on what \nactions were not needed. Specifically, I am referring to the proposed \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, which was again \ndefeated earlier this year. Without constitutionally tying the hands of \nthis and future Congresses, the leaders of the Congress and the \nPresident have come together to forge a balanced-budget plan. The plan \nis not perfect, by any means, but it must serve as a reminder that, in \norder to balance the budget, it takes only the courage to stand in the \nwell of this chamber and cast our vote for a specific plan to eliminate \nthe deficit. There is no substitute for courage that can be drawn from \nsuch an ill-conceived constitutional amendment.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me announce my intention to support \nfinal passage of S. Con. Res. 27.\n  I commend the members of the majority and minority leadership, and \nthe Budget Committee, who have come together with equanimity to work \nout a bipartisan budget agreement with the White House. Compromise is \nnever easy to achieve, but its results may well be worth our efforts. \nAfter all, let us not forget that the Senate itself was, according to \n``The Federalist Papers,'' the ``result of compromise between the \nopposite pretensions of the large and the small States.'' Similar \nconflicting ``pretensions'' have helped mold the bipartisan budget \nagreement before this body into a reasonable approach to balance the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 27, the bipartisan budget agreement as amended during the \ndebate of the past few days. Mr. President, I believe that the Budget \nResolution represents an important victory for this body and for the \nAmerican people in that we can finally look forward to a balanced \nbudget by 2002. Priorities like Medicare, Medicaid, education and the \nenvironment have been protected. This agreement, the first true \nbalanced budget in 28 years, delivers on a personal promise of mine to \nwork to strengthen the economy, balance the budget and put families \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I salute the work of both parties as the primary \nreason this agreement was reached. Each side had to give and take to \nget us to this point. I commend the President and the congressional \nleadership, particularly Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg, for \ntheir responsible conduct throughout this entire process. We are in \ntheir debt.\n  Mr. President, the budget agreement puts more resources into \neducating America's children--from Head Start to college--than the \nFederal government has done in 30 years. It secures Medicare's solvency \nfor a decade, cleans up poisonous waste sites and will help move \nmillions of Americans from welfare to work. Just as important, it \naccomplishes all this and gives needed tax relief to hard-working \nfamilies and small businesses through capital gains and estate tax cuts \nand a $500 per child tax credit.\n  Mr. President, this agreement only begins our work, it doesn't end \nit. I will go forward with my colleagues fighting for families--to \nstrengthen our investment in children by repairing their crumbling \nschools, extending medical coverage to more children, and cutting \njuvenile crime--and to strengthen Social Security and make retirement \nsecure for every working American.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senate shortly will be taking a very momentous step. \nWe will be acting on a budget resolution designed to eliminate the \nfederal budget deficit by 2002. This has been an objective many of us \nhave fervently sought for many years. It has been my objective since I \ncame to the Senate in 1985.\n  The Federal Government has run a deficit continuously for more than \n30 years, but it soared to what were then almost inconceivable heights \nin the 1980s during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. As a result of \nthose stratospheric deficits, the national debt has multiplied several \ntimes, exacting a toll from our economy, increasing interest rates, and \nmaking debt service one of the largest expenditures in the Federal \nbudget.\n  I would like nothing more than to vote for a solid budget resolution \nthat would achieve balance while allocating resources in a way most \nlikely to meet our most pressing national needs. Because of the \nstrength of my desire to achieve balance and eliminate the deficit, I \nam tempted to vote for the resolution that the Senate is considering \ntoday. It does, of course, project balance in 2002.\n  Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to achieve a budget \ncompromise, which entails bridging the great differences among elected \nofficials--the President and his Administration and both Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Congress. President Clinton and his senior advisers, \nthe Senate and House Republican leadership, and the chairmen and \nranking members of the House and Senate Budget Committees have labored \nmightily for many weeks to try to devise the plan on which we will be \nvoting today. Given those differences they had to bridge, I think they \nare to be commended for what they accomplished.\n  But above all the applause for the deal they struck, and the \nbipartisan congratulatory cheers simply for laying aside the usual \nbickering and sticking with the plan they have prepared, I hear my \nconscience saying it is wrong to ignore my core set of values and what \nI believe should be the priorities for our Nation.\n  This budget deal, Mr. President, may be historic. I strongly support \nthe fact that it achieves balance in 5 years, and if that balance \nactually is achieved, it surely will be historic. But that is far from \nthe only measure that should be applied to a budget. Deficit \nelimination is a vital objective, but it is neither an economic policy \nnor a statement of priorities for our Nation or its Government.\n  Said another way, it matters, and matters greatly, how we achieve \nbalance, not just that we achieve it.\n  Mr. President, despite the fact it achieves balance, and despite the \nfact that one can imagine many budgets that would be worse for our \nNation--indeed, one need look no further than the draconian budget the \ncongressional Republicans tried to force down our throats as recently \nas 2 years ago--this budget does not meet America's needs as I believe \nthey can and must be met while achieving budget balance. It fails this \ntest in two ways--one of those consists of vital activities it fails to \ninclude, and the other consists of the detrimental effects of its \ncontents.\n  The foremost deficiency of this budget is that it has no vision for \nAmerica's children. To partially address this deficiency, I offered an \namendment to enable the Senate to consider legislation later this year \nto meet the critical early developmental needs of children from birth \nto age 6. I applaud the managers for accepting this amendment. But \nearlier, the Senate rejected a bipartisan amendment that would have \nprovided the budgetary room needed to enact a program providing health \ninsurance to the millions of children who do not now have it.\n  We were presented with a deal that gives lip service to some of our \ncritical domestic needs by providing limited room for so-called \nPresidential initiatives. These include $16 billion over 5 years to \nprovide health insurance to children who do not now have it; an \nincrease in Pell grants; and increased funding for bilingual and \nimmigrant education, child literacy initiatives, Head Start, and \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and National Park Service operations. \nBut the allocations for these categories fall far short of the \nadditional investments that are needed in these and other critical \nareas.\n  The share of our gross domestic product invested in education, \ntraining, infrastructure, and civilian research and development will \ncontinue to decline for the next 5 years under this budget blueprint. \nMany Senators--on both sides of the aisle--pointed this out during the \ndebate and each one in turn was rebuffed.\n  Look at the amendment by my great friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. The amendment they offered would \nenable an expansion of health coverage to all uninsured American \nchildren. But their amendment was defeated--shot down for the sake of \nthe deal. Look at the amendment by my able friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois. Senator\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\nMoseley-Braun attempted to set aside $5 billion for school \nconstruction. Of the schools in Massachusetts, 92 percent are in \ndisrepair, and this money would have been a downpayment on our \nobligation to allow these children and all American children to have at \na minimum a proper setting in which to learn. But Senator Moseley-\nBraun's amendment was rejected. And, why? Because it purportedly would \nhave busted the deal.\n  The Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, sought to increase \nfunding for Head Start, school lunches, and school construction. \nRepublicans cynically demolished that amendment by passing a substitute \namendment calling for a school voucher program.\n  At the head of the list of the harmful features of the bill can be \nplaced the effects of its tax cuts. I support and believe the Nation \ncan benefit greatly from the President's initiatives to provide \nassistance through the Tax Code to American families and individuals to \nhelp them meet the costs of higher and continuing education. But this \nbudget resolution includes tax cuts that are sufficiently large that \nthe result inescapably will be to increase the deficit--yes, I said \nincrease the deficit--for at least the next 2 years.\n\n  Considerably more potentially destructive, despite a fuzzy commitment \nby the deal cutters that the tax cuts will not be backloaded--that is, \nthey will not result in mushrooming revenue loss in the future, the \nrevenue losses will significantly increase in the outyears. The net \nrevenue loss over 5 years will be $85 billion; the net loss over 10 \nyears is projected to be $250 billion.\n  Mr. President, while President Clinton did win some less-than-\nironclad assurances that the Republican-controlled Finance and Ways and \nMeans Committees will include some of his tax cut priorities regarding \neducation tax deductions and credits and a child tax credit, the \nRepublicans insist on including sweeping, broad-based, across-the-board \ncapital gains and estate tax reductions among a host of tax cuts. These \ncuts will have a dramatically skewed distribution, providing the \ngreatest portion of their benefits to taxpayers with annual incomes \nplacing them among the top 5 percent of the Nation.\n  It is instructive to look at two proposals. Reducing capital gains \ntaxation from 28 percent to 19.6 percent will yield 85 percent of the \nbenefit to the top 5 percent of taxpayers, all with incomes exceeding \n$100,000. Reducing the estate tax by increasing the exemption from \n$600,000 to $1 million will benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent of \nhouseholds. Under current law, 98 percent of Americans who die leave \nestates wholly exempt from estate taxes. Such proposals can only be \nviewed as Republican ``welfare-for-the-rich'' at its worst.\n  Mr. President, while non-defense discretionary accounts are squeezed \nharder as we approach the magical balance to occur in 2002, and while \nmost Americans have worked hard and sacrificed for the past 5 years to \nkeep our economy booming and slash the deficit more than $200 billion \nand will be required to tighten their belts further by this resolution, \nthe richest Americans and American corporations are absolved from \ncontributing to the final push to 2002. The deal virtually ignores \ncorporate welfare--both that which exists among discretionary spending \nprograms and the far larger amount which exists in the Internal Revenue \nCode.\n  At a time when beneficiaries of spending programs--especially lower-\nincome beneficiaries--have been subjected to significant reductions in \nthose benefits they have received, corporate beneficiaries are asked to \nbear virtually none of the cost of achieving budget balance, much less \npaying for the investments in people and infrastructure that are so \nbadly needed.\n  As my distinguished friend, the eternally junior Senator from South \nCarolina, Senator Hollings, said on the floor on Tuesday evening, there \nis a scarcity of discipline in this budget and even less willingness to \ntake less-than-pleasant budget medicine now in order to experience \neconomic and budgetary order in later years. Instead, even that limited \nbudgetary reckoning the deal entails is largely postponed until the \nfinal 2 years of the deal. Because of this, the national debt will \nincrease significantly in the next several years, resulting in ever-\nhigher debt service costs which must be borne by the budget until that \ndebt is reduced.\n  I reiterate that I staunchly support balancing the Federal budget. \nBut I do not believe in balancing the budget in just any way. One \nroadmap for achieving balance is not the same as every other roadmap \nfor achieving balance. There unquestionably is a difference. Indeed, I \nhave worked on and voted for balanced budget plans over the years with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. But, I cannot vote for this one. \nIt is a Wizard of Oz budget deal--no home, no heart, no brain, and no \ncourage.\n  If this budget passes and becomes the operative structure for fiscal \ndecision making by the Congress, as I expect it may, I will work \ndiligently to do everything possible to meet the needs of America's \nchildren, and other pressing needs, within its constraints, and to \nalter those constraints where it is possible to do so.\n  But, with no joy, I will vote no on final passage, greatly \ndisappointed and saddened that the Senate has not taken the steps and \nprovided the opportunities that are so badly needed to fairly confront \nand meet our Nation's most critical needs while achieving a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is an historic occasion. This budget \noutline is the first plan Congress has produced in 28 years to balance \nthe budget.\n  I want to thank all of those who worked so hard to get us to this \npoint, including the President and Vice President, Erskine Bowles, \nFrank Raines, John Hilley and others at the White House, Senators Frank \nLautenberg, ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, House \nminority leader Dick Gephardt and John Spratt.\n  I also want to thank our partners across the aisle: Senate majority \nleader Lott, Senator Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Speaker Gingrich and Congressman John Kasich.\n  And all the staff, in both houses, the administration and including \nmy own, who have worked so diligently to complete this agreement.\n  Finally, I want to thank two former colleagues, Senators Jim Sasser \nand Harris Wofford, who were defeated for re-election in 1994--in no \nsmall part because they supported the 1993 deficit reduction plan. \nWithout that plan we would not be here today. Because of that plan, \nwe've been able to cut the budget deficit by 75 percent. In less than 5 \nyears, we've gone from a $280 billion deficit to a $67 billion deficit.\n  The U.S. economy has added more than 12.5 million new jobs, and 3 \nmillion small businesses. Our economy is now growing at a virtually \nunparalleled rate of 3.5 percent a year. Unemployment is at its lowest \nlevel in 24 years. Young people graduating from college this month are \nentering one of the best job markets in years. That's a remarkable \nrecord of progress.\n  I support this budget resolution because it builds on that progress. \nMake no mistake: This budget plan is not the culmination of the \nContract With America. It is, in some fundamental ways, a repudiation \nof that contract.\n  Where the contract targeted tax relief to those who needed it least, \nthis budget agreement targets it to those who need it most. Where the \ncontract would have left Medicare to wither on the vine, this agreement \nextends the solvency of the Medicare trust funds for a decade. Where \nthe contract represented a declaration of war, this resolution is \ninstead a declaration of principles.\n  There is a difference between a budget that slashes and burns to get \nto zero, and a budget that is truly balanced. This resolution--if we \nadhere to it--will result in a balanced budget that addresses not only \nour financial deficit, but our investment deficit as well. This budget \nplan sets aside $35 billion in education tax relief, to help working \nfamilies pay for college and job training. This plan will provide \nhealth insurance for 5 million children--half of the uninsured children \nin America. This plan extends the life of Superfund, so we can clean up \nthe environmental mistakes of our past, and it invests in environmental \nsafeguards, so we can avoid mistakes in the future. This budget keeps \nMedicare solvent for another decade--without gouging senior citizens \nwho depend on the program.\n  It is a good deal. But it is not a done deal. We still have a long \nway to go before this declaration of principles is\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\ntranslated into an actual budget--13 individual appropriations bills, \nplus a reconciliation bill.\n  We know full well, from the last Congress, how difficult these next \nsteps can be. It is my hope that we will also remember the painful \nconsequences of refusing to take those steps. As long as the \ncommitments we have received now in writing are honored, we will \nproceed in good faith toward reconciliation.\n  That does not mean, however, that we will be passive observers of \nthis process. Any attempt to undermine our agreement and skew the tax \nrelief to benefit disproportionately those who need tax relief the \nleast will be met with forceful opposition. So will any effort to \nshortchange our agreement on education tax credits and children's \nhealth insurance.\n  The time for negotiations on these priorities is over. There is more \nthan enough money, and flexibility, in this budget plan to honor these \nimportant commitments. There is also enough room in this framework to \naccommodate our proposal to help communities rebuild crumbling schools, \nand replace obsolete schools. According to the Government Accounting \nOffice, one-third of all schools--serving 14 million children--require \nextensive repair or replacement. Almost 60 percent of schools have at \nleast one major structural problem, from sagging roofs to cracked \nfoundations. About half have unhealthy environmental conditions, such \nas poor ventilation or inadequate heating. Half lack the basic \nelectrical wiring needed to connect them to the information \nsuperhighway.\n  It is wrong for us to hobble future generations with the debts of \nthis generation; that is why we are taking these steps to eliminate the \ndeficit. But it is equally wrong to deny future generations the basic \ntools they will need to make a life for themselves and their own \nfamilies. Education is the most important of those tools, and that \nincludes safe, adequate schools.\n  It is our hope that we can have a truly balanced budget on its way to \nthe President's desk before the August recess. Then we need to turn our \nattention to other concerns, including juvenile drug abuse and crime, \npension reform and, yes, campaign finance reform. Bipartisanship does \nnot come easy to this Congress.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LONG TERM ENTITLEMENT \n                   REFORMS, INCLUDING ACCURACY IN DETERMINING \n                   CHANGES IN THE COST OF LIVING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Entitlement reforms.--The Senate finds that with \n     respect to long term entitlement reforms--\n       (A) entitlement spending continues to grow dramatically as \n     a percent of total Federal spending, rising from fifty-six \n     percent of the budget in 1987 to an estimated seventy-three \n     percent of the budget in 2007;\n       (B) this growth in mandatory spending poses a long-term \n     threat to the United States economy because it crowds out \n     spending for investments in education, infrastructure, \n     defense, law enforcement and other programs that enhance \n     economic growth;\n       (C) in 1994, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and \n     Tax Reform concluded that if no changes are made to current \n     entitlement laws, all Federal revenues will be spent on \n     entitlement programs and interest on the debt by the year \n     2012;\n       (D) the Congressional Budget Office has also recently \n     issued a report that found that pressure on the budget from \n     demographics and rising health care costs will increase \n     dramatically after 2002; and\n       (E) making significant entitlement changes will \n     significantly benefit the economy, and will forestall the \n     need for more drastic tax and spending decisions in future \n     years.\n       (2) CPI.--The Senate finds that with respect to accuracy in \n     determining changes in the cost of living--\n       (A) the Final Report of the Senate Finance Committee's \n     Advisory Commission to study the CPI has concluded that the \n     Consumer Price Index overstates the cost of living in the \n     United States by 1.1 percentage points;\n       (B) the overstatement of the cost of living by the Consumer \n     Price Index has been recognized by economists since at least \n     1961, when a report noting the existence of the overstatement \n     was issued by a National Bureau of Economic Research \n     Committee, chaired by Professor George J. Stigler;\n       (C) Congress and the President, through the indexing of \n     Federal tax brackets, social security benefits, and other \n     Federal program benefits, have undertaken to protect \n     taxpayers and beneficiaries of such programs from the erosion \n     of purchasing power due to inflation; and\n       (D) the overstatement of the cost of living increases the \n     deficit and undermines the equitable administration of \n     Federal benefits and tax policies.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should continue working to \n     enact structural entitlement reforms in the 1997 budget \n     agreement and in subsequent legislation;\n       (2) Congress and the President must find the most accurate \n     measure of the change in the cost of living in the United \n     States, and should work in a bipartisan manner to implement \n     any changes that are necessary to achieve an accurate \n     measure; and\n       (3) Congress and the President must work to ensure that the \n     1997 budget agreement not only keeps the unified budget in \n     balance after 2002, but that additional measures should be \n     taken to begin to achieve substantial surpluses which will \n     improve the economy and allow our nation to be ready for the \n     retirement of the baby boom generation in the year 2012.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TACTICAL FIGHTER AIRCRAFT \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense has proposed to modernize the \n     United States tactical fighter aircraft force through three \n     tactical fighter procurement programs, including the F/A-18 \n     E/F aircraft program of the Navy, the F-22 aircraft program \n     of the Air Force, and the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft \n     program for the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps;\n       (2) the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Under \n     Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, and \n     several Members of Congress have publicly stated that, given \n     the current Department of Defense budget for procurement, the \n     Department of Defense's original plan to buy over 4,400 F/A-\n     18 E/F aircraft, F-22 aircraft, and Joint Strike Fighter \n     aircraft at a total program cost in excess of \n     $350,000,000,000 was not affordable;\n       (3) the F/A-18 E/F, F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter \n     tactical fighter programs will be competing for a limited \n     amount of procurement funding with numerous other aircraft \n     acquisition programs, including the Comanche helicopter \n     program, the V-22 Osprey aircraft program, and the C-17 \n     aircraft program, as well as for the necessary replacement of \n     other aging aircraft such as the KC-135, the C-5A, the F-117, \n     and the EA-6B aircraft; and\n       (4) the 1997 Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense \n     Review has recommended reducing the F/A-18 E/F program buy \n     from 1,000 aircraft to 548, and reducing the F-22 program buy \n     from 438 to 339.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that, within 30 \n     days, the Department of Defense should transmit to Congress \n     detailed information pertaining to the implementation of this \n     revised acquisition strategy so that the Congress can \n     adequately evaluate the extent to which the revised \n     acquisition strategy is tenable and affordable given the \n     projected spending levels contained in this budget \n     resolution.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CHILDREN'S HEALTH \n                   COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) of the estimated 10 million uninsured children in the \n     United States, over 1.3 million have at least one parent who \n     is self-employed and all other uninsured children are \n     dependents of persons who are employed by another, or \n     unemployed;\n       (2) these 1.3 million uninsured kids comprise approximately \n     22 percent of all children with self-employed parents, and \n     they are a significant 13 percent of all uninsured children;\n       (3) the remaining uninsured children are in families where \n     neither parent is self-employed and comprise 13 percent of \n     all children in families where neither parent is self-\n     employed;\n       (4) children in families with a self-employed parent are \n     therefore more likely to be uninsured than children in \n     families where neither parent is self-employed; and\n       (5) the current disparity in the tax law reduces the \n     affordability of health insurance for the self-employed and \n     their families, hindering the ability of children to receive \n     essential primary and preventive care services.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that from \n     resources available in this budget resolution, a portion \n     should be set aside for an immediate 100 percent \n     deductibility of health insurance costs for the self-\n     employed. Full-deductibility of health expenses for the self-\n     employed would make health insurance more attractive and \n     affordable, resulting in more dependents being covered. The \n     government should not encourage parents to forgo private \n     insurance for a government-run program.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON A MEDICAID PER CAPITA CAP.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in order to meet deficit \n     reduction targets in this resolution with respect to \n     medicaid--\n       (1) the per capita cap will not be used as a method for \n     meeting spending targets; and\n       (2) the per capita cap represents a significant structural \n     change that could jeopardize the quality of care for \n     children, the disabled, and senior citizens.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ADDED SAVINGS GO TO \n                   DEFICIT REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) balancing the budget will bring numerous economic \n     benefits for the United States economy and American workers \n     and families, including improved economic growth and lower \n     interest rates;\n       (2) the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution crafted pursuant \n     to an agreement reached between the Congress and the \n     Administration purports to achieve balance in the year 2002;\n       (3) the deficit estimates contained in this resolution may \n     not conform to the actual deficits in subsequent years, which \n     make it imperative that any additional savings are realized \n     be devoted to deficit reduction;\n       (4) the Senate's ``pay-as-you-go'' point of order prohibits \n     crediting savings from updated economic or technical data as \n     an offset for legislation that increases the deficit, and \n     ensures these savings are devoted to deficit reduction; and\n       (5) Congress and the Administration must ensure that the \n     deficit levels contained in this budget are met and, if \n     actual deficits prove to be lower than projected, the \n     additional savings are used to balance the budget on or \n     before the year 2002.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) legislation enacted pursuant to this resolution must \n     ensure that the goal of a balanced budget is achieved on or \n     before fiscal year 2002; and\n       (2) if the actual deficit is lower than the projected \n     deficit in any upcoming fiscal year, the added savings should \n     be devoted to further deficit reduction.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FAIRNESS IN MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Trustees of the Medicare Trust Funds recently \n     announced that medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund \n     is headed for bankruptcy in 2001, and in 1997, HI will run a \n     deficit of $26,000,000,000 and add $56,000,000,000 annually \n     to the Federal deficit by 2001;\n       (2) the Trustees also project that Supplementary Medical \n     Insurance (SMI), will grow\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\n     twice as fast as the economy and the taxpayers' subsidy to \n     keep the SMI from bankruptcy will grow from $58,000,000,000 \n     to $89,000,000,000 annually from 1997 through 2001;\n       (3) the Congressional Budget Office reports that when the \n     baby-boom generation begins to receive social security \n     benefits and is eligible for medicare in 2008, the Federal \n     budget will face intense pressure, resulting in mounting \n     deficits and erosion of future economic growth;\n       (4) long-term solutions to address the financial and \n     demographic problems of medicare are urgently needed to \n     preserve and protect the medicare trust funds;\n       (5) these solutions to address the financial and \n     demographic problems of medicare are urgently needed to \n     preserve and protect the medicare trust funds;\n       (6) reform of the medicare program should ensure equity and \n     fairness for all medicare beneficiaries, and offer \n     beneficiaries more choice of private health plans, to promote \n     efficiency and enhance the quality of health care;\n       (7) all Americans pay the same payroll tax of 2.9 percent \n     to the medicare trust funds, and they deserve the same \n     choices and services regardless of where they retire;\n       (8) however, under the currently adjusted-average-per-\n     capita cost (AAPCC), some counties receive 2.5 times more in \n     medicare reimbursements than others;\n       (9) this inequity in medicare reimbursement jeopardizes the \n     quality of medicare services of rural beneficiaries and \n     penalizes the most efficient and effective medicare service \n     providers;\n       (10) in some states, the result has been the absence of \n     health care choices beyond traditional, fee-for-service \n     medicine for medicare beneficiaries, which in other counties \n     and states plan providers may be significantly over-\n     compensated, adding to medicare's fiscal instability; and\n       (11) ending the practice of basing payments to risk \n     contract plans on local fee-for-service medical costs will \n     help correct these inequities, mitigate unnecessary cost in \n     the program, and begin the serious, long-term restructuring \n     of medicare.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the \n     Finance Committee should strongly consider the following \n     elements for medicare reform--\n       (1) any medicare reform package should include measures to \n     address the inequity in medicare reimbursement to risk \n     contract plans;\n       (2) medicare should use a national update framework rather \n     than local fee-for-service spending increases to determine \n     the annual changes in risk plan payment rates;\n       (3) an adequate minimum payment rate should be provided for \n     health plans participating in medicare risk contract \n     programs;\n       (4) the geographic variation in medicare payment rates must \n     be reduced over time to raise the lower payment areas closer \n     to the average while taking into account actual differences \n     in input costs that exist from region to regional;\n       (5) medicare managers in consultation with plan providers \n     and patient advocates should pursue competitive bidding \n     programs in communities where data indicate risk contract \n     payments are substantially excessive and when plan choices \n     would not diminish by such a bidding process; and\n       (6) medicare should phase in the use of risk adjusters \n     which take account of health status so as to address \n     overpayment to some plans.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE TO \n                   LITHUANIA AND LATVIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Lithuania and Latvia reestablished democracy and free \n     market economies when they regained their freedom from the \n     Soviet Union;\n       (2) Lithuania and Latvia, which have made significant \n     progress since regaining their freedom, are still struggling \n     to recover from the devastation of 50 years of communist \n     domination;\n       (3) the United States, which never recognized the illegal \n     incorporation of Lithuania and Latvia into the Soviet Union, \n     has provided assistance to strengthen democratic institutions \n     and free market reforms in Lithuania and Latvia since 1991;\n       (4) the people of the United States enjoy close and \n     friendly relations with the people of Lithuania and Latvia;\n       (5) the success of democracy and free market reform in \n     Lithuania and Latvia is important to the security and \n     economic progress of the United States; and\n       (6) the United States as well as Lithuania and Latvia would \n     benefit from the continuation of assistance which helps \n     Lithuania and Latvia to implement commercial and trade law \n     reform, sustain private sector development, and establish \n     well-trained judiciaries.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) adequate assistance should be provided to Lithuania and \n     Latvia in fiscal year 1998 to continue the progress they have \n     made; and\n       (2) assistance to Lithuania and Latvia should be continued \n     beyond fiscal year 1998 as they continue to build democratic \n     and free market institutions.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A NATIONAL COMMISSION \n                   ON HIGHER EDUCATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assure that a national commission should be \n     established to study and make specific recommendations \n     regarding the extent to which increases in student financial \n     aid, and the extent to which Federal, State, and local laws \n     and regulations, contribute to increases in college and \n     university tuition.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LOCKBOX.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that to ensure all savings from medicare \n     reform are used to keep the medicare program solvent, the \n     Treasury Secretary should credit the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund (Part A) with government securities \n     equal to any savings from Medicare Supplemental Medical \n     Insurance (Part B) reforms enacted pursuant to the \n     reconciliation instructions contained in this budget \n     resolution.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE EARNED INCOME CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) an April 1997 study by the Internal Revenue Service of \n     Earned Income Credit (EIC) filers for tax year 1994 revealed \n     that over $4,000,000,000 of the $17,000,000,000 spent on the \n     EIC for that year was erroneously claimed and paid by the \n     IRS, resulting in a fraud and error rate of 25.8 percent;\n       (2) the IRS study further concluded that EIC reforms \n     enacted by the One Hundred Fourth Congress will only lower \n     the fraud error rate to 20.7 percent, meaning over \n     $23,000,000,000 will be wasted over the next five years; and\n       (3) the President's recent proposals to combat EIC fraud \n     and error contained within this budget resolution are \n     estimated to save $124,000,000 in scoreable savings over the \n     next five years and additional savings from deterrent \n     effects.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the \n     President should propose and Congress should enact additional \n     programmatic changes sufficient to ensure that the primary \n     purpose of the EIC to encourage work over welfare is achieved \n     without wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on fraud and \n     error.\n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REPAYMENT OF THE FEDERAL \n                   DEBT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Congress and the President have a basic moral and \n     ethical responsibility to future generations to repay the \n     Federal debt, including money borrowed from the Social \n     Security Trust Fund;\n       (2) the Congress and the President should enact a law that \n     creates a regimen for paying off the Federal debt within 30 \n     years; and\n       (3) if spending growth were held to a level one percentage \n     point lower than projected growth in revenues, then the \n     Federal debt could be repaid within 30 years.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the President's annual budget submission to Congress \n     should include a plan for repayment of the Federal debt \n     beyond the year 2002, including the money borrowed from the \n     Social Security Trust Fund; and\n       (2) the plan should specifically explain how the President \n     would cap spending growth at a level one percentage point \n     lower than projected growth in revenues.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING LONG-TERM \n                   ENTITLEMENT REFORMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the resolution assumes \n     the following--\n       (1) entitlement spending has risen dramatically over the \n     last thirty-five years;\n       (2) in 1963, mandatory spending (i.e., entitlement spending \n     and interest on the debt) made up 29.6 percent of the budget, \n     this figure rose to 61.4 percent by 1993 and is expected to \n     reach 70 percent shortly after the year 2000;\n       (3) this mandatory spending is crowding out spending for \n     the traditional ``discretionary'' functions of Government \n     like clean air and water, a strong national defense, parks \n     and recreation, education, our transportation system, law \n     enforcement, research and development and other \n     infrastructure spending;\n       (4) taking significant steps sooner rather than later to \n     reform entitlement spending will not only boost economic \n     growth in this country, it will also prevent the need for \n     drastic tax and spending decisions in the next century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution assume that \n     Congress and the President should work to enact structural \n     reforms in entitlement spending in 1997 and beyond which \n     sufficiently restrain the growth of mandatory spending in \n     order to keep the budget in balance over the long term, \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare Trust \n     Funds, avoid crowding out funding for basic Government \n     functions and that every effort should be made to hold \n     mandatory spending to no more than 70 percent of the budget.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) emergency spending adds to the deficit and total \n     spending;\n       (2) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 exempts emergency \n     spending from the discretionary spending caps and pay-go \n     requirements;\n       (3) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 expires in 1998 and \n     needs to be extended;\n       (4) since the enactment of the Budget Enforcement Act, \n     Congress and the President have approved an average of \n     $5,800,000,000 per year in emergency spending;\n       (5) a natural disaster in any particular State is \n     unpredictable, by the United States is likely to experience a \n     natural disaster almost every year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assume that the Congress should \n     consider in the extension of the Budget Enforcement Act and \n     in appropriations Acts--\n       (1) provisions that budget for emergencies or that require \n     emergency spending to be offset;\n       (2) provisions that provide flexibility to meet emergency \n     funding requirements associated with natural disasters;\n       (3) Congress and the President should consider \n     appropriating at least $5,000,000,000 every year within \n     discretionary limits to provide natural disaster relief;\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\n       (4) Congress and the President should not designate any \n     emergency spending for natural disaster relief until such \n     amounts provided in regular appropriations are exhausted.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ENFORCEMENT OF BIPARTISAN \n                   BUDGET AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the bipartisan budget agreement is contingent upon--\n       (A) favorable economic conditions for the next 5 years; and\n       (B) accurate estimates of the fiscal impacts of assumptions \n     in this resolution; and\n       (C) enactment of legislation to reduce the deficit;\n       (2) if either of the conditions in paragraph (1) are not \n     met, our ability to achieve a balanced budget by 2002 will be \n     jeopardized.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals and limits in this resolution \n     assume that--\n       (1) reconciliation legislation should include legislation \n     to enforce the targets set forth in the budget process \n     description included in the agreement and to ensure the \n     balanced budget goal is met; and\n       (2) such legislation shall--\n       (A) establish procedures to ensure those targets are met \n     every year;\n       (B) require that the President's annual budget and annual \n     Congressional concurrent resolutions on the budget comply \n     with those targets every year;\n       (C) consider provisions which provide that if the deficit \n     is below or the surplus is above the deficits projected in \n     the agreement in any year, such savings are locked in for \n     deficit and debt reduction; and\n       (D) consider provisions which include a provision to budget \n     for and control emergency spending in order to prevent the \n     use of emergencies to evade the budget targets.\n\n     SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) heart disease was the leading cause of death for both \n     men and women in every year from 1970 to 1993;\n       (2) mortality rates for individuals suffering from prostate \n     cancer, skin cancer, and kidney cancer continue to rise;\n       (3) the mortality rate for African American women suffering \n     from diabetes is 134 percent higher than the mortality rate \n     of Caucasian women suffering from diabetes;\n       (4) asthma rates for children increased 58 percent from \n     1982 to 1992;\n       (5) nearly half of all American women between the ages of \n     65 and 75 reported having arthritis;\n       (6) AIDS is the leading cause of death for Americans \n     between the ages of 24 and 44;\n       (7) the Institute of Medicine has described United States \n     clinical research to be ``in a state of crisis'' and the \n     National Academy of Sciences concluded in 1994 that ``the \n     present cohort of clinical investigators is not adequate'';\n       (8) biomedical research has been shown to be effective in \n     saving lives and reducing health care expenditures;\n       (9) research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n     has contributed significantly to the first overall reduction \n     in cancer death rates since recordkeeping was instituted;\n       (10) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has resulted in the identification of genetic \n     mutations for osteoporosis; Lou Gehrig's Disease, cystic \n     fibrosis, and Huntington's Disease; breast, skin and prostate \n     cancer; and a variety of other illnesses;\n       (11) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has been key to the development of Magnetic Resonance \n     Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning \n     technologies;\n       (12) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has developed effective treatments for Acute \n     Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Today, 80 percent of children \n     diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia are alive and \n     free of the disease after 5 years; and\n       (13) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health contributed to the development of a new, cost-saving \n     cure for peptic ulcers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this Resolution assumes that--\n       (1) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years; and\n       (2) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by $2,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1998 \n     over the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1997.\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CERTAIN ELDERLY LEGAL \n                   ALIENS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Committee on Finance will include in its \n     recommendations to the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     changes in laws within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Finance that allow certain elderly, legal immigrants who will \n     cease to receive benefits under the supplemental security \n     income program as a result of the Personal Responsibility and \n     Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-\n     193; 110 Stat. 2105) to continue to receive benefits during a \n     redetermination or reapplication period to determine if such \n     aliens would qualify for such benefits on the basis of being \n     disabled; and\n       (2) the Committee on Finance in developing these \n     recommendations should offset the additional cost of this \n     proposal out of other programs within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n     SEC. 317. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING RETROACTIVE TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in general, the practice of increasing a tax \n     retroactively is fundamentally unfair to taxpayers; and\n       (2) retroactive taxation is disruptive to families and \n     small business in their ability to plan and budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) except for closing tax loopholes, no revenues should be \n     generated from any retroactively increased tax; and\n       (2) the Congress and the President should work together to \n     ensure that any revenue generating proposal contained within \n     reconciliation legislation pursuant to this concurrent \n     resolution proposal, except those proposals closing tax \n     loopholes, should take effect prospectively.\n\n     SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND \n                   BALANCING THE BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) this budget resolution is projected to balance the \n     unified budget of the United States in fiscal year 2002;\n       (2) section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 \n     requires that the deficit be computed without counting the \n     annual surpluses of the Social Security Trust Funds; and\n       (3) if the deficit were calculated according to the \n     requirements of section 13301, this budget resolution would \n     be projected to result in a deficit of $108,700,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2002.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this budget resolution assume \n     that after balancing the unified Federal budget, the Congress \n     should continue efforts to reduce the on-budget deficit, so \n     that the Federal budget will be balanced without counting \n     social security surpluses.\n\n     SEC. 319. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING SUFFICIENT FUNDING \n                   FOR VETERANS PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) veterans and their families represent approximately 27 \n     percent of the United States population;\n       (2) more than 20 million of our 26 million living veterans \n     served during wartime, sacrificing their freedom so that we \n     may have ours; and\n       (3) veterans have earned the benefits promised to them.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the assumptions underlying this Budget Resolution \n     assume that the 602(b) allocation to the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs will be sufficient in fiscal year 1998 to \n     fully fund all discretionary veterans programs, including \n     medical care; and\n       (2) funds collected from legislation to improve the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs' ability to collect and retain \n     reimbursement from third-party payers ought to be used to \n     supplement, not supplant, an adequate appropriation for \n     medical care.\n\n     SEC. 320. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FAMILY VIOLENCE OPTION \n                   CLARIFYING AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Domestic violence is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1,000,000 violent crimes against women are committed by \n     intimate partners annually.\n       (2) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that \\1/4\\ of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over \\1/2\\ of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (3) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending these programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n       (4) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, Illinois, document, for the \n     first time, the interrelationship between domestic violence \n     and welfare by showing that from 34 percent to 65 percent of \n     AFDC recipients are current or past victims of domestic \n     violence.\n       (5) Over \\1/2\\ of the women surveyed stayed with their \n     batterers because they lacked the resources to support \n     themselves and their children. The surveys also found that \n     the availability of economic support is a critical factor in \n     poor women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten them and their children.\n       (6) The restructuring of the welfare programs may impact \n     the availability of the economic support and the safety net \n     necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse without risking \n     homelessness and starvation for their families.\n       (7) In recognition of this finding, the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate in considering the 1997 Resolution on \n     the budget of the United States unanimously adopted a sense \n     of the Congress amendment concerning domestic violence and \n     Federal assistance. Subsequently, Congress adopted the family \n     violence option amendment as part of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996.\n       (8) The family violence option gives States the flexibility \n     to grant temporary waivers from time limits and work \n     requirements for domestic violence victims who would suffer \n     extreme hardship from the application of these provisions. \n     These waivers were not intended to be included as part of the \n     permanent 20 percent hardship exemption.\n       (9) The Department of Health and Human Services has been \n     slow to issue regulations regarding this provision. As a \n     result, States are hesitant to fully implement the family \n     violence option fearing that it will interfere with the 20 \n     percent hardship exemption.\n       (10) Currently 15 States have opted to include the family \n     violence option in their welfare plans, and 13 other States \n     have included some type of domestic violence provisions in \n     their plans.\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the provisions of this Resolution assume that--\n       (1) States should not be subject to any numerical limits in \n     granting domestic violence good cause waivers under section \n     402(a)(7)(A)(iii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(A)(iii)) to individuals receiving assistance, for \n     all requirements where compliance with such requirements \n     would make it more difficult for individuals receiving \n     assistance to escape domestic violence; and\n       (2) any individual who is granted a domestic violence good \n     cause waiver by a State shall not be included in the States' \n     20 percent hardship exemption under section 408(a)(7) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 608(a)(7)).\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX CUTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget assumes that--\n       (1) a substantial majority of the tax cut benefits provided \n     in the tax reconciliation bill will go to middle class \n     working families earning less than approximately $100,000 per \n     year; and\n       (2) the tax cuts in the tax reconciliation bill will not \n     cause revenue losses to increase significantly in years after \n     2007.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE TO AMTRAK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Amtrak is in a financial crisis, with growing and \n     substantial debt obligations approaching $2,000,000,000;\n       (2) Amtrak has not been authorized since 1994;\n       (3) the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation favorably reported legislation to reform \n     Amtrak during the last two Congresses, but no legislation was \n     enacted;\n       (4) the Finance Committee favorably reported legislation in \n     the last Congress that created a dedicated trust fund for \n     Amtrak, but no legislation was enacted;\n       (5) in 1997 Amtrak testified before the Congress that it \n     cannot survive beyond 1998 without comprehensive legislative \n     reforms and a dedicated source of capital funding; and\n       (6) Congress is obligated to invest Federal tax dollars \n     responsibly and to reduce waste and inefficiency in Federal \n     programs, including Amtrak.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that:\n       (1) Legislative reform is urgently needed to address \n     Amtrak's financial and operational problems.\n       (2) It is fiscally irresponsible for Congress to allocate \n     additional Federal dollars to Amtrak, and to distribute money \n     from a new trust fund, without providing reforms requested by \n     Amtrak to address its precarious financial situation.\n       (3) The distribution of money from any new fund to finance \n     an intercity rail passenger fund should be implemented in \n     conjunction with legislation to reauthorize and reform the \n     National Rail Passenger Corporation.\n\n     SEC. 323. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF \n                   CHILDREN'S HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's children and the next generation of children \n     are the prime beneficiaries of a balanced Federal budget. \n     Without a balanced budget, today's children will bear the \n     increasing burden of the Federal debt. Continued deficit \n     spending would doom future generations to slower economic \n     growth, higher taxes, and lower living standards.\n       (2) The health of children is essential to the future \n     economic and social well-being of the Nation.\n       (3) The medicaid program provides health coverage for over \n     17,000,000 children, or 1 out of every 4 children.\n       (4) While children represent \\1/2\\ of all individuals \n     eligible for medicaid, children account for less than 25 \n     percent of expenditures under the medicaid program.\n       (5) Disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding under the \n     medicaid program has allowed States to provide health care \n     services to thousands of uninsured pregnant women and \n     children. DSH funding under the medicaid program is critical \n     for these populations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the health \n     care needs of low-income pregnant women and children should \n     be a top priority. Careful study must be made of the impact \n     of medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) reform \n     proposals on children's health and on vital sources of care, \n     including children's hospitals. Any restrictions on DSH \n     funding under the medicaid program should not harm State \n     medicaid coverage of children and pregnant women.\n\n     SEC. 324. DEPOSIT OF ALL FEDERAL GASOLINE TAXES INTO THE \n                   HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1956, Federal gasoline excise tax revenues have \n     generally been deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and \n     reserved for transportation uses.\n       (2) In 1993, Congress and the President enacted the first \n     permanent increase in the Federal gasoline excise tax which \n     was dedicated to general revenues, not the Highway Trust \n     Fund.\n       (3) Over the next five years, approximately $7,000,000,000 \n     per year in Federal gasoline excise tax revenues will be \n     deposited in the general fund of the Treasury, rather than \n     the Highway Trust Fund.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions in this resolution assume that Congress \n     should in the extension of the Budget Enforcement Act, ISTEA \n     reauthorization, appropriations Acts, and in any revenue \n     bills, that all revenues from Federal gasoline excise taxes, \n     including amounts dedicated to general revenues in 1993, \n     should be dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund so that such \n     taxes may be used for the purpose to which they have \n     historically been dedicated, promoting transportation \n     infrastructure and building roads.\n\n     SEC. 325. SENSE OF THE SENATE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Scientific research on the development of the brain has \n     confirmed that the early childhood years, particularly from \n     birth to the age of 3, are critical to children's \n     development.\n       (2) Studies repeatedly have shown that good quality child \n     care helps children develop well, enter school ready to \n     succeed, improve their skills, cognitive abilities and \n     socioemotional development, improve classroom learning \n     behavior, and stay safe while their parents work. Further, \n     quality early childhood programs can positively affect \n     children's long-term success in school achievement, higher \n     earnings as adults, decrease reliance on public assistance \n     and decrease involvement with the criminal justice system.\n       (3) The first of the National Education Goals, endorsed by \n     the Nation's governors, passed by Congress and signed into \n     law by President Bush, stated that by the year 2000, every \n     child should enter school ready to learn and that access to a \n     high quality early childhood education program was integral \n     to meeting this goal.\n       (4) According to data compiled by the RAND Corporation, \n     while 90 percent of human brain growth occurs by the age of \n     3, public spending on children in that age range equals only \n     8 percent of spending on all children. A vast majority of \n     public spending on children occurs after the brain has gone \n     through its most dramatic changes, often to correct problems \n     that should have been addressed during early childhood \n     development.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, of \n     $29,400,000,000 in current estimated education expenditures, \n     only $1,500,000,000, or 5 percent, is spent on children from \n     birth to age 5. The vast majority is spent on children over \n     age 5.\n       (6) A new commitment to quality child care and early \n     childhood education is a necessary response to the fact that \n     children from birth to the age of 3 are spending more time in \n     care away from their homes. Almost 60 percent of women in the \n     workforce have children under the age of 3 requiring care.\n       (7) Many States and communities are currently experimenting \n     with innovative programs directed at early childhood care and \n     education in a variety of care settings, including the home. \n     States and local communities are best able to deliver \n     efficient, cost-effective services, but while such programs \n     are long on demand, they are short on resources. Additional \n     Federal resources should not create new bureaucracy, but \n     build on successful locally driven efforts.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budget totals and levels in this resolution assume \n     that funds ought to be directed toward increasing the supply \n     of quality child care, early childhood education, and teacher \n     and parent training for children from birth through age 3.\n\n     SEC. 326. HIGHWAY TRUST FUND NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR \n                   DEFICIT PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that the Congress \n     should consider legislation to exclude the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Highway Trust Fund from the totals of \n     the Budget of the United States Government.\n\n     SEC. 327. AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND NOT TAKEN INTO \n                   ACCOUNT FOR DEFICIT PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the budget resolution that the Congress should \n     consider legislation to exclude the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund from the \n     totals of the Budget of the United States Government.\n\n     SEC. 328. MILITARY RETIREMENT TRUST FUNDS NOT TAKEN INTO \n                   ACCOUNT FOR DEFICIT PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that the Congress \n     should consider legislation to exclude the receipts and \n     disbursements of the retirement and disability trust funds \n     for members of the Armed Forces of the United States from the \n     totals of the Budget of the United States Government.\n\n     SEC. 329. CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT TRUST FUNDS NOT TAKEN INTO \n                   ACCOUNT FOR DEFICIT PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that the Congress \n     should consider legislation to exclude the receipts and \n     disbursements of the retirement and disability trust funds \n     for civilian employees of the United States from the totals \n     of the Budget of the United States Government.\n\n     SEC. 330. UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION TRUST FUND NOT TAKEN INTO \n                   ACCOUNT FOR DEFICIT PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that the Congress \n     should consider legislation to exclude the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Unemployment Compensation Trust \n     Fund from the totals of the Budget of the United States \n     Government.\n\n     SEC. 331. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there is no direct linkage between the fuel taxes \n     deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and the transportation \n     spending from the Highway Trust Fund;\n       (2) the Federal budget process has severed this linkage by \n     dividing revenues and spending into separate budget \n     categories with--\n       (A) fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust Fund as \n     revenues; and\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\n       (B) most spending from the Highway Trust Fund in the \n     discretionary category;\n       (3) each budget category referred to in paragraph (2) has \n     its own rules and procedures; and\n       (4) under budget rules in effect prior to the date of \n     adoption of this resolution, an increase in fuel taxes \n     permits increased spending to be included in the budget, but \n     not for increased Highway Trust Fund spending.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) in this session of Congress, Congress should, within a \n     unified budget, change the Federal budget process to \n     establish a linkage between the fuel taxes deposited in the \n     Highway Trust Fund, including any fuel tax increases that may \n     be enacted into law after the date of adoption of this \n     resolution, and the spending from the Highway Trust Fund; and\n       (2) changes to the budgetary treatment of the Highway Trust \n     Fund should not result in total program levels for highways \n     or mass transit that is inconsistent with those assumed under \n     the resolution.\n\n     SEC. 332. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING TAX INCENTIVES FOR \n                   THE COST OF POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that any revenue reconciliation bill should \n     include tax incentives for the cost of post-secondary \n     education, including expenses of workforce education and \n     training at vocational schools and community colleges.\n\n     SEC. 333. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ADDITIONAL TAX CUTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in this \n     resolution shall be construed as prohibiting Congress in \n     future years from providing additional tax relief if the cost \n     of such tax relief is offset by reductions in discretionary \n     or mandatory spending, or increases in revenue from \n     alternative sources.\n\n     SEC. 334. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRUTH IN BUDGETING \n                   AND SPECTRUM AUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the electromagnetic spectrum is the property of the \n     American people and is managed on their behalf by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (2) the spectrum is a highly valuable and limited natural \n     resource;\n       (3) the auctioning of spectrum has raised billions of \n     dollars for the Treasury;\n       (4) the estimates made regarding the value of spectrum in \n     the past have proven unreliable, having previously \n     understated and now overstating its worth;\n       (5) because estimates of spectrum value depend on a number \n     of technological, economic, market forces, and other \n     variables that cannot be predicted or completely controlled, \n     it is not possible to reliably estimate the value of a given \n     segment of spectrum; therefore,\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Senate that as auctions occur as \n     assumed by this Resolution, the Congress shall take such \n     steps as necessary to reconcile the difference between actual \n     revenues raised and estimates made and shall reduce spending \n     accordingly if such auctions raise less revenue than \n     projected.\n\n     SEC. 335. HIGHWAY DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 10 demonstration projects totaling $362,000,000 were \n     listed for special line-item funding in the Surface \n     Transportation Assistance Act of 1982;\n       (2) 152 demonstration projects totaling $1,400,000,000 were \n     named in the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation \n     Assistance Act of 1987;\n       (3) 64 percent of the funding for the 152 projects had not \n     been obligated after 5 years and State transportation \n     officials determined the projects added little, if any, to \n     meeting their transportation infrastructure priorities;\n       (4) 538 location specific projects totaling $6,230,000,000 \n     were included in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991;\n       (5) more than $3,300,000,000 of the funds authorized for \n     the 538 location-specific projects remained unobligated as of \n     January 31, 1997;\n       (6) the General Accounting Office determined that 31 States \n     plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico would have \n     received more funding if the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act location-specific project funds \n     were redistributed as Federal-aid highway program \n     apportionments;\n       (7) this type of project funding diverts Highway Trust Fund \n     money away from State transportation priorities established \n     under the formula allocation process and under the Intermodal \n     Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act of 1991;\n       (8) on June 20, 1995, by a vote of 75 yeas to 21 nays, the \n     Senate voted to prohibit the use of Federal Highway Trust \n     Fund money for future demonstration projects;\n       (9) the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 expires at the end of fiscal year 1997; and\n       (10) hundreds of funding requests for specific \n     transportation projects in Congressional Districts have been \n     submitted in the House of Representatives.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) notwithstanding different views on existing Highway \n     Trust Fund distribution formulas, funding for demonstration \n     projects or other similarly titled projects diverts Highway \n     Trust Fund money away from State priorities and deprives \n     States of the ability to adequately address their \n     transportation needs;\n       (2) States are best able to determine the priorities for \n     allocating Federal-Aid-To-Highway monies within their \n     jurisdiction;\n       (3) Congress should not divert limited Highway Trust Fund \n     resources away from State transportation priorities by \n     authorizing new highway projects; and\n       (4) Congress should not authorize any new demonstration \n     projects or other similarly-titled projects.\n\n     SEC. 336. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE USE OF BUDGET \n                   SAVINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since our Nation began to keep poverty statistics, due in \n     large part to the social security system and the medicare \n     program.\n       (2) Twenty-two percent of every dollar spent by the Federal \n     Government goes to the social security system.\n       (3) Eleven percent of every dollar spent by the Federal \n     Government goes to the medicare program.\n       (4) Currently, spending on the elderly accounts for \\1/3\\ \n     of the Federal budget and more than \\1/2\\ of all domestic \n     spending other than interest on the national debt.\n       (5) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the social security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (6) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee \n     for the social security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (7) The accumulated balance in the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund is estimated to fall to zero by 2001.\n       (8) While the Federal budget deficit has shrunk for the \n     fourth straight year to $67,000,000,000 in 1997, measures \n     need to be taken to ensure that that trend continues.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that budget \n     savings in the mandatory spending area should be used--\n       (1) to protect and enhance the retirement security of the \n     American people by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     social security system;\n       (2) to protect and enhance the health care security of \n     senior citizens by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); and\n       (3) to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline to \n     ensure that the level of private investment necessary for \n     long-term economic growth and prosperity is available.\n\n     SEC. 337. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE VALUE OF THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM FOR FUTURE RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The social security system has allowed a generation of \n     Americans to retire with dignity. Today, 13 percent of the \n     population is 65 or older and by 2030, 20 percent of the \n     population will be 65 or older. More than \\1/2\\ of the \n     elderly do not receive private pensions and more than \\1/3\\ \n     have no income from assets.\n       (2) For 60 percent of all senior citizens, social security \n     benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement \n     income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, social \n     security benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement \n     income.\n       (3) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since the United States began to keep poverty statistics, due \n     in large part to the social security system.\n       (4) Seventy-eight percent of Americans pay more in payroll \n     taxes than they do in income taxes.\n       (5) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee \n     for the social security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (6) The average American retiring in the year 2015 will pay \n     $250,000 in payroll taxes over the course of his or her \n     working career.\n       (7) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the social security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that no change \n     in the social security system should be made that would \n     reduce the value of the social security system for future \n     generations of retirees.\n\n     SEC. 338. SENSE OF SENATE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH DIVIDEND \n                   PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that with respect to the \n     revenue levels established under this resolution:\n       (1) According to the President's own economists, the tax \n     burden on Americans is the highest ever at 31.7 percent.\n       (2) According to the National Taxpayers Union, the average \n     American family now pays almost 40 percent of their income in \n     State, local, and Federal taxes.\n       (3) Between 1978 and 1985, while the top marginal rate on \n     capital gains was cut almost in half--from 35 to 20 percent--\n     total annual Federal receipts from the tax almost tripled \n     from $9,100,000,000 annually to $26,500,000,000 annually.\n       (4) Conversely, when Congress raised the rate in 1986, \n     revenues actually fell well below what was anticipated.\n       (5) Economists across-the-board predict that cutting the \n     capital gains rate will result in a revenue windfall for the \n     Treasury.\n       (6) While a USA Today poll from this March found 70 percent \n     of the American people believe that they need a tax cut, \n     under this resolution Federal spending will grow 17 percent \n     over five years while the net tax cuts are less than 1 \n     percent of the total tax burden.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     with respect to the revenue levels established under this \n     resolution, to the extent that actual revenues exceed the \n     revenues projected under this resolution due to higher than\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\n     anticipated economic growth, that revenue windfall should be \n     reserved exclusively for additional tax cuts and/or deficit \n     reduction.\n\n     SEC. 339. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, revenue and spending \n     aggregates may be changed and allocations may be revised for \n     legislation that provides funding for early childhood \n     development programs for children ages zero to six provided \n     that the legislation which changes revenues or changes \n     spending will not increase the deficit for--\n       (1) fiscal year 1998;\n       (2) the period of fiscal years 1998 through 2002; or\n       (3) the period of fiscal years 2002 through 2007.\n       (b) Revised Allocations.--\n       (1) Adjustments for legislation.--Upon the consideration of \n     legislation pursuant to subsection (a), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the \n     Senate appropriately revised allocations under sections \n     302(a) and 602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and \n     revised functional levels and aggregates to carry out this \n     section. These revised allocations, functional levels, and \n     aggregates shall be considered for the purposes of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as allocations, functional \n     levels and aggregates contained in this resolution.\n       (2) Adjustments for amendments.--If the chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget submits an adjustment under this \n     section for legislation in furtherance of the purpose \n     described in subsection (a) upon the offering of an amendment \n     to that legislation that would necessitate such a submission, \n     the chairman shall submit to the Senate appropriately revised \n     allocations under sections 302(a) and 602(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and revised functional \n     levels and aggregates to carry out this section. These \n     revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall \n     be considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 as allocations, functional levels and aggregates \n     contained in this resolution.\n       (c) Reporting Revised Allocations.--The appropriate \n     committee shall report appropriately revised allocations \n     pursuant to sections 302(b) and 602(b) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 340. SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Our Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security, and with the support of Federal \n     assistance, State and local law enforcement officers have \n     succeeded in reducing the national scourge of violent crime, \n     as illustrated by a murder rate in 1996 that is projected to \n     be the lowest since 1971 and a violent crime total in 1996 \n     that is the lowest since 1990.\n       (2) Through a comprehensive effort to attack violence \n     against women mounted by State and local law enforcement, and \n     dedicated volunteers and professionals who provide victim \n     services, shelter, counseling, and advocacy to battered women \n     and their children, important strides have been made against \n     the national scourge of violence against women, illustrated \n     by the decline in the murder rate for wives, ex-wives, and \n     girlfriends at the hands of their ``intimates'' fell to a 19-\n     year low in 1995.\n       (3) Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts need \n     continued financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     for funding and financial assistance to continue their \n     efforts to combat violent crime and violence against women.\n       (4) Federal, State and local law enforcement also face \n     other challenges which require continued financial commitment \n     from the Federal Government, including regaining control over \n     the Southwest Border, where drug trafficking and illegal \n     immigration continue to threaten public safety and menace \n     residents on the border and throughout the Nation.\n       (5) The Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund established in \n     section 310001 the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \n     Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14211) fully funds the Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, including the \n     Violence Against Women Act, without adding to the Federal \n     budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the functional totals underlying this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Federal Government's commitment to fund Federal law \n     enforcement programs and programs to assist State and local \n     efforts to combat violent crime, including violence against \n     women, will be maintained; and\n       (2) funding for the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund will \n     continue in its current form at least through fiscal year \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 341. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN \n                   PREVENTION OF DRUG USE BY CHILDREN.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that, from resources available in this \n     budget resolution, a portion should be set aside for a \n     national grassroots volunteer effort to encourage parental \n     education and involvement in youth drug prevention and to \n     create a drug-intolerant culture for our children.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe concurrent resolution was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  [Applause.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment, requests a conference with the House and is \nauthorized to appoint conferees.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a couple unanimous consent requests \nthat I think Members will be very interested in. First, let me take a \nmoment to comment on the cooperation and the significance of that vote.\n  It truly was a bipartisan effort. It was cooperation between the \nCongress and the President. I think we should be proud of it, and it is \nan example of what I hope we can do more of in the future.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his efforts, his willingness to be \non the floor and work with us on some of these votes. We had a couple \nof bumpy spots along the way, but I think the result was a good one.\n  I particularly thank the chairman of the committee. I know he feels a \nrush of emotion right now. He has been working on trying to get us to \nthis type of budget resolution for 25 years. I think he has done a \ngreat job. I commend him and thank him for the great work he has done.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  Mr. LOTT. Also, the Senator from New Jersey stood right there with \nhim. They worked together. He kept his word, and we got a tremendous \nresult here of 78 to 22, overwhelming. Without that type of cooperation \nacross the aisle from the Budget Committee, it could not have been \nachieved. So I thank one and all for what has been achieved today.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield for just a moment, I \nknow people are waiting for the vote on the judges, so we need to be \nexpeditious. I, too, commend the distinguished Budget Committee \nchairman and the ranking member for the extraordinary demonstration of \nleadership. This vote would not have been possible were it not for the \nway they worked with the White House, with us, in coming to the vote we \nhave today.\n  This is a historic moment. We will balance the budget as a result of \nthis resolution. Democrats and Republicans alike can take credit and \ncan take a great deal of pride in what we have done today. So I commend \nthem and appreciate very much their leadership today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the leader yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the chairman, I will yield to him. \nHe has earned the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want to start thanking people, because there \nare so many who did so much. I do want to say, from my standpoint, that \nmy highest, highest thanks go to our majority leader. He has not been a \nmajority leader for a long time, and this is a very, very difficult \nundertaking. There were a lot of potential pitfalls.\n  Frankly, I commend him for being a very, very courageous majority \nleader. He has a lot of courage. When something has to be done and he \nagrees to do it, it is like you have a great army with you; we just \nmove. If he wasn't in the lead, I was, and we took turns and we got \nthis done.\n  I also want to say that this is a bipartisan effort. I say to Senator \nDaschle, thank you. When we had trouble, we would call on him.\n  Last but not least, I always knew Frank Lautenberg, but I didn't know \nwe were really friends. I think I can say we have a bond between us now \nthat came about because we worked on a very, very difficult set of \nissues for a long time. I thank him and his staff for their \ncooperation, and close by saying to all the Senators, thanks for the \nway you conducted yourselves. This is a complicated, messy process, but \nI think we did the Senate well, which I always want to do.\n  I will close by saying that the one staff person I must always \nrecognize, and I think the White House at one point suggested without \nBill Hoagland we couldn't put this together. I thank him publicly.\n  Frank, it is good to be your friend.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may, Mr. President, I too, want to say that my \nwork with Pete Domenici was illuminating, a learning experience at \ntimes. His smile sometimes was beguiling, but the steel nerves always \nshowed through. It was a good experience.\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\n  I noted with one of our colleagues over there, Senator Nickles--and I \nam sure that he does not mind my quoting him here--he said that this \nmarkup in the budget was the least acrimonious that he had seen in his \n17 years on the Budget Committee. I, too, in the 14 years I have been \non the Budget Committee.\n  We had plenty of differences. Do not let anybody think it was smooth \ngoing all the way. But there was a determination to get the job done. \nIt was largely Pete's leadership and our willingness to just put aside \nsome differences.\n  My leader, Tom Daschle, was always there to encourage me and the \nteam.\n  Senator Lott, too, you know how to push at times and how to pull at \nother times. You still got us going in the same direction. I don't get \nit. But it was a pleasure working with the majority leader.\n  My team, John Cahill, Bruce King, Sander Lurie, Marty Morris, Sue \nNelson, Mitch Warren, and the others whom I was fortunate enough to \ninherit from the experienced days of Senator Exon and Senator Sasser, \nAmy Abraham, Matt Greenwald, Phil Karsting, Jim Klumpner, Nell Mays, \nand Jon Rosenwasser, everybody helped enormously. I want to say Bill \nHoagland and the majority leader's team were cooperative. They tried to \nalways make sure we understood exactly what was going to be in there. \nThere was no attempt to deceive or fool.\n  Thus, we have an agreement that we can all be proud of. The American \npeople should be proud of it. They saw us cooperating, as the majority \nleader said. And here we saw a vote of 78 to 22. That is pretty darn \ngood.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  I do have a couple unanimous-consent requests to make. I think \nMembers will be very interested in this. Then we can go on with some \nclosing statements and some wrapup information.\n  We have some other matters that we are going to try to work through \nin the afternoon. But if we can get these two agreements, then we could \nannounce there would be no further votes today. I think that would be \nvery important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5023-7", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5066-S5070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: No. \n73, Donald Middlebrooks; No. 74, Jeffrey Miller; No. 75, Robert Pratt. \nI further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en \nbloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, statements \nrelating to any of these nominations be printed in the Record, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we are now \nat the end of May. We have confirmed a grand total of two judges in \nthis session. If we confirm these, it will make five, one a month, \nwhich is zero population growth in the Federal judiciary.\n  I will not ask for a rollcall, but we have been told over and over \nagain these were all being held up so we could have rollcalls on them. \nI suspect we will not have them because it will be embarrassing to see \nthat three excellent, well-qualified judges, held up all this time, \nthen would get voted on virtually unanimously.\n  I will also note Margaret Morrow, the one woman who was on the panel \non this, still is not before the Senate and still is being held for \nmysterious holds on the Republican side.\n  I urge my good friend, the majority leader--and he is my good \nfriend--I urge him to do this. I have been here 22 years with \noutstanding majority leaders, Republicans and Democrats, with Senator \nMansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole, and Senator \nMitchell as majority leaders. And now I have the opportunity to serve \nwith the distinguished Senator from Mississippi as the majority leader.\n  No majority leader has ever allowed the Senate before to do what is \nhappening to the Federal judiciary now. I urge my friend from \nMississippi not to allow this Senate to be the first Senate that acts \ntoward the Federal judiciary or diminishes the integrity and the \nindependence of our Federal judiciary, the integrity and independence \nrecognized and commended and praised throughout the world, to let it be \ndiminished here.\n  I urge the distinguished majority leader to work with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, and myself and others, to move these \njudges. We have 100 vacancies. We have 25 to 28 sitting before the \ncommittee that could go immediately, or nearly immediately. We have to \ndo this and stop--stop--the belittling and diminishing of our Federal \njudiciary. It is part of what makes this a great democracy. We should \nnot allow it to happen.\n\n  I will not object to the request of the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:\n\n                             The Judiciary\n\n       Donald M. Middlebrooks, of Florida, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Southern District of Florida.\n       Jeffrey T. Miller, of California, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Southern District of California.\n       Robert W. Pratt, of Iowa, to be United States District \n     Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.\n\n\n             statement on the nomination of robert w. pratt\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has \ndecided to take up the nomination of Robert W. Pratt to be a U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Southern District of Iowa. Mr. Pratt is a well-\nqualified nominee.\n  We first received Robert Pratt's nomination in August 1996. He was \nnot accorded a hearing last Congress and the President renominated him \non the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the District \nCourt for the Southern District of Iowa. He had a confirmation hearing \non March 18 where he was supported by Senator Harkin and Senator \nGrassley and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee on \nApril 17, more than 4 weeks ago.\n  With this confirmation the Senate has confirmed five Federal judges \nin five months--one Federal judge a month. Even with the three judicial \nconfirmation votes today, there are still almost 100 judicial vacancies \nin the Federal courts. Since this session began, vacancies on the \nFederal bench have increased from 87 to 103 and we have proceeded to \nconfirm only five nominees. After these three confirmations, after more \nthan doubling our confirmation output for the entire year in this one \nafternoon, we still face 98 current vacancies today and that number is \ncontinuing to grow. At this rate, we are falling farther and farther \nbehind and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer \nand longer times to the detriment of more Americans and the national \ncause of prompt justice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nrecent articles on the crisis caused by the vacancies in the Federal \ncourts.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Time, May 26, 1997]\n\n Empty-Bench Syndrome--Congressional Republicans Are Determined To Put \n                  Clinton's Judicial Nominees on Hold\n\n                           (By Viveca Novak)\n\n       The wanted posters tacked to the walls of courthouses \n     around the country normally depict carjackers, kidnappers and \n     other scruffy lawbreakers on the lam. But these days the \n     flyers might just as well feature distinguished men and women \n     in long dark robes beneath the headline ``Help Wanted.'' As \n     of this week, 100 seats on the 844-person federal bench are \n     vacant. Case loads are creeping out of control, and sitting \n     judges are crying for help.\n       The situation is urgent, says Procter Hug Jr., chief judge \n     of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers \n     California and eight other Western states. Hug says that with \n     a third of its 28 seats vacant, the court has had to cancel \n     hearings for about 600 cases this year. Criminal cases take \n     precedence by law, so at both the trial and appellate levels, \n     it is civil cases that have been crowded out. Civil rights \n     cases, shareholder lawsuits, product-\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\n     liability actions, medical-malpractice claims and so forth \n     are being pushed to the back of the line, however urgent the \n     complaints. Chief Judge J. Phil Gilbert of the southern \n     district of Illinois went an entire year without hearing a \n     single civil case, so overwhelmed was he by the criminal load \n     in a jurisdiction down to two judges out of four. ``It's \n     litigants who end up paying the price for the delays,'' says \n     A. Leo Levin, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania \n     Law School.\n       Things won't improve any time soon. Democratic Senators \n     have been slow in recommending names to the White House, \n     which in turn has dragged its feet in forwarding those \n     recommendations to the Senate for confirmation. At a private \n     meeting with federal judges last week, Clinton promised to \n     send close to two dozen new names to Capitol Hill by July 4. \n     But once they get there, they face new hurdles. Last year the \n     Senate confirmed only 17 federal district-court judges and \n     none for the appeals courts. This year looks even worse, with \n     only two confirmations thus far. The number of days from \n     nomination to confirmation is at a record high of 183, and 24 \n     seats have been vacant more than 18 months, qualifying them \n     as judicial emergencies.\n       This slowdown in judicial confirmations is not due to \n     congressional lethargy. Just the opposite. With Republicans \n     firmly in control of the Senate, many of the party's \n     theorists feel they have the power--and the rightful \n     mandate--to implement the ideals of a conservative \n     revolution that lost its focus in recent years. So they \n     have been not so quietly pursuing a historic change in the \n     ambiguous ``advise and consent'' role the Constitution \n     gives the Senate in the selection of federal judges. The \n     successful assault by Democrats on Ronald Reagan's \n     nomination of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court helped \n     open the way for what has become a more partisan and \n     ideological examination of all judicial nominees.\n       Some Republicans have as much as declared war on Clinton's \n     choices, parsing every phrase they've written for evidence of \n     what they call judicial activism. That label has long been \n     applied to judges who come up with imaginative new legal \n     principles in their decisions rather than simply following \n     the letter of the law or the Constitution. Lately the term \n     has been tossed around like insults at a brawl. ``The \n     Republicans define `activist' according to their political \n     agenda,'' says a federal judge. ``It's O.K. to be an activist \n     if you're striking down affirmative action and gun-free \n     school laws. It's not if you're overturning abortions \n     restrictions and the line-item veto.''\n       Meanwhile, nominees are left adrift. The federal bench's \n     poster child of the moment is Margaret Morrow. Nominated in \n     May 1996 with broad bipartisan support, Morrow was the first \n     woman president of the California Bar Association, has had a \n     distinguished career in private practice and could fill a \n     trophy case with her awards and citations. She cleared the \n     judiciary committee unanimously but got stuck in last year's \n     G.O.P. freeze-out on the Senate floor. Clinton sent her name \n     back up this year, but in the meantime, conservatives began \n     raising questions about some of her writings the committee \n     hadn't seen. After another hearing, she received a letter \n     from Republican Senator Charles Grassley asking her position \n     on every ballot initiative that's come up in California over \n     the past decade, in effect asking which levers she pulled in \n     the voting booth. Morrow's nomination still isn't scheduled \n     for a vote, and she isn't even the longest-suffering nominee. \n     That distinction belongs to William Fletcher, named by \n     Clinton to the Ninth Circuit in April 1995.\n       Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     says he would like to clear the backlog. ``Playing politics \n     with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it,'' he said in \n     March. But those close to him say he's feeling pressure from \n     the right, and indeed his remarks have become more combative. \n     Last week he told a group of judges that he would refuse ``to \n     stand by to see judicial activists named to the federal \n     bench.''\n       Republicans are also aiming rocket launchers at those lucky \n     enough to have already been issued their robes. Proposals \n     range from having three-judge panels, rather than a single \n     judge, hear challenges to ballot initiatives to radical \n     notions like amending the Constitution to eliminate lifetime \n     tenure. Lawmakers have taken to threatening impeachment \n     proceedings against judges whose rulings they dislike. House \n     majority whip Tom DeLay of Texas, a chief proponent of using \n     the impeachment process much more freely than it is now, says \n     he wants ``to make an example'' of someone this year. Some \n     candidates they're considering: Judge Thelton Henderson in \n     California, who struck down a voter-approved referendum \n     ending state affirmative-action programs (he has since been \n     reversed); Judge John Nixon in Tennessee, who has reversed \n     several death-penalty convictions; and Judge Fred Biery in \n     Texas, who has refused to seat a Republican sheriff and \n     county commissioner because of a pending lawsuit challenging \n     some absentee ballots. Not mentioned are judges like New \n     York's John Sprizzo, who freed two men who had blocked access \n     to an abortion clinic because they acted on religious \n     grounds.\n       So far, the Republicans see no real downside to picking on \n     the third branch of government. ``Some of these rulings have \n     inflamed mainstream America,'' says Clint Bolick of the \n     conservative Institute for Justice. ``So when the GOP \n     elevates this issue, it is seen as a winner.\n       It's ironic that these fusillades should be coming now, \n     when even activists like Bolick concede that Clinton's \n     nominees have been mostly moderate, and liberals are moaning \n     that the President hasn't done enough to counteract the \n     effect of 12 straight years of Republican court choices. But \n     what it adds up to is ``probably the most intense attack on \n     the judiciary as an institution ever,'' says Robert Katzmann, \n     a lawyer and political scientist who has written a book on \n     Congress and the courts. ``The framers of the Constitution \n     tried to create a system in which judges would feel insulated \n     from political retribution. That's being undermined.''\n\n                     [From U.S. News, May 26, 1997]\n\n    The GOP's Judicial Freeze--A Fight To See Who Rules Over the Law\n\n                      (By Ted Gest and Lewis Lord)\n\n       When Bill Clinton was first elected, liberals thought they \n     would finally get a chance to rectify what they saw as a \n     great injustice. For 12 years, Ronald Reagan and George Bush \n     had packed the judiciary with conservative judges. And their \n     rulings were shifting power toward police and corporations \n     and away from criminal suspects, environmentalists, and trade \n     unions. Clinton, it seemed, would be able to shift the \n     balance of power back.\n       Well into Clinton's second term, the judiciary's \n     composition has barely changed, thanks to an aggressive \n     Republican strategy of thwarting Clinton's nomineees--and a \n     remarkable timidity on the president's part. During his first \n     term, when Democrats controlled the Senate for two years, 202 \n     of his nominations were confirmed. But in the past 16 months, \n     with the GOP firmly in control, the Senate has approved the \n     nominations of only 18 district judges and one circuit court \n     of appeals judge. Roughly 100 judgeships--12 percent of the \n     judiciary--are vacant, including a record 24 ``judicial \n     emergencies,'' seats that have been open for at least 18 \n     months. Judges are working nights and weekends on the stacks \n     of new cases that keep piling up. Countless civil disputes \n     involving businesses and families--whether a worker should \n     get a disability benefit, whether a loss is covered by \n     insurance, whether an alien should be deported--are being \n     held up for months.\n       Congress has insisted on playing an unprecedented role. In \n     the past, the Senate paid close attention to a president's \n     Supreme Court nominees but usually gave him a free hand in \n     selecting other federal judges. Now, the Republican Senate is \n     demanding--and often getting--a voice in whom Clinton \n     appoints to the district courts, where judges and juries make \n     basic rulings involving federal law, and to the appeals \n     courts, which decide most constitutional and other big \n     issues. ``It's a scandalous and stunningly irresponsible \n     misuse of the Senate's authority,'' says law professor \n     Geoffrey Stone, the provost at the University of Chicago.\n\n\n                          authority challenged\n\n       The slowdown could become a constitutional showdown. ``In \n     all of American history there has never been a situation \n     where a newly elected president has faced this of challenge \n     to his judicial nominations,'' says Sheldon Goldman, author \n     of the upcoming book Picking Federal Judges: Lower Court \n     Selections From Roosevelt to Reagan. ``The gauntlet has been \n     thrown down to President Clinton. And now we will see if he \n     is going to fight or if he's going to back off.''\n       Last week, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a conservative, \n     chastised the White House and the Senate for leaving so many \n     vacancies. ``Unless the executive and the legislative \n     branches change their ways,'' Rehnquist told the Federal \n     Judges Association, ``the future for judicial appointments is \n     bleak.'' He urged judges to meet with senators from their \n     areas. One judge who recently did is Procter Hug Jr. of Reno, \n     Nev., chief of the nation's busiest court--the nine-Western-\n     state 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has lost nine \n     of its 28 judges to retirement. Hug asked Sen. Orrin Hatch, \n     chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for action, and \n     Hatch replied that he would hold one judicial nomination \n     hearing each month. ``Nationally, there are 25 circuit-judge \n     vacancies,'' said Hug. ``The have got to hold more than one a \n     month.''\n       Republicans are resisting Clinton nominees aggressively in \n     part because they had to fight so long to get the judiciary \n     to their liking. The Reagan White House shrewdly decided not \n     to rely solely on GOP senators, who might have picked judges \n     mainly because of connections instead of ideology. \n     Instead, Reagan created the Federal Judicial Selection \n     Committee, which sought judges willing to reject \n     affirmative action, give police more authority, allow \n     restrictions on abortions, and permit voluntary school \n     prayer.\n       The emphasis on ideology stirred a hostile Democratic \n     reaction. Democrats in 1987 successfully blocked the \n     nomination to the Supreme Court of Robert Bork, which \n     increased Republican determination to protect their gains. \n     And they have. Reagan's appointees and those of Bush are now \n     considered the most conservative since the judges whom \n     Franklin Roosevelt assailed 60 years ago for curbing his New \n     Deal, and they make up more than half the federal judiciary.\n\n\n                            failure to fight\n\n       Liberals had hoped that Clinton would pull the courts back \n     from the right and, by the year 2000, establish a majority of \n     left-leaning judges. But he hasn't. For one thing, he has \n     been slow to send up nominees, partly because the Senate has \n     been reluctant to move\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\n     those already pending. Clinton has nominated candidates for \n     fewer than one third of the vacancies. More important, he has \n     shown an aversion to fighting for controversial nominees. One \n     prominent example involved an old friend, Georgetown \n     University law professor Peter Edelman. Clinton decided in \n     1995 not to nominate Edelman for a seat on the appeals court \n     in Washington, DC, after conservatives served notice they \n     would mount a Bork-like challenge, citing Edelman's writings \n     as ``too liberal.''\n       In essence, Clinton rejects the liberal view that he should \n     counter the Reagan-Bush emphasis on conservative views. ``He \n     doesn't want to make a federal bench in his image,'' House \n     counsel, Abner Mikva. ``What he really wants is a high-\n     quality bench that will do the right thing regardless of \n     ideology.'' Other insiders say that when the White House sets \n     legislative priorities, it is more interested in winning \n     votes from key senators on policy issues than in pressing \n     them to support judicial nominees.\n       This has left liberal activists bitterly disappointed. ``He \n     has an enormous opportunity to reshape the federal bench,'' \n     says Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice, an umbrella \n     organization of public-interest law groups, ``but rather than \n     hit the ground running, he has silently tolerated an \n     unprecedented number of attacks on the federal judiciary.''\n       Liberals like Aron are doubly disappointed because those \n     nominations Clinton has pushed have not been particularly \n     liberal. His trial judges, according to one study, seem \n     closer in ideology to Gerald Ford's judges than they do to \n     those of Jimmy Carter, who are considered the most liberal of \n     current judges.\n       To the extent Clinton has had a broad agenda for the \n     judiciary, the guiding principle has been not philosophy but \n     race and gender. ``Clinton's first term,'' says Goldman, who \n     teaches political science at the University of \n     Massachusetts--Amherst, ``was the first ever in which most of \n     a president's appointments went to women or minorities.''\n\n\n                            not mainstream?\n\n       Republicans argue that they have no choice but to hold up \n     Clinton's nominees because many are ``judicial activists'' \n     far out of the mainstream. One would-be district judge tarred \n     as an activist is Margaret Morrow of Los Angeles, a former \n     state bar president who was first nominated to the bench more \n     than a year ago. In 1988, Morrow wrote an article suggesting \n     that California might be putting too many questions to a vote \n     in citizens' referendums. Senators now are demanding to know \n     her positions on many referendum issues.\n       ``Judicial activists do not abide by the law,'' says Hatch, \n     who defines a judicial activist as ``someone who makes law as \n     a superlegislator and usurps power from two other co-equal \n     branches.'' Mikva, who was a longtime judge before working at \n     the White House, offers a different view: ``An activist judge \n     is a judge who makes a decision you don't like.''\n       This month, Hatch did remind his GOP colleagues that \n     Clinton had won and thus was entitled to make nominations. \n     ``He deserves respect and support for his nominees as long as \n     they are qualified,'' the senator said. But he also has said \n     that judicial activists are not qualified.\n       The Clinton administration insists that it has a grip on \n     the problem. ``We are doing as much bipartisan consultation \n     as we can . . . to see how Republican senators' views can be \n     absorbed into the system,'' says White House Counsel Charles \n     Ruff. That approach fails to placate Clint Bolick of the \n     Institute for Justice, a libertarian group. When Clinton was \n     re-elected, he said, ``the stakes doubled,'' and the prospect \n     of a Democrat appointing a majority of judges became a ``very \n     real concern, not an abstract concern.'' Bolick's goal is to \n     thwart any Clinton choice who doesn't meet his sharply \n     conservative standards. He expects that in the coming months \n     his fellow conservatives will go after even more Clinton \n     nominees.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to speak today in \nbehalf of Robert Pratt, to serve on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Iowa.\n  I have known Bob and his wonderful family for almost 25 years. I met \nhim when we were both fresh out of law school. We landed jobs at the \nPolk County Legal Aid Society. And it was this experience that made a \npermanent impression on me.\n  Since that time, Bob has dedicated his life to using the law to \nimprove people's lives, their communities and their future. He is \ncurrently in private practice in Des Moines and continues to devote his \npractice to the legal needs of lower income and economically \ndisadvantaged Iowans.\n  Bob Pratt is, quite simply, one of the best public interest lawyers \nin the country. And his respect for the rule of the law and his faith \nin our country's system of justice is truly inspiring.\n  I believe that Bob possesses all of the qualifications necessary to \nassume the very serious responsibilities carried out by any Federal \njudge. He has the temperament, the intellectual rigor, the compassion, \nand the ability to be fair and impartial.\n  I am also proud to say that Bob enjoys bipartisan support from the \nIowa legal community. Robert Downer, former President of the Iowa State \nBar Association, and a Republican, states: ``It has been my privilege \nto be acquainted with Mr. Pratt for some time, and I regard him very \nhighly both personally and professionally. With the heavy caseload in \nthe Southern District of Iowa it will be of great benefit to litigants \nin that court if he can be confirmed without delay.''\n  Mr. President, I am proud to continue Iowa's fine tradition of \njudicial selection based upon merit. I believe Bob Pratt reflects very \nproudly on all of us who have chosen to be public servants. And I have \nno doubt that he will make an excellent U.S. District judge for the \nSouthern District of Iowa.\n\n\n                      statements on the nomination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has \ndecided to take up the nomination of Donald M. Middlebrooks to be a \nU.S. District Judge for the southern district of Florida. Mr. \nMiddlebrooks is a well-qualified nominee.\n  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his judicial nomination \nto the full Senate more than 4 weeks ago. The southern district of \nFlorida desperately needs him to manage is growing backlog of cases.\n  We first received Donald Middlebrooks' nomination in September 1996. \nHe was not accorded a hearing last Congress and the President \nrenominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy \non the district court for the southern district of Florida, which \nvacancy has existed since October 1992. This is another of the judicial \nemergency vacancies that we did not fill last year. It has been vacant \nfor more than 4\\1/2\\ years. He has the support of both Senator Graham \nand Senator Mack and was reported by the Judiciary Committee to the \nSenate on April 17.\n  With this confirmation, the Senate has confirmed three Federal judges \nthis year--the same amount of times we have gone on vacation in 1997. \nAt this rate, we are falling farther and farther behind and more and \nmore vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to \nthe detriment of more Americans and the national cause of prompt \njustice. We must do better.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the chairman and other \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to move the \nnominations process forward so that the Senate confirms the judges that \nthe Federal courts need to ensure the prompt administration of justice.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join all those in America who are \nconcerned about filling judicial vacancies in expressing gratitude to \nSenators Hatch and Leahy for bringing judicial nominations to the floor \nfor our timely consideration.\n  Florida, with some of the busiest districts in the Nation, has three \nFederal judicial vacancies. With our action today, one of those \nvacancies is no more, and the people of Florida's southern district \nwill soon be served by an outstanding and experienced member of both \nthe legal and larger south Florida community--Mr. Don Middlebrooks.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to fill all of the \njudicial vacancies in Florida. But today's action is a very positive \nstep forward.\n  Mr. President, the people served by the jurists we confirm have a \nright to expect judges who bring unquestioned competence, strong \nintegrity, devotion to duty, and diversity of experience with them to \nthe Federal bench.\n  Throughout his career--as an undergraduate and law student at the \nUniversity of Florida, a public servant, and a distinguished member of \nthe south Florida legal community--Don Middlebrooks has met--and \nexceeded--this standard of excellence time and time again.\n  Mr. Middlebrooks started his career in the public service at the \nUniversity of Florida, where his fellow undergraduates elected him \npresident of the student body.\n  That excellence in student government was followed by distinction at \nthe University of Florida Law School and, eventually, outstanding \nservice in the Florida State government.\n  In 1974, Don Middlebrooks was asked to serve the people of Florida as \nassistant general counsel to then-Governor\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nReubin Askew. He served with such distinction that Governor Askew \nultimately elevated him to the post of general counsel.\n  Three years later, as Governor Askew's second and final term was \ncoming to a close, Mr. Middlebrooks left Tallahassee and joined the \nsouth Florida offices of Steel, Hector, & Davis, one of our State's \noldest and largest law firms.\n  His 20 years of experience with highly complex legal issues makes him \nespecially well-prepared for the cases that he will see as a Federal \ndistrict court judge in south Florida.\n  But the fact that Don Middlebrooks has spent the last two decades in \nthe private sector does not mean that he has neglected his commitment \nto public service.\n  In addition to handling numerous pro bono cases himself, Mr. \nMiddlebrooks was chairman of Steel, Hector, & Davis' public service \ncommittee when the firm received the American Bar Association pro bono \naward and the Florida Supreme Court chief justice's law firm \ncommendation.\n  He has also been a civic leader. The list of his involvements is long \nand distinguished--chairman of the Palm Beach County Criminal Justice \nCommission, president of the Florida Bar Association, member of the \nFlorida Ethics Commission.\n  Perhaps Don Middlebrooks' most important civic contribution has been \nhis tireless commitment to the welfare of Florida's youngest \ngeneration--its children.\n  In addition to being the father of 11-year-old Amanda and 9-year-old \nJack, Mr. Middlebrooks has served as chairman of the Palm Beach County \nChildren's Services Council, chairman of the Florida Bar Commission for \nChildren, and a member of the Florida Commission on Child Welfare.\n  Mr. Chairman, throughout his life, Don Middlebrooks has been \nrespected by his peers, hailed for his outstanding service to the \npeople of Florida, honored for his civic involvements, and praised for \nhis skill and competence in the legal arena.\n  I have no doubt that this pattern of distinction and outstanding \nservice will continue once he is invested as a Federal judge in the \nsouthern district of Florida.\n\n\n           statements on the nomination of jeffrey t. miller\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has \ndecided to take up the nomination of Jeffrey T. Miller to be a U.S. \ndistrict court judge for the southern district of California. Judge \nMiller is a well-qualified nominee.\n  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the \nSenate more than 4 weeks ago. The southern district of California \ndesperately needs Judge Miller to help manage its growing backlog of \ncases.\n  We first received Judge Jeffrey Miller's nomination in July 1996. He \nwas not accorded a hearing last Congress and the President renominated \nhim on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the \ndistrict court for the southern district of California, which vacancy \nhas existed since December 1994. This is one of the judicial emergency \nvacancies that we should have filled last year. This vacancy has \npersisted for 2\\1/2\\ years. He has the support of both Senators from \nCalifornia. He had a confirmation hearing on March 18 and his \nnomination was considered and reported to the Senate by the Judiciary \nCommittee on April 17.\n  With this confirmation, the Senate has confirmed four Federal judges \nthis year--the same number as the number of amendments to the \nConstitution that have been considered and defeated by the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. At this rate, we are falling farther \nand farther behind and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount \nover longer and longer times to the detriment of more Americans and the \nnational cause of prompt justice. We must do better.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader \nfor calling up these judicial nominations for votes by the Senate, and \nin particular for calling up Judge Jeffrey Miller, who has been \nnominated to the U.S. district court for the southern district of \nCalifornia in San Diego.\n  It was my distinct pleasure to recommend Judge Jeffrey Miller to the \nPresident. I feel strongly he is extremely well qualified for the \nposition.\n  Judge Miller has been serving for 10 years as a superior court judge \nin San Diego, having been appointed by a Republican Governor, George \nDeukmejian, in 1987.\n  Judge Miller previously spent 19 years with the State attorney \ngeneral's office.\n  He earned both his undergraduate and law degree from the University \nof California at Los Angeles in the 1960's. He first devoted himself to \npublic service by working in the Peace Corps for a year.\n  During his experience in the Los Angeles attorney general's office \nfrom 1968 to 1974, he briefed approximately 60 cases on behalf of the \npeople, urging affirmation of trial court convictions before the court \nof appeals in more than half of those cases.\n  Of those cases, published opinions were issued in 13, all but 1 \naffirming trial court convictions.\n  From 1974 to 1987, Judge Miller supervised attorneys and carried his \nown caseload in the tort and condemnation section of the attorney \ngeneral's office, which oversaw the San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino, \nand Riverside areas. Here he represented the State in matters ranging \nfrom class action lawsuits to California Highway Patrol officers sued \nfor false arrest.\n  Judge Miller has argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Both \ncases were argued successfully on behalf of the State.\n  His lengthy and distinguished experience as a prosecutor prepared him \nwell for his appointment in 1987 as a superior court judge.\n  Since then, he has handled many sensitive high-profile criminal and \ncivil cases including two murder cases where the juries rendered \nconvictions with full sentences.\n  This has prepared him extremely well for the criminal and civil \ncaseload facing the southern district judges.\n  Simply put, Judge Miller is one of the most respected and trusted \njudicial figures in the San Diego area. He is both fair minded and \nthoughtful, yet remains tough and decisive.\n  His bipartisan support and solid judicial background make him a \nstrong nominee for confirmation. Among those who have endorsed Judge \nMiller's nomination are those who know the judge's work best:\n  Presiding Judge James R. Milliken of the superior court described \nJudge Miller as ``a superb judge'' and ``a fine, insightful person. He \nunderstands legal issues and problems and does an absolutely wonderful \njob in the courtroom.''\n  Judge Anthony Joseph, a colleague on the San Diego Superior Court, \nwrote: ``His positive outlook and pragmatic approach are essential in \nthis era.''\n  Judge Daniel Kremer of the U.S. court of appeals noted that Judge \nMiller ``is particularly well known for his ability to handle complex \ncases efficiently and fairly.''\n  Retired Justice Charles Froehlich, Jr., of the court of appeals said: \n``He is a person of very high ethical standards. He would indeed be a \ncredit to the local district court bench.''\n  Judge Judith Haller of the court of appeals wrote: ``Judge Miller \nwould be an outstanding selection and one which would be extremely well \nreceived by members of our legal community. He is one of those rare \nindividuals who receives unanimous praise from all who have worked with \nhim professionally or who know him personally.''\n  Judge Miller is an active member of the California Judges \nAssociation.\n  He has been elected to the executive committee and served on that \ncommittee as supervising judge of the north county branch of the San \nDiego Superior Court. He has also chaired the joint jury committee and \nthe rules committee.\n  Let me conclude by saying how important it is to fill the vacancies \non the southern district bench. Presiding Judge Judith Keep has \nprovided some startling information about workload in the southern \ndistrict, which I would like to submit for the Record.\n  There are currently two vacancies on the southern district bench. The \nsix judges now serving in the southern district faced a caseload of \n5,674 cases in 1996. Five years earlier, the total filings in this \ndistrict were 2,914. That represents a 95-percent increase in the \nworkload from 1991 to 1996 for the southern district judges.\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\n  In addition, the vacancy Judge Miller would fill has been vacant \nsince December 28, 1994--more than 26 months. Judge Gordon Thompson \ntook senior status on December 28, 1994.\n  This vacancy has only made the workload on the southern district more \nintense.\n  So I urge my colleagues to address the workload problem by confirming \nthis eminently qualified candidate, Judge Jeffrey Miller.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, so they will \nunderstand, this is the Chemical Weapons Convention implementing \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previous order with respect to the \nbill be vitiated and, further, the committee substitute amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The committee substitute amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the debate on ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention, I said that I expected that both the \nPresident and the Congress must be wholly dedicated to implement this \ntreaty in a way that advances U.S. national security interests and that \nprotects the constitutional rights of American citizens. Today, we will \nconsider a bill to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention. In my \nview, this bill accomplishes both of those objectives.\n  The bill before us today is the product of negotiation with the \nadministration and with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nAlthough this bill differs, in several respects, from the version of S. \n610 that was introduced in the Congress, I believe that we have \nachieved a bill that comprehensively implements the treaty, while also \nprotecting the constitutional rights of Americans. Let me explain \nbriefly why that is true:\n  First, our bill provides for civil liability of the United States for \nthe loss of property resulting from inspection procedures under the \ntreaty.\n  Second, the Chemical Weapons Convention authorizes a team of \ninternational officials to inspect the facilities of private American \nbusinesses. Our bill protects the constitutional rights of American \ncitizens through the warrant requirement that must be satisfied for all \ninspections.\n  Third, the bill protects confidential business information that, \naccording to the treaty, must be reported to the U.S. National \nAuthority. The bill also provides aggressive penalties for the person \ndisclosing the information, as well as for those benefiting from the \ninformation.\n  In sum, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1997 is \na reasonable effort to protect the constitutional rights of our \ncitizens against unlawful inspections under the treaty.\n  We have worked exceedingly hard with the Administration and with \nMembers on the other side of the aisle to craft this bill. In \nparticular, I want to thank Senators Lugar, Kyl, Leahy, and Biden, as \nwell as their staff, for their tremendous efforts in this regard, done \nunder serious time constraints. I want to thank, in particular, David \nStephens, Randy Schueneman, Marshall Billingslea, Ken Meyers, Beryl \nHowell, Ed Levine, David Schanzer, Stephen Schlesinger, Jennifer \nCarrico, and Paul Larkin.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to compliment my esteemed chairman, \nSenator Hatch, for forging a consensus on this complex issue. As my \ncolleagues know, I was engaged in negotiations on the Chemical Weapons \nconvention resolution of ratification for months, and I know first hand \nhow many deeply held views this treaty implicates and how difficult it \nis to bring the parties together.\n  But we succeeded on the treaty and now, with the help of many \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, have succeeded on the implementing \nlegislation.\n  I supported this compromise measure in committee and will do so again \nnow because it takes the important steps necessary to implement the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  As required by the convention, this bill will enact tough criminal \nsanctions for possessing, stockpiling, transferring, and using chemical \nweapons. It will also require U.S. companies to report on their \nproduction and use of potentially dangerous chemicals and submit to \ninspections of their facilities.\n  Taking these steps will demonstrate to the rest of the world that the \nUnited States is committed to continuing its leadership role in arms \ncontrol and other issues of global importance.\n  I want to make clear, however, that I do not support some of the \nprovisions in this bill and have very serious concerns about their \nimpact on the convention.\n  In particular, I do not believe we should be granting the President \ndiscretionary authority to deny a CWC inspection based on national \nsecurity grounds, as would be done by section 401. By signing and \nratifying this treaty, the United States--with the advice and consent \nof 74 Members of this body, given less than a month ago--agreed to \nallow certain inspections, subject to our constitutional requirements. \nWith few exceptions, denial of a duly authorized inspection would \nviolate the convention.\n  Even if the President never exercises this authority, the mere \ninclusion of this provision in the legislation will encourage other \ncountries to deny inspections on national security grounds. If we \nshould enact to so-called national security exception, we can be sure \nthat the Chinese will seize upon the precedent we set and use it to \nundermine the effectiveness of the entire certification regime.\n  I have similar concerns regarding section 403, which would exempt \nfrom reporting and routine inspection requirements unscheduled discrete \norganic chemicals that are coincidental byproducts and are not isolated \nor captured for use or sale. While waste streams are not, in \nthemselves, a threat to the object and purposes of the CWC regime, \nmonitoring of such streams does afford one of the most convenient and \nnonintrusive means of determining whether a facility is worthy of \nconcern in the first place.\n  The drafters of this provision are concerned that CWC implementation \nwould otherwise require paper manufacturers to undertake costly \nmonitoring of their waste streams, and that is an understandable \nconcern. There is no need, however, to grant such a broad exemption as \nis currently contained in this section.\n  I am also troubled by:\n  The broad compensation scheme in section 103 that does not even \nrequire a plaintiff to prove its case by a preponderance of the \nevidence to receive taxpayer funded compensation for the loss of trade \nsecrets; and\n  The limitation in sections 102 and 308 on the Government's power to \nrequire contractors to submit to CWC inspections.\n  I hope to work with other Senators and the administration to \nameliorate these concerns prior to enactment of this measure. Treaties \nare solemn obligations, and the Chemical Weapons Convention, with all \nits faults, is our best hope for exposing violators and mobilizing the \nworld so as to put a stop to chemical weapons. We must resist the urge, \ntherefore, to enact provisions that could conflict with our treaty \nobligations and do damage to the effectiveness of the treaty regime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention was \ninitiated by President Reagan, negotiated by President Bush and \nratified on behalf of the United States by President Clinton. The \nratification of this convention was a major achievement that consumed a \ngreat deal of the time and attention of the Senate.\n  When the Senate gave its advise and consent to ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention, the administration told us it was \nimperative that we act on implementing legislation as quickly as \npossible. The Judiciary Committee had the task of reporting back to the \nSenate with implementing\n\n[[Page S5079]]\n\nlegislation in time for Senate consideration before our Memorial Day \nrecess.\n  The implementing legislation considered by the Senate today is where \nthe rubber meets the road. It will define precisely how the general \nobligations of the international treaty will affect American citizens \nand American chemical companies.\n  A significant principle of the convention is set forth in Article VII \nregarding ``National Implementation Measures.'' This principle makes \nclear that each state party shall, in accordance with its \nconstitutional processes, adopt the necessary measures to implement its \nobligations under this convention. My objective when I began work on \nthis legislation was to make sure that it reflected our constitutional \nprinciples and sound public policy, while fulfilling our obligations \nunder the convention.\n  Over the last few weeks, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing, \nsolicited the advice of experts from both the administration and in the \nprivate sector, and worked to craft legislation we could report to the \nSenate in a very short time frame. I commend my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee, and especially Chairman Hatch, Senator Biden, and \nSenator Kyl, for their diligence and efforts in fulfilling this \nCommittee's responsibilities. Senator Lugar deserves enormous credit \nfor his constructive and helpful work in reaching the compromises \nnecessary to get this legislation done.\n  I also thank Ivo Spalatin, Dave Barton, and Bernie Sewart, from the \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency; Bill Danvers and Gordy Bendick, \nfrom the National Security Council; Steven Goldman and Ann Connaughton \nfrom the Department of Commerce; Eileen Gillio from the Department of \nDefense; and Craig Iscoe from the Department of Justice. These \ndedicated employees from Federal agencies and the White House spent \nhours, even late into the night, to share their expertise with the \ncommittee. We appreciate their hard work.\n  The hearing we held on May 13, 1997, regarding the administration's \nimplementing legislation, S. 610, raised a number of issues that needed \nto be addressed. For example, one aspect of S.610 that required our \nattention was its blanket exception from the Freedom of Information Act \nfor all information reported to, or otherwise obtained by any of the \nagencies involved in implementing the convention.\n  Even a witness from the Department of Justice admitted that this \nprovision was not intended, for example, to limit public access to \nrecords concerning the number of inspections conducted under the \nconvention, even if that information was reported to, or otherwise \nobtained by the U.S. National Authority from the Technical Secretariat. \nHe agreed that this provision could be clarified.\n  The committee amendment to S.610 substantially improves this aspect \nof the legislation by removing the blanket exception under the Freedom \nof Information Act contained in the original bill. The substitute \nretains protection for trade secrets and other proprietary business \ninformation provided under the act and the convention, but the \noperations of the Federal agencies in implementing this act will not be \ncloaked in secrecy. They will be fully subject to the FOIA--as they \nshould be.\n  Yet another provision in S.610, as introduced, could have been \nconstrued to penalize a person for refusing to consent to an entry or \ninspection required under the convention. A Justice Department witness \ntestified at the Judiciary Committee hearing that this section is \ninelegant and fails to account for the process agreed to in the \nconditions of ratification. The implementing legislation reported by \nthe committee clarifies this provision, and affirms the constitutional \nright of every American to refuse to give their consent to a search and \nthe requirement that the Government obtain a warrant.\n  We also heard from several witnesses about including in the \nimplementing legislation a mechanism to compensate those companies that \nsuffer a loss of trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary \ninformation due to their compliance with the convention. The \nimplementing legislation we reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nprovides a compensation scheme that I sincerely hope will not become a \nsurer bet than the lottery for a payout to companys subject to the \nconvention. This scheme will, after the plaintiff establishes a prima \nfacie case, shift the burden to the Government to prove that any loss \ndid not arise from the company's compliance with the convention. \nProving a negative will be no easy task for the Government, which may \nlegitimately decide simply to settle such claims, despite their lack of \nmerit. We may have to revisit this scheme if it proves to be \nauthorization for a legal holdup of the U.S. Treasury.\n  Other provisions in this implementing legislation also give me pause. \nIt does not reflect all the changes each of us would like in the exact \nform we would like them. But it certainly reflects good faith \ncompromises on both sides.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe compromise reached on S. 610, the legislation to implement the \nChemical Weapons Convention. I believe it is very much in our national \ninterests to pass this implementation legislation just as we ratified \nthe CWC.\n  Let me first express my respect and appreciation for the \ndistinguished Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Biden and the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy. They and their staff have really done the \nheavy lifting in getting this implementing language to the floor.\n  I also want to express my respect for the opponents of this treaty, \nincluding the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I have worked well with \nSenator Kyl on many issues, including, at the moment, our strong effort \nto pass a Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution.\n  I know that in this debate these Senators are motivated by their \ngenuine and deeply felt concern for America's national security. \nHowever, I must disagree with the view that we would be better off \nwithout this treaty, or by passing implementation language that renders \nthe treaty meaningless.\n  Mr. President, the threat of chemical weapons falling into the hands \nof terrorists, or being used as a weapon of war by a rogue state, has \nincreased dramatically in recent years.\n  One need only reflect on the dangers faced by our military by Iraq's \nincipient chemical weapons program during the gulf war, or the \ntragedies our nation has suffered with the bombing of the World Trade \nCenter, the Federal building in Oklahoma City, and the Olympic Park in \nAtlanta, to fully appreciate the dangers posed by the proliferation of \nchemical weapons. In each of these cases, the tragedy and loss of life \ncould have been magnified significantly had chemical weapons been used.\n  Chemical weapons are among the most barbaric of mankind's inventions. \nThey are so awful, that the United States, by act of Congress, has \ndecided to eliminate our own stocks of these weapons by 2004. They are \ndesigned to kill and incapacitate by causing such effects as skin \nblistering, blindness, lung damage, choking, nervous system disruption, \nparalysis, or oxygen starvation. Because of the ease of their dispersal \nover a wide area, chemical weapons are especially useful for targeting \ncivilian populations.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is the most far-reaching attempt ever \nby the international community to control the spread of chemical \nweapons. It bans for the first time the development, production, and \npossession of chemical weapons and reinforces the international norm \nagainst their use. Since we are destroying our own chemical weapons, it \nonly makes sense that we should want other nations to do so as well.\n  The convention requires all signatory states to declare and destroy \nany chemical weapons and the facilities used to produce them. It \nrequires member states to submit annual reports on the production and \nuse of certain sensitive chemicals. This information, combined with our \nown intelligence resources, will significantly improve our ability to \nmonitor and prevent illegal transfers and uses of such chemicals.\n\n  Once the CWC takes effect, it will make it much harder and more \ncostly for proliferators and terrorists to acquire chemical weapons. An \nintrusive verification system will be set up to detect violations. \nSanctions will be imposed against nations that refuse to\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\nparticipate, making it more difficult for them to acquire precursor \nchemicals for poison gas and easier to monitor their efforts to do so.\n  The intelligence-sharing and global verification network that will \nresult from this treaty will increase the chances that terrorist \nattacks involving chemical weapons can be prevented before they ever \noccur--a net gain in the security of our troops and our citizens.\n  We must start with the proposition that no arms control agreement is \n100 percent verifiable. But with the CWC, we will know far more about \nwho is trying to develop chemical weapons, where, and how than we would \nwithout the treaty. That is why the intelligence community has \nconsistently testified that, while the treaty is not completely \nverifiable, they regard it as a highly desirable tool that will enhance \nour knowledge of chemical weapons programs and our ability to stop \nthem.\n  The CWC's verification regime requires routine inspections of all \ndeclared facilities working with significant amounts of chemicals \nlisted by the treaty. In addition, any site, declared or not, may be \nsubject to short-notice challenge inspections if there are suspicions \nthat it is being used to produce or store banned chemicals.\n  The CWC also establishes significant trade restrictions on precursor \nchemicals. These restrictions will make it more difficult for nations \nwho are not parties to the treaty to acquire these chemicals, and will \nprovide us with much more information than we currently have about who \nis seeking to import such chemicals, and in what amounts.\n  So the concern about verification, while valid, I believe has been \nmore than adequately addressed. We must go into this treaty with our \neyes open, aware that it will not detect every violation. But why would \nwe deprive ourselves of the extremely useful tools and information this \ntreaty would provide on the grounds that they are not fool-proof? It \nwould be incredibly short-sighted to do so.\n  Another concern that has been raised involves the potential theft of \ncommercial or trade secrets. Nothing in the CWC or its implementation \nlanguage require the United States, or any U.S. company, to provide any \nconfidential business information to any foreign party.\n  I am concerned about how this issue has been addressed in this \nimplementation legislation. Under this bill, the American taxpayer must \npay for the theft of confidential business information by foreign \nindustrial spies.\n  I think the better course is for the injured business to first take \nreasonable steps to seek compensation from the spy who stole the \ninformation or from the foreign company which used the stolen \ninformation to gain a competitive advantage, before going after the \nU.S. Treasury. I am hopeful that this issue can be addressed in the \nconference on this legislation, and I appreciate the commitment of the \nSenator from Arizona to continue to work with me on this.\n  Mr. President, I think this debate really comes down to whether or \nnot one supports international arms control agreements. Many of the \ncriticisms of the CWC and implementation legislation were levied \nagainst all previous successful arms control treaties, such as the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the START Treaty.\n  Those who worry that the United States will weaken its vigilance in \nour efforts to guard against the threat of chemical weapons have \nactually done us a service. I believe the intensity of this debate has \nhelped to ensure that we will never allow ourselves to believe that the \ntreaty by itself is enough. We will follow the course that President \nReagan did--a strong national defense and arms control agreements with \nverification.\n  The CWC is not a panacea, and none of its proponents believes it is. \nIt will not by itself banish chemical weapons from the earth, but it \nwould result in the destruction of much of the world's chemical weapons \nstocks, and provide us with a valuable set of tools that would \nsignificantly strengthen our ability to monitor and defend against the \nthreat of chemical weapons.\n  I am very pleased that both sides of this debate were able to work \ntogether and come to what I feel is, overall, a good agreement. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for the CWC Implementation Legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention \nImplementation Act of 1997, S. 610, adequately serves to implement the \nobligations of the Nation under the Chemical Weapons Convention that we \nratified a few weeks ago. S. 610 reinforces the concerns expressed in \nthe ratification conditions that constitutional protections for U.S. \ncitizens must be maintained during the intrusive inspection regime \nrequired by the CWC. S. 610 protects both private companies and Federal \ninstallations from frivolous challenge inspections by demanding that \nprobable cause be demonstrated in order to obtain a search warrant.\n  S. 610 implements procedures for taking samples and maintains the \nrequirement in the Senate's ratification conditions that these samples \nwill stay within the country. To the extent possible, I would encourage \nthe U.S. National Authority to work with the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons to move toward inspection techniques \nthat avoid all concerns with loss of proprietary chemical information \nfrom the acquisition and analysis of samples. Measurement techniques, \nusing acoustic signatures for example, have been developed at Los \nAlamos that can identify whether the contents of a container are a \nknown chemical weapon agent or precursor, without resorting to actual \nchemical analysis.\n  During the ratification process for the CWC, I was concerned with \nprotection of business interests of U.S. companies, and was \nparticularly concerned that small businesses might be adversely \nimpacted by challenge inspections directed against their property. S. \n610 now allows any company to request federal assistance in preparing \nfor an inspection and provides that a small business shall receive such \nassistance without cost. That's a good step for further protecting the \ninterests of our small businesses.\n  With passage of S. 610, the United States will move ahead to \nimplement the Chemical Weapons Convention in concert with the \nInternational Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. \nUnfortunately, the international community involved in the CWC now does \nnot include Russia since they failed to ratify the convention. To \nrealize the full global benefits of the CWC, more nations need to \naccept the convention's conditions--and I hope that Russia will lead \nthe way among the nations that still have not ratified the convention.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the title amendment be agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nstatements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to recognize \nthe dedication of a gentleman who has long been a part of the Senate. \nLarry Harrison, Senate Chamber attendant, is retiring after over 36 \nyears of Federal service.\n  Larry began his long Government career in the U.S. Army in 1942. \nThose who have been around the Hill for a while may have known him in \nvarious capacities as he worked for the Architect of the Capitol and in \nthe Senate's Environmental Services operation.\n  As a Chamber attendant for the past 10 years, Larry frequently was \nhere before we arrived and remained after we left, opening the Chamber \nin the morning and locking it again after the day's business was \ncompleted. He has greeted us each day with a smile and a friendly word. \nWe will all miss Larry around here.\n  Larry's retirement will allow him to do something that makes us all a \nbit envious--and I'm not talking about playing golf, though I'm sure \nhe'll be doing plenty of that, too. He will be spending more time with \nhis wife, Jean, and sons, Michael Henry, Albert Philips, and Kevin \nHarrison.\n  I want to express my personal appreciation to Larry and his family, \nand I'm certain my colleagues share my sentiments. Our best thoughts \nand wishes are with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5081-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LARRY HARRISON: THREE DECADES OF OUTSTANDING SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at the end of this month one of the \nSenate's finest employees, Larry Harrison, will retire. He will be \nsorely missed. Larry has served his Nation for most of his life and \nworked in the Capitol for over 36 years--longer than most of my \ncolleagues and I have been in Washington. He served in the U.S. Army \nduring World War II, participating in the D-day invasion at Normandy, \nand following the war worked for the Architect of the Capitol for 5 \nyears. Larry returned to the Capitol to work for the Sergeant at Arms \nin 1967, and has been with us ever since. Throughout his long years of \nservice, his dedication to his work has been extraordinary.\n  One of the great joys of working in the Capitol is the magnificent \nbeauty of this building. For this, we owe a large debt to Larry. It is \nhis job to maintain the President's Room, the Cloakroom, and the Senate \nChamber, and the pride he takes in this work is well evident. Thanks to \nhis careful attention to detail, these historic rooms are kept in \npristine condition. In addition, he operates a shoe shine station in \nthe Senators' bathroom. As my colleagues will attest, he never fails to \nhave a kind word and a smile for everyone.\n  Larry is known and loved by staff and Senators alike for his good \nhumor. Indeed, his friendly nature has been contagious. An avid golfer, \nhe is single-handedly responsible for the creation of the Cloakroom \nInvitational--an annual golf tournament involving the Cloakroom staff \nof both parties. More than just a day to relax on the golf course, it \nis an opportunity for staff from both sides of the aisle to get to know \neach other. It is safe to say that thanks to Larry Harrison, the Senate \nruns with a greater deal of friendship, respect and trust than would \notherwise be the case. All this from a man whose first game of golf \ntook place in a cornfield with a branch as a club and a crumpled ball \nof tape as a golf ball.\n  I wish Larry all the best as he begins his retirement, and thank him \nfor his years of service. As he leaves, our thoughts and prayers go \nwith him. I hope he will enjoy the best of health, and have many years \nof happy retirement with his wife Jean and their three sons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5081-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5081-S5082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LOUISIANA CONTESTED ELECTION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, periodically I report to the Senate on the \nprogress being made on the Louisiana investigation. On May 8, I advised \nthe Senate that the Committee on Rules and Administration was working \non a bipartisan investigation into allegations that fraud, \nirregularities, and other errors affected the outcome of the 1996 \nelection for U.S. Senator from Louisiana--the first such Senate \ninvestigation into alleged vote fraud since the early 1950's, almost 45 \nyears ago.\n  Since that time, the committee has secured appropriate office space \nin New Orleans to meet the needs of the investigation. Our committee \ncounsel, majority and minority together, have also been to Baton Rouge, \nwhere they were joined by our investigative teams, headed by Richard \nCullen and George Terwilliger from the law firm of McGuire, Woods, \nBattle & Boothe, and Robert Bauer and John Hume of the law firm of \nPerkins Coie.\n  While in Baton Rouge our teams met with Gov. Mike Foster--a \nRepublican, the President of the Senate Randy Ewing, and the Speaker of \nthe House ``H.B.'' Hunt Downer, Jr.--both Democrats, each of whom \nexpressed their full cooperation in the conduct of the Senate's \ninvestigation.\n  Meetings were also held with the Secretary of State Fox McKeithan, \nthe Commissioner of Elections Jerry Fowler, and others, and again full \ncooperation and assistance as needed were offered.\n  Senator Ford and I have requested the assistance of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation in the form of a detail of investigative \nagents. I ask unanimous consent that our letter to the Attorney General \nof the United States, Janet Reno, and to the Director of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                     Rules and Administration,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     The Attorney General, Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General and Director Freeh: As you are \n     aware, the Committee on Rules and Administration is \n     conducting a preliminary investigation into allegations of \n     fraud and other irregularities which reportedly occurred in \n     the 1996 U.S. Senate race in Louisiana. The Committee \n     anticipates that this investigation will last approximately \n     45 days.\n       The Committee has hired outside counsel to advise the \n     Committee and direct this investigation. It is their strong \n     recommendation that the Committee augment our resources with \n     professional investigators. In order to expedite and \n     facilitate this investigation, and ensure the level of \n     investigative professionalism required in such a case, the \n     Committee respectfully requests the assistance of detailees \n     from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       The Committee has identified an immediate need for two \n     detailees, preferably with a familiarity with Louisiana, and \n     the New Orleans area specifically. As the investigation \n     progresses, the Committee anticipates a need for at least two \n     additional detailees. We ask that these detailees be provided \n     to the Committee on a non-reimbursable basis, with the \n     Committee bearing the associated travel expenses for these \n     detailees, pursuant to Senate rules.\n       The Committee has secured space in the Hale Boggs Federal \n     Building in New Orleans for the duration of this \n     investigation with the expectation that attorneys for the \n     Committee will begin occupying that space by early next week. \n     Due to the timeliness of this investigation, we would hope \n     that two detailees could be made available to the Committee \n     at the same time so that the Committee investigation could \n     begin promptly.\n       It is important to the Committee that this investigation be \n     conducted with the utmost\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\n     professionalism and respect for the individuals involved, in \n     particular, the elected officials and citizenry of Louisiana. \n     The reputation and integrity of the Bureau make it the most \n     appropriate source for such assistance. We anticipate that a \n     memorandum of understanding regarding the deployment of these \n     detailees will need to be signed between your office(s) and \n     the Committee. We are prepared to execute that document \n     immediately.\n       We greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wendell H. Ford,\n       Ranking Member.\n     John Warner,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this past Wednesday, May 21, I met with \nthe Deputy Attorney General, Seth Waxman, and the Deputy Director of \nthe FBI, William Esposito, and later spoke by telephone with the \nDirector, Louis Freeh. The Deputy Attorney General has advised me this \nmorning that our request for FBI investigators has been approved.\n  The arrangements between the Rules Committee and the Department of \nJustice parallel those between the Justice Department and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. As detailees, the FBI investigators \nwill report jointly, through Committee staff, to myself and the ranking \nmember.\n  In addition, two accounting specialists, including a Certified Public \nAccountant, will be detailed to the Committee from the General \nAccounting Office to assist in the review and assessment of a \nconsiderable volume of election documents. This important phase of the \ninvestigation will begin next week.\n  Finally, Senator Ford and I have agreed on the issuance of the first \nround of subpoenas to State officials for numerous election documents.\n  I close this sequential report to the Senate with the same two \nstatements I have made in the past. First, there has been no \nallegation, thus far, in this case of any illegal actions on the part \nof Senator Landrieu.\n  Second, the goal of this investigation is to fulfill the Senate's \nduty under the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 5. Pursuant to \nthis duty the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration authorized \nthis investigation to: determine the existence or absence of a body of \nfact that would justify the Senate in making the determination that \nfraud, irregularities, or other errors, in the aggregate, affected the \noutcome of the election for U.S. Senator in the State of Louisiana in \n1996.\n  As developments occur, of such significance as to inform Senators, I \nwill promptly speak on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5081-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CAMPAIGN FINANCE HEARINGS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today that the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration will be holding two additional \nhearings on the issue of campaign finance reform after the short \nrecess.\n  On June 18, we will be honored to have as witnesses two of our former \ncolleagues, Vice-President Walter Mondale and Senator Nancy Kassebaum-\nBaker. They will be speaking on their work as cochairs of a committee \nformed by President Clinton to generate public support for campaign \nfinance reform. We anticipate that the other witnesses will concentrate \non the difficult legal and policy issues involved with regulation of \nissue advocacy and independent expenditures. These two phenomena grew \nsharply in importance in 1996 and deserve a thorough review by the \nCommittee.\n  The other hearing, scheduled for June 25, will address the issue of \nwhether certain campaign contributions are indeed voluntary. I plan to \nfocus on union dues and Senator Nickles' Paycheck Protection Act, which \nwould require a union member to affirmatively give the union permission \nto use his or her dues' money for partisan political activity and would \nmake sure that no person is compelled to contribute to a campaign \nwithout their consent.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Ford, the ranking minority \nmember, will invite witnesses to discuss political activity by \ncorporations and tax-exempt organizations, and the effect of such \nactivity on the shareholders and donors to these organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5082-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5082-S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VIRGINIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BI-ANNUAL DINNER\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Through \nmy years in the Senate I have worked with community leaders from \nVirginia as well as Maryland and the District of Columbia.\n  John ``Till'' Hazel, Jr., is one with whom I have had a long personal \nfriendship--as did our fathers, both medical doctors.\n  But transcending friendship, we have had our full measure of \nagreements, and disagreements, on issues affecting this area.\n  This month the State of Virginia Chamber of Commerce honored ``Till'' \nHazel by inviting him to give his report on the State of the Union of \nthis greater metropolitan area.\n  I was present as the audience received with great respect his strong, \noutspoken, message.\n  Since it bears on our present and future responsibility as an \nintegral part, and voice, of this area, I ask unanimous consent that \nhis statement be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Remarks by John T. Hazel, Jr., Virginia Chamber of Commerce \n                   Congressional Dinner, May 8, 1997\n\n       It is a personal privilege and great honor to address this \n     distinguished gathering of political and business leaders \n     and, particularly, to share with you observations and \n     concerns regarding Virginia's position in the national and \n     international economy as we hurtle toward the 21st century.\n       Virginians are a proud people, we have a wonderful \n     geographic location, and a history and tradition of \n     conservative and prudent leadership commitment to our \n     citizens. However, that tradition cannot allow complacency \n     which is at times the excuse for lack of vision and often the \n     enemy of prosperity.\n       My focus today is upon the future of Virginia and what we \n     must do to assure a high level of prosperity in a knowledge \n     driven economy. Change, at the pace we are experiencing it, \n     challenges us all with deciding what to keep and what to \n     discard. We face great opportunities if we choose wisely and \n     great hazards if we do not.\n       Reference to history and tradition is for the purpose of \n     perspective. We cannot prosper if we live in the past. It is \n     the future to which we must look. No day is complete without \n     reference in print or electronic media of economic \n     competition on a global basis. No state nor locality is \n     isolated from economic competition. We must develop a \n     realistic data base and an exciting vision for the future \n     with an emphasis upon growth and prosperity. Current data is \n     not encouraging.\n       Despite vigorous efforts by Governor Allen and development \n     agencies, net job growth in the first six years of the 90s \n     has been only half of net job growth in the 80s. Projections \n     regarding the future do not suggest a return to the robust \n     job growth of the 80s without vigorous new efforts. Indeed, \n     if the technology sector largely based in Northern Virginia \n     is removed from the data, job growth in Virginia thus far in \n     the 90s is zero or perhaps negative.\n       The lack of robust job growth is particularly troubling \n     since the population of Virginia has increased by more than \n     one million people since 1980. Measured against the national \n     average, Virginia is no better than average in the United \n     States in job growth and, indeed, for the past several years \n     has been below the national average--ranking 33rd in the \n     nation. Personal income growth has tracked job growth causing \n     the income of the average Virginia family to be only \n     approximately equal to the national average with personal \n     income growth ranking only 29th in the nation.\n       EDS, a major national corporation with heavy employment in \n     Virginia, represents that lack of skilled workers has \n     affected its employment base and economic health. There are \n     many other similar examples. Eighteen thousand technology-\n     based jobs are unfilled in Virginia while employment in \n     absolute terms is only at or below the national average.\n       Virginia no longer competes for job growth simply with its \n     sister states. A recent conversation with the CEO of a \n     concern with global operations suggests that Ph.Ds in Pacific \n     Rim countries can be found for a lifetime training cost of \n     $100,000 versus $1,000,000 in the United States, and \n     engineers can be hired who do very satisfactory work which is \n     then exported to the United States from Bangladesh at 20% of \n     the cost of an engineer in the United States.\n       Certainly, we as Virginians do and must aspire to be the \n     best. It is abundantly clear that we are barely average in \n     the critical areas of job growth and individual income. We, \n     as business and political leaders, cannot fail to lead our \n     citizens to achieve the very best.\n       Where must we look to correct this mediocre or less than \n     mediocre performance? The answer is investment and \n     reinvestment in essential infrastructure. Education, \n     transportation and our financial base.\n\n[[Page S5083]]\n\n       Education today is best described as K-L. L does not refer \n     to law school but to K thru Life. To compete successfully at \n     the national and international level, education must never \n     end. Training and retraining are the keys to our economic \n     future. With 18,000 technology jobs in Virginia unfilled \n     because of lack of trained employees, the problem is \n     immediate, clear and compelling.\n       But when we review the commitment of Virginia to education, \n     we find that legislative studies have identified a $6.2 \n     billion immediate need to enhance local schools. A need \n     without suggested solution. Virginia ranks only 43rd in \n     higher education support, and simply to equal the southern \n     states average will require a commitment of an additional \n     $200 million per year indefinitely for operating requirements \n     only. Virginia had achieved in the 80s a slow and steady pace \n     toward a modest level of quality and funding in its \n     institutions of higher education. Unfortunately, the \n     depression of the early 90s and the requirements of a \n     balanced budget caused the political system to withdraw in \n     excess of $100 million per year from higher education with an \n     invitation to the individual institutions to increase tuition \n     in lieu of an increase in state taxes. This was done and the \n     budget successfully balanced from the pocketbook of students \n     and their parents without an increase in taxes. The \n     predictable result in Virginia public tuition is among the \n     very highest in the nation.\n       As the economic crisis ended, funding for higher education \n     in Virginia continued to be restricted. The average \n     investment per thousand dollars of individual income dropped \n     from $12 in 1979 to $6.76 today--a drop of 44% in funding. \n     This decrease means that Virginia's record for financial \n     support for higher education is one of the worst in the \n     nation. The results are evident in every direction. The belt \n     tightening of the universities, despite serious \n     restructuring efforts, has reached harmful proportions.\n       The president of one of Virginia's leading institutions \n     recently testified that in offering faculty positions to \n     sustain excellence in a core discipline, 11 of 12 offers were \n     rejected on the basis of inadequate compensation. The same is \n     not true with priorities elsewhere. Indeed, we seem to have \n     no limit to what we are willing to pay for athletic \n     excellence, but payment for academic excellence is demeaned \n     and ignored.\n       Technology is much talked about and little funded.\n       The community college system--a cornerstone of work force \n     training and retraining--has been forced to reduce worker \n     access and increase tuition for programs which are \n     fundamental to preparation for skilled jobs.\n       In recent years, capital improvements have been paid for \n     largely by debt. Now debt increases are frozen to sustain \n     Virginia's bond rating and no provision made for critical \n     capital improvements.\n       In Virginia, a state with a proud heritage from the days of \n     the Founding Fathers, support of higher education now ranks \n     at the low end of the nation. Thomas Jefferson believed that \n     higher education should be available ``within a day's ride of \n     all Virginians'' and founded a university of which we are all \n     proud, but today, with the demand for quality education \n     perhaps more critical to the prosperity of Virginians than \n     ever before, political and business leadership refuses to \n     recognize effectively the need. As the economy of Virginia \n     converts from mining, manufacturing and agriculture, the \n     principal asset of the citizens of Virginia is their \n     intellectual power and skill. Intellectual skill must be \n     enhanced and nurtured. As Governors Godwin, Holton and \n     Baliles made clear in their landmark statement of January \n     1995:\n       ``Now is the time to make critical key investments in \n     Virginia's future. We believe the place to start is by \n     reaffirming public support for our unique system of higher \n     education. . . .''\n       The transportation infrastructure of Virginia continues to \n     service more citizens with vastly more miles of travel than \n     ever before without recognition of additional funding \n     requirements. As gas mileage increases, highway revenues by \n     mile decrease.\n       Principal deficiencies impact the entire state. Hampton \n     Roads has identified approximately $20 billion in \n     transportation improvements necessary. Bridges and tunnels \n     are very expensive, but the need cannot be denied.\n       Virginia requires an upgrade of I-81 now carrying three \n     times the truck traffic for which it was designed and without \n     any financial plan for improvement. Roanoke and Richmond have \n     demonstrated needs of several billion dollars each if their \n     commerce is to continue to move freely.\n       Northern Virginia shares with the Washington region \n     national recognition as the second worst gridlock in the \n     nation. There are clearly demonstrated multi-billion dollar \n     requirements. The total of state transportation requirements \n     over the next twenty years is an absolute minimum of $35 \n     billion and could range upward to over $50 billion by \n     Virginia Department of Highway estimates. Despite these \n     needs, the Highway Department can only identify $12 billion \n     of likely available funds and that number is seriously \n     suspect as maintenance requirements erode construction funds.\n       Traffic gridlock is frequently equaled only by political \n     gridlock in resolving problems. Within a few miles of this \n     hall, we endure an infamous example of political gridlock. In \n     1945, the US Army Corps of Engineers constructed a dozen \n     bridges across the Rhine River under hostile fire. The \n     political system at Federal and State levels has been \n     gridlocked in discussions regarding replacement of the \n     Woodrow Wilson bridge for ten years already and is still \n     without an action plan for construction. Some years ago the \n     life of the bridge was determined to be 9 years. By my \n     calculations we have 7 years, 4 months and 20 minutes before \n     it collapses into the River. But have no fear, further down \n     the River even the downsized Army Corps of Engineers at Ft. \n     Belvoir should be able to erect a pontoon crossing to save us \n     from the fruits of political gridlock.\n       Finally, in reviewing the infrastructure in Virginia, we \n     must look to the fiscal situation, and it is grim. \n     Philosophically, Virginia was a few short years ago a no debt \n     state--one of the few in the nation. How different today. The \n     fastest growing item in the Virginia budget is debt service.\n       During the 90s to balance the budget, a series of emergency \n     measures were utilized. There was a pledge to citizens who \n     voted for the lottery that proceeds would be only for capital \n     construction. Yet now lottery proceeds exceeding $300 million \n     annually are a vital part of the general fund despite that \n     commitment. In addition to the transfer of lottery funds to \n     the general fund, a series of single shot annual measures \n     have been utilized to balance the budget. The most onerous \n     being increased tuition.\n       Perhaps the most dramatic example of the current problem \n     was the recent discussion of what new lottery game could be \n     adopted to provide additional revenue for the general fund \n     without encouraging addictive gambling. I never knew until \n     the General Assembly discussion that some lottery games were \n     addictive and some were not. In any event, a new lottery game \n     and the fortuitous settlement of the litigation allowed the \n     state to eke out a balanced budget last Session.\n       Virginia has a serious structural deficit in state \n     finances. General fund revenues do not cover expenses. It is \n     politically convenient to ignore the deficit, and it is \n     policy apparently on a non-partisan basis to continue to \n     promise no tax increases and talk tax cuts without \n     reference to financing commitments, expenditures, income \n     and investment in our future.\n       Where is Virginia as we look forward to the future--a \n     future which should be founded upon optimism, enthusiasm and \n     strength? The people of Virginia are intelligent, committed, \n     and have high level of work ethic an integrity. Mr. \n     Jefferson, as did other Founding Fathers, believed that an \n     informed public was fundamental to prosperity, health and \n     enjoyment in the democratic system.\n       Unfortunately, the difficulty in today's world is in \n     assuring an informed public. Virginians have indicated in \n     overwhelming numbers at all levels an awareness that higher \n     education is the key to individual prosperity and a desire to \n     have a transportation system that functions. Yet we are, at \n     the political level, unwilling to make it clear what the \n     needs are and how they will be paid for. Business has failed \n     to demand political accountability and politicians have \n     failed to inform.\n       We are in the early stages of yet another political \n     campaign in which the prevailing political wisdom apparently \n     is directed at ignoring needs and, thus, the costs.\n       In higher education, there is a determined effort to reduce \n     costs by reducing the number of students to be educated which \n     is simply to deny access to education to a significant number \n     of citizens. There are those who sponsor denying education to \n     those who are ``below average''--a shocking thought when \n     contemplated seriously. There is a suggestion that faculties \n     are commodities and quality in a faculty is not related to \n     quality in the educational product.\n       There is a complete denial essentially by silence of the \n     urgent and compelling needs of transportation.\n       Business leadership must demand that candidates for any \n     office be required to address in specifics what programs they \n     intend to dismantle, and what new commitments they are \n     unwilling to make. Thus far, we have been treated to denial. \n     The people of Virginia deserve better. We need leadership \n     which will understand the need for reinvestment and new \n     investment in Virginia's future--who will understand that we \n     are part of an international economy in a knowledge driven \n     world of technology and that the only competitive edge we \n     have is our infrastructure.\n       While my comments have focused principally on higher \n     education, transportation and fiscal needs which are the \n     fundamentals, if other areas of the infrastructure are not \n     enhanced the capability of Virginia to compete is further \n     weakened.\n       Without investment and reinvestment, we cannot expect to be \n     competitive as we enter the next century. No business leader \n     can fail to invest in the future. Why should our great state \n     be denied investment in the future? We cannot allow Virginia \n     to be weakened at this time of intense global competition by \n     denial of problems and refusal to debate the issues because \n     the solutions may be politically uncomfortable. Virginia has \n     the capacity for investment. We lack the political will.\n       The citizens of Virginia are entitled to be informed and to \n     decide whether we should settle for mediocrity in job growth, \n     in education,in transportation and in our financial base. We \n     cannot accept a political leadership which denies Virginians \n     the tools necessary for future prosperity.\n       Our goals must be a system of higher education among the \n     best in the country. Not a quibble over 43rd or 44th. A K-12 \n     system which prepares graduates for accelerated\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\n     learning and successful participation in the workplace, a \n     first class system of transportation, and a financial \n     structure with bi-partisan support that addresses with \n     political honesty funding requirements.\n       Virginia must create a competitive position in global \n     markets in the new century with an unrestricted commitment to \n     excellence in providing our citizens with the tools of \n     prosperity in a world of intense competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5082-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5084-S5086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIARY VACANCIES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take just a few minutes on \njudges, because I want to make two basically important points on \njudges.\n  At the outset, first, the current vacancy levels are not the product \nof some alleged Republican stall on judges.\n  Second, the Senate's constitutional advise-and-consent responsibility \nshould not be reduced to a mere numbers game.\n  At the end of the last session, we had 65 judge vacancies. Last year, \nwe had 21 judges nominated. We put through 17. We would have put \nthrough four more except for Democratic objections to their own \njudges--not to the judges, but to putting them forward, because one \nDemocrat was not getting the judges that he wanted.\n  Let me just elaborate for a minute or two on those two points.\n  Mr. President, this is not a numbers game. Let me make an important \npoint, which is this. Federal judges should not be confirmed as part of \na numbers game or to reduce the vacancy rate to a particular level.\n  While I plan to oversee a fair and principled confirmation process, \nas I always have, I want to emphasize that the primary criteria in this \nprocess is not how many vacancies need to be filled, but whether \nPresident Clinton's, or whoever the President is, whether their \nnominees are qualified to serve on the bench and will not, upon \nreceiving their judicial commission, spend a lifetime, a career, \nrendering politically motivated activist decisions.\n  The Senate has an obligation to the American people to thoroughly \nreview the records of all nominees it receives to ensure that they are \ncapable and qualified to serve as Federal judges. These are lifetime \nappointments with lifetime full benefits after they retire. Frankly, \nthe record of activism demonstrated by so many of the Clinton judges \nand nominees calls for more vigilance in reviewing these nominees.\n  The current vacancies are not the result of a Republican stall. I \nthink that is another point that has been widely distorted in recent \nweeks. The argument is that the Republicans are somehow stalling these \njudges. The facts show rather clearly that the current vacancies are \nnot the result of Republican stall tactics.\n  First of all, at the end of the last Congress there were 65 \nvacancies. Today there are 100, 74 of which have not even had a \nrecommended nominee. I have been here a long time, but I have never \nheard we had to confirm people who were not even nominated.\n  There are 26; and we now have put through 5. We have four more that \nwe put out of the committee yesterday, who I believe will go through \nquite soon. And we will have another markup of judges perhaps a week \nafter we get back.\n  Let me just make this point so that we can resolve some of these \nproblems.\n  These vacancies were caused by a record level of resignations in the \npast few months.\n  During President Clinton's first 4 years, we confirmed 202 judges. \nThat is a near record high and nearly one-quarter of the entire Federal \nbench.\n  By the close of last Congress, there were only 65 vacancies. This is \nvirtually identical to the number of vacancies under the Democratic \nchairman in the previous Congress. The Department of Justice itself \nstated that this level of vacancies represents virtual full employment \nin the Federal courts. So last Congress we were more than fair to \nPresident Clinton in his judicial nominees. We reduced the vacancy \nlevel to the level which the Justice Department itself considers \nvirtual full employment.\n  But since the election last fall, 35 judges have either resigned or \ntaken senior status. That is a dramatic number in such a short period, \nwhich has led to the current level of 100 vacancies.\n  Now, current vacancy rates are not an unprecedented crisis. Let me \njust point that out by saying there has only been a 5 percent increase \nin the vacancy rate. Keep in mind that 63 vacancies, a vacancy rate \njust over 7 percent, is considered virtual full employment, and 100 \nvacancies is a vacancy rate just over 12 percent. How can a 5 percent \nrise in the vacancy rate convert ``full employment'' into a ``crisis.''\n  The Democratic Senate left a much higher vacancy rate under President \nBush. But compare today's 100 vacancies to that under a Democratic \nSenate during President Bush's Presidency.\n  In May 1991--the same time we are at right now--there were 148 \nvacancies. That is during President Bush's tenure. In May of 1992, \nagain in President Bush's tenure, there were 117 vacancies. So that 148 \nand 117, respectively, is more than we have right now.\n  Now, I find it interesting that at that time I do not recall reading \na single article or watching a single interview on judicial vacancies. \nSo, in short, I think it is quite unfair and, frankly, inaccurate to \nreport that the Republican Congress has created a vacancy crisis in the \ncourts.\n  Now, I might add that judicial emergencies simply mean that the seat \nhas been unfilled for a certain period of time. In reality, though, \nmany of them are far from emergencies. Indeed, of the 24 alleged \njudicial emergencies, the administration has not even put up a nominee \nfor 11 of those seats. How do you blame the Congress for that? As for \nthe others, I think you will find a number of the relevant districts do \nnot, in fact, have an overburdensome caseload, and, in fact, some of \nthe senior judges are suggesting that we reexamine the number of judges \nin their area and reduce them because they do not need them. It costs \nat least $1 million a year for every judge in this country, and there \nare well over 800.\n  All of this being said, I feel very strongly we must do our best to \nreduce the vacancies in the Federal courts. Frankly, there are limits \nto what we can do, especially with what the administration has done so \nfar. The fact of the matter is that, excluding two brand new nominees \nwhose paperwork we have not yet received and cannot process because we \nhave not yet received it, there are only 26 nominees for these 100 \nvacancies, meaning 74 vacancies are without nominees. Of these 26, 8 \nhave already had hearings and are either on the Senate floor or about \nto be reported out of committee. So we are moving on nominees, and we \nwill continue to move.\n  The problem, however, is that many of the remaining 18 nominees who \nhave not yet had committee action are in one way or another problematic \nor controversial. All but a few of them were carried over from the last \nCongress, and I can assure you that there is a reason why the Senate \nconfirmed 202 other nominees but not them. If and when the \nadministration sends us qualified, noncontroversial nominees, they will \nbe processed fairly and promptly, and I am trying to process these \ncontroversial nominees to the extent that we can and certainly am \ntrying to do so fairly and promptly.\n  Take Mr. Alan Gold from Florida, for example. He was nominated in \nFebruary of this year. We completed his paperwork and review in March \nand April. He had a hearing 2 weeks ago and was reported out of the \ncommittee yesterday, just to give an illustration.\n  When the administration sends us problematic nominees, it takes much \nmore time and it is much more difficult to process them, and the \nadministration knows this. I think my colleagues on the other side know \nthis. If all we are left with are judges whom we are not ready to move, \nI will not compromise our advise-and-consent constitutional function, I \nwill not compromise it simply because the White House has not sent up \nqualified nominees. As I said at the outset, the Senate's advise-and-\nconsent function should not be reduced to a mere numbers game. The \nconfirmation of an individual to serve for life as a Federal judge is a \nvery serious matter and it should be treated as such.\n  Now, we have had a lot of complaining and yelling and screaming about \nthis, but to be honest with you, we are much better than a number of \nprior Congresses where Democrats had control of the Judiciary Committee \nand when they had control of the floor as\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\nwell. President Clinton has not been mistreated. He has not been \ntreated unfairly, and his nominees have not been mistreated or treated \nunfairly. In fact, we have yet to have a nominee who has been rejected \non the floor during the Clinton administration, although I felt that at \nleast two of them should have been.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee can stay on the floor just for a moment \nbecause I intend to refer to some of the things he has said.\n  To begin with, the distinguished chairman is a close personal friend \nof mine, not the least of which I find that, as a Grateful Dead fan of \nlong standing, I enjoy his gospel music. So we do have some areas that \njoin us.\n  I must take exception to some of the remarks he has made about \nFederal judges. He mentioned that none had been rejected on the floor. \nWell, of course they have. We have had the average of one a month. At \nthis rate, with 100 vacancies, it is zero population growth in the \nFederal judiciary. President Clinton will not be in office long enough \nnor will the next two Presidents, to see all these vacancies filled--\nnot if you do one a month.\n  When he says none have been rejected on the floor, that is because \nthese are extraordinarily well-qualified people and they are going to \nbe voted for on this floor. In fact, even Merrick Garland they held up \nfor so long. When Judge Garland came here, some people--for whatever \nreasons, ideological or whatever--voted against him, but not one person \nsuggested he was not extraordinarily well qualified; in fact, one of \nthe best qualified judges we have seen in years. In fact, even some who \nvoted against him commended his qualifications. So it became just a \npolitical, partisan thing.\n  I suspect that the 27 judges that are being held in limbo or in the \nprison of the Senate Judiciary Committee, if they had a fair vote on \nthis floor, would all be confirmed overwhelmingly because Senators \nwould not want to have to go back to their State and try to explain to \npeople why, other than for purely partisan motives, they voted against \nsome of these judges.\n  So, how do you defeat the judges? You make sure they never come \nforward. I will give you an example--Margaret Morrow. Margaret Morrow \ncame before our committee last year. She had to go through all the \nusual and appropriate confirmation hearings, and she was voted out of \nthe committee unanimously, but somehow they made sure she never came to \nthe floor for a vote.\n  So this year Margaret Morrow was brought back again and told she was \ngoing to be put in her place. All the men who were candidates for the \nFederal judiciary were brought up first and she was told to sit there--\nalthough she had been here once before and unanimously confirmed, she \nwas told to sit there in the back of the room waiting for the others to \nbe confirmed or to be heard.\n  Now, I keep bringing this issue up at the Judiciary Committee \nmeeting, and I am told there are no objections to her, but somehow she \nis never brought forward to be voted on. I keep saying, if Senators \nwant to vote against her, stand up, have the guts to stand up in the \nbright sunshine and say how they would vote on her, but nobody does, \nnobody does.\n  She was asked such questions as how she votes. There were over 100 \ninitial questions before it became too embarrassing, and then how did \nshe vote on initiatives in California. I raise the question, and I hope \nthat all Senators, Republicans and Democrats, would agree with me on \nthis, that the Senate demeans itself if it starts asking people how \nthey voted in the secrecy of the voting booth. I would never allow \nsomebody to ask me how I voted unless I really wanted to tell how I \nvoted in the secrecy of the voting booth. The distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia would not allow that. The distinguished Senator from \nUtah would not allow that. And I suspect the Senator who asked the \nquestion would not allow it of himself. She is supported by the \nRepublican mayor of Los Angeles. She is supported by significant \nRepublicans and Democrats in California. She was the president of the \nCalifornia Bar Association, the first woman ever elected to that \nposition--the president of the Los Angeles Bar Association--but somehow \nshe does not come on to the floor.\n  I suspect that if she was brought for a vote, she would win \noverwhelmingly. She would win with 90 votes in the Senate, at least, \nbut apparently she loses with one vote of an anonymous Senator who \nhides behind a veil of secrecy and will not tell us why he or she is \nholding her up.\n  Now, is this full employment of the Federal judiciary? Not according \nto the Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist. Chief \nJustice Rehnquist says the situation is bleak --not full employment, \nbut bleak.\n  We have emergencies existing. The ninth circuit has a quarter to a \nthird of all judges missing. Will the White House have more judges \ncoming up? Of course they will. But do not blame the White House; blame \nthe U.S. Senate. We have had more vacations and recesses in the Senate \nthan we have had judges. We ought to at least do the job we are paid to \ndo.\n  Of course, I agree with the distinguished Senator from Utah that we \nshould scrutinize all judges. We can do that, but do it, and then get \non with our work. We get paid plenty. We ought to do it.\n  What I see happening, Mr. President, when you have a Congressman from \nTexas who says that judges should be impeached because he, the \nCongressman, happens to disagree with their decisions--Mr. President, I \nread the Constitution. I have my own copy, supplied to me by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, and I say to my friend \nfrom West Virginia that I looked through that copy and I found grounds \nof impeachment--high crimes and misdemeanors. I did not find grounds of \nimpeachment that you annoyed a Congressman from Texas or anywhere else.\n  I do not think that was ever contemplated by the Founders, I say to \nmy good friend. But this is the kind of ridiculous thing we have, all \nof which is aimed at going against the independence of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  We had somebody else who proposed the Congress have the ability to \nstand up and vote to override any judicial decision. What does that do \nto the independence and what does it have to do with our workload? Here \nit is May 23, and we are finally passing the budget that the law \nrequires us to pass on April 15. Can you imagine if we had to then vote \non several thousand judicial decisions each year? This is what we are \nhearing. Again, a conservative Republican Justice, Justice Scalia, says \nthis is going too far. I agree with him.\n  As I said earlier to the distinguished Republican leader--I was on \nthe floor--I hope that he would work to see this does not continue. \nMajority leaders of the Senate, the 22 years I have been here, Senators \nMansfield, Byrd, Baker, Dole and Mitchell, all great leaders, all \nleaders who said there are certain things where partisanship has to \nend. The President of the United States has the authority under the \nConstitution to appoint judges. We advise and consent. We are not the \nappointers of judges. He is. We can recommend, we can advise and we can \nconsent. But once he has appointed them, then if we do not like them, \nvote them down. But do not take on the pride of 100 Senators around \nhere.\n  I suspect, regarding the press accounts, that the distinguished \nSenator from Utah has certain restraints from within his own caucus. I \nunderstand that. But I urge this. We are going to go out of session now \nfor 10 days or so, a week, whatever it is. I urge, as I have before, \nthat the distinguished majority leader, the distinguished Democratic \nleader, the distinguished Senator from Utah and I sit down and try to \nfind if there is a way to start moving these judges from the Senate, \nand from the Senate end how we can move faster. If people do not like \nthem, vote against them, but do not hold them in limbo; and then I \nsuggest we meet with the President of the United States.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say that the Senator from Vermont is \na dear friend of mine. There is no question about that. We enjoy \nworking together.\n  But I think the points that I have made are very valid points. The \nadministration has taken up to 618 days to name each nominee. That is \nreally twice the time that historically it has taken in prior \nadministrations in the\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\nWhite House. At an average of 618 days for each vacancy President \nClinton has taken to fill, according to my calculations--I could be \nwrong--but it would take more than 125 years to fill all 74 vacancies.\n  So, you can play this numbers game. All I am saying is I dedicate \nmyself to try to do the best I can to get these judges through. I \nappreciate the help my colleague gives me in that regard. I think, as \nwe get more of these nominees up here, we will get more of them to the \nfloor.\n  But I appreciate his remarks. I just do not quite agree with them, \nthat is all.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will continue to work with my good friend \nfrom Utah. In the meantime, I will send him my Grateful Dead tapes, and \nI will listen to his music and we will both be in a better mood.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, I want to take this opportunity to \nhighlight a growing problem with securities fraud in this country--a \nproblem which affects thousands of American families who are now \ninvesting their hard earned savings in a booming stock market. The \nproblem involves the fraudulent manipulation of the stocks of small \ncompanies in scams which can literally wipe out investors who place \ntheir trust in unscrupulous brokers and stock promoters.\n  Fraud in the sale of small company stocks has been increasing at an \nalarming rate. In the typical case, unscrupulous brokerage firms, often \noperating through intermediaries, purchase large positions in a company \nwhich is worthless or of very limited value and then drive its price \nhigher through manipulation. They do this by aggressively cold calling \nthousands of unsuspecting individuals, often inexperienced in \ninvesting, and persuading them to purchase the company's stock by \ngreatly exaggerating its financial prospects. The inevitable effect of \nthis massive sales campaign is to push the price higher, at which point \nthe brokerage firm dumps its shares, leaving the public holding \ninvestments which rapidly become worthless.\n  According to published reports and court proceedings, these schemes \noften utilize other illegal or unethical practices, including: The \ndissemination of false information on which investors rely, the \nemployment by brokerage firms of persons with criminal records, as well \nas the use of unlicensed individuals whose only activity is ostensibly \nto prospect for customers but who often participate in making sales for \nwhich they are paid under the table; and the bribing of brokers to \nassist in the manipulation by recommending the stock to their trusting \ncustomers.\n  These securities fraud schemes have been uncovered in recent \nprosecutions and criminal investigations. At least four grand juries \naround the country are investigating small-stock manipulation--what may \nbe the financial crime of the 1990's, just as insider trading was the \nfinancial crime of the 1980's. Indeed, according to published articles, \na Federal grand jury in Los Angeles has even investigated a Federal \nprosecutor suspected of engaging in securities fraud. And last year, an \nFBI sting operation in New York City resulted in the arrest of 46 \nindividuals for this type of activity.\n  In recent years, the soaring stock market has attracted millions of \nnew investors, many of them hard working families trying to save for \nthe future or elderly Americans trying to expand their retirement \nsavings. it is understandable that these individuals, confronted with \nthe prospect of astronomical tuition bills for their children or \nescalating medical costs for themselves, fall prey to sales pitches \npromising high returns in what are supposed to be the glamour companies \nof the future.\n  Overall, it is estimated that one in three American households have \nsome of their assets invested in the stock market. Most do not have the \ntime or the resources to carefully scrutinize stock offerings to \ndetermine which ones are fraudulent, instead putting their faith in \nbrokers, who, because they are licensed by the Government, the public \nbelieves it has reason to trust.\n  Mr. President, some years ago I served as the State of Maine's \nCommissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial \nRegulation, and one of the responsibilities of my department was the \nprotection of investors in my State. While that experience taught me \nthat America has the most dynamic and healthiest capital markets in the \nworld, it also taught me that there is no shortage of con artists and \nfraudulent schemes. What was true then unfortunately appears to be true \ntoday, and regrettably, there is evidence that the problem may be more \nwidespread.\n  While the vast majority of those who work in our securities industry \nare honest, we must be continually vigilant in safeguarding the \nintegrity of our markets. We must remain committed to combating what \nappears to be a new wave of securities fraud, involving the intense \nmarketing and subsequent manipulation of the stock offerings of small \ncompanies, many with high-tech sounding names. These offerings--when \npushed by overly aggressive and fraudulent marketing pitches to average \nAmerican families and the elderly--present a ripe opportunity to lull \nthe investing public into believing the stock is about to take off. Too \noften, these stocks do not soar to the heavens but rather fail to the \nground.\n  This fraud must be fought on a variety of fronts. The regulators must \ncontinue to enforce existing regulations and to watch for illegal \nactivity. The public must be more careful in investing in the stock \nmarket. And the Congress must--and will--closely investigate this \ngrowing problem of securities fraud.\n  As chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nMr. President. I am concerned about this fraud in the micro-capital \nmarkets--about this manipulation of small company stocks by Wall Street \nbandits. The subcommittee has a long and proud tradition of \ninvestigating schemes which rip off innocent consumers and taint the \nreputations of those who play by the rules. This investigative \ntradition will continue under my leadership. With more and more \nAmericans entering the stock market each year, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations will be looking closely at these \nmatters, investigating how these stock manipulation schemes victimize \nAmerican investors and how we can arrest this emerging securities \nfraud.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and in the Senate to protect the public from \nunscrupulous operators who would prey on hard working Americans seeking \nto participate in the American Dream through investment in the stock \nmarket. The expanding economic opportunities presented by a booming \nstock market should not benefit just the most wealthy Americans, but \nshould benefit average American families as well.\n  As the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I \npromise you that we will vigorously investigate those who abuse the \ntrust of their fellow citizens seeking to invest their hard earned \nsavings. I further pledge that we will be especially relentless in our \nefforts to expose schemes which exploit the elderly. During my tenure, \nthe subcommittee will use its investigative authority to shine the \nlight of truth on those who operate in the shadowy fringes of America's \ncapital markets.\n  I thank the Senate for its attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today I supported and the Senate \npassed a budget resolution negotiated primarily by the leadership of \nthe legislative and executive branches of our Government.\n  I supported this budget resolution, notwithstanding some major \ndisappointments with both the process and the result.\n  I qualify my support for the final agreement because I believe it \nfalls well short of the goals that we should have for a responsible \nfiscal policy to guide our Nation over the next 5 years and beyond.\n  But in the end, I recognize that this is probably the best product \nthe congressional leadership and this administration could agree on, \nand that we're much better off doing something than doing nothing.\n  And reaching this general consensus will free the Congress to get on \nwith many of the important matters that continuing gridlock would have \npostponed.\n  The commitment to reach a balanced budget early in the next century \ncan trace its roots to the hard work done by the President in 1993 and \nthe insistence last Congress, by the new congressional majority, that \nwe set 2002 as a ``date certain'' to actually reach balance.\n  And I think its fair to add that I doubt this agreement would have \nbeen possible without the bipartisan groundwork laid by the Centrist \nCoalition, a group of 22 Senators evenly divided between both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Our budget was the only balanced budget plan introduced last year \nwhich received bipartisan support.\n  Since passing the administration's deficit reduction package in 1993, \nwe have brought the deficit down from $290 billion to what most \nforecasters expect will be a $67 billion deficit this year.\n  With the aid of lower deficits, low interest rates, and low \ninflation, the economy continues to expand, bringing unemployment down \nto 4.9 percent and filling the Federal Treasury with unexpected \nreceipts.\n  These fundamentals, which I believe were set in motion with the \npassage of the 1993 plan, have now put a balanced budget within our \ngrasp, even if we're relying on some optimistic assumptions about \nrevenues on future Congresses making tougher decisions than we are \nmaking in this budget, and on the Social Security surplus to reach that \nfuture balance.\n  This is not an insignificant event. The last time the Federal \nGovernment submitted a balanced budget was in 1968--for fiscal year \n1969--and the surplus that year was only $3.2 billion.\n  As one who came to the Senate in January 1989 pledging to do all I \ncould to eliminate persistent budget deficits, the prospect of actually \nreaching our goal, even 5 years down the road, is certainly a welcome \nmilestone.\n  As I have already noted, however, this agreement is not all I had \nhoped it would be.\n  First, I'm very concerned about the assumptions which underlie the \nplan.\n  Less than 3 weeks ago, negotiators were putting the finishing touches \non this same basic budget outline, with a deficit of approximately $50 \nbillion in 2002.\n  It was only after the Congressional Budget Office revised its revenue \nforecasts that negotiations were able to claim a balanced budget.\n  To fully understand the impact of the CBO revision, the deficit \nprojections for the next 5 years are now a total of $250 billion less \nthan what CBO projected in January.\n  If we want to increase the likelihood that we will actually achieve \nbalance, it seems to me that we would want to use the most conservative \neconomic forecast that we have.\n  If we err in our projections, I would rather err on the side of doing \nmore deficit reduction than less than what is needed to do the job.\n  But even if the more optimistic assumptions come true and we do \nbalance the unified budget in 2002, this plan does little to address \nthe long-term fiscal challenges we face, and in some ways may \nexacerbate them.\n  While the budget calls for some modest steps to restrain the growth \nof entitlement spending, in the areas of Medicare and Medicaid, these \nmodest steps do not prevent entitlement spending from taking a larger \nshare of the budget.\n  Mandatory spending in the form of entitlements and interest on the \ndebt will consume over 70 percent of the budget by 2002.\n  This represents a complete reversal from 30 years ago when 70 percent \nof the budget went for defense and other discretionary investments.\n  And as mandatory spending takes up a greater share of the budget, \nthat leaves less room for investments in human and physical capital \nthat enhance future productivity and economic growth.\n  Not only does this budget not call for significant entitlement \nreform, the inclusion of tax cuts with large out-year costs also \nexacerbates our long-term fiscal problems.\n  As all of us know, we face a demographic wave, called the baby boom \ngeneration, that will double the number of people eligible for Social \nSecurity, and Medicare, between now and 2030.\n  By not addressing the long-term costs of Medicare and Social \nSecurity, and by failing to adopt an accurate measure of cost-of-living \nchanges, entitlements will continue to grow at an unsustainable pace. \nThat is at the same time, the tax cuts in this budget plan will take \naway the revenue needed to finance these expenditures.\n  The most likely result of this scenario is the continued cutbacks on \ndefense and other discretionary priorities in the future or even larger \nbudget deficits than what we have faced in the past.\n  As a result, I view this budget as more of a missed opportunity to \naddress our long-term fiscal challenges rather than the budget \nbalancing achievement that many are celebrating.\n  Notwithstanding my reservations about this agreement, however, and my \ndisappointment in some of its elements, I applaud the President and the \ncongressional leadership for their efforts to end the gridlock and \nreach a compromise that both sides could live with, even though the \ndeal closers were more spending to satisfy Democrats and more tax cuts \nto satisfy Republicans--tax cuts I might add that are made with \nborrowed money. Less of each would have eased the debt burden we are \npassing on to future generations, and I will work with my colleagues to \nmake it a more fiscally responsible plan along the way.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in order to accommodate several Senators \nwho wish to speak, I now ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be recognized to speak in the morning period in the order in \nwhich they are listed: Senator Abraham for 15 minutes, Senator Byrd, \nand then Senator Grams.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the case of Air Force 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn \nhas highlighted the need for an independent review of gender relations \nin the services.\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\n First, I think the publicity about this case has served as an \nunderstandable impetus for all of us to speak our minds on this issue. \nThat is, I think, useful, in that relations among the sexes in the \nmilitary obviously need a thorough, independent review in light of the \nscandals that have emerged in recent months.\n  It is imperative though, that as we review the rules regarding gender \nrelations in the military, we keep our eye on the ball. The ball is \nthat the goal should always be the most effective, combat-ready, \ndisciplined, tough fighting force that the Nation can field. \nEffectiveness, discipline, unit cohesion and morale cannot ever take a \nsecond place to any other value, since the premier responsibility of \nthe military is the national security of our Nation. If gender \nrelations must take a back seat to that goal, that is as it should be.\n  In the case of Lieutenant Flinn, the military justice system has \ntried to do its work, in spite of all the comment and publicity \nattendant to this case. There is a question about whether the Secretary \nof the Air Force should have granted Lieutenant Flinn a general \ndischarge in lieu of a court-martial. We all, I am sure, have opinions \nabout that. I personally feel that the charges of lying and disobeying \nthe order of a superior officer, never mind the charge of adultery, \nwhich, of course, no one condones, merit a disciplinary decision, and \nthat the Secretary should not have granted her a general discharge in \nlight of those charges. That is my opinion. Other Senators may have \nother views. However, I believe that the larger issue and perhaps the \nroot of the problem in this much publicized case may lie in the \nmilitary rules of fraternization. When it is permissible for members of \nthe opposite sex to socialize, live together, or otherwise fraternize, \nvaries considerably among the different services. The standards are \nseriously inconsistent. I have indicated that I intend to offer an \namendment to the upcoming fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization \nmeasure which would, if enacted, establish an independent outside \nreview commission to review the question of the appropriateness of \ngender integrated recruit training in the services. I think such a \ncommission could review, as well, the rules of fraternization with the \ngoal of recommending a single consistent fraternization standard for \nconduct among enlisted people, between enlisted people and officers, \nand among officers, which spans all the services. What is appropriate \nfor a soldier in the Army should also be appropriate for a sailor or an \nairman or a marine.\n  Mr. President, clearly we are in the middle of a national debate on \ngender relations and on general conduct in the services, and the work \nof an independent commission to review the many issues which have \narisen seems urgent, needed and very useful. In the meantime, I believe \nthat we politicians should refrain from urging particular decisions in \nspecific cases, and let the system work in the best way that it can \nuntil an opportunity has been had to systematically review the rules \nregarding gender relations and conduct in all of the services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5087-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5088-S5089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FALLEN HEROS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the traditional start of the summer \noutdoor season approaches, advertisers are busily reminding us that we \nhave only three days to ready our big yards for summer, or that hooray, \nwe have an extra day to spend on outdoor chores--using their newest \ntools, gadgets, and products, of course. Well, Mr. President, most of \nus will enjoy an extra day this weekend. That is cause for celebration. \nHowever, the purpose is to celebrate our fallen heros, not to celebrate \nanother opportunity to spend money.\n  Memorial Day is set aside to remember the final sacrifice made by \nmany brave men and women in the defense of our Nation and our ideals of \nliberty and justice. Though in many cases, years have passed since they \nlaid down their lives for us, the memory of these fallen heros should \nnot fade from our hearts, drowned out by the din of advertising or \nburied beneath a tide of sales circulars. I urge my colleagues, and the \nAmerican public, to pause for a moment this weekend, that they fly \ntheir flags, pause to set aside their dirt-covered gloves, to brush the \ngrass clippings from their pants legs, and to sit for a moment in the \nsun-dappled shade of an ancient tree, and thank these men and women who \nhave--to paraphrase the preamble to our mighty Constitution--provided \nfor the common defense, promoted the general welfare, and secured the \nblessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\n  In the United States, our fallen soldiers have been honored and \nremembered on Memorial Day since the time of the Civil War. That tragic \nconflict spawned so many spontaneous gestures of remembrance in our \ncountry that the location and the date of the first Memorial Day or \nDecoration Day--Decoration Day, as it was called--Ceremony is disputed.\n  One of the most moving and famous of the early Memorial Day tributes \noccurred in Columbus, Mississippi. On April 26, 1866, the women of \nColumbus gathered to decorate the graves of their husbands, brothers, \nlovers and friends who had been buried four years earlier after the \nBattle of Shiloh in a plot now known as Friendship Cemetery. The plot \ncontained the remains of 1500 confederate soldiers, but it also was the \nfinal resting place for 100 fallen federal troops.\n  The time was reconstruction. In 1866, much of the South was under \nmilitary occupation and was impoverished. Resentment and hatred still \nran high on both sides of the Mason Dixon line.\n  But, to these war-weary women, the time for hostilities was over. \nAfter scattering flowers on the graves of their own men, they decorated \nthe graves of the union men with magnolia blossoms.\n  But, like so many of our religious and secular days of remembrance, \nthe origin and purpose of Memorial Day have become at least partially \nobscured by the more immediate pleasures of a day off, the flash and \ndanger of a car race or the anticipation of good food at a picnic.\n  Let me quote from a book, The Good War, an oral history of World War \nII by Studs Terkel. In 1982, a woman of thirty told Terkel: ``I can't \nrelate to World War II. It's in schoolbook texts, that's all. Battles \nthat were won, battles that were lost. Or costume dramas you see on TV. \nIt's just a story in the past. It's so distant, so abstract. I don't \nget myself up in a bunch about it.''\n  Without a continued awareness of the real significance of this \nnational day of remembrance, we may eventually also largely forget the \ndifficult and invaluable lessons of the human cost and the ultimate \ntragedy of all warfare. Particularly today, when armed conflicts such \nas Desert Storm may seem glamorous, even entertaining and almost \nantiseptic in their efficiency, we must not forget as a nation that war \nalways means death, destruction, broken homes, broken families, twisted \nand maimed bodies and devastation.\n  While this Nation must never shrink from armed conflict if that is \nthe course we must take to protect our freedoms, we must also never \nforget nor minimize the horror of war, else we may someday risk its \ngrisly consequences too easily.\n\n  So it is my hope, that on this coming Memorial Day, all Americans \nwill take a few moments to remember the brave men and women who have \nfought and died to preserve this great nation and its principles of \nliberty and freedom. The personal suffering and sacrifice endured by \nour fallen soldiers and their families for the sake of our country must \nnot go without a measure of recognition by each of us on this most \nsolemn of days. These were real people, not just statistics in a \nhistory book or names chiseled on stone. These were young men and women \nwith sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, hopes, dreams, aspirations \nand fears just like the rest of us. At some future time, God forbid, \nthe names of our own sons, daughters and grandchildren could very well \nbe among those that are read at a ceremony honoring our fallen \nsoldiers.\n  Nothing confronts us with our common humanity--with our shared \nresponsibilities as citizens and with a renewed appreciation for the \nworth of our sacred and fragile freedoms like a contemplation of our \nnational conflicts, and the sorrow, heroism, death and sacrifice that \nhas accompanied each of them.\n  This weekend thousands of American families will visit cemeteries \naround the nation to remember husbands,\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\nwives, sons, daughters, grandfathers, great grandfathers and friends \nwho paid the ultimate price in this nation's conflict. All of us need \nto take time to show our solidarity with their grief and their \nsacrifice; to fly the flags at our homes, schools, cemeteries and \npublic places; to walk the eerie quiet of Antietam or Bull Run; visit \nthe local veterans' cemeteries; lay some flowers on the tomb of a \nfallen soldier; spend a quiet moment at the monuments to our honored \nwar dead; take our children in tow and teach them about all the brave \nyoung men and women who have paid so dearly in the past so that future \ngenerations can be free; and through that conscious effort and those \nsmall individual acts put a very human face on Memorial Day. Remember, \nspontaneous acts of remembrance such as these were what spawned \nMemorial Day in the first place. And they will always be the most \nmeaningful tributes of all.\n\n       In Flanders fields the poppies blow\n       Between the crosses, row on row,\n       That mark our place; and in the sky\n       The larks, still bravely singing, fly\n       Scarce heard amid the guns below.\n       We are the Dead.

Mr. President, I should like to talk a little bit about \ntoday's budget vote and some reasons why I had to anguish over it and \nvote no on this budget, a budget that I hoped we could all be proud of \nand we could go home and really tell our constituents we had done the \nbest job we could and we were providing an honest budget that was going \nto provide the things we had talked about--smaller Government, less \ntaxes, et cetera.\n  But, Mr. President, there is an old saying that if something seems \ntoo good to be true, then it probably is. In Washington, that scene can \nbe taken one step further. If something seems too good to be true, then \nit probably is and the taxpayers are somehow going to get stuck paying \nfor it.\n  Such is the case with the budget resolution passed by the Senate \nearlier today. On paper, the plan purports to eliminate the deficit by \nthe year 2002 by reining in Federal spending while providing \nsignificant tax relief for America's working families.\n  I appreciate all the efforts that were made to try to reach a good \nbudget agreement I hoped I could support, and I know how hard Senators \nDomenici and Lautenberg and the leadership on both sides of the aisle \nworked to bang out this budget. But in reality, this budget will \nultimately create bigger Government, a budget that is going to demand \nmore dollars from the taxpayers rather than giving them most of the tax \nrelief they have been promised.\n  It is, in other words, a deal between politicians here in Washington, \nnot between the taxpayers and the people they elected to represent \nthem.\n  I have made the pursuit of a balanced budget my top priority here in \nthe Congress, and I have always said I would support a budget plan \nwhich meets just three basic specific criteria. First, it must shrink \nthe size and scope of Government and return money and the power that \nthose dollars represent to the tax people. It must balance the budget \nby the year 2002 with steadily declining deficits each year and without \nthe use of rosy economic scenarios. And it must provide meaningful and \nbroadbased tax relief to working families.\n\n  Now, while I would like to join the bandwagon in supporting the \nbudget resolution, this Washington budget does not meet those \nprotaxpayer standards.\n  First, shrink Government and return power to the taxpayers. Balancing \nthe budget by the year 2002 is a responsibility we must meet, but it is \nsimply the beginning. If we intend to reduce the $5.3 trillion national \ndebt that will remain even after the deficit is eliminated, and take \npower from Washington and return it to the taxpayers, we must do more \nthan simply balance the budget. We were not elected to serve as the \nNation's accountants, simply trying to make sure the numbers all add up \non paper. We were elected to be policymakers--and balancing the budget \nis just one of these policies.\n  We cannot lose sight of the overall goal of shrinking the size of the \nWashington bureaucracy and sending those dollars back to the taxpayers. \nYet, this budget plan does just the opposite. It increases the size of \nGovernment by giving President Clinton even more money for pet projects \nthan he originally requested--$74 billion more than he requested in his \nbudget just last year, and $5 billion more than the budget he put \nforward in February of this year.\n  Mr. President, instead of eliminating wasteful programs to reduce the \nFederal deficit, this budget plan actually creates numerous new \nprograms, including $34 billion in new entitlement programs that will \ncost billions of the taxpayers hard-earned dollars.\n  Now, if some of these new programs have merit, they should be \nauthorized and appropriated through open hearings and through normal \ncommittee process. Total spending in this budget plan for all programs \nis $18 billion higher than President Clinton's budget request for the \nnext 5 years. So where is that in shrinking the size of Government? It \nis increasing the size of Government. The discretionary spending for \nthe next year alone will be $6.3 billion more than even what the \nPresident had requested back in February.\n  Compared to the budget resolution we passed last year, this budget \nplan has significantly increased discretionary spending. In fiscal year \n1998, discretionary spending will be $26 billion higher, $26 billion \nmore than last year's budget, while the total discretionary spending \nfor the next 5 years will be $194 billion higher than last year's \nbudget request.\n  I do not believe this is what the taxpayers had in mind when they \nheard the President declare that the era of big Government is over. \nDuring the last 5 years, Congress spent an additional $240 billion \nraising the size of Government that much over the years, but over the \nnext 5 years we are going to increase the size of the Government \nanother $270 billion. Again, plus the $34 billion in new spending \ninitiatives, not just fattening some of the old programs but actually \ncreating, giving birth to $34 billion in new programs that will have to \nbe supported even more in the outyears.\n  By increasing discretionary spending and creating new entitlement \nprograms, this budget plan would ensure that big Government is not only \nhere to stay, but that it will grow even bigger, and it will ultimately \nmean higher taxes in the future. In the continuing struggle between \ntaxpayers and big Government, this budget deal takes the wrong side, \nand I cannot be a part of it.\n  Second, the claim of balancing the budget with steadily declining \ndeficits, not through rosy scenarios. One of the dirtiest little \nsecrets in Washington is the economic hocus-pocus that goes on in the \nbudgeting process. The Washington folks seem to believe that as long as \nthey have a balanced budget on paper, however they can reshape the \nnumbers to fit their goals, it does not matter how they got there \nbecause the end will justify the means. But, as everyone knows, you \ncan't write a household budget with inflated numbers or unrealistic \nassumptions, and you should not be able to write a Federal budget that \nway as well.\n  Any honest budget plan must reach balance through steadily declining \ndeficits every year. The deficit must be lower each year than the \npreceding one. But this year's 5-year budget agreement actually \nincreases the deficits for the first 2 years, then projects enough of a \nreduction in the final 2 years to reach balance. So, in other words, \nlet's spend more now and then we will cut later. In other words, this \nPresident will be out of office, this Congress will have many new \nfaces, probably, but they are going to let the next President and the \nnext Congresses make the tough decisions that this Congress has turned \nits back on making.\n  Mr. President, James Glassman wrote on this subject in Tuesday's \nWashington Post, and I found this observation to be most appropriate. \nHe said:\n\n       The way to get to smaller government is by spending less \n     money. In fact, federal\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\n     spending will rise sharply in fiscal year 1998--that's the \n     year that starts on October 1, 1997, and the only budget year \n     that has any real significance.\n\n  Why? Because ``all the other numbers for all the other years are \nsheer fantasy. As anyone who runs a business knows, the only figure you \ncan possibly control is next year's spending.''\n\n  Let me say when the budget deal was struck here in 1990 that raised \ntaxes, part of the agreement was we will put a cap on future spending. \nWe will not spend over this limit. In 1993, a new tax increase came \ninto being, and along with that new tax increase came the removal of \nthose old caps, and new caps on spending were put at a higher level. \nThey said, all right, we will not spend over this level if you give us \nthese tax increases now.\n  Now, in 1997, for the 1998 budget year, the first thing that has to \nbe done in this budget, we have to bust those spending caps again \nbecause this budget can't live within those promises, and it extends \nthe level ever higher.\n  What does that mean? Where does the revenue come from? It is taken \nfrom the taxpayers and the hard workers of this country. Budget \nproponents are claiming to balance the budget by immediately increasing \nthe deficit by at least $23 billion, or an increase of 34 percent, and \nthen finding the savings to eliminate the deficit in the preceding \nyears for the following years.\n  If this does not make sense to the American taxpayers, that is \nbecause it does not make sense at all. It is just another example of \nthe budget tomfoolery that is going around in Washington. A budget plan \nmust also be based on real numbers and not the inflated budget \nestimates that have been used in the past to justify more spending and \nhigher taxes. Somehow the new revenues, the increased dollars that come \nto Washington, can never be put into the category of reducing the \ndeficit or returning some of it in tax relief. It always goes on the \nother side of more spending.\n  This budget agreement fails on that score as well as by continuing to \nuse the inflated budget estimates of the past to mask the spending \nincreases it contains. I cannot support a budget that uses such \ngimmicks simply to make the numbers add up on paper.\n  There are two other weaknesses of the agreement I would like to point \nout. For quite some time we have been told repeatedly by the CBO that \nwe needed at least $500 billion in spending cuts to achieve a balanced \nbudget. It will take hard choices to accomplish that. However, the need \nto make some of the most difficult choices supposedly vanished recently \nwhen we were told that we can spend more while balancing the budget at \nthe same time because somehow the CBO discovered $225 billion in extra \nmoney. This cannot be true. It contradicts the CBO's own recently \ncompleted study that examined the potential impact of a recession on \nbudget projections and the goal of a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  In this study, the CBO examined two possible recessions, one possibly \nin 1998, another in the year 2000, and it concluded in both cases GDP \nwould fall 3.7 percent below potential and would add about $100 billion \nto the deficit. That would make the goal of achieving a balanced budget \nin the year 2002 very difficult.\n  Again, if the $225 billion in ``extra money'' is indeed real, it did \nnot fall mysteriously from the sky. It is money that belongs first and \nforemost to the American taxpayers, and it should be put to proper use. \nThe right way would be to return it to the taxpayers as tax relief and/\nor designated for deficit reduction. The wrong way is to spend all \nthat. Unfortunately, this budget resolution takes the wrong way.\n  Now, there are some who said on the floor today only $30 billion of \nthat $225 billion was spent. If that is true, where is the rest of it? \nWhere did it go? If it is still there, let's put it to tax relief. But \nthe secret is that it has been put into spending.\n  I introduced an amendment earlier today that would have required that \nwe use the $225 billion of the CBO revenue windfall as assumed under \nthis budget for tax relief and deficit reduction, and to keep \nnondefense discretionary spending at the current freeze baseline level. \nMy amendment called for giving back half of the $225 billion windfall \nto the taxpayers and then devoting the other half for deficit \nreduction. Again, the question is, where did that money go?\n  Another element of my amendment called for keeping nondefense \nspending at a freeze baseline level. Now, baseline budgeting has been \nthe subject of great debates, many debates, and I will not repeat the \narguments today, but let me tell you briefly why this is so important. \nFor years, Republicans criticized the use of inflated baseline \nbudgeting because it did not reflect the actual spending levels in \nterms of an increase or a cut in a program's funding. By that, they \nalways project next year's spending to already be higher so they set a \nnew baseline. So if we were going to spend $100 this year, the new \nbaseline next year would be $105, so that is what they work off. If we \nonly spend $104, the claim would be we cut the budget by $1, when \nactually we spent $4 more.\n  Now, there are claims in this budget that we will save $1 trillion in \nspending for the American taxpayer over the next 10 years. Now, that \nsounds great, doesn't it? If you go by the baseline budgeting, what \nthey are really saying is, if we froze spending today, over the next 10 \nyears we would spend about $16.2 trillion, but under the baseline \nbudgeting, we are going to only spend $19.2, but we could have spent \n$20 trillion, so we are saving you $1 trillion. We could have spent $20 \ntrillion, but by the baseline we will cut back.\n\n  The difference is, we are not saving $1 trillion in spending for the \ntaxpayers. We are adding $3 trillion in new spending over the same 10 \nyears.\n  It was Lee Iacocca who said if American businesses used baseline \nbudgeting the way Congress does, ``They would throw us in jail.'' Many \nof us share Iacocca's views and believe inflated baseline budgeting is \na fraud and it should be ended.\n  During the past 2 years we have been telling the American people we \nwould guarantee an honest accounting of our Federal budget by \nimplementing zero-baseline budgeting. In other words, be honest. This \nis what we spend this year. This is what we propose to spend next year, \nnot the baseline that we could have spent, but we are not going to \nspend quite that much, so we will save you money. That is like going to \na sale and saying I am going to spend $100 to save $4.\n  We adopted zero-baseline budgeting, and Congress has produced two \nbalanced budgets by using the freeze baseline. But the fiscal year 1998 \nbudget resolution abandoned this policy that we had used over the last \n2 years of honest accounting by reverting to inflated baseline \nbudgeting. In my view, this is a shift, again, in the wrong direction.\n  Returning to the inflated baseline not only again breaks a promise to \nthe American people but also ensures, ensures that big government will \nlive on by allowing Washington to avoid the hard choices that it must \nmake to eliminate wasteful programs and address our long-term fiscal \nimbalances. We could have met the problem head on this year. They were \nnegotiating the budget and could have finally had to face those \nproblems, but somehow, at the last minute, the White Knight, the CBO, \nwith $225 billion in new projections, rode in for the rescue and \nCongress did not have to make any choices. They went ahead and spent \nall the money.\n  Mr. President, my amendment, as you know, was defeated by the Senate \nthis morning. But this issue is not one that is going to go away. We \nmust be honest with the American people, and we must, again, use zero-\nbaseline budgeting as we promised, so we can rebuild the American \npeople's confidence in the Government and make Congress accountable to \nthe taxpayers.\n  No. 3, meaningful broad-based tax relief for working families. I have \nbeen the Senate's leading advocate of what we call meaningful broad-\nbased tax relief for working families through an important measure such \nas the $500-per-child tax credit.\n  Rhetorically, everyone from colleagues in Congress and the President \nhas joined me in calling for such tax relief. Once again, a closer look \nat this budget agreement reveals that reality does not match the \nrhetoric.\n  What does this Washington deal mean for the millions of families who \nwould benefit from a broad-based tax cut? Proponents of the budget \nagreement argue that since $135 billion has been set aside on paper for \ntax relief, that it is good. I beg to differ, because,\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\nas with all things in Washington, there is more, or, in this case, \nthere is less than meets the eye.\n  For example, when they say there is $135 billion available for tax \nrelief, they are ignoring the fact that $50 billion of this pool will \nbe raised through higher taxes, so, in other words, to give a tax break \nto some we will have to raise taxes on others. We are going to have to \nborrow from Peter to pay Paul. So that leaves us a net tax cut of $85 \nbillion and someone will have to pay for the $50 billion. You can bet \nthat someone will not be Uncle Sam.\n  Also consider the fact that $35 billion has already been promised \naway to the President for his narrowly targeted college education tax \nplan.\n  Now, as the Senate author of the broad-based tax relief for working \nfamilies represented by the $500-per-child tax credit, I am deeply \ntroubled that this Washington budget agreement dedicates too much money \nfor narrowly targeted tax relief at the expense of broad-based tax \nrelief. The debate over targeted versus broad-based tax relief raises \nthe single most important question for us today, and that is the \nquestion of who decides. Targeted tax relief says Washington will \ndecide who is going to get a tax break, how they are going to get it, \nand what they have to do to get that tax break. If you, as a taxpayer, \nwant to cut, you have to do what Washington tells you to do, whereas \nbroad-based tax relief says taxpayers can decide. If you want to use \nyour tax cut for higher education, go ahead, for housing, go ahead, for \nhealth care, go ahead, but tax relief should not be narrowly tailored \nto fit the priorities set by Washington or used as a tool for social \nengineering purposes.\n  Tax relief should be as broad based as possible leaving the \ndecisionmaking on how best to use that to the taxpayer themselves. \nEvery household is different. Washington cannot decide.\n\n  Now, while all of us support the use of tax relief for higher \neducation expenses, we must recognize that there are many other needs \nfaced by working families every day that can be best met by a tax cut, \nand it should not be up to Washington to make those decisions. But that \nis what this budget agreement does by reserving $35 billion from the \nPresident's college tax deduction which benefits a few. This Washington \ndeal takes away tax relief dollars from the child tax credit which \nbenefits the many.\n  Finally, there are many other claims to those dollars remaining in \nthe tax relief pool, including a capital gains tax cut, estate tax \nrelief, IRA's and a host of other tax proposals. But if you start out \nwith $135, you take away $50 in tax increases, you have $85 net. From \nthose $85 million, the President has targeted tax relief of $35 \nbillion, which leaves a pool of $50 billion.\n  To go through some of this other child tax relief, if you are going \nto get the full-blown tax relief you have been promised, it would be \n$104 billion. If you are going to get tax gains, tax reduction, it \nwould be $24 billion; estate tax, $18 billion; IRAs, about $11 billion. \nWhat we have is about $170 billion of tax cuts promised that somehow we \nare going to squeeze out of a box of $50 billion. So, in other words, \nsomebody is going to get something, but it will be a shadow. While all \nthese ideas have merit, the competition for this ever-shrinking pool \nmeans more bad news for those of us who care about getting tax relief.\n  Again, we have promised working families a $500-per-child tax credit, \nbut once you factor in all the tax hikes, special interest tax cuts, \nand deals that have been made a part of the budget agreement, it is \neasy to see that this $500-per-child tax credit could end up being \nnothing more than a token gesture, a promise of meaningful broad-based \ntax relief for working families without the dollars to back it up.\n  In other words, working families will be squeezed out again, a broken \npromise, and that is something that I cannot support.\n  Contrary to the claims of its proponents, this Washington budget deal \nis a retreat from the promises we made to the taxpayers for meaningful \ntax relief. As I have argued, the figures set-aside for tax relief are \nwholly inadequate to keep the promises we made to take from Washington \nand give back to the taxpayers--a fatal flaw in this budget agreement \nand another brush-off to the working families we are supposed to \nrepresent.\n  In its analysis of the budget, the Heritage Foundation concluded that \n``a credible plan to balance the Federal budget must result in a \nsmaller Government that costs less and leaves much more money in the \npockets of working Americans. The current budget deal not only fails \nthese important tests, but in many cases would implement policies that \nare worse than taking no action at all.''\n  The medical profession is guided by the doctrine of ``First, do no \nharm.'' The American people should demand the same of their Government \nas it establishes the Nation's spending and tax priorities through the \nbudget process. A budget that fails to meet even the most basic tests \nof honesty and common sense--and that may actually leave the Nation in \na fiscal situation more perilous than the one we face today--is a \nbudget the American taxpayers will not support. Congress and the \nPresident can, and must, do better.\n  In closing, let me add a final thought about this so-called balanced \nbudget resolution.\n  As I stand here in this Chamber, on a day when I should be proudly \ntelling the taxpayers of Minnesota that Congress has finally heard \ntheir pleas and produced an honest budget that reduces the size of \ngovernment and offers meaningful tax relief, I am saddened and angry \nthat I cannot.\n  The budget resolution passed by the Senate today is not the budget I \nwas elected to carry out. It is not the budget a great many of my \ncolleagues were elected to carry out. It is a budget built of \nconcession, not of compromise, of illusion, not of reality, of \nwhispers, not of boldness. It is a budget built like a house of cards, \nwithout a foundation, and held together by nothing but wishes and \nassumptions. This may be a so-called agreement between the Republicans \nand Democrats in Washington, but it is not the budget agreement we \npromised the taxpayers. It is a budget Congress hopes America will \nlike. As you see more of the details, it will be one they don't. For \nthis reason, it is a budget I deeply regret I cannot in good conscience \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5089-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5091-S5093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JONNA LYNNE CULLEN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this has been an extremely busy week for the \nSenate and a historic week, capped off by our work on the landmark \nbudget resolution.\n  Before we finish today, and before Members return home to observe \nMemorial Day, I want to join my colleague, Senator Cochran, from \nMississippi, and others who are interested in paying special tribute to \na special lady. I thank my colleagues that do have time reserved to \nspeak for giving us these few minutes to say to our good friend, and, \nin my case, a former colleague when I was a staff member, Jonna Lynne \nCullen, and thank her for a lot of great memories and for a lot of \ngreat work and for all that she has done for our country.\n  I think it is appropriate that we do this at the end of this week \nwhen we have done something good for this country by passing a budget \nresolution that will, at last, ensure a balanced budget for the \nAmerican people. It is appropriate because most of Jonna Lynne Cullen's \nlife has been devoted to good things for her country.\n  She first came to Capitol Hill as a young woman. I got to know her in \n1959 as a college freshman at the University of Mississippi. We were \nfriends then. A few years later, then, in 1967, when she came to \nCapitol Hill, she went to work for the Rules Committee with the \nlegendary chairman, William Colmer of Mississippi.\n  One year later, I joined the Congressman's staff as his \nadministrative assistant, beginning a close working relationship with \nJonna Lynne--or J.L., as we all affectionately call her--and that \nrelationship grew as we worked on bills before the Rules Committee and \nwe spent time in the presence of Chairman Colmer and as she worked in \nthe Reagan administration. Through the years, our relationship and \nfriendship has continued to grow.\n  Over the course of 30 years in the Nation's Capitol, J.L. has \nremained much as she was when we first met. Without dealing in \nstereotypes, it's true that she is very much a southern woman:\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\n  Gracious even in the face of rudeness, generous to a fault, ready to \nmake others feel at ease and at home, tolerant of other's opinions but \nquite sure of her own, soft of heart and tough of spirit.\n  Last week, many Members of the House of Representatives took to the \nfloor of the House to recount their own memories of J.L. And the \nrecurrent theme of their recollections was how much she has helped \nthem, in one way or another.\n  I remember when she worked on the Rules Committee staff. She would \ncome back to the rail, and they would have a rule up, and she would not \nonly watch the rule, but she worked with many of us who had various and \nsundry problems to try to help us get through a legislative problem or \nto deal with a family problem. She was sort of the mother hen in the \nHouse back in those days in the early 1970's. Senator Cochran and I \nenjoyed her friendship so much.\n  I can't think of a better tribute to any person than to be known by \nhow much she helped others. And certainly that is true with J.L.\n  The reason she could help so many is because she really was so able. \nShe is a master of the House rules. She not only knows every in and out \nof the legislative process, but she knows the people involved as well \nto help you get the results you are looking for. She has always had \ntheir trust, and her word was good. She has never been a part of the \ndeplorable side of Washington that thrives on leaks or negative \ninformation or self-promotion. It is just not her style. Indeed, she \nrepresents an older tradition--maybe one she learned from Chairman \nColmer in the behind-the-scenes service in which the good of the \nCongress and the good of the country that it leads to by its actions \nmust come before any personal considerations, which helps to explain \nwhy she has friendships across the partisan aisle, too. She worked both \nsides of the aisle. She can fight someone on policy and yet respect \nthem on principle. She has always been a winner who understands how to \nwin the right way.\n  It was little wonder, then, that in January 1981 when President \nRonald Reagan came into office, Jonna Lynne was asked to take charge of \nthe Congressional Affairs Office at the Office of Management and Budget \nto work with then head of OMB, David Stockman, a Congressman from \nMichigan at that time.\n  That has always been an important job. But it was at a particularly \ncritical juncture at that time, which was an extraordinary period of \nactive legislative involvement by the President--changes in a number of \nlaws, major tax cuts, some restraint on the budget--that really made a \ndifference.\n  The President-elect and his inner circle knew they were facing a \nnational crisis. At that time we had a sinking economy with worse \nahead, raging inflation, regulatory strangulation, the Iranian hostage \nsituation, a hollow military force, Soviet proxy aggression on three \ncontinents, and on Capitol Hill, deeply entrenched majorities from the \nother party with a minority in the House and the Senate--or in the \nHouse at least--of the President's party.\n  Today, we tend to forget just how bad things really were then or just \nhow gloomy the future might have appeared to us at that time. The \nPresident-elect and most of his key aides were strangers to Capitol \nHill. But OMB was to be the vanguard, the spearhead actually, of what \nwe needed to accomplish. We had Jonna Lynne Cullen working at OMB, \nworking with the House and with the Congress that she knew so well.\n  So to OMB she went working around the clock to help forge a governing \ncoalition in the House.\n  In those days we couldn't get a majority on any vote if we didn't get \naround 50 Democrats. We had 180 or so Republicans--I think there were \nabout 186--and in some instances every one of the Republicans and we \nhad to get something over 50 Democrats to be able to win any votes. \nTime after time after time we won by one vote, two votes, six votes. It \nwas scary. It was tedious. But Jonna Lynne was there helping us work \nboth sides of the aisle to get the victories for the American people.\n\n  Much later, when the fruits of her labors came to harvest in the \nhistoric economic package that set the stage for the longest sustained \neconomic recovery in our Nation's history, there were plenty of people \naround to take credit.\n  But Jonna Lynne is not that type. She continued to be the ultimate \ninsider, shy of the news media but bold in her commitment to what will \nforever more be known as the Reagan revolution.\n  Even after she left the administration, she was always on call for a \ngood cause. She handled congressional relations for Reagan's bipartisan \ncommission on Central America-- an interesting commission. Henry \nKissinger was involved in that, Jack Kemp, and I think even Alan \nGreenspan--quite a group--Jonna Lynne, and Democrats and Republicans. \nThey went to Central America and did a great job.\n  She helped develop a policy consensus that turned the tide against \nthe Soviet and Cuban meddling in this hemisphere.\n  Devoted as she has always been in public service, J.L. has still a \nremarkable private life. Professionally, she has not only been a \nlobbyist but, as businesswoman, very successful with culinary skills \nthat have led to the Pesto Plus line of food products.\n  Somehow she found time to paint along with her Pesto Plus products. \nHer botanical water colors outshine their real life subjects. With \nflowers, as with people, J.L. is able to look beneath the surface to \nbring out the hidden beauty.\n  It must be said that J.L. came up through the ranks of the \ncongressional staff from the lowest entry level at a time when it was \nvery difficult for women. Not all doors were open to them. But she \nopened them, not by confrontation or argument but by excellence and by \nhard work.\n  I doubt if she ever considered herself a pioneer, but, in fact, she \nhas led the way for others, getting ahead the old-fashioned way--with \nstrength of conviction and hard work.\n  Characteristically, she has translated her commitment in that area to \nthe advancement of women in Government, and especially within the \nRepublican Party, into positive action. She has pulled together women \nMembers of Congress, of the media, and others to better understand and \nassist one another.\n  Of course, bringing people together like that and finding common \nground on which to make progress has always been J.L.'s trademark.\n  A few years ago, when many of us joined together to help celebrate a \nmilestone birthday for J.L., the walls were decorated with large \nblowups of photos from her childhood days and her days in college. I \nremembered some of them, actually. Needless to say, there had been \ncertain changes along the way. But you could see the same openness, \nfrankness, and sparkle, and the same zest for life in Jonna Lynne every \nday as in those childhood days and those pictures, too.\n  When illness struck J.L. several years ago, she turned even that into \nan opportunity for service. She gave her time and energy to fighting \nagainst cancer while waging her own individual battle in that regard. \nAccording to Senate procedure, we are not supposed to address \nindividuals here on the Senate floor but, Mr. President, if Jonna Lynne \nwere here with us, I would tell her what all of her many friends are \ntrying to tell her in many different ways, and that is simply this: \nThank you, J.L., for all that you have done for us and for our country. \nAnd though you are not with us in the Capitol, you will always be in \nour hearts.\n  God bless you and thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I congratulate and commend my friend and \ncolleague from Mississippi for his wonderfully eloquent statement, and \nfor taking time, today, to pay tribute to a very special friend. \nTwenty-five years ago, Jonna Lynne Cullen came to my office in Jackson, \nMS, to congratulate me on my election to the Congress. She and my wife, \nRose, along with my distinguished colleague the majority leader, were \nclassmates at the University of Mississippi just 13 years before that. \nShe told me, when she came to the office, all about the process of \norganizing the House of Representatives and offered to assist me and my \nstaff as I began my job as the new U.S. Congressman from the Fourth \nCongressional District of Mississippi. Her advice and counsel to me \nwere very helpful, and I\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\ngained more respect for her, for her insight and her knowledge, as time \nwent on.\n  As a member of the staff of the House Rules Committee, she was where \nthe action was. She was where you knew what legislation was coming up \nand what the process was. And she was a great source of information and \nencouragement for me, as someone who had never worked as a member of \nthe staff or had been closely involved in the workings of the Congress \nbefore my election in 1972.\n  Her appreciation of the Congress was contagious, and so was her \nenthusiasm. Everyone I knew liked her. In time, her capabilities and \ndedication were rewarded with an offer to work at the White House. At \nthe Office of Management and Budget, she helped guide to passage some \nof the most important budget reforms ever adopted. During her career as \na member of the staff of the House, and in the Executive Office of the \nPresident, she was one of the most dependable, conscientious, and \neffective employees who has ever worked at either place.\n  Since then, she has been involved in a wide range of activities, most \nof which have been related to business or Government. She began her own \nbusiness, J.L. Gourmand, Inc., to manufacture and market her Pesto Plus \nproducts. She organized women's groups to support other entrepreneurs \nand professional women here and around the world. She traveled to other \ncountries to help explain to those with new democracies how best to \nguarantee the blessings of self-government. And she developed her \nconsiderable talent with water colors as a painter of flowers, which \nare collected and appreciated throughout the National Capital area and \nin the houses of her friends and admirers all across the country. And \nthat is a lot of houses, because she has many friends and admirers.\n  All of her friends, and I am so pleased and privileged to have been \none of her close friends for the past 25 years, wish we could see a \nmodern miracle make her well because nobody could be a better or more \nunselfish friend than Jonna Lynne Cullen.\n  With our good wishes we also send to her our thanks for all she has \ndone and all she has given to make the Congress and the country so much \nbetter off, because of her good work and her well-lived life.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to join with the majority leader in \npaying tribute to an extraordinary woman, J.L. Cullen.\n  It would be accurate to say that J.L. worked for the House Rules \nCommittee, but that wouldn't begin to capture the spirit of this \nwonderful person. Yes, she was an outstanding and dedicated staffer, \nbut for those of us who have served in the House--especially women--she \nwas so much more. She was our friend.\n  From my first days in the House I was privileged to know J.L. and our \nrelationship grew from there. Her wonderful sense of humor, her warmth \nand her intellect made an impression on all of us, as our distinguished \nmajority leader can attest from his days in the House.\n  As an unofficial morale officer, J.L. brought together women of the \nHouse of Representatives, on a number of occasions hosting my female \ncolleagues and me for dinner at her home. I will always fondly remember \ndinners with J.L., Nancy Johnson, and Lynn Martin--for both the company \nand the cooking! J.L. knew her way around a kitchen as well as she knew \nher way around House procedure, and in fact ultimately opened up her \nown business selling pesto.\n  No matter what she did, J.L. was always gracious, always hospitable. \nAnd in the House, she quietly but effectively fostered unity and \ncamaraderie among Members. She was there through dark days as well as \nthe bright ones, and she was a tremendous resource for us.\n  When I last had the pleasure of seeing J.L. at a reception recently, \ndespite her illness, she greeted me with her usual good cheer and \nhumor. She is truly a remarkable person and the way in which she has \nhandled her illness with strength and dignity is inspirational to me. \nJ.L. is one of those rare people who lends perspective to what we do \nhere in Washington and brings into sharp focus the things that are \ntruly important in life.\n  I hope J.L. is watching us today, to see and hear our comments, Mr. \nPresident. Because I want her to know how deeply she has touched the \nlives of those with whom she worked. J.L. may not be a Member of \nCongress, but she is as much a credit to this institution as any of its \nfinest elected officials. And she is as much a part of this Congress as \nany one of us who are Members.\n  So often, one hears of the unelected staff. For so many, they are the \nnameless faceless people who work in the shadow of the dome--out of the \nglare of public attention usually reserved for those elected to the \nHouse or Senate. J.L. Cullen is among the finest of those people. \nUninterested in the spotlight, she measures her contributions solely by \nthe lives she touches or the results she achieves.\n  But today, I want the public to know her name. I want them to know \nthat she is a person without whom the people's business--the work of \nthis institution, indeed the work of this Nation--would not have been \ndone. And I want America to know that she has been a public servant in \nthe very finest sense of the word.\n  J.L., if you're watching, please know that you are in my heart and in \nmy prayers. You helped make this native-born Mainer feel at home in \nWashington, you helped me to do my job better, and you helped me to \nlaugh along the way, too. I will forever cherish your caring and \nfriendship, and remember your exemplary service to Congress and the \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am recognized for 20 minutes, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, that's correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleagues describe Jonna \nLynne Cullen, and while I did not and do not know her, the description \ngiven by my two colleagues makes me, and I am sure other colleagues \nhere in the Congress, wish we knew her. She is undoubtedly like friends \nthat all of us have around this country, who represent the very small \npart of our population that gets involved and makes things happen, and \ntruly demonstrate what good citizenship is all about.\n  So, while I don't know Jonna Lynne Cullen, I commend my two \ncolleagues from Mississippi. I also wish her well because she \nrepresents what is best of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5091-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5093-S5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DISASTER IN NORTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak just for a moment about \nwhat is happening in North Dakota, my home State, the disaster that \noccurred there and my disappointment, my profound disappointment that \nit appears that Congress will leave for the Memorial Day recess without \nhaving addressed that issue.\n  First, a number of us think there are important things we do from \ntime to time. Today was important for a couple of reasons. My daughter \nHaley, age 7, last evening, when I arrived home at 10 o'clock, because \nthe Congress is going late every day, asked me if I was going to be \nable to come to her second grade puppet show this morning. And I said \nof course, I wouldn't miss her second grade puppet show, because she \nhas been talking about it for a month. So I missed the first votes this \nmorning to go to my daughter's puppet show. While I regret I missed \nvotes, I think I did what was most important.\n  Some of these choices that we make about what we must do to meet \ncertain obligations sometimes are difficult--that is not a difficult \none--because the schedule here in the Senate is kind of a difficult \nschedule. As the presiding officer knows, the difficulty in balancing \nour obligations sometimes presents significant obstacles for us. Almost \nevery night this week we have worked very late. I have been a conferee \non the supplemental appropriations bill as a Member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. We have been working day after day on that \npiece of legislation. We have also been working on the budget \nagreement.\n  While one of the important things I did this morning was to attend a \nsecond grade puppet show for a young girl I am enormously proud of, \nanother important thing I did today was to cast a vote in support of a \nbudget proposal that I think is important for this country. I have cast \nprevious votes just like\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nthat. In 1993 I cast a vote for a budget agreement that was a tough \nvote. It only prevailed by one vote; one vote. The Vice President had \nto come to this Chamber and cast the tie-breaking vote, the deciding \nvote. It cut spending, increased some taxes, and people said, ``If you \ndo it, you are going to cause a depression in this country and put this \ncountry in a tailspin.''\n  We said, I said, the President said, and those of us who voted for it \nsaid: It is important for us to do what's necessary to get this Federal \ndeficit under control, and if the medicine is tough medicine, so be it. \nWe are willing to support it. I voted for it and I am glad I did.\n  Since that time, since 1993, we have had steady economic growth. We \nhave had lower inflation--down, down, and down for 4 years; \nunemployment has dropped, down, down, and down for 4 years. We have an \neconomy that is in good shape--low unemployment, low inflation, good \neconomic growth, and the Federal deficits have come down 75-percent \nsince 1993. There has been a 75-percent reduction in the Federal \ndeficit because, in 1993, we did what was the right thing to do.\n  My political party paid an awful price for that, as a matter of fact. \nSome of my colleagues who were willing to vote for that are not in this \nChamber any longer. But it was the right thing to do. And now the \nCongress takes the second step. This one, I am pleased to say, is \nbipartisan. The previous one, we did not get any votes from that side \nof the aisle--not one. And we prevailed by one vote. Today, I am \npleased to say--and I hope the American people feel some comfort--that \nit is a bipartisan effort. The second step is bipartisan and that makes \na great deal more sense in our country, for us to be working together. \nInstead of trying to figure out how do you get the worst of each, maybe \nwe ought to spend time trying to figure out how to get the best of \nboth: How do you work together, not how do you fight each other. And \nthis budget agreement is an agreement hammered out by the White House \nand by Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress.\n\n  Is it perfect? No. Would I have done it differently, had I written it \nmyself? Yes. Is there more to do? Sure. But is it the right thing for \nthis country, to be saying to the American people on a bipartisan basis \nthat fiscal responsibility is important; that your comfort about the \nfuture of this country can increase because the Congress is not going \nto continue to spend money it doesn't have on things it doesn't need; \nis not going to continue to charge what it now consumes to our kids and \ngrandkids? That is important. And that is the second thing I did today \nthat was important. And I am pleased I cast that vote and I expect I \nwill remain satisfied over the years that I was a part of that effort.\n  But not every day has moments that are satisfying. We each make of \nour individual days what we choose to make of them. You can get up and \nhave a bad attitude and be in a bad mood all day long, if you like. The \none thing we are in charge of is our attitude. You can decide you are \ngoing to make something of yourself, do something good for the country; \nyou are going to do something worthwhile for your families. Well, all \nof us have different ways of dealing with the days. I mentioned a \ncouple of ways that satisfy me today, a second grade puppet show and a \nbudget deal that I think makes sense for this country.\n  Let me also, if I might, describe something that causes me enormous \nheartache today. I have worked for weeks with colleagues here in the \nSenate on a disaster appropriations bill. My colleagues in the Senate, \nfrom Senator Stevens, the chairman of that committee, to Senator Byrd, \nthe ranking member of the committee, and so many others on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee have done a remarkable job, a wonderful job of \ncreating a disaster bill that says to the people who suffer in our \nregion of the country: We want to help you. You are not alone.\n  We worked day and night and one would have hoped that a bill \nproviding disaster relief would have been enacted before the Congress \ntakes a recess for Memorial Day. But, guess what, last evening we were \ntold that the other body had decided it cannot provide a disaster \nrelief bill. All of the provisions of the disaster relief in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill are largely agreed to. They are not in \ncontroversy. There is no disagreement. So the money is agreed to. Yet, \nthis bill that contains other issues, some of them totally unrelated to \nthe disaster, and some of them very controversial--those are the \nprovisions, incidentally, that have held up the bill and derailed the \nbill--we are told, because of those other provisions, it cannot be \ndone. The House of Representatives, the other body, says it just will \nnot do it.\n  Let me tell you why this is important and why I think it is an \nenormous setback for the people who are out there, waiting for disaster \naid. If some do not now know, and I expect all Americans do, having \nwatched television, about what my constituents have faced, and the \nconstituents in Minnesota and South Dakota have faced, let me describe \nit again briefly: 3 years worth of snow in 3 months in North Dakota, \nseven to eight major blizzards closing down virtually all of the roads \nin the State. The last blizzard put nearly 2 feet of snow across the \nState of North Dakota; tens of thousands, over 100,000 head of \nlivestock dead, 1.7 million acres of farmland inundated by water; a \nriver not 100 yards wide becomes a lake 150 miles by 20 and 30 miles.\n  As that river is channeled through our cities, it reaches Grand \nForks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, and it reaches a record level \nnever before reached on the Red River in those two cities. And then the \ndike breaks in the middle of the night and the dike begins failing all \nacross the town and the residents of East Grand Forks, MN, and Grand \nForks, ND, had to flee for their lives. Many of them rushed down the \nstreet to get on a National Guard truck, with only the clothes on their \nback, having left everything behind in their homes. They have left \ntheir vehicles. They have left all their personal goods, and they get \non a truck, or some other device, and they flee the community. In East \nGrand Forks, MN, 9,000 people were evacuated. The entire town was \nevacuated. In Grand Forks, ND, 50,000 population, 90 percent of the \ntown evacuated.\n\n  When you tour the town next, a day or two after the dike broke, you \ntour it with a Coast Guard boat and the cars that were on Main Street \ncould not be seen because the water was well above the level of those \nautomobiles. There was nobody in town of a town of 50,000 people or a \ntown of 9,000 people--totally evacuated.\n  Then a fire starts and destroys parts of several downtown blocks. One \nentire block is devastated, 11 major buildings in the historic district \nof downtown Grand Forks are destroyed and firefighters, fighting a fire \nchest-deep in ice cold water, suffering hypothermia, were fighting a \nfire in a flood, trying to get in front of a fire that destroyed part \nof the downtown of a city. Meantime, 4,000 people are out in an \naircraft hangar at the Grand Forks Air Force Base leaving their homes \nnow to sleep on a cot.\n  So we went to the Air Force base. Vice President Gore came to North \nDakota. President Clinton came to North Dakota. And you see men and \nwomen and families, children out in these airplane hangars sleeping on \ncots, living in hangars because there was nowhere to go.\n  Today, weeks later, there are somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 \npeople in Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, who are not yet \nback in their homes. So this morning, they woke up in a strange place. \nTonight, they will go to bed in a strange place, and what of Members of \nCongress? They recessed for Memorial Day. It was time to go home. Oh, \nthey had some unfinished business. One piece of unfinished business was \nto say to the people in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and people in \nSouth Dakota and Minnesota that ``you are not alone; here is a helping \nhand.'' We just passed a disaster bill, but the people in the other \nbody didn't have time for that. Do you know why they didn't have time \nfor it? They said to us yesterday, ``If we had taken the disaster \nportions out of the supplemental appropriations bill and passed them \nalone, we would have lost our leverage.''\n  What kind of leverage is it that they are talking about, do you \nthink? The leverage to pass an amendment that they have stuck on that \nbill which has\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nnothing to do with the disaster. It has to do with Government \nshutdowns--very controversial amendment--and has no relationship to a \ndisaster bill. But they stuck it on there knowing they could hold \nhostage thousands of victims of these floods, and that is exactly what \nhappened.\n  We have come to the end of this week, and the other body decided it \ndoesn't have time; they were unwilling to pass a disaster bill.\n  I have been around this institution for some long while, first in the \nHouse of Representatives and now in the Senate. There is not a \nprecedent for this. Nowhere that I know of is there a precedent for a \ndisaster bill, when people have suffered in a region of this country, \nfor someone else to say, ``Oh, by the way, I know this is a disaster, \nso I am going to stick this on my agenda, and either you pass it that \nway or it doesn't get passed.'' At no time that I know of has someone \nin Congress said to those who suffered earthquakes in California or \nfloods along the Mississippi in 1993 or tornadoes or fires, never have \nI heard the Congress say, ``And, by the way, yes, we're in the business \nof disaster relief, but we want to stick extraneous amendments on which \nare controversial, and we are willing to play with the threat of a veto \nby a President because we're not so concerned about the victims of a \ndisaster.''\n  Some have said, ``Well, it's not urgent; it can wait a couple of \nweeks.'' Let me describe for my colleagues why it is urgent and why \nwhat the House has done, if it continues to do it--and it looks like it \nwill--why it is significant to the people of our region.\n  The money in this bill, $500 million for Community Development Block \nGrants, which is the most flexible money available to help rebuild and \nrecover, cannot be made available, cannot be obligated and cannot be \ncommitted by these cities to say to those folks who lost everything, \nand lost their homes especially, that ``here is our new floodplain, \nhere is where we are going to buy out the homes, here is a commitment \nwe will buy out your home, and now you can start building anew.'' This \ndelays that. It delays recovery. It delays rebuilding. It delays \nrepair. And delay is critical in our part of the country.\n\n  We have a very short construction season. This 2-week delay, 4-week \ndelay, or 6-week delay, whatever it turns out to be, is a devastating \ndelay to people who are not in their homes and who are awaiting answers \nfrom local officials about what will happen to the home that is already \ndestroyed.\n  So, Mr. President, there is no excuse for what has happened. I want \nto make it clear that the Senate Appropriations Committee created a \ndisaster portion of this bill that is a wonderful, wonderful response \nto the people of our region.\n  I commend Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd and all of the people who \nworked together to do that. That is not where the problem is. They are \nto be complimented. The problem exists because we had some folks on the \nother side of the Capitol who said, ``We don't care. We're leaving. \nWe've got a plane ticket and a ride out of town.''\n  I ask those who are now on their way, if they have the time in the \nnext week when the Congress is on recess, to stop by Grand Forks, ND. I \njust finished talking to the mayor. There is a line of people outside \nthe civic center, and every single one of them is asking, ``What is \nhappening to the funding? Do you have the ability to commit so we know \nif there is going to be a buyout of our house? Do you have some \ncommitment to rebuild?'' Every one of them is asking, ``When will we \nknow?''\n  To those who believe it is important to go on recess and ignore the \nneeds of people in a disaster, I say, ``Stop by Grand Forks and explain \nto those folks why that was their priority.''\n  This disaster portion of this bill is a good portion of the bill. The \nSenator from Washington is here. He serves on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee with me. All of it with respect to disaster is now agreed \nto--all of it. I compliment every member of that committee because they \nhave done a wonderful job. It simply could have been lifted out and \npassed so at least the disaster portion is available, because we did it \nand did it right. Republicans and Democrats working together did it \nright.\n  But what happened was, last evening, some folks on the other side \nsaid, ``We're sorry, we're just not going to do that, we're going \nhome.'' And if I sound a little angry--I guess that is probably an \nappropriate word to describe it. I don't think that I ought to stand \nhere and say, ``Well, that's the way the system works.'' I represent \nthousands of people who don't have a home, thousands of people who \ndon't have much hope, thousands of people who are asking for help. And \nI think it is unconscionable that anyone on that side of the Capitol \nbelieves it is appropriate to leave those people high and dry without \nan answer, without hope, and without help.\n  Oh, yes, it is going to come, and when it comes, I am going to be \nthankful that it is there. But, between now and then, it is delayed--\ndelay of recovery, delay of rebuilding and delay of providing hope that \nwe should well provide to the people of that region. There hasn't been \none instance since I have been in Congress that I have not been the \nfirst to say, ``Sign me up'' when there is an earthquake in California \nthat devastates that region. I say it is our job, yes, our job as North \nDakota taxpayers to say to them, ``We want to help you.''\n  The same is true of every region of the country that has suffered \ndisaster. It is important for us to reach out and help, and it is \nespecially important now when we need help for the rest of the country \nto do that. The Senate Appropriations Committee was prepared to do it \nand had written a piece to do it. Regrettably, it is Friday afternoon, \nand it now looks like there will be a recess without disaster aid going \nto people who will not be sleeping in their bed--not a hundred of them, \nnot a thousand of them, but thousands and thousands--who the mayors of \nthese cities say await word of when this help is coming.\n  I don't know if there is going to be other news today on this \nsubject, but I hope some way is found and that this will not be the \nfinal message as this Congress leaves for the Memorial Day recess. If \nit is, I pledge to be on the floor the first time this Congress \nreconvenes to say to my colleagues that now is the time to at least \npass the disaster portion of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Washington will yield for an \ninquiry as to how long he expects to be.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Washington will take somewhere between \n10 and 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5093-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5095-S5096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the budget resolution which has just been \nadopted by this body is a remarkable achievement. It is a remarkable \nachievement partly because, for the first time in decades, it was \nadopted by a large bipartisan majority rather than as a simple partisan \ndocument. It is a remarkable achievement as well, I believe, because \neach of the 78 Members of this body who voted for it did so with \nserious reservations about substantial portions of that budget \nresolution. Yes, it meets the primary objective of the President and of \nthe vast majority of Members in Congress in that it establishes \npolicies under which the budget will, in fact, come into balance \nshortly after the turn of the century.\n  Yes, it does, in fact, limit spending and the growth of Government to \na slower rate at least than would take place were we on automatic \npilot.\n  Yes, it meets some but by no means all of the President's priorities \nas he outlined them in his State of the Union Address.\n  And, yes, it provides very real tax relief for the American people, \nmost particularly for working American parents and their children. But \nthose of us for whom tax relief was a major goal are unhappy because it \nis insufficient and because there are too many new spending programs, \nand those relatively indifferent to tax relief but in favor of all of \nthe President's priorities, and more, are unhappy because there is not \nenough spending included in this resolution.\n  In the long run, however, Mr. President, I believe that it represents \na triumph, or rather the culmination of a set of conflicting ideas \nwhich somehow\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\nor another have joined together to make a real success.\n  In 1993, along with every one of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle, I opposed President Clinton's first budget in the firm belief \nthat it would result in harm to our economy. Now, in a very real sense, \nwe were wrong. For a group of reasons, the budget deficit did, indeed, \ndecline and economic opportunity did, indeed, increase.\n  In 1995, as a part of a majority, we proposed a dramatic change in \ndirection, a real balanced budget for the first time, genuine tax \nrelief for the first time and major reforms in entitlement programs \ndesigned not only to help the taxpayers' pocket, but to save the future \nof Medicaid and of Medicare.\n  That resolution never became law because of the President's veto, but \nit did have one tremendously positive impact. For the first time, the \nPresident and a majority of his party dedicated themselves actually to \nbalancing the budget. During the entire year during which that 1995 \nbudget was debated, interest rates declined, it became easier and \neasier for the people of the United States to purchase homes, purchase \nautomobiles, start new businesses, provide job opportunities. Only when \nthe promise began to fail did interest rates, once again, increase.\n  The promise was renewed early this year, and a few short weeks ago \nmet fruition in an agreement between the Republican leadership of both \nHouses and the President of the United States.\n  Since even the commitment to a balanced budget paid dramatic \ndividends in increased economic opportunity, lower unemployment and \nlower interest rates, the accomplishment of a balanced budget, I am \nconvinced, Mr. President, will bring even more rewards to the American \npeople in lower interest rates and greater opportunity, and for the \nfirst time in decades meeting our responsibility not to spend money \ntoday while sending the bills to our children and to our grandchildren.\n\n  I am convinced, in spite of my own disagreement with some of the \npolicies in this proposal, that it will have nothing but good results \nwith respect to the economy of the United States. Yet, Mr. President, I \nam convinced there are still very real troubles ahead, very real rough \nspots in the road.\n  I note that while only eight Members of the Democratic Party voted \nagainst the budget resolution, the vast majority of them voted for \namendment after amendment during the course of the last 3 days that \nwould have increased taxes and increased spending, by my own total for \nthe amendments, by $88 billion in higher taxes and almost that amount \nin greater spending--direct violations of the agreement that they and \nthe President have made with the Republican leadership.\n  As a consequence, I am convinced that it is important for all of us \non both sides of the aisle to remember that we made a commitment to the \nAmerican people in this agreement, one that was almost instantly \napproved by the vast majority of our citizens, and keep not just those \nparts of the agreement with which we agree, but those with which we \ndisagree.\n  I am the chairman, Mr. President, of a subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee. The agreement includes a number of \nPresidential priorities that can only be funded through my \nsubcommittee. Several of those priorities are ones with which I \ndisagree. I think the money could be spent elsewhere better. But I do \nfeel committed to keep those unpleasant parts of the agreement in order \nto reach the overall more important goals that are a part of a historic \nbudget resolution.\n  So, in one sense, Mr. President, the vote a few hours ago was the \nculmination of a process and of a debate which has lasted for many, \nmany years. In another sense, it is only the beginning. And unless it \nis taken seriously by those who support it, we still face the prospect \nof failing.\n  I am an optimist. I think that this is a new beginning, more than an \nending to a long period of arid political exchanges. I look forward to \nworking with all of my colleagues in order to make it happen.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Gorton pertaining to the submission of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 29 are located in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

It has been my good fortune to \nwork with him. While we differ on many issues, I certainly admire the \nextraordinary service he has provided this country.

Mr. President, it is my privilege today to honor Mary \nNiedringhaus of Brandon Valley, SD. Mary has been selected as Teacher \nof the Year in the Brandon Valley School District in recognition of two \ndecades of outstanding teaching, guidance, and care that she has given \nthe children of the community. I can think of few individuals more \ndeserving of this prestigious award.\n  A fifth grade teacher at Brandon Elementary, Mary's gift is her \nability to recognize and meet the needs of each of her students. She \nconveys an excitement for learning that her students find infectious. \nWhether bright or struggling, students excel in Mary's class because \nshe genuinely believes in each of them and draws out their best \nefforts. After hearing Mary's lesson on importance of ladybugs to \npeople, one little girl was so excited that later in the day she rushed \nto Mary and presented her with a ladybug. As she explained \nbreathlessly, she had just rescued it from being flushed down the \ntoilet in the girls' bathroom.\n  Mary holds herself and her students to the highest standards. Parents \nin Brandon seek to place their children in her classroom because they \nknow that she will give them the finest education possible. Once, when \nplanning a unit on South Dakota history for her students, Mary \ndiscovered that no good textbooks existed on the subject for grade \nschool students. Undaunted, she developed her own curriculum based on \nmaterials she gathered on her own. Mary's curriculum is now the model \nused by all teachers in the Brandon Valley school district.\n  No remarks about Mary would be complete without mention of the deep \nempathy she has for others. Brandon Elementary School Principal Marv \nSharkey noted that Mary, ``has the knack of making parents feel like \ntheir child is the best kid in the world.'' Mary genuinely loves her \nstudents; I believe that this is the true source of her success as a \nteacher.\n  Finally, it seems that Mary has done as a good of job raising her \nchildren as she has teaching her students. Her daughter, Nancy \nErickson, is a longtime, invaluable senior member of my staff. Mary \nshould be deeply proud of her.\n  Mr. President, I commend Mary Niedringhaus for her exceptional work. \nAlong with other district winners, she\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nwill now be considered at the State level for the South Dakota Teacher \nof the Year award. I wish her the best of luck as this process \ncontinues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5096-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was not able to come to the floor as \nthe Senator from North Dakota was expressing himself with regard to the \ndisaster, and I know that the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nMinnesota, [Mr. Grams], has worked long and hard to work with all of us \nas we have made the effort to address the extraordinary concerns, the \nextraordinary difficulties, and the extraordinary pain that people in \nMinnesota and the Dakotas have faced now for the better part of 6 \nmonths. First, the harsh winter months, cold and snow and ice in many \ncases precluded farmers from feeding their livestock, and in many cases \ncaused the death of hundreds of thousands of livestock, only to be \nfollowed by floods and other spring disasters that have left many \nthousands of people homeless in all three States.\n  After visits which the President, the Vice President, the Speaker, \nthe House majority leader and others, there was a national commitment \nto address this problem and to find ways in which to help these people \nas quickly as we possibly could. There were editorials written about \nthe great bipartisan effort that was made in order to do all we could \nto address the matter in an expeditious and comprehensive manner.\n  I am very saddened by what has happened in the last 48 hours. I am \ntroubled by the fact that there are those who still wish to use the \neffort to provide this assistance to people who need it so badly as the \nvehicle for an agenda that has nothing to do with the disaster, as a \nvehicle to address other needs, other concerns that may or may not be \nlegitimate but have absolutely no reason for being associated with this \nbill, have absolutely no reason for being attached to this legislation.\n  I am troubled that anybody would use the kind of cynical approach to \nhinder our efforts to find ways with which to address this problem as \nquickly and as seriously as we possibly could. We have no business \nleaving the Senate and leaving the House under these circumstances.\n  I give great credit to the majority leader as he comes to the floor, \nbecause I do believe he made every effort to try to address this \nproblem as successfully as he could. I know he has attempted to find \nways in which to extract those problematic provisions from the bill. I \nknow of his efforts yesterday. I am very disappointed that even with \nhis efforts we failed. I also applaud the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. Senator Stevens has done great work in \nattempting to find ways with which to address this problem.\n  So I must say, Mr. President, on a bipartisan basis I believe our \nbody has done a great deal in attempting to avert the extraordinary \ncalamitous circumstances that we are facing right now. It is going to \nbe very difficult to go home, as I will, to speak to the people of \nWatertown, SD, not only on Memorial Day but at their high school \ncommencement this year and explain what happened, explain why this \nCongress has left town without completing its work on this very \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. President, there are no words to describe how badly some of us \nfeel, how frustrated, exasperated, and angered we are at these \ncircumstances. We can only hope that upon our return, these political \ngames and these ploys that have nothing to do with this legislation can \nbe averted and we can deal with them far more effectively and address \nit in a comprehensive way. At that time, we will still, as late as it \nwill be, give people hope that we understand their pain, that we \nunderstand their circumstance, and that we will respond as we best know \nhow to do. It is only that hope that allows me with a very heavy heart \nto leave this town with our work incomplete.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of us will redouble our efforts as soon as \nwe return. Let us get the job done. Let us do it right. Let us do it \nunderstanding completely how difficult a circumstance people in our \nStates and States around the country must now face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have some unanimous-consent requests to \nmake and an Executive Calendar list. First I want to say to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader I understand his feelings and \nappreciate his comments. We did work to try to get through all the \nlegislative hurdles in moving the supplemental and resolving the \nproblems attached to it. We ran into some procedural limitations there \nat the end that made it impossible for us to complete it, but we need \nto get it done. We are going to get it done. We are going to make sure \nthe people of the States that have had disasters are going to get the \naid they need.\n  I have already sent a letter urging everything be done to make sure \nthe funds continue to flow through FEMA and any other agency that has a \nrole in providing disaster assistance, whether it is in South Dakota, \nNorth Dakota, Kentucky, or Minnesota.\n  When we come back, it is going to be one of the two first orders of \npriority. One, we have to do the budget conference report, which I \nthink will be done very quickly, and then we can really focus on \ngetting the supplemental completed and resolving some of the issues \nthat are critical issues attached to it so that we can come up with a \nsolution everybody can live with on the census question and address the \nroads problem and also find a way to deal with avoiding Government \nshutdowns in the future.\n  I think we can do all of those once we make up our minds to focus on \nit and get our minds committed to working on that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5097-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5097-S5098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EXPLANATION OF SELECTED VOTES TO THE SENATE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, now that the budget resolution has been \nadopted, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss several of the more \nimportant votes that took place.\n  The first of these was the Hatch-Kennedy amendment. This amendment \nwas characterized as an effort to raise cigarette excise taxes in order \nto provide health care for low- and moderate-income children. I take \nexception to that description. There was nothing in the Hatch-Kennedy \namendment to ensure that the new taxes would be imposed upon cigarettes \nor that the additional revenues would be spent on children's health. \nThe net effect of this amendment would have been to raise taxes by $30 \nbillion and spending by $20 billion, period. I have several reasons for \nopposing an amendment of this sort.\n  First, I am not opposed to taxing cigarettes in order to either \nreduce taxes elsewhere or fund important programs, and this vote should \nnot be interpreted as such. The net effect of this amendment, however, \nwould be to reduce the net tax cut contained within this resolution--\ntax cuts targeted at families, education, and pro-growth policies--by \n$30 billion. The tax cut contained in this resolution is already less \nthan 1 percent of the total Federal tax burden over the next 5 years, \nbarely adequate to provided badly needed tax relief to families and \nsmall businesses. I believe that level is already too low, and I \ncertainly do not support making it smaller.\n  Furthermore, nothing prevents Senator Hatch, as a member of the \nFinance Committee, from offering his proposal as part of the \nreconciliation process. An amendment offered in the Finance Committee \nto increase tobacco taxes in order to provide additional Medicaid \nfunding for children's health insurance would be in order. I might \nsupport it. The amendment considered by the Senate Wednesday, however, \ndoes nothing to further the prospects of such an effort.\n  On the other hand, this amendment does expand the reconciliation \ninstructions of the Labor Committee, where Senator Kennedy is the \nranking member. This amendment would provide the Finance Committee an \nadditional $2 billion and the Committee on Labor a whopping $18 \nbillion. Not withstanding the debate over taxes or children's health, \nthere is no disagreement that both these issues belong in the Finance \nCommittee--not Labor. The construction of this amendment appears \nmotivated more by the jurisdictional concerns of Senator Kennedy than a \nconcern for children's health.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment ignores the $16 billion \nalready\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\nprovided by the resolution for children's health insurance. Neither \nSenator Kennedy nor Senator Hatch adequately explained why it was \nnecessary to spend $36 billion for a problem the President had agreed \ncould be addressed with $16 billion or why undermining an agreement \nthat already addresses this problem is superior to working through the \nusual committee process. As was made clear during the debate, the $16 \nbillion provided by the budget is more than enough to provide \nchildren's health insurance as requested by the President.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this amendment does nothing to further the \ncause of providing health care to America's children. It reduces the \ntax cuts for families and small businesses by 35 percent, it does \nnothing to assist the Finance Committee in its work to address this \nissue, and it endangers the $16 billion already provided for children's \nhealth.\n  I would also take this opportunity to speak about the Gramm amendment \nto reduce discretionary spending by $76 billion and increase the net \ntax cut in the resolution by a like amount. Mr. President, the Federal \ndeficit this year will be below $70 billion for the first time in \nalmost 20 years, largely because Congress over the past 2 years held \nthe line on Government spending and taxation. We resisted efforts to \nraise spending above reasonable levels and we opposed efforts to raise \nthe already record tax burden on American families. And while I intend \nto support this resolution because I believe, on balance, that it will \nresult in a smaller, more efficient Government, I am concerned that the \nspending proposed by this agreement is too high, and that it plants the \nseeds for ever-expanding Government down the road.\n  How much spending does this resolution contain? For discretionary \nspending, this resolution spends $212 billion more than the 1995 budget \nresolution, $189 billion more than last year's budget resolution, $75 \nbillion more than the moderate group's budget alternative last year, \nand just $16 billion less than the President's budget this year--\nwithout the triggered cuts he proposed to ensure his budget gets to \nbalance. With regard to the Gramm amendment, the underlying resolution \nspends $76 billion more than the President proposed just last year. \nHence, the Gramm amendment to reduce overall spending levels by $76 \nbillion and to target that savings toward tax reduction.\n  Mr. President, last Congress I collaborated with a group of Senators \nand Representatives to make the Federal more efficient by eliminating \nwasteful programs and consolidating duplicative agencies. In our work, \nwe proposed to eliminate three Cabinet-level agencies--HUD, Commerce, \nand Energy. Moreover, we advocated targeting both spending and tax \nprovisions which provided unwarranted benefits to corporations, so-\ncalled corporate welfare. The point of this effort, Mr. President, was \nto make the Federal bureaucracy more rational and efficient and to \nreduce the burden of government on Americans.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Gramm amendment is in line with our on-\ngoing efforts to streamline the Government and make it more responsive \nto Americans. The discretionary spending levels it provides--the same \nspending levels as supported by the President last year--are sufficient \nto increase funding for important programs like health research, \ntransportation infrastructure, and insuring children while forcing \nCongress to turn a critical eye towards the waste and inefficiency \nprevalent in the Federal bureaucracy. Through my work at eliminating \nwasteful Government agencies, I am convinced that we can save $76 \nbillion over 5 years by targeting corporate welfare without harming \nimportant Federal programs.\n  Just as important, the Gramm amendment provides significant tax \nrelief for American families and businesses. As I said previously, the \ntax relief contained in the underlying budget resolution is less than 1 \npercent of the total Federal tax burden over the next 5 years. It is \nbarely sufficient to provide families with a pared-down $500-per-child \ntax credit, a reduction on the capital gains tax rate, estate tax \nreform, and an expansion of IRA's.\n\n  Mr. President, the tax burden is at its highest level in American \nhistory, with the typical American family paying almost 40 percent of \ntheir income to State, local and Federal governments--more than they \nspend on food, clothing, and housing combined. With the Gramm \namendment, the tax relief contained in this resolution would still be \nmodest--less than 2 percent of the total tax burden--but it would allow \nus to fully fund the $500-per-child tax credit, cut the capital gains \nrate in half, provide relief from the onerous estate tax, and expand \neligibility for IRA's. These are important reforms that I have been \nworking on for my entire tenure in the Senate, and I will continue to \nwork to provide meaningful tax relief to American families beyond the \ntax cuts included in this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5097-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5098-S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we were voting on various matters \nthis morning, leading to passage of the concurrent resolution on the \nbudget for the fiscal year 1998, which I voted against, I found myself \nmusing of the very different time just 4 years ago when a starkly \ndivided Senate passed a far more stentorian measure than that before us \ntoday. In an interval between votes, I wrote to the members of the \nFinance Committee of that time:\n\n       As we close out this embarrassing budget season, cutting \n     taxes, increasing some spending, promising a balanced budget \n     somewhere in the next century, it might restore a measure of \n     self respect to recollect a not distant time when we knew \n     better and did differently.\n       1993. Democrats had won the Presidency and held the \n     Congress. The world was tranquil enough, but our finances \n     were seemingly a wreck. In the twelve previous years the debt \n     had quadrupled and there was no money for anything. On \n     another occasion we can discuss how this came about: I am \n     concerned here with what we did. The Finance Committee (with \n     some help from others) put together and passed, in committee, \n     on the floor, the largest package of tax increases and \n     spending cuts in history. Our purpose was direct and avowed. \n     To show we could govern. The more conservative our critics, \n     the more apocalyptic the pronouncements. Ruin all round was \n     surely at hand.\n       In the event, we succeeded beyond imagining. The latest \n     Monthly Treasury Statement shows a booming economy throwing \n     off unexampled revenue. (Recall, a fortnight ago the \n     Congressional Budget Office discovered an additional $225 \n     billion in anticipated revenues for the next five years. \n     Fortuitous, perhaps, but not fake.) A nice detail? Last month \n     the Treasury paid off $65 billion in debt, the largest \n     repayment ever.\n       It was all done by the narrowest of margins. Bob Kerrey at \n     the very last moment--he had wanted an even sterner measure. \n     But we did do it. I would like to think it will not now be \n     undone. This is not yet clear.\n\n  The contrast between the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \nand this legislation is illuminated by an important article that \nappeared in yesterday's Wall Street Journal under this headline:\n\nTax on Wealthy Is Boosting U.S. Revenue Treasury Says 1993 Increase Is \n                        Helping Cut the Deficit\n\n  The article, by Michael M. Phillips, reports that the cataclysmic \npredictions of so many Republicans about the economic effects of the \n1993 legislation have not been borne out. To the contrary, as a result \nof the 1993 act, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is at its lowest \nlevel in a quarter century, and the expansion is in its 74th month, \nwith full unemployment and little or no inflation. The Treasury is \nawash with revenue. As Mr. Phillips writes:\n\n       The inflow provides persuasive, if not conclusive, evidence \n     in the continuing debate over the economic impact of the 1993 \n     tax increases, which raised marginal income-tax rates to 35% \n     from 31% on taxable incomes between $140,000 and $250,000, \n     and to 39.6% on incomes above $250,000.\n\n  Which leads to another important point, about which I will again \nquote the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The recent flood of revenue pouring into Treasury coffers--\n     enough to push the federal budget to a record $93.94 billion \n     surplus for the month of April--appears to have come mostly \n     from the nation's biggest earners, indicating that the \n     controversial tax increase may indeed be taking from the \n     rich.\n\n  How do we know this? Because the unexpectedly high revenue inflows \nhave come from taxes other than those withheld by employers. These \n``non-withheld'' taxes are mainly paid by wealthier taxpayers, who owe \ntaxes on other income such as stock options, bonuses, and the like. In \nApril, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement, the Treasury took \nin $110.8 billion in nonwithheld revenues, almost twice\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\nwhat it received in 1992, before enactment of the 1993 legislation.\n  It fell to the Finance Committee to assemble the package of spending \ncuts and, yes, tax increases that would pass the Senate. It was not \neasy. In the end, we put the bill through without a single Republican \nvote. One Republican Senator declared on this floor:\n\n       We are buying a one way ticket to a recession * * * When \n     all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy \n     will create fewer jobs, Government will spend more money, and \n     the American people will be worse off.\n\n  It was not pleasant. But we were clear. On June 23, 1993, as the \nSenate debate on the bill was coming to a close, I put it this way:\n\n       Why do we have to do it, Mr. President? Because after 12 \n     years of mounting deficits and devastatingly increased debt, \n     we are sending a message to the financial markets of the \n     United States and of the world, which now have as much effect \n     on our affairs in a manner never before known because of the \n     debt we have incurred, that we are going to stop it.\n\n  We made the tough choices in 1993, and they have paid off handsomely \nin economic and fiscal dividends.\n\n  Now compare 1993 with what we are doing today. By failing to address \nthe overstatement of the cost of living by the Consumer Price Index, \nthis budget misses a historic opportunity. An accurate cost-of-living \nindex, as recommended by the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer \nPrice Index appointed by the Finance Committee--the Boskin Commission--\nwould have saved $1 trillion in 12 years, freeing us from the \nprotracted fiscal crisis of the last two decades. Had we seized the \nopportunity, we could now be taking on big issues, such as the future \nof Medicare and Social Security. Instead, the all-consuming quest to \nreach balance--if only for a moment--in the year 2002 has reduced this \nto a series of small debates over often derisory sums.\n  This budget also fails to address the demographic problems facing our \ntwo biggest Federal entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare. \nThese are the serious issues in Federal budgeting, yet this resolution \npostpones the day when Congress must, inevitably, confront them. Even \nso, it should be recorded that a correction of 1.1 percentage points in \nthe measurement of the cost of living would in an instant have kept \nSocial Security in actuarial balance until the year 2052.\n  This resolution unwisely calls for net tax cuts of $250 billion over \n10 years. Coupled with this budget's failure to address long-term \nentitlement spending, these tax cuts will lead us right back to giant \ndeficits in the outyears. Preliminary estimates, which are just \nbeginning to come in, indicate that in the second 10 years, 2008-2017, \nthe proposed tax cuts could lose in excess of half of $1 trillion.\n  Even if one believes, as some do in good faith, that tax cuts are \nnecessary and appropriate at this point, the particular tax cuts agreed \nto by the White House and the Republican leadership will make for poor \ntax policy. It is beyond any serious dispute that the proposed \nreductions in the rate of tax on capital gains will disproportionately \ngo to the very wealthiest taxpayers. Likewise the estate tax relief \ncalled for in this budget will benefit a tiny fraction--less than 1.5 \npercent--of estates. And the proposed tax cuts for education, most \nthoughtful observers agree, could be better spent in ways that would \ndemonstrably help students and their families, such as making permanent \nthe provisions for employer-provided educational assistance.\n\n  Nor does this budget follow the spirit of the 1993 legislation in the \narea of deficit reduction. The provisions of the 1993 act were \ninitially estimated to reduce the deficit by $500 billion over 5 years; \nin fact it reduced the deficit by nearly twice that amount. The deficit \nreduction in the budget before us is questionable; its balance in the \nyear 2002 will be momentary at best. And it makes only feeble, \nshortsighted choices in tax and entitlement policy.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I voted ``no'' because this budget is an \nunworthy successor to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, \nwhich was perhaps the most consequential legislation of this decade. I \nask unanimous consent that the article from the Wall Street Journal of \nMay 22, 1997, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Tax on Wealthy Is Boosting U.S. Revenue\n\n\n         treasury says 1993 increase is helping cut the deficit\n\n                        (By Michael M. Phillips)\n\n       Washington.--President Clinton sold the 1993 income-tax \n     increase as a way to shrink the budget deficit at the expense \n     of the rich.\n       Republican adversaries predicted it wouldn't generate much \n     revenue because the rich would work less and take bigger \n     deductions: Now there's growing, if still tentative, evidence \n     that Mr. Clinton may have been right after all.\n       The recent flood of revenue pouring into Treasury coffers--\n     enough to push the federal budget to a record $93.94 billion \n     surplus for the month of April--appears to have come mostly \n     from the nation's biggest earners, indicating that the \n     controversial tax increase may indeed be taking from the \n     rich. ``The available data suggest the surge in tax \n     collections has come from the taxpayers with high incomes, \n     who were the only ones affected by the 1993 changes,'' says \n     Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.\n       Corporate taxes, which were increased modestly under the \n     1993 law, also have brought in more revenue, but at about the \n     level the Treasury had been predicting.\n       Treasury officials had expected healthy revenue growth from \n     the tax changes all along. After all, the economy has been \n     expanding at a steady clip and unemployment stands at 4.9% of \n     the work force, meaning more people are taking home \n     paychecks, making money on stock options, raking in bonuses--\n     and giving the government its cut.\n\n\n                           surprising amounts\n\n       But the dimensions of the inflows caught officials by \n     surprise. Individual income-tax liabilities rose about 11% in \n     the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1995, and a further 12% in \n     fiscal 1996. Data aren't yet available to prove whether those \n     sudden increases came from the poor, the rich or those in \n     between. Treasury officials see convincing signs, however, \n     that upper-income Americans are behind the revenue surge.\n       Lower- and middle-income workers usually have their taxes \n     withheld by their employers. Upper-income taxpayers are much \n     more likely to receive year-end bonuses or income from \n     exercising stock options, so they are also more likely to \n     have to send in checks with their returns.\n       This year, revenues from those non-withheld taxes are \n     running many billions of dollars above the Treasury's \n     expectations. In April, when individual returns were due, the \n     Treasury took in $110.8 billion in nonwithheld tax revenues, \n     up from $89 billion in April 1996 and nearly twice the $57 \n     billion it received in April 1992, before the tax increase \n     took effect.\n       ``It turned out we got more revenues than were anticipated \n     and also more revenues than could be explained by the growth \n     of the economy,'' says Eric J. Toder, an economic consultant \n     and Mr. Clinton's former deputy assistant secretary of the \n     Treasury for tax analysis.\n\n\n                            big debt payment\n\n       Some of the revenue growth could be coming from individuals \n     who are cashing in stock options. And some companies are no \n     doubt deducting those costs from their own taxes. But, on \n     balance, the government is taking in billions more than it \n     had expected, and most of that is in the form of nonwithheld \n     individual income taxes. In fact, revenues have been running \n     so high even conservative budget watchers have reduced their \n     five-year deficit projections by $225 billion. And last \n     month, the Treasury announced the government would pay off \n     $65 billion of the federal debt--the largest such payback \n     ever and $50 billion more than officials had planned just a \n     few months earlier.\n       The inflow provides persuasive, if not conclusive, evidence \n     in the continuing debate over the economic impact of the 1993 \n     tax increases, which raised marginal income-tax rates to 36% \n     from 31% on taxable incomes between $140,000 and $250,000, \n     and to 39.6% on incomes above $250,000. The law also \n     effectively boosted Medicare taxes on high-income individuals \n     and implemented other changes.\n       The package, part of the 1993 budget agreement, drew harsh \n     criticism from the right. Texas GOP Rep. Dick Armey, who is \n     now the House majority leader, predicted dire results. ``Who \n     can blame many second-earner families for deciding that the \n     sacrifice of a second job is no longer worth it?'' he wrote. \n     Then-Sen. Robert Packwood, an Oregon Republican and chairman \n     of the Senate Finance Committee, made this forecast: ``I will \n     make you this bet. I am willing to risk the mortgage on it. . \n     . . The deficit will be up; unemployment will be up: in my \n     judgment, inflation will be up.''\n\n\n                         Armey Praises Congress\n\n       Mr. Packwood later acknowledged that his prediction was \n     wrong. A spokeswoman for Mr. Armey credits the Republican-\n     dominated Congress, not the tax increase, for sparking \n     economic growth and higher tax revenues.\n       Other doomsayers, in the face of a booming economy, have \n     softened their predictions. But Martin Feldstein, a Harvard \n     economist and chairman of President Reagan's Council of \n     Economic Advisers, took a more academic approach to analyzing \n     the tax increase he labeled ``a bad mistake.''\n       In a 1995 study, Prof. Feldstein, who counts Mr. Summers \n     among his former students,\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\n     and co-author Daniel Feenberg argued the increase had \n     produced disappointingly little revenue--just $9 billion in \n     1993--while encouraging the rich to work less, deduct more \n     and generally change their behavior to avoid paying more \n     money to the government. In particular, couples with joint \n     incomes of $140,000 to $180,000 were more inclined to seek \n     larger mortgages, take more time off instead of working extra \n     hours or otherwise reduce the amount of income they would \n     have to report as taxable, Prof. Feldstein says.\n       Even now, with the Treasury flush, Prof. Feldstein contents \n     that the tax increase has proved to be an unjustified drain \n     on the U.S. economy. The unexpected revenue surge could be \n     due in part to the spectacular performance of the stock \n     market--and executives' stock options--in recent years, he \n     says. Besides, he adds, the budget situation would have been \n     even better without the tax boost.\n       That what-if question is a thorny one. Hard data aren't yet \n     available to show whether in fact the tax increase led high-\n     income Americans so reduce their taxable income in 1995 and \n     1996.\n       But present and former Treasury officials say the recent \n     revenue flood has tilted the debate against Prof. Feldstein \n     and indicates that the tax boost is probably raising large \n     sums from the wealthy.\n       ``The basic fact is that people looked at the 1993 budget \n     agreement and said there'd be a recession, the deficit would \n     go way up and that tax collections would go way down,'' says \n     Mr. Summers. ``What has happened is there has been a boom, \n     the deficit has gone way down and tax collections have gone \n     way up.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5098-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FISCAL YEAR 1998 BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I voted with the majority of my \ncolleagues in supporting the bipartisan budget agreement embodied in \nthe Fiscal Year 1998 Budget Resolution. While I have serious concerns \nabout several aspects of this agreement, I am hopeful that time will \nprove me wrong and the American people will actually reap the benefits \nof permanent tax relief and deficit reduction that are promised in this \nagreement.\n  First, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for his hard \nwork and excellent management of this difficult bill. In particular, I \nam grateful for his cooperation and support for my amendment regarding \nconcerns about overly optimistic estimates of revenue from the future \nauction of broadcast spectrum. I am committed to enacting legislation \nto mandate these auctions over the next 5 years, but I am very \nconcerned that this budget assumes much greater revenues from spectrum \nsales than can reasonably be anticipated at this time.\n  Both Senator Domenici and I agree that spectrum auctions will raise a \nconsiderable amount of revenue for the Treasury. However, we also share \nthe common concern that auctions depend on supply and demand, and \ntherefore, the revenue received will undoubtedly fluctuate from today's \nestimates.\n  The amendment that Senator Hollings and I offered simply states, that \nif the revenue from future sales falls short of the estimates in the \nresolution, deficit reduction targets will not be met. In that event, \nmy amendment would require the Senate to find other savings or revenue \nto ensure that we stay on track in eliminating annual budget deficits \nby 2002. Senator Domenici's support for this amendment was critical to \nits adoption by a vote of 84 to 15. I am counting on him to work with \nSenator Hollings and me to identify spending cuts in the event spectrum \nsales fall short of the revenue estimates in the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I have listened carefully to my colleagues who have \ndiscussed problems with the economic estimates underlying this plan. I, \ntoo, was disturbed when the Congressional Budget Office released a new \nestimate of future tax revenue just hours before the President and the \nCongressional negotiators on this balanced budget deal announced a \nfinal deal. While time may validate CBO's more optimistic estimates, \nthe sudden announcement of an additional $225 billion in taxes was \ndisconcerting, to say the least. While our economy's performance in \nrecent months could very well justify a near-term revenue increase, I \nam concerned that the high rates of economic growth forecast into the \nnext century might be too optimistic. More importantly, this tax \nwindfall could hamper efforts in the near term to reduce both \ndiscretionary and mandatory Federal spending.\n\n  Mr. President, under the plan in this resolution, we will continue to \ncarry an annual deficit for the next 4 years. Our Nation's burden of \ndebt will increase to $6.5 trillion by the year 2002. Annual \nappropriations spending will continue to increase under the plan in \nthis resolution. I hope the Congress will resist the temptation to \nspend up to the limits in this resolution, and will instead work to \nadvance the date when our budget is in balance and we begin to whittle \naway at the national debt.\n  The most important and promising aspect of this resolution is its \npromise of permanent tax relief for Americans. The resolution sets up a \nprocedure for swift enactment of a bill to provide tax relief that will \ncreate jobs and provide the fuel for even greater economic growth in \nour Nation.\n  The $500-per-child tax credit will give immediate and much-needed \nrelief to middle- and low-income families. Capital gains and estate tax \nrelief will spur investment in new enterprises and reinvestment in \nfamily and small businesses. Until this agreement, the President had \nbeen implacably opposed to these profamily and pro-small-business tax \nreforms. Early enactment of these tax relief measures should be the \nfirst order of business for the Congress under this agreement.\n  Mr. President, in the 15 years I have spent in the Congress, I have \nseen many plans and proposals to balance the budget. Yet, today, our \nNation bears the financial burden of a $5.3 trillion debt. Yet, I voted \nfor this plan because I remain hopeful that the Congress and the \nPresident are committed to both the letter and the spirit of the \nagreement reached just a few weeks ago. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to enact the much-needed tax reform envisioned in this \nresolution and to ensure we carry out the terms of this agreement to \nachieve a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5100-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LOIS PALAGI\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Mrs. Lois Palagi, \na third grade teacher at West Elementary School in Butte. I want to \nrecognize Lois because she has distinguished herself as one of the best \nand most beloved teachers in the community of Butte.\n  In Montana we pride ourselves on providing our children with a top \nnotch education. And we do a great job. But that success doesn't happen \nby accident. All Montanans shoulder part of the responsibility. One key \ncomponent of our success is Montana's dedicated and hard-working \nteachers.\n  Lois is a prime example of how teachers help our youth become some of \nthe most competitive minds in the country. She has served her students \nfor over 35 years. And in that time, she has taught her children the \nimportance of discipline, respect, knowledge and wisdom. So many people \nhave grown up under her watchful eyes to become responsible, hard-\nworking adults because she led by example. And now she leaves behind a \nlegacy of dedication, caring and love for teaching. She has brought \ngreat honor to her noble profession.\n  At the end of this school year, Lois will begin a new undertaking--\nretirement. She will be able to spend more time with her husband Larry, \nson Mark, and daughter-in-law Linda. And devote more of her time to her \nthree grandchildren: Bob, Jessica, and little Andie Elizabeth. She will \nbe dearly missed at West Elementary School. But I'm certain she will be \nheartily appreciated as she spends more time with her family.\n  Mr. President, it is impossible to count the number of lives that one \nperson touches during his or her life. But I do know that in 35 years \nof teaching, that number is sure to be a mighty sum. I would just like \nto add my voice to all the others and say ``Thank you, Lois.''\n  And good luck in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5100-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5100-S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DISASTER ASSISTANCE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I deeply regret that the other body has \nchosen to stand in recess for the Memorial Day break without having \npassed disaster assistance appropriations for the hundreds of thousands \nof victims of natural disasters in 33 states throughout the country. As \nall members are aware, yesterday afternoon the House\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\nof Representatives, by a vote of 278-67, rejected an adjournment \nresolution. Immediately following that vote, according to press \naccounts, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nMr. Livingston, sought recognition for the purpose of attempting to \nbring up a clean disaster assistance supplemental appropriation bill \nintended to provide sufficient and necessary assistance for a number of \nprograms to ensure that there will be no delay in getting assistance to \nthe victims of these natural disasters. As I understand it, the total \namount of that proposal was approximately $1 billion. Had the House \ntaken it up and passed this interim disaster assistance bill, I am \ncertain the Senate could have done the same and the President had \nindicated that he would have signed it.\n  The larger disaster assistance supplemental bill that is in \nconference contains some very controversial and difficult issues which \nhave nothing to do with providing the necessary funds for disaster \nvictims, or with the nearly $2 billion contained in the bill for aid to \nour men and women in uniform around the world--particularly Bosnia--\nengaged in peacekeeping operations, or with the $750 million in funding \nfor veterans compensation and pension. The conferees are in agreement, \nto a large extent, with the funding issues in the bill. But, these \ncontentious, extraneous issues have slowed the progress of the \nconference despite the skillful and patient manner with which the \ndistinguished chairman of the conference, Mr. Livingston, has conducted \neach meeting of the conferees. He has shown the ability to proceed as \nexpeditiously as possible, while at the same time protecting all \nMembers' rights to fully air their views on each matter before the \nconference. I have nothing but high praise for his leadership, as well \nas that of the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Obey, or of our \nchairman, Senator Stevens, as well as for all of the chairmen and \nranking members of this conference who have worked many hours to \nresolve most of the differences in the bill. I would have preferred, as \nI am sure all of the conferees would have preferred, to be able to \nstand here today urging the Senate to adopt a completed conference \nagreement on H.R. 1469, the emergency disaster assistance supplemental \nappropriation bill.\n  Since, for the reasons I have stated, that was not possible, I \nexpress to the American people and particularly to the hundreds of \nthousands of disaster victims throughout the country, my deep regret \nthat their elected representatives in Congress have chosen to recess \nfor the Memorial Day holiday without having taken any action to address \ntheir desperate need for Federal assistance. At the same time, I urge \nthem not to despair and pledge my efforts to do all that I can to work \nwith the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, and the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the House Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. Livinston, and Mr. Obey, to complete final action on \nH.R. 1469 as quickly is as humanly possible when the conference next \nconvenes, hopefully during the first week of June.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5100-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES WEEK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this week is National Emergency Medical \nServices Week. The people who work and volunteer in the emergency \nmedical services field provide an invaluable service for all American \ncitizens--they provide us with a safety net. This is necessary because \nregardless of how careful we try to be, we are all subject to the whims \nof fate. Common sense and practicality are often not enough to prevent \naccidents caused by the carelessness of ourselves or others. In these \ntimes of need, we rely on dedicated emergency medical services \npersonnel. They take care of us when we cannot take care of ourselves.\n  I want to take this time to recognize the special disposition that a \nperson must have to be an emergency medical service worker. These \npeople all share common characteristics such as the desire to help, as \nwell as the ability to feel empathy for, the people they assist. Of \ncourse, kindness and willingness to help alone are not enough. These \nworkers must also possess the skills needed to do the job and to do it \nwell. These skills can only be acquired through hard work and \ndedication. The working lives of emergency medical service workers are \ncharacterized by a lack of predictability in both content and \nscheduling. They have no routine to rely on. They truly must be ready \nfor any thing at any time.\n  Although emergency medical service workers across the country have \nmany things in common, they also face many different challenges and \ndangers every day. There are some who must fight traffic, some who \nfight long distances and bad roads, and some who are forced to face the \nfear and possibility of losing their lives in order to try and save \nours. Despite all of the challenges and dangers faced by these \ndedicated workers, they continue to be efficient, to be dependable, and \nto be effective in saving lives day after day.\n  In a world which is fraught with peril, it comforts me to know that \nthere are people that we can count on in our hour of need. And so, Mr. \nPresident, I am proud to recognize this week as National Emergency \nMedical Services week to acknowledge the important work and strong \ncharacter of the dedicated emergency medical services personnel. We are \nfortunate to have this opportunity to show our appreciation for all of \ntheir tireless work on our behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5101-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will welcome home a true \nAmerican hero, Eastpointe, MI native, astronaut Jerry Linenger. Jerry \nis returning to Earth this weekend aboard the space shuttle Atlantis \nafter a 5 month mission on the Russian space station, Mir.\n  I am sure that Jerry expected his 5 months in space to provide him \nwith innumerable opportunities and challenges, but the challenges he \nand his crewmates faced were way beyond expectations. They had to fix \nantifreeze fume leaks which threatened the space station's air supply. \nThe oxygen-generating systems malfunctioned, forcing the crew to \nactivate three backup oxygen canisters each day to provide them with \nthe oxygen they needed to breathe. And, Jerry and his Russian fellow \nscientists had to extinguish the worst fire ever aboard an orbiting \nhuman spacecraft, an ordeal which captured the attention of millions of \npeople in the United States, Russia and around the world. It seemed \nfrom this earthly vantage point that the 10 plagues of space travel \nwere being visited on Mir--leaks, lack of oxygen, humidity, fire, \ntemperature, excess CO2, loss of power, lack of supplies and \nreplacement parts, claustrophobia, and separation from family. When the \nspace shuttle Atlantis recently linked up with the Mir space station to \ndeliver much needed repair parts and to pick him up, Jerry may have \nmade the understatement of the year when he remarked to its crew \nmembers that it was ``nice to see you.''\n  While the drama played out in space, Jerry Linenger's professionalism \ncame to the fore. He continued his work on\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\nthe scientific experiments he was scheduled to complete, including \nexperiments on materials which may be used in future spacecraft, and \ntests on how living in space affected his immune system. He also \nbrought his experiences home to Earth by posting letters to his son, \nJohn, on NASA's World Wide Web page, as well as by participating in the \nMir international amateur Radio experiment. Using this new technology, \nJerry linked up with a fifth grade class in Charlevoix, MI. In one of \nhis messages to his son, Jerry explained one facet of life in space: \n``When running on the treadmill, we sweat. From our skin, the moisture \nevaporates in order to cool our bodies (By the way--those doggies you \nare so fascinated with use their tongues, panting, to 'sweat' and \nregulate their temperature). The sweat evaporates into the air. This \nwater, along with all the other humidity in the air is condensed on \ncold coils (just like the outside of your cold bottle getting wet on a \nhot, humid day) and collected. Biocide is added, the condensate boiled, \nand we use it to drink or rehydrate our freeze-dried foods. Delicious.\n  We have all felt the joy which comes with returning home from a long \ntrip, but there are few people alive who truly know the feeling Jerry \nLinenger will have after returning from 5 months orbiting the Earth. \nJerry's wife, Kathryn, and young son, John, eagerly anticipate his \nreturn for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that \nKathryn is due to give birth to their second child in early June. It \nappears that Jerry will make it home in time.\n  I would like to express my deepest admiration for the accomplishments \nof Jerry Linenger. We can all benefit from his example of courage, \nperseverance and professionalism. Jerry has said that upon his return \nto Earth, he hopes to spend time with his family and dreams of ``going \nup to Northern Michigan and finding an old timer that knows how to fish \nand doesn't like talking a lot . . . just sitting down by the stream \nand breathing fresh air in and the fresh water.'' I, for one, hope he \ngets that chance. I know my colleagues join me in welcoming Jerry \nLinenger back to Earth, and in congratulating him on a mission \nheroically accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5101-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REGARDING THE DEDICATION OF THE JACK SWIGERT MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to call my \ncolleagues' attention to a historic event which occurred today in \nStatuary Hall, just down the hall from this chamber--the unveiling of \nColorado's statue of Jack Swigert. I commend and applaud the efforts of \nall those Coloradans who helped to bring the Jack Swigert statue to \nWashington and Statuary Hall.\n  The inclusion of this statue would not be possible without the \nefforts of many Coloradans, who I would like to thank for their \ntireless efforts.\n  Among the individuals who worked on this project, the members of the \nJack Swigert Memorial Commission should be mentioned for their \ndedication. Holly Coors, Marleen Fish, Don Friedman, Dennis Gallagher, \nVirginia Swigert, and Carl Williams all worked tirelessly under the \nchairmanship of Hal Shroyer. Has has spent 10 years on this project, \nand I am happy that he can see his goal achieved today.\n  The Arapahoe County Republican Men's Club also stands out for its \nlarge contribution. Members lobbied the State legislature and donated \nsubstantial amounts of time and money in an effort to commission the \nstatue.\n  Of equal importance to the effort was Veterans of Foreign Wars \nChapter 11229. It was commissioned soley for the purpose of persuading \nthe State legislature to create the statue of Mr. Swigert and put the \ninitiative on the ballot. Mr. Swigert was a lifelong member of VFW Post \nNo. 1, which is the oldest VFW in the Nation founded after the Spanish-\nAmerican War.\n  Due to the dedicated efforts of these individuals and the many others \ninvolved in this project, Jack Swigert will be remembered and honored \nas a true American hero with this statue we dedicate to him today. And, \nhis statue will represent Colorado with honor and distinction here in \nthe U.S. Capitol for generations to come.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5102-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5102-S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OUTSTANDING NM SMALL BUSINESSES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor New Mexico's outstanding \nsmall businesses and small business advocates as selected by the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration. I will not be able to attend the awards \nluncheon but I do want to recognize the significant accomplishments of \nthese New Mexican entrepreneurs.\n\n\n             NEW MEXICO SMALL BUSINESS PERSONS OF THE YEAR\n\n  The top SBA award this year goes to Mary Jean and Andrew \nChristiansen, owners of Elite Laundry Co. in Gallup, NM, who were \nselected as New Mexico Small Business Persons of the Year. The \nChristensen's are among the 53 top small businesses owners in the \nNation who will be honored by the SBA in Washington, DC, later this \nyear.\n  The Christiansens have created more than 70 jobs in a region of New \nMexico that has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation. This \nfamily owned small business is also providing profit-sharing and \nretirement benefits, in a state where 71 percent of private sector \nemployees have no pensions.\n\n\n                       1997 EXPORTER OF THE YEAR\n\n  New Mexico recently received word from the Commerce Department that \nit has seen a 112 percent growth in exports, including a remarkable \n256-percent increase in trade with Asia. These achievements would not \nhave been possible without the hard work and savvy of business-owners \nsuch as Kimberly de Castro, the 1997 New Mexico Exporter of the Year.\n  Ms. de Castro is the owner of Wildflower International Ltd., in Santa \nFe, which provides brokering services to foreign buyers. Based on \nbuyers' initial inquiries, Wildflower International researches the \nmarketplace and provides buyers with options that meet their \nrequirements. The trade company currently exports to China, Israel, \nItaly and Egypt and is actively negotiating sales in Taiwan and several \nother Asian countries.\n\n\n                      1997 ADVOCATE AWARD WINNERS\n\n  Small business owners and entrepreneurs need champions who believe in \nwhat they're doing and give them advice, encouragement and assistance.\n  Michael G. Murphy, the assistant business editor for the Albuquerque \nJournal, is the 1997 New Mexico Media Advocate of the Year and also the \n1997 Region VI Media Advocate of the Year. Previously the editor of the \nAlbuquerque Business Times, Mr. Murphy has reported on issues and \ninitiatives that have been informative and useful to the small business \ncommunity as well as governmental officials.\n  The New Mexico Women in Business Advocate of the Year is Jennifer A. \nCraig, regional manager of the Women's Economic Self Sufficiency Team \nOffice in Las Cruces. WESST Corp. is a nonprofit business and technical \nassistance organization that focuses on women and minority \nentrepreneurs. Since the Las Cruces office opened in 1995, more than \n250 women have received assistance and more than 50 have started or \ndeveloped their own businesses.\n  Teresa O. Molina, a vice president of 1st New Mexico Bank in Deming, \nhas been selected as the New Mexico Financial Services Advocate. Ms. \nMolina is active in SBA lending and through her efforts, 1st New Mexico \nBank awarded the first SBA 504 loan in my home State.\n  The 1997 New Mexico Minority Small Business Advocate is Anna Muller, \nthe owner of NEDA Business Consultants in Albuquerque. Ms. Muller was a \nnational leader in the effort to preserve and improve the SBA 8(a) \nMinority Enterprise Development program.\n\n\n              1997 SUBCONTRATOR AND CONTRACTOR OF THE YEAR\n\n  Dennis A. Reasner, president of Albuquerque's Darco Products, Inc., \nis the 1997 Region VI Subcontractor of the Year. Armando De La Paz, \npresident and CEO of Vista Technologies, Inc., in Albuquerque is the \n1997 Region VI Prime Contractor of the Year.\n  Small businesses are the engine of New Mexico's--and the Nation's--\neconomic growth. I commend these small business owners and advocates \nfor their desire and commitment to create new jobs and new economic \nopportunities in\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nNew Mexico. We must raise the standard of living in my State and one \nconcrete way to accomplish this is by fostering the development of \nsmall businesses that provide good wages and good benefits for their \nemployees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5102-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ARLINGTON\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, today I introduced S. 817, legislation \ndesigned to maintain rural communities' access to hospital care.\n  Today many rural Americans live in fear that they may lose access to \nlocal and regional hospital care. In these rural areas, where serious \naccidents, often related to farm equipment, are a constant threat. \nAccess to an emergency care hospital within 35 miles can mean the \ndifference between life and death. The ability to be referred to a \nmajor regional hospital for more specialized care can be of like \nimportance. Congress must recognize the special needs of rural America \nand work to meet them. This bill is a step in the right direction.\n  The Rural Health Care Protection Act of 1997 focuses on providing \nsupport to Sole Community Hospitals and Rural Referral Centers. Sole \nCommunity Hospitals [SCH's] are hospitals located at least 35 miles \nfrom other hospitals and are often the sole source of emergency care or \ninpatient services in their areas. There are currently 728 SCH's in 46 \nStates. There are 11 in my home State of Iowa. Rural Referral Centers \n[RRC's] are relatively large and specialized rural hospitals which \nreceive referrals from community hospitals throughout a region. There \nare currently 142 RRC's in 39 states, including five in Iowa.\n  This legislation contains four proposals designed to help keep these \ncare centers operating. First, the act would give SCH's the option of \nchoosing an updated fiscal year 1994-95 base year for Medicare funding \ninstead of the outdated base years which they must currently use. \nSecond, the act would permanently grandfather as an RRC any hospital \nthat has previously qualified as an RRC. Third, the act would exempt \nthe RRC's from the statewide rural wage index threshold for geographic \nreclassification. Finally, the bill would allow rural hospitals that \nmeet the reclassification criteria to be reclassified as urban \nhospitals for purposes of disproportionate share hospital [DSH] payment \nadjustments.\n  This bill would help ensure that rural Americans maintain access to \nthese essential care centers. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join me in support of this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5103-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURE RETURNED TO CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The actions of Swiss banks and their relations with \n     Nazi Germany before and during World War II and the banks' \n     actions after the war concerning former Nazi loot and \n     heirless assets placed in the banks before the war have been \n     the subject of an extensive and ongoing inquiry by the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n     Senate and a study by a United States interagency group.\n       (2) On January 8, 1997, Michel Christopher Meili, while \n     performing his duties as a security guard at the Union Bank \n     of Switzerland in Zurich, Switzerland, discovered that bank \n     employees were shredding important Holocaust-era documents.\n       (3) Mr. Meili was able to save some of the documents from \n     destruction and then turned them over to the Jewish community \n     in Zurich and to the Swiss police.\n       (4) Following Mr. Meili's disclosure of the destruction of \n     the Holocaust-era documents, Mr. Meili was suspended and then \n     terminated from his job. He was also interrogated by the \n     local Swiss authorities who tried to intimidate him by \n     threatening prosecution for his heroic actions.\n       (5) Since this disclosure, Mr. Meili and his family have \n     been threatened and harassed, and have received many death \n     threats. Mr. Meili also received a hand-delivered note \n     threatening the kidnapping of his children in return for the \n     ``Jewish money'' he would receive for his actions, and urging \n     him to emigrate to the United States or be killed.\n       (6) Because of his courageous actions, Mr. Meili and his \n     family have suffered economic hardship, mental anguish, and \n     have been forced to live in fear for their lives.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Michel Christopher Meili, Giuseppina Meili, Mirjam Naomi \n     Meili, and Davide Meili shall be held and considered to have \n     been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent \n     residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon \n     payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 3. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Michel \n     Christopher Meili, Giuseppina Meili, Mirjam Naomi Meili, and \n     Davide Meili as provided in this Act, the Secretary of State \n     shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the \n     appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total \n     number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country \n     of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5104-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5104-S5106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATION OF THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas the Expedition commanded by Meriwether Lewis and \n     William Clark, which came to be called ``The Corps of \n     Discovery'', was one of the most remarkable and productive \n     scientific and military exploring expeditions in all American \n     history;\n       Whereas President Thomas Jefferson gave Lewis and Clark the \n     mission to ``. . . explore the Missouri River & such \n     principal stream of it, as, by its course and communication \n     with the waters of the Pacific ocean, whether the Columbia, \n     Oregon, Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct \n     & practicable water communication across this continent for \n     the purposes of commerce. . .'';\n       Whereas the Expedition, in response to President \n     Jefferson's directive, greatly advanced our geographical \n     knowledge of the continent and prepared the way for the \n     extension of the American fur trade with Indian tribes \n     throughout the area;\n       Whereas President Jefferson directed the explorers to take \n     note of and carefully record the natural resources of the \n     newly acquired territory known as Louisiana, as well as \n     diligently report on the native inhabitants of the land;\n       Whereas Lewis and Clark and their companions began their \n     historic journey to explore the uncharted wilderness west of \n     the Mississippi River at Wood River, Illinois on May 14, \n     1804, and followed the Missouri River westward from its mouth \n     on the Mississippi to its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains;\n       Whereas the Expedition spent its first winter at Fort \n     Mandan, North Dakota, crossed the Rocky Mountains by \n     horseback in August 1805, reached the Pacific Ocean at the \n     mouth of the Columbia river in mid-November of that year, and \n     wintered at Fort Clatsop, near the present city of Astoria, \n     Oregon;\n       Whereas the Expedition returned to St. Louis, Missouri, on \n     September 23, 1806, after a 28-month journey covering 8,000 \n     miles during which it traversed 11 future States: Illinois, \n     Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, \n     Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon;\n       Whereas the explorers faithfully followed the President's \n     directives and dutifully recorded their observations in their \n     detailed journals;\n       Whereas these journals describe many plant and animal \n     species, some completely unknown to the world of science or \n     never before encountered in North America, and added greatly \n     to scientific knowledge about the flora and fauna of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas accounts from the journals of Lewis and Clark and \n     the detailed maps that were prepared by the Expedition \n     enhanced knowledge of the western continent and routes for \n     commerce;\n       Whereas the journals of Lewis and Clark documented diverse \n     American Indian languages, customs, religious beliefs, and \n     ceremonies;

and\n       (3) calls upon the President, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, the Director of the National Park Service, American \n     Indian tribes, other public officials, and the citizens of \n     the United States to support, promote, and participate in the \n     many bicentennial activities being planned to commemorate the \n     Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today we are considering Senate Resolution \n57, a resolution commemorating the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark \nExpedition.\n  The resolution asks public officials and other citizens to support, \npromote, and participate in the many bicentennial activities \ncelebrating the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The resolution also \nexpresses its support for the events to be held in observance of the \nexpedition at St. Louis, MO, in 2004, at Bismarck, ND, in 2005, in \nHohenwald, TN, at the Meriwether Lewis National Monument, and in many \ncities during the bicentennial celebration. It further commends the \nwork of the National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council, Lewis and \nClark Trail Heritage Foundation, public and private groups, and \nindividuals that are preparing bicentennial activities to celebrate the \n200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during the years \n2004 through 2006.\n  Senate Resolution 57 notes that the Lewis and Clark Expedition was \none of the most remarkable and productive scientific and military \nexpeditions in American history. President Thomas Jefferson directed \nthat scientific, biological, geographic, and ethnographic information \nabout the territory west of the Mississippi be gathered and reported. \nIn ``Undaunted Courage,'' Stephan E. Ambrose wrote that President \nJefferson directed that the first purpose of the expedition was ``to \nfind the shortest & most convenient route of communication between the \nU.S. and the Pacific ocean, within the temperate latitudes.''\n  After months of preparing for the journey into unknown territory, \nincluding learning celestial navigation, gathering equipment, and \nchoosing men for the expedition, Meriwether Lewis and and his co-\ncaptain William Clark began their journey west of the Mississippi at \nWood River, IL, on May 14, 1804. The 40-person expedition wintered near \nFort Mandan, ND, reached Fort Clatsop on the Pacific Ocean near present \nday Astoria, OR, and returned to St. Louis, MO, on September 23, 1806. \nTheir 28-month journey covered 8,000 miles and traversed 11 future \nStates: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, South \nDakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.\n  The maps prepared on the expedition and the journals kept by \nMeriwether Lewis and William Clark carefully document their \ndiscoveries. The Lewis and Clark Expedition encountered and documented \ndiverse American Indian people, languages, customs, religious beliefs, \nand ceremonies. The native American Indian tribes of the Northern \nPlains and the Pacific Northwest played an essential role in the \nsurvival and success of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n\n  On their safe return to St. Louis, Lewis and Clark reported to \nJefferson:\n\n       In obedience to your orders we have penetrated the \n     Continent of North America to the Pacific Ocean, and \n     sufficiently explored the interior of the country to affirm \n     with confidence that we have discovered the most practicable \n     rout (sic) which does exist across the continent by means of \n     the navigable branches of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers.\n\n  The National Park Service [NPS] also observes that:\n\n       The Lewis and Clark Expedition was one of the most dramatic \n     and significant episodes in the history of the United States. \n     It stands, incomparably, as our Nation's epic in documented \n     exploration of the American West. During 1804-06, it carried \n     the destiny, as well as the flag, of our young Nation \n     westward from the Mississippi across thousands of miles of \n     uncharted lands to the Pacific Ocean.\n  NPS goes on to say that:\n\n       In its scope and achievements, the Expedition towers among \n     the major explorations in the history of the world. Its \n     findings contributed vital new knowledge concerning the \n     resources and inhabitants of the lands west of the \n     Mississippi River. The resulting geopolitical impact of the \n     mission had far-reaching effects upon international \n     boundaries and relations.\n\n  The President and the Congress have previously recognized the \nimportance of the Lewis and Clark Expedition by establishing a 5-year \ncommission in 1964 to study the history and route of the expedition, \nand again in 1978 by designating the route as the Lewis and Clark \nNational Historic Trail administered by the Secretary of the Interior \nthrough the National Park Service.\n  Also, this resolution, which recognizes American heroes of the past, \nwill help to bring history alive and enhance tourism along the Lewis \nand Clark trail. In North Dakota, the Lewis and Clark Visitor Center \nwill celebrate its grand opening and dedication with activities June 6-\n8, 1997, in Washburn, so I appreciate that the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee has advanced this resolution in a timely way.\n  I appreciate the support of the National Park Service and my \ncolleagues in celebrating the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark \nExpedition. I particularly appreciate as cosponsors Senators Murkowski, \nBumpers, Thomas, Craig, Akaka, Smith of Oregon, Gorton, Johnson, \nConrad, Burns, Reid, Thompson, Daschle, Frist, Kerrey, Bond, Murray, \nCochran, Moseley-Braun, Ashcroft, and Coverdell.\n  Mr. President, I urge all members of the Senate to vote in favor of \nSenate Resolution 57.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be \nagreed to, the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 57), as amended, with its preamble, read as \nfollows:\n\n                               S.

I do note, Mr. President, that I have discussed this with \nSenator Daschle and this substantially cleans the Executive Calendar. \nThere are a few remaining, but they are awaiting companion nominations \nor have problems that I think we may resolve soon after we get back. \nThis is a major list of nominations that are being confirmed this \nafternoon. I am glad we were able to work out the difficulties.\n\n\n            nominations of Ann Jorgensen and Lowell Junkins\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Ann Jorgensen \nto the Farm Credit Administration Board of Directors and Lowell Junkins \nto the Farmer Mac Board of Directors. Both nominees appeared before the \nAgriculture Committee on April 10 and both were favorably reported out \nof committee on April 15 by unanimous vote.\n  The Farm Credit System is an important source of agricultural credit \nfor rural America. The system is regulated by the Farm Credit \nAdministration, which has had a vacancy on its three-member Board since \nMarch 31, 1995. I am pleased that after that long vacancy we have a \nqualified nominee to complete the board. Ms. Jorgensen has a \ndistinguished career in farming, entrepreneurship, and public service \nand will serve ably as an FCA board member.\n  Farmer Mac was created by Congress in 1988 to promote a secondary \nmarket in farm real estate loans. The Farm Credit System Reform Act of \n1996 provided Farmer Mac with additional authorities to develop a \nsuccessful secondary market. The future of Farmer Mac will be \ndetermined in the next 2 years. It is important that qualified \nindividuals serve on the board to help move Farmer Mac toward a \nsuccessful secondary market for agricultural loans.\n  Mr. Junkins has served as a recess appointee to the Farmer Mac Board \nof Directors since April 1996. Mr. Junkins was also spoken highly of by \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Grassley, and Congressman Boswell.\n  Ann Jorgensen and Lowell Junkins are well qualified and should be \nconfirmed by the Senate to the Farm Credit Administration Board and the \nFarmer Mac Board respectively. I urge my colleagues to vote for their \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5107-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5108-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5108-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1974.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to \nthe personal representative of the estate of Fred Steffens of Big Horn \nCounty, Wyoming, certain land comprising the Steffens family property; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                          transfer legislation\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which would \nreturn a family farm in Big Horn County, WY, to its rightful owners. \nThe family of Fred Steffens lost ownership of the property where they \nlived and prospered for almost 70 years, as a result of a \nmisrepresentation by the original property owners. Mr. Steffens' \nrelatives have explored every avenue to regain the title to their \nproperty, and are left with no other option than to seek congressional \nassistance. I stand before you today, on behalf of my constituents, to \nrequest help in providing a timely solution to this problem. It is my \nhope that in doing so, this wrong can be righted.\n  Upon the death of Fred Steffens on January 20, 1995, his sister, \nMarie Wambeke, was appointed personal representative of the 80-acre \nSteffens Estate. In February 1996, Ms. Wambeke learned from the Bureau \nof Land Management [BLM] that she did not have a clear title to her \nbrother's property, and she submitted a color-of-title application. \nShortly thereafter, Ms. Wambeke was informed that her brother's \nproperty was never patented, so her application was rejected.\n  The injustice of this situation is that when Mr. Steffens purchased \nthis property in 1928, he did receive a Warranty Deed with Release of \nHomestead from the former owners. Unfortunately, these individuals did \nnot have a reclamation entry to assign to Mr. Steffens. In fact, 2 \nyears before selling the property, the original owners had been \ninformed that the land they occupied was withdrawn by the Bureau of \nReclamation for the Shoshone Reclamation Project. At the same time, \nthey were notified that they had never truly owned the property.\n  Unethically, this did not stop them from selling the land to Mr. \nSteffens in 1928. In good faith Mr. Steffens purchased the property, \npaid taxes on the property from the time of purchase, and is on record \nat the Big Horn County Assessor's office as owner of this property. Due \nto the dishonesty of others, his family now faces the sobering reality \nof losing this land unless a title transfer can be effected \nlegislatively.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would transfer \nthe land from Fred Steffens' estate to his sister, Marie. This property \nhas been in their family since 1928. Through no fault of their own, \nthese folks are being forced to relinquish rights not only to their \nland, but to a part of their heritage and a legacy to their future \ngenerations. I hope we can expedite this matter by turning this land \nover to Marie Wambeke's ownership.\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

McKinney \n     and Margaret W. McKinney on September 28, 1928, and \n     thereafter occupied by Fred Steffens, known as ``Farm C'' in \n     the E\\1/2\\NW\\1/4\\ of Section 27 in Township 57 North, Range \n     97 West, 6th Principal Meridian, Wyoming.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 802. A bill to provide for the retention of the name of the \nmountain at the Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming known as \n``Devils Tower'', and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n      THE DEVILS' TOWER NATIONAL MONUMENT DESIGNATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which will enable \nDevil's Tower National Monument to retain its historic and traditional \nname.\n  This, our first national monument, has been known as ``Devil's \nTower'' for over 120 years. It is an unmistakable symbol of Wyoming and \nthe West and is known internationally as one of the premiere crack \nclimbing locations in the world. Consequently, Devil's Tower, and it's \nworldwide recognition by that name, is very important to my State, \nwhich depends so heavily on its tourism industry. And yet, there are \nthose who would attempt to fix that which is not broken.\n  I am fully sensitive to the feelings of those Native Americans who \nwould prefer to see the name of this natural wonder changed to \nsomething more acceptable to their cultural traditions. Many tribal \nmembers think of the monument as sacred. However, I believe that little \nwould be gained from a name change, and much would be lost.\n  It is important to remember that there is no consensus as to which \nIndian name would be most appropriate. In fact, there seem to be as \nmany proposals for new names as there are special interest groups \nproposing them. Among the candidates are Bear's Lodge, Grizzly Bear's \nLodge, Bear's Tipi, Bear's Lair, Bear Lodge Butte, Tree Rock and \nseveral others. The only thing they seem agreed upon is what the \nmonument should not be called: Devil's Tower.\n  The initiative to change the name of Devil's Tower would accomplish \nlittle more than to dredge up age-old conflicts and divisions between \ndescendants of European settlers and the descendants of Native \nAmericans. This would be most unfortunate and would result only in \neconomic hardship for all the area's citizens. My legislation will \nprevent such hardship and will embrace the least offensive option \noffered so far--the preservation the traditional name of Devil's Tower. \nI urge my colleagues to support this measure. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF DEVILS TOWER.\n\n       (a) In General.--The mountain at the Devils Tower National \n     Monument in Wyoming, located at 44 degrees, 42 minutes, 58 \n     seconds north latitude, 104 degrees, 35 minutes, 32 seconds \n     west longitude, shall be known and designated as ``Devils \n     Tower.''\n       (b) Legal References.--Any reference in any law, map, \n     regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United \n     States to the mountain referred to in subsection (a) is \n     deemed to be a reference to ``Devils Tower.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 803. A bill to permit the transportation of passengers between \nUnited States ports by certain foreign-flag vessels and to encourage \nU.S.-flag vessels to participate in such transportation; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      THE U.S. CRUISE TOURISM ACT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ngreatly increase the economic benefits to our Nation from cruise ship \ntourism. This measure, called the United States Cruise Tourism Act, \nwill implement one of the recommendations of the White House Conference \non Travel and Tourism. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Murkowski \nin introducing this bill.\n  Pleasure cruises aboard ocean-going vessels represent one of the \nfastest growing segments of our tourism industry. Over the past 5 \nyears, cruise ship tourism has grown by 50 percent and is expected to \ngrow at a rate of 5\\1/2\\ percent annually over the next few years. When \na cruise ship is in port, as much as $250,000 is spent on maintenance \nand supplies, and cruise passengers spend an average of $205 a day. \nAlthough 85 percent of these cruise passengers are Americans, most of \nthe revenues now go to foreign destinations.\n  This export of American tourist dollars is the unintended consequence \nof the outdated Passenger Vessel Services Act [PSA] of 1886. This act \nprohibits non-U.S.-flag vessels from carrying passengers between U.S. \nports. Unfortunately, since the U.S.-flag fleet is now down to one \ncruise ship, this restriction makes passenger cruise travel between U.S \nports virtually impossible. Today, the passenger cruise industry in the \nUnited States consists primarily of foreign flag vessels which, under \ncurrent law, must sail to and from foreign ports. This prevents many of \nour mid-coast ports such as Charleston, San Francisco, Baltimore and \nothers from participating in the cruise industry because of their \ndistance from foreign ports. As a result, potential cruise itineraries \non the east and west coast, the gulf coast, the Great Lakes and the \ncoast of Alaska have yet to be developed.\n  Mr. President, our legislation would allow our port cities and shore-\nbased tourism businesses to take advantage of this booming area of \ntourism while providing incentives for the rehabilitation of the U.S.-\nflag cruise industry. This bill would enact a narrow waiver to the PSA \nto permit large, ocean-going, foreign-flag cruise ships to carry \npassengers between U.S. ports. Subsequently, as U.S. companies become \nattracted to the business, U.S.-flag ships will enter the market. When \nthis happens, foreign vessels would be required to reduce their \ncapacity to make room for more U.S. competitors. This provision also \naddresses the concern expressed by many of our shipyards. They have \ncomplained that the uncertainty over the continuation of the PSA was \nchilling their efforts to obtain investment in a U.S.-built cruise \nship. If enacted, our bill would assure a market for the ships they \nbuild.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation in no way affects the Jones \nAct. The Jones Act is an entirely separate statute enacted in 1920 to \nprotect our cargo fleet and assure that we have a qualified merchant \nmarine in times of war. Also, this measure does not waive the PSA for \nany trade where there currently exists an American competitor. U.S. \nferries, river boat cruises, and cruises on the Atlantic intra-coastal \nwaterway would not be affected.\n  Mr. President, our country has a beautiful coastline and Americans \nshould not have to join the armed services or buy a yacht to see it. \nMoreover, our tourist industry is one of the most successful \ncontributors to the economic growth of our Nation. We should not permit \nartificial barriers to inhibit the good work of the people in this \nindustry. This legislation will remove that barrier. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 803\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Cruise Tourism \n     Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the interest of the United States to maximize \n     economic return from the growing industry of pleasure \n     cruises--\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\n       (A) by encouraging the growth of new cruise itineraries \n     between coastal cities in the United States, and\n       (B) by encouraging the use of United States goods, labor, \n     and support services.\n       (2) In maximizing the economic benefits to the United \n     States from increased cruise vessel tourism, there is a need \n     to ensure that existing employment and economic activity \n     associated with United States-flag vessels (including tour \n     boats, river boats, intracoastal waterway cruise vessels, and \n     ferries) are protected and to provide for the reemergence of \n     a United States-flag cruise vessel industry.\n       (3) The pleasure cruise industry is one of the fastest \n     growing segments of the tourism industry and is expected to \n     grow at a rate of 5 percent a year over the next few years.\n       (4) The United States-flag ocean cruise vessel fleet \n     consists of only a single vessel that tours the Hawaiian \n     Islands. As a result, all the cruise vessels carrying \n     passengers to and from United States ports are foreign-flag \n     vessels and the United States ports served are mostly ports \n     that are close enough to foreign ports to allow intermediate \n     calls.\n       (5) Prohibiting cruises between United States ports by \n     foreign-flag vessels results in the loss of tourist dollars \n     and revenue for United States ports and greatly disadvantages \n     United States ports and coastal communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. FOREIGN-FLAG CRUISE VESSELS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this Act:\n       (1) Coastwise trade.--The term ``coastwise trade'' means \n     the coastwise trade provided for in section 12106 of title \n     46, United States Code and includes trade in the Great Lakes.\n       (2) Cruise vessel.--The term ``cruise vessel'' means a \n     vessel of greater than 4,000 gross registered tons which \n     provides a full range of luxury accommodations, \n     entertainment, dining, and other services for its passengers.\n       (3) Foreign-flag cruise vessel.--The term ``foreign-flag \n     cruise vessel'' does not apply to a vessel which--\n       (A) provides ferry services or intracoastal waterway \n     cruises;\n       (B) regularly carries for hire both passengers and vehicles \n     or other cargo; or\n       (C) serves residents of the vessel's ports of call in the \n     United States as a common or frequently used means of \n     transportation between United States ports.\n       (4) Repair and maintenance service.--The term ``repair and \n     maintenance service'' includes alterations and upgrades.\n       (b) Waiver.--Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8 of \n     the Act of June 19, 1886 (24 Stat. 81, Chapter 421; 46 U.S.C. \n     App. 289), or any other provision of law, and except as \n     otherwise provided by this section, the Secretary of \n     Transportation (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     may approve the transportation of passengers on foreign-flag \n     cruise vessels not otherwise qualified to engage in the \n     coastwise trade between ports in the United States, directly \n     or by way of a foreign port.\n       (c) Exceptions.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may not approve the \n     transportation of passengers on a foreign-flag cruise vessel \n     pursuant to this section with respect to any coastwise trade \n     that is being served by a United States-flag cruise vessel.\n       (2) United states-flag service initiated after approval of \n     foreign-flag vessel.--Upon a showing to the Secretary, by a \n     United States-flag cruise vessel owner or charterer, that \n     service aboard a cruise vessel qualified to engage in the \n     coastwise trade is being offered or advertised pursuant to a \n     Certificate of Financial Responsibility for Indemnification \n     of Passengers for Nonperformance of Transportation from the \n     Federal Maritime Commission (issued pursuant to section 3 of \n     Public Law 89-777; 46 U.S.C.

Today, Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] in introducing this \nimportant bill. It is intended to break down a barrier that Congress \ncreated 111 years ago, and which has long since ceased to make sense.\n  Opening that door will create a path to thousands of new jobs, to \nhundreds of millions of dollars in new economic activity and to \nmillions in new Federal, State, and local government revenues. \nFurthermore, Mr. President, that door can be opened with no adverse \nimpact on any existing U.S. industry, labor interest, or on the \nenvironment, and it will cost the government virtually nothing.\n  There's no magic to this; in fact, it's a very simple matter. This \nbill merely allows U.S. ports to compete in the business of offering \nhomeport services to the cruise ship trade.\n  The bill amends the Passenger Service Act to allow foreign cruise \nships to operate between U.S. ports. However, it also very carefully \nprotects all existing U.S. passenger vessels by using a definition of \ncruise ship designed to exclude any foreign-flag vessels that could \nconceivably compete in the same market as U.S.-flag tour boats, \nferries, or riverboats. Finally, it provides a mechanism to guarantee \nthat if a U.S. vessel ever enters this trade in the future, steps will \nbe taken to ensure an ample pool of potential passengers.\n  Mr. President, this is a straightforward approach to a vexing \nproblem, and it deserves the support of this body.\n  As my colleagues know, this bill is very similar to S. 668, a bill I \nintroduced just a few weeks ago. The major difference is that that bill \napplies only\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\nto cruise ships operating in Alaska, and this one applies nationwide. \nOther differences include the fact that my original bill sets a 5,000 \ngross deadweight ton cut-off for vessels seeking to enter the coastwise \ntrade, and this one uses a 4,000 ton limit. This bill also requires \nforeign vessels operating in the U.S. trade to effect repairs in U.S. \nshipyards. Both of these differences are positive, in my view.\n  The change in tonnage will encourage U.S. ports to compete for \nbusiness from some of the smaller vessels in the luxury cruise ship \nfleet, which continuing to protect existing U.S. tour vessels in the \n100-ton class. While there are a few riverboats in the area of 3,000 \ntons, none of these operate in the open ocean cruise ship trade, and \nthe bill contains other protections specifically for these U.S. \nvessels.\n  The requirement for U.S. repair will assist in creating and \nmaintaining even more U.S. jobs. From the standpoint of the cruise \nships, it simply calls for the continuation of what is already a common \npractice among vessels that need work while visiting a U.S. port\n  Mr. President, it isn't 1886 anymore, and it is time to change the \ncurrent law. These days, no one is building any U.S. passenger ships of \nthis type, and no one has built one in over 40 years. Instead of \nprotecting U.S. jobs, the current law is a job losing proposition, as \nit prohibits U.S. cities from competing. That is absurd.\n  The cash flow generated by the cruise ship trade is enormous. Most \npassengers bound for my State of Alaska fly in or out of Seattle-Tacoma \nInternational Airport, but because of the law, they spend little time \nthere. Instead, they spend their pre- and post-sailing time in a \nVancouver hotel, at Vancouver restaurants, and in Vancouver gift shops. \nAnd when their vessel sails, it sails with food, fuel, general \nsupplies, repair and maintenance needs taken care of by Vancouver \nvendors.\n  According to some estimates, the city of Vancouver receives benefits \nof well over $200 million per year from the cruise ship trade. Others \nprovide more modest estimates, such as a comprehensive study by the \nInternational Council of Cruise Lines, which indicated that in 1992 \nalone, the Alaska cruise trade generated over 2,400 jobs for the city \nof Vancouver, plus payments to Canadian vendors and employees of over \n$119 million.\n  This is a market almost entirely focused on U.S. citizens going to \nsee one of the United State's most spectacular places, and yet we force \nthem to go to another country to do it. We are throwing away both money \nand jobs--and getting nothing whatsoever in return.\n  Why is this allowed to happen? The answer is simple--but it is not \nrational. Although the current law is actually a job loser, there are \nthose who argue that any change would weaken U.S. maritime interests. \nThey seem to feel that amending the Passenger Service Act so that it \nmakes sense for the United States would create a threat to Jones Act \nvessels hauling freight between U.S. ports. Mr. President, there simply \nis no connection whatsoever between the two.\n  Then there is the suggestion that this bill might harm smaller U.S. \ntour or excursion boats. Mr. President, that is also untrue. The \nindustry featuring these smaller vessels is thriving, but it simply \ndoesn't cater to the same client base as large cruise ships. The fact \nof the matter is that there is no significant competition between the \ntwo types of vessel, because the services they offer are in no way \ncomparable. The larger vessels offer unmatched luxury and personal \nservice, on-board shopping, entertainment, and so forth. The smaller \nvessels offer more flexible routes, timing, shore excursions, and other \nopportunities.\n  There is one operating U.S. vessel that doesn't fit the mold: the \nConstitution, an aging 30,000-ton vessel operating only in Hawai. This \nis the only ocean-capable U.S. ship that might fit the definition of \ncruise vessel. I have searched for other U.S. vessels that meet or \nexceed the tonnage limit in the bill, and the only ones I have found \nthat even approach it are the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen, \nboth of which are approximately 3,360 tons, and both of which are 19th \ncentury-style riverboats that are entirely unsuitable for any open-\nocean itinerary such as the Alaska trade. Further, the bill \nspecifically prohibits any foreign vessel from participating in the \nintra-coastal trade served by these riverboats.\n  Mr. President, I will not claim that this legislation would \nimmediately lead to increased earnings for U.S. ports. I can only say \nthat it would allow them to compete fairly, instead of being anchored \nby a rule that is actively harmful to U.S. interests. That alone makes \nit good public policy, and I look forward to my colleagues' agreement \nand support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        D'Amato and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 804. A bill to restrict foreign assistance for countries providing \nsanctuary to indicted war criminals who are sought for prosecution \nbefore the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n          The War Crimes Prosecution Facilitation Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncreate stronger incentives for the parties to the Dayton Peace \nAgreement to arrest indicted war criminals and transfer them to the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia [ICTY]. I am \npleased that Senators Leahy, Lugar, Feinstein, Mikulski, Murray, \nLieberman, D'Amato, and Moynihan are original cosponsors of this bill, \nwhich we believe will foster reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nin the long run.\n  As a result of the horrifying extent of war crimes committed before \nand during the war in Bosnia, the U.N. Security Council, in May 1993, \ncreated the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n[ICTY]. One of only four international war crimes tribunals ever \nestablished, its mandate is to prosecute ``genocide, crimes against \nhumanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and violations of \nthe laws and customs of war'' committed in the territory of the former \nYugoslavia from January 1, 1991, until ``a date to be determined after \nrestoration of peace.''\n  When the parties to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia signed the \nDayton Peace Agreement, they recognized that reconciliation could not \noccur unless war criminals were brought to justice. As such, they \nagreed to cooperate fully with ``the investigation and prosecution of \nwar crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law.'' \nAll members of the international community are required by the tribunal \nstatute to cooperate in ``the identification and location of persons,'' \n``the arrest or detention of persons,'' and ``the surrender or the \ntransfer of the accused'' to the tribunal.\n  With the exception of the Bosnian Muslims, however, the parties to \nthe Dayton Peace Agreement have failed to arrest and transfer to the \ntribunal the vast majority of indicted war criminals in territory \nwithin their control. Though 74 persons have been indicted by the 4-\nyear-old tribunal, 66 of them remain at large. Let me repeat that. Of \nthe 74 persons indicted for the most heinous crimes against humanity on \nEuropean soil since World War II, 66 remain at large. Among these are \nthe notorious Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian Serb \nArmy commander Ratko Mladic, both accused of genocide and crimes \nagainst humanity.\n  Where are these and other war criminals finding sanctuary?\n  Many of the indicted war criminals have been sighted living openly \nand freely in Croatia, the Croat-controlled areas of the Federation of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska, and the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro).\n  Last fall, one nongovernmental organization, the Coalition for \nInternational Justice, compiled a list of all public sightings of war \ncriminals. For example, according to the coalition's research, Dario \nKordic, one of the most widely recognized war criminals in the \nformer Yugoslavia for his role in killings in Lasva Valley, was seen \nvisiting his parents' apartment in Zagreb, Croatia. About the same \ntime, Ivica Rajic, another highly sought after war criminal, was \nreportedly seen in a hotel in Split, Croatia.\n\n  The list of public sightings of indicted war criminals goes on and \non.\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\n Associated Press correspondent Liam McDowall reportedly located six \nBosnian Croats indicted for war crimes living and working in the \nBosnian Croat town of Vitez. And in perhaps the most egregious case to \ndate, Boston Globe reporter Elizabeth Neuffer reportedly found Zeljko \nMejakic--indicted for crimes committed as commander of Omarska camp \nwhere some 4,000 people were tortured to death and women were brutally \nraped--working as the deputy commander of the Prijedor police station \nin Republika Srpska.\n  This list may not be entirely up to date now, but it illustrates \ngraphically that many of the indicted war criminals could have been \narrested easily if the authorities in control of the territory where \nthey were located had chosen to do so. I believe that is still the case \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent that a list of sightings of indicted war \ncriminals who remain at large be included in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks.\n  I know, Mr. President, that the act of apprehending and transferring \nindicted war criminals to the Hague presents a thorny problem for the \nUnited States. While some argue that American and NATO military \npersonnel should do the job, the prevailing wisdom is that using our \ntroops to arrest these indicted war criminals would be fraught with \ndifficulties that could put our troops in danger. Others have raised \nthe possibility that some type of international strike force could get \nthe job done. Discussions about these options have been underway since \nNATO troops landed in the region 1\\1/2\\ years ago, but no action has \nbeen taken. Meanwhile war criminals continue to roam the region with \nimpunity, and the clock ticks ever closer to the June 1998 withdrawal \ndate for SFOR.\n  If the international community concludes that it cannot use force to \napprehend indicted war criminals, it must try another approach. Make no \nmistake about it: if indicted war criminals remain at large when the \nSFOR's mission ends, our prestige and credibility will be severely \nundermined. America may be able to protect NATO troops by not involving \nthem in a mission to arrest indicted war criminals, but we cannot \nprotect our reputation and that of NATO as a defender of democracy and \nhuman rights if indicted war criminals roam the region with impunity \nwhen our troops withdraw.\n  Mr. President, since NATO is unwilling to arrest the indicted, my \ncolleagues and I are recommending an approach which reinforces the \nobligation of the parties to the Dayton Agreement to arrest and \ntransfer those indicted for genocide, rape, and other crimes against \nhumanity to the Hague. To secure their cooperation, it imposes \nconditions on America's portion of the $5.1 billion in economic \nreconstruction funding to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Because parties to \nthe Dayton Agreement sorely want Western assistance and the \ninternational acceptance it implies, this assistance provides us with a \npowerful lever. We ought to use it.\n  Under our legislation, until the President certifies that a majority \nof war criminals have been arrested and transferred to the tribunal, no \nassistance--with the exception of assistance for humanitarian programs, \ndemocracy programs, and certain physical infrastructure projects that \ncross borders--could be provided to a sanctioned country or constituent \nentity. Similarly, U.S. executive directors of international financial \ninstitutions could not vote for assistance until the President makes \nthe required certification.\n  The President would have up to 6 months to make this certification. \nOnce the certification is made, assistance could be provided for up to \n6 months. At the end of the 6-month waiver period, no assistance could \nbe provided unless all indicted war criminals have been arrested and \nturned over to the ICTY. If a country or entity arrests and transfers \nto the Hague a majority of the indicted war criminals in territory \nunder its effective control immediately, and the rest of them within 6 \nmonths, assistance to that country or entity will not be affected.\n  In other words, this legislation recognizes that even the parties to \nthe Dayton Agreement may find it difficult to apprehend all indicted \nwar criminals immediately, and therefore does not require them to \ncomplete the process all at once. Once a majority of the war criminals \nhave been arrested and turned over, they are given up to 6 months to \nfinish the job.\n  Because our goal is to promote greater cooperation, democratic and \nhumanitarian assistance will still be provided even in sanctioned \ncountries or entities. Humanitarian assistance is defined to include \nfood and disaster assistance and assistance for demining, refugees, \neducation, health care, social services, and housing. Democratization \nassistance includes electoral assistance and assistance used in \nestablishing the institutions of a democratic and civil society, \nincluding police training.\n  However, assistance for projects in communities in which local \nauthorities are harboring criminals or preventing refugees from \nreturning home will be strictly limited to emergency food and medical \nassistance and demining assistance. And absolutely no assistance--\nhumanitarian or otherwise--can be provided to projects or organizations \nin which an indicted war criminal is affiliated or has a financial \ninterest. These provisions are important to ensure that our assistance \nis not being used to prop up war criminals and that only communities \nthat allow refugees to return are rewarded with assistance.\n  This legislation recognizes that the realities of government control \nin the former Yugoslavia do not always conform to the arrangements in \nthe Dayton Agreement. Recognizing that a constituent entity of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina may not control all areas within its border, and that \nCroatia or Serbia may have effective control of territory that reaches \nbeyond their borders, the legislation holds a government or constituent \nentity responsible for indicted war criminals ``in territory that is \nunder their effective control.'' As such, the legislation is not meant \nto impose sanctions on the Muslim-Croat Federation as a whole if an \nindicted war criminal remains in a Croat-controlled area of the \nFederation. Likewise, it would allow sanctions to be imposed against a \ncountry, such as Croatia, for failing to secure the apprehension of war \ncriminals in areas of the Federation which it effectively controls.\n\n  Mr. President, these measures are not intended to be punitive. I have \nmade every effort to ensure that humanitarian assistance to the people \nin all parts of the former Yugoslavia will not be affected. I do not \noppose reconstruction funding, and recognize that it is in our national \ninterest to help rebuild this war-torn region. But I believe there is \nvalue in using bilateral and multilateral assistance as a carrot, to \nprovide an incentive to the parties to arrest and turn war criminals \nover to the tribunal.\n  Unless war criminals are brought to justice, reconciliation in Bosnia \nand Herzegovnia will remain an elusive goal and refugees and displaced \npersons will be unable to return to their homes. Though reconstruction \nassistance will help to rebuild ravaged economies, reconstruction \nwithout reconciliation will not be effective in ensuring long-term \nstability. Until the perpetrators of genocide are held accountable, \nvictimized communities will continue to assign collective guilt and the \ncycle of hatred will be perpetuated.\n  No infusion of money can wipe away the crimes of the past 6 years. \nMoney alone is not enough. What is required is a genuine process of \nreconciliation, which can never occur unless war criminals are brought \nto justice.\n  The Washington Post, in a February 1997 editorial, said it well:\n\n       U.S. forces [cannot] fulfill their mission--bringing peace \n     to Bosnia--as long as war criminals remain at large. Lately, \n     it has become popular to focus on economic reconstruction as \n     the answer to Bosnia's troubles. But war didn't break out for \n     economic reasons, and economic aid alone can't secure the \n     peace. As long as alleged war criminal Radovan Karadzic and \n     his henchmen run things from behind the scenes, economic aid \n     actually will flow to the criminals. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, we know that the threat of sanctions can work to \neffect cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal. In the last year and a \nhalf, the administration has successfully leveraged assistance to \nCroatia to secure the transfer of two indicted war criminals to The \nHague. But the process has been too long and drawn out. One of the war \ncriminals voluntarily agreed to be sent to The Hague, and the other was \nin custody for more than 10 months before the Croatian Government \ntransferred him to the tribunal.\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\n At this rate, it would take us some 66 years to bring all the indicted \nwar criminals to The Hague. That's just too long. Stronger action must \nbe taken.\n  The World Bank is pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into \nCroatia and sending assessment teams to Republika Srpska. In fiscal \nyear 1997, the Agency for International Development has set aside \nroughly $70 million for Republika Srpska, and it intends to do the same \nin fiscal year 1998. This bill requires the Administration to use these \nassistance programs to secure the speedy apprehension of war criminals, \nwhich is just as essential for reconciliation and long-term stability \nas reconstruction efforts--if not more so.\n  No one has articulated the need for this legislation as well as \nJustice Goldstone, Former Chief Prosecutor of the International \nCriminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda when he spoke \nat the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in January of 1997:\n\n       Where there have been egregious human rights violations \n     that have been unaccounted for, where there has been no \n     justice, where the victims have not received any \n     acknowledgment, where they have been forgotten, where there's \n     been a national amnesia, the effect is a cancer in the \n     society. It's the reason that explains . . . spirals of \n     violence that the world has seen in the former Yugoslavia for \n     centuries . . .\n\n  Justice Goldstone was right. What is required is a genuine process of \nreconciliation, which can never occur unless war criminals are brought \nto justice. Without reconciliation, the spiral of violence will only \ncontinue, and the military mission on which the American taxpayers have \nliterally spent billions will be for naught.\n  Secretary of State Albright will be traveling to Bosnia next week. \nShe has assured me that the issue of war criminals will be raised at \nevery opportunity, and I am confident that she will take a very tough \nstand, urging the parties to the Dayton Agreement to meet their \ncommitments. But the U.S. Government has been urging compliance for \nover a year now with little success, and it's clear that we need to put \nmore teeth into our position. Our bill does just that. It clearly \nstates that the apprehension of war criminals is critical for \nreconciliation. It links U.S. assistance to progress on this issue, and \nit provides clear deadlines for progress in arresting and transferring \nindicted war criminals to The Hague.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation, \nwhich has been endorsed by the Coalition for International Justice, \nHuman Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, Action Council for \nPeace in the Balkans, and the International Human Rights Law Group. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation and a letter of \nendorsement from those organizations appear in the Record.\n  America stands for justice and reconciliation throughout the world. \nWe must stand up for those principles by ensuring that the war \ncriminals of Bosnia are apprehended and the victims are heard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``War Crimes Prosecution \n     Facilitation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In May 1993, the United Nations established the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \n     (ICTY).\n       (2) The mandate of the Tribunal is to prosecute ``genocide, \n     crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Conventions, and violations of the laws and customs of war'' \n     committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia from \n     January 1, 1991, until ``a date to be determined after \n     restoration of peace''.\n       (3) Parties to the Dayton Agreement, as well as subsequent \n     agreements, agreed to cooperate fully with the \n     ``investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other \n     violations of international humanitarian law''. All members \n     of the international community are required by the Tribunal \n     Statute to cooperate in ``the identification and location of \n     persons'', ``the arrest or detention of persons'', and ``the \n     surrender or the transfer of the accused'' to the Tribunal.\n       (4) Although 74 persons are under indictment by the \n     Tribunal, 66 remain at large, including 53 Bosnian and \n     Yugoslav Serbs, and 13 Bosnian and Croatian Croats.\n       (5) Credible reports indicate that some of the indicted war \n     criminals are living in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina that \n     are under the effective control of Croatia or Serbia-\n     Montenegro. Many of the indicted war criminals have been \n     sighted living openly and freely in Croatia, the Croat-\n     controlled areas of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     Republika Srpska, and Serbia-Montenegro.\n       (6) An estimated 2,000,000 persons have been forced from \n     their homes by the war, many of whom remain displaced and \n     unable to return to their homes, in violation of the Dayton \n     Accords, because their homes are in a jurisdiction controlled \n     by a different ethnic group.\n       (7) The fighting in Bosnia has ceased for more than a year, \n     and international efforts are now focused on the economic \n     reconstruction and implementation of the civilian aspects of \n     the Dayton Accords.\n       (8) The International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Monetary Fund, and individual \n     donor countries, including the United States, have begun \n     disbursing funds toward meeting an identified goal of \n     $5,100,000,000 for reconstruction of Bosnia.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be \n     achieved if indicted war criminals remain at large and \n     refugees and displaced persons are unable to return to their \n     homes;\n       (2) reconstruction without reconciliation will not be \n     effective in ensuring stability in the long run because \n     absent individual accountability, victimized communities will \n     assign collective responsibility, thus perpetuating the cycle \n     of hatred; and\n       (3) the Government of the United States should ensure that \n     multilateral and bilateral assistance is provided to parties \n     to the Dayton Agreement only if doing so would promote \n     reconciliation as well as reconstruction, including the \n     transfer of war criminals to the Tribunal, the return of \n     refugees and displaced persons, and freedom of movement.\n       (b) It is further the sense of the Senate that the \n     Tribunal, consistent with its mandate, should continue to \n     investigate and bring indictments against persons who have \n     violated international humanitarian law.\n\n     SEC. 4. RESTRICTIONS ON FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Bilateral Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--No assistance may be provided under the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act \n     for any country described in subsection (d).\n       (2) Application to prior appropriations.--The prohibition \n     on assistance contained in paragraph (1) includes the \n     provision of assistance from funds appropriated prior to the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Multilateral Assistance.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall instruct the United States executive directors of the \n     international financial institutions to work in opposition \n     to, and vote against, any extension by such institutions of \n     any financial or technical assistance or grants of any kind \n     to any country described in subsection (d).\n       (c) Exceptions.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall not apply to the provision of--\n       (A) humanitarian assistance;\n       (B) democratization assistance; or\n       (C) assistance for physical infrastructure projects \n     involving activities in both a sanctioned country and \n     nonsanctioned contiguous countries, if the nonsanctioned \n     countries are the primary beneficiaries.\n       (2) Further limitations.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1)--\n       (A) no assistance may be made available under the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act for a \n     program, project, or activity in any country described in \n     subsection (d) in which an indicted war criminal has any \n     financial or material interest or through any organization in \n     which the indicted individual is affiliated; and\n       (B) no assistance (other than emergency food or medical \n     assistance or demining assistance) may be made available \n     under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export \n     Control Act to any program, project, or activity in any area \n     in any country described in subsection (d) in which local \n     authorities are not complying with the provisions of Article \n     IX and Annex 4, Article II of the Dayton Agreement relating \n     to war crimes and the Tribunal, or with the provisions of \n     Annex 7 of the Dayton Agreement relating to the rights of \n     refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes of \n     origin.\n       (d) Sanctioned Countries.--A country described in this \n     section is a country the authorities of which fail to \n     apprehend and transfer to the Tribunal all persons in \n     territory that is under their effective control who have been \n     indicted by the Tribunal.\n       (e) Waiver.--\n       (1) Authority.--The President may waive the application of \n     subsection (a) or subsection (b) with respect to a country if \n     the President determines and certifies to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress within six months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act that a majority of the indicted persons \n     who are within territory that is under the effective control \n     of the country have been arrested and transferred to the \n     Tribunal.\n       (2) Period of effectiveness.--Any waiver made pursuant to \n     this subsection shall be effective for a period of six \n     months.\n       (f) Termination of Sanctions.--The sanctions imposed \n     pursuant to subsection (a) or subsection (b) with respect to \n     a country shall\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\n     cease to apply only if the President determines and certifies \n     to Congress that the authorities of that country have \n     apprehended and transferred to the Tribunal all persons in \n     territory that is under their effective control who have been \n     indicted by the Tribunal.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Finding someone \n     prepared to arrest them is tough.\n       On a typical afternoon, Marinko Katava, who's wanted for \n     murder, can be found behind his desk in the town hall. Pero \n     Skopljak, the town's former chief of police, runs a local \n     printing store.\n       The Kupreskic family--three of whose members are wanted for \n     their role in the murderous wartime campaign against their \n     Muslim neighbors--are usually at the grocery store they run.\n       All have been indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in \n     The Hague, Netherlands and listed on a widely-distributed \n     ``Wanted'' poster.\n       The suspects aren't easy to see. A reporter who spoke by \n     telephone with the Kupeskics was met at the grocery by a \n     group of men who asked the reporter to leave. Skopljak's wife \n     made the same request at the printing shop, and fellow town \n     hall workers said Katava did not want to meet the visitor.\n       But none of them take any precautions to guard against \n     arrest.\n       Why should they?\n       Nobody is looking for them. The unarmed U.N. police force \n     has no powers of arrest and the NATO-led peace force has no \n     mandate to hunt those indicted for their alleged roles in \n     Bosnia's war.\n       Of the 74 men indicted by the tribunal--four Muslims, 16 \n     Croats and 54 Serbs--only eight are in detention. Four \n     Muslims, two Serbs and one Croat are in The Hague, and one \n     Croat is being held in Croatia, pending extradition.\n       Just the most famous war crimes suspects follow elaborate \n     security measures to make sure they won't be nabbed and \n     carried off to trial. They include Radovan Karadzic, who led \n     the Bosnian Serbs during the war, and his former military \n     commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, who was fired Saturday by \n     Karadzic's replacement, President Biljana Plavsic.\n       ``Somehow the issue of detaining war criminals has fallen \n     into an institutional black hole,'' said Michael Steiner, a \n     top international peace administrator in Bosnia.\n       The impotence of the international community was starkly \n     illustrated in August when an indicted Serb walked into a \n     U.N. police station near Sarajevo to file a complaint against \n     Bosnian police who had attempted to arrest him.\n       The U.N. police did not recognize him and later said they \n     would have made no effort to detain him anyway, since it \n     wasn't their job.\n       Stung by criticism, international peace administrators are \n     now compiling a list of war crimes suspects and their \n     whereabouts.\n       They're hoping that with the U.S. elections over--along \n     with the chance that U.S. casualties could mar President \n     Clinton's reelection--Washington may be prepared to support a \n     new mission to go after some of the wanted men.\n       But up to now, officials have displayed little zeal to \n     embroil any of the 43,000 soldiers of the NATO-led peace \n     force in the war crimes issue, wary of possible retaliation \n     by Bosnia's former warring parties.\n       The peace force claims that during the past 11 months, not \n     one of its men has spotted a war crimes suspect. Spokesmen \n     now even deny their troops' sightings of Karadzic, which they \n     once confirmed.\n       That leaves nabbing suspects up to Bosnian Muslim, Croat \n     and Serb authorities--and ``they will not do it,'' Steiner \n     said. It would be political suicide for any leader to hand \n     over suspects to The Hague.\n       While the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo has in the main \n     cooperated in arresting and extraditing suspects, Bosnia's \n     Serbs and Croats have not.\n       The two Serbs in custody were arrested abroad, and the \n     Croat in The Hague handed himself in after special conditions \n     were agreed upon in advance. The Croat being held in Croatia \n     was arrested by Croatian officials, not Bosnian Croats.\n       Karadzic, accused of genocide and crimes against humanity \n     for the siege of Sarajevo and the presumed massacre of \n     thousands of Muslims after the fall of Srebrenica in July \n     1995, still controls the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia from \n     behind the scenes.\n       Ostensibly forced out of office in July under the terms of \n     a U.S.-brokered deal, he makes little effort to conceal his \n     daily movements in his mountain stronghold of Pale, southeast \n     of Sarajevo. Confident of his security system and aware that \n     nobody is going to try and grab him, he drives past the \n     U.N. police station in Pale each day.\n       Mladic lives just 8 miles from a big American base in \n     eastern Bosnia, keeping bees and goat in a heavily-guarded \n     compound in Han Pijesak. There was no unusual movement \n     reported around his compound on Saturday.\n       U.N. officials told The AP that six indicted Serbs still \n     hold their police jobs: four in the northwestern town of \n     Prijedor and two in the southeastern town of Foca.\n       Bosnian Croats are no more compliant. In Vitez, 50 miles \n     northwest of Sarajevo, at least six of the 14 Croats indicted \n     for their role in the expulsion and murder of Muslims from \n     the region remain at liberty.\n       The Associated Press discovered that at least one of the \n     war crimes suspects wanted for murder, Marinko Katava, \n     continues to work as a labor inspector in the local \n     government.\n       Katava--whose whereabouts, according to the tribunal and \n     the multinational peace force, is unknown--can be found \n     during working hours at town hall and at other times in his \n     pleasant downtown apartment.\n       Mirjan Kupreskic and his cousin Vlatko Kupreskic, wanted \n     for their alleged role in a murderous campaign against Muslim \n     civilians, live in Pirici on Vitez's eastern flank and run a \n     small grocery in the center of town.\n       Together with Zoran Kupreskic, Mirjan's brother, the three \n     are charged on several counts of war crimes. Their victims, \n     Muslim neighbors, included a four-month-old infant and a 75-\n     year-old pensioner.\n       Pero Skopljak, whom tribunal prosecutors accuse of \n     overseeing ``the inhumane treatment'' of Muslim civilians, \n     runs a printing company from the ground floor of his spacious \n     house in Vitez.\n       Drago Josipovic, indicted for his role in the execution of \n     Muslim civilians, is a chemical engineer at the local Vitezit \n     explosives factory. He lives in his family house in the \n     village of Santici, just east of Vitez.\n       The town's deputy policy chief, Marko Dundzer, told The AP \n     that he knew ``a few'' suspects remained in Vitez but didn't \n     know any of them personally.\n       In spite of Bosnian Croat leaders' claims that they are \n     cooperating fully with the tribunal, Dundzer said he would \n     not attempt to arrest any suspect. ``I have received no \n     orders to do such a thing,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Oct. 29, 1996]\n\n              Bosnia's War Criminals Enjoy Peacetime Power\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Neuffer)\n\n       Prijedor, Bosnia-Herzegovina--It only takes a phone call to \n     nearby Omarska to discover the whereabouts of Zjelko Mejakic, \n     one of the West's most wanted indicted war criminals.\n       ``Zejelko?'' says the operator at the town police station. \n     ``He's not here at the moment, but he'll definitely be here \n     later.''\n       Mejakic, the Bosnian Serb former commander of the notorious \n     Omarska prison camp, is deputy police chief, despite his \n     indictment for genocide by the International War Crimes \n     Tribunal at the Hague. And he is not alone: Three indicated \n     war criminals work at the Prijedor police station, according \n     to United Nations and Bosnian Serb sources.\n       Nearly a year after the Dayton peace accord for Bosnia \n     called for war criminals to be brought to justice, alleged \n     war criminals remain at large and in positions of power, many \n     ruling their communities as firmly in peace as they did \n     during the war.\n       The net result, a Globe investigation has found, is that \n     some alleged war criminals are flourishing in peacetime. Some \n     are believed to have turned to organized crime, including \n     drug trafficking, counterfeiting and extortion.\n       Others have kept their hold on communities, allegedly \n     intimidating political opponents and running protection \n     rackets, keeping their war records buried under new abuses of \n     power. Their reach appears to stretch beyond Bosnia: Several \n     war crimes witnesses interviewed in Germany said they have \n     been threatened there.\n       ``Unfortunately, Dayton is only a piece of paper,'' said \n     Rev. Karlo Visaticki, a Roman Catholic priest in Serb-held \n     Banja Luka who holds local warloads responsible for the 1995 \n     disappearance of a local priest. ``All the war criminals are \n     still in power.''\n       The arrest and trial of alleged war criminals is seen as a \n     key element of peace here, allowing justice to break Balkan \n     cycles of revenge. Yet NATO peacekeepers, whose mandate bans \n     them from searching out war criminals, have yet to arrest any \n     of the more than 76 men indicted. Nor have former warring \n     parties turned over those charged.\n       Under the Dayton accord, indicted war criminals are banned \n     from holding public or elective office. But in reality, many \n     still do: most notably, Gen. Ratko Mladic heads the Bosnian \n     Serb Army despite his indictment for overseeing the massacre \n     of thousands of Muslims from the UN ``safe haven'' of \n     Srebrenica. In fact, UN sources say Mladic has extended his \n     power base to include police in northwest Bosnia.\n       Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader widely \n     viewed as a prime architect of a conflict that killed scores \n     of thousands of people and created 2 million refugees, was \n     forced to step down, but still dictates Bosnian Serb policies \n     and lives in Bosnia with impunity despite his war crimes \n     indictment.\n       Other less renowned indicated war criminals threaten peace \n     by continuing to control their communities. Prijedor, in \n     Serb-held Bosnia, and Mostar, in the Muslim-Croat Federation, \n     are two such places.\n\n\n                                prijedor\n\n       In 1993, Prijedor burst into the West's consciousness with \n     news of the Serb-run detention camps of Ornarska, Keraterm \n     and Trnopolje. Today, the camps are closed. But those who \n     operated them, beating, torturing, raping and killing Muslim \n     and Croat prisoners, still run Prijedor, according to Bosnian \n     Serbs and Western officials. To some, these men are war \n     heroes, who deserve to be in charge of the police station and \n     newspaper. But to opposition politicians, ethnic minorities \n     or dissidents of any kind, the presence of indicted and \n     alleged war criminals in power means peace brings no \n     guarantee of freedom.\n       ``The only thing that has changed since Dayton is that \n     there is no shooting,'' said one of the few remaining Muslims \n     here, who asked not to be identified. Out of a prewar \n     population of about 45,000 Muslims, about 450 remain. ``We \n     continue to live in fear.''\n       Three indicted war criminals accused of genocide for \n     ``ethnic cleansing'' at the Omarska camp are today Prijedor \n     policemen: shift commander Mladen ``Krkan'' Radic, former \n     camp commander Miroslav Kvocka and guard Nedjeljko Timarac.\n       ``The worst shift in the camp was the one in which Mladen \n     Radic was in charge,'' recalled camp survivor Nusret Sivac in \n     a book about Ornarska and Trnopolje. ``One day * * * they \n     were beating and stomping over everyone, saying, `On St. \n     Peter's day, we'll light you as firewood, [rape] your Turkish \n     mothers!' and they kept their promise.''\n       With these men in power in Prijedor--and Mejakic in the \n     police station in Ornarska--there can be no freedom of \n     speech, local Bosnian Serbs say.\n       ``It's a pity these killers are still free,'' said one \n     Bosnian Serb from near Ornarska, who asked not to be \n     identified. ``Because it is still dangerous. Overnight, one \n     can lose one's life.''\n       Learning of the presence of indicted war criminals on the \n     Prijedor force, Robert Wasserman, deputy commissioner of the \n     UN International Police Task Force, which monitors civilian \n     aspects of the Dayton accords, said the group would seek to \n     have the officers removed.\n       ``We are outraged, and we will move immediately for the \n     removal of these people,'' he said. ``It seriously undermines \n     confidence in police in the country.''\n       One alleged criminal who is still free is former Prijedor \n     police chief Simo Drljaca, whom UN and NATO officials expect \n     to be indicted this month for war crimes. Drljaca, sources \n     say, determined who was sent to prison camps and how they \n     were treated, including signing all the execution orders.\n       Since the war, Drljaca has run Prijedor as if it were his \n     fiefdom. In addition to controlling officials from the mayor \n     on down. Drljaca is alleged by residents to have demanded \n     kickbacks for apartments and police protection of businesses. \n     Locally, his nickname is ``Mr. Ten Percent,'' for the rate he \n     demands from area bars and restaurants.\n       Bosnian Serbs who don't toe the party line allege they had \n     to pay the police to avoid being evicted from their \n     apartments. Western officials say that residents who talked \n     to them later were threatened by Drljaca, called to the \n     police station for ``informative talks.''\n       NATO officials attempted to reduce Drljaca's power a few \n     weeks ago, forcing Bosnian Serb authorities to remove him as \n     police chief after he threatened NATO peacekeepers with a \n     gun.\n       ``He was God here,'' said one Western official in the \n     region. ``He controlled everything and everyone.''\n       But last week, despite a new job as logistics adviser to \n     the minister of interior of the Serb half of Bosnia, Drljaca \n     was working as the Prijedor police station, still reachable \n     via his secretary there. ``Unfortunately,'' said one military \n     source, ``he's still pulling the strings here.''\n       ``Oh, from now on I am going to be a good boy,'' Drljaca \n     said in a recent interview with the Globe, denying all \n     allegations. ``These charges are unjustified . . . but it \n     won't affect my personal life. I have protection. Any time of \n     day or night, I am ready to resist.''\n       That alleged war criminals still run Prijedor is a powerful \n     disincentive for Muslim and Croat refugees who want to return \n     home.\n       ``These criminals assaulted and killed and robbed us, and \n     now they are still in power?'' said Sefik Terzic, a 54-year-\n     old Omarska survivor now in Germany. ``And this is where I am \n     supposed to return to? I'd rather kill myself than let them \n     finish the job they began four years ago.''\n\n\n                                 MOSTAR\n\n       Since the signing of the Dayton agreement last December, \n     the city of Mostar has become Bosnia's hub for organized \n     crime. Explosions routinely destroy cafes of owners unwilling \n     to pay protection money. Opposition figures are openly \n     harassed. Car theft and counterfeit rings abound. Ethnic \n     minorities are chased from their homes. An illegal drug \n     trade, from marijuana to cocaine, is flourishing. And lurking \n     behind all these developments. Bosnian government and Western \n     sources say, are two men accused of being war criminals: \n     Mladen ``Tuta'' Naletilic and Vinko ``Stela'' Martinovic.\n       ``It's got to be the leaders in Mostar and in Bosnia who \n     are determined to get rid of this problem and put the scum \n     where they belong, behind bars,'' Sir Martin Garrod, the \n     European Union envoy to Mostar, told reporters in August, \n     naming Naletilic and Martinovic.\n       Neither man has been indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal, \n     although files on their wartime activities have been sent to \n     the Hague. The Tribunal was alarmed after Nedzad Ugljen, a \n     Bosnian agent investigating the two men and cooperating with \n     the Tribunal, was assassinated in Sarajevo, according to \n     sources who read a letter sent by the Tribunal to Bosnian \n     officials.\n       A look at the two men's alleged wartime and peacetime \n     careers reveals how fine a line there appears to be between \n     war crimes and organized crime in today's Bosnia.\n       The old warlords have simply shifted their activities to \n     organized crimes.'' said Col. Pieter Lambrechste of the \n     European Union police in Mostar. ``And in this postwar \n     period, crime is flourishing.''\n       So much so that FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration \n     investigators, drawn by the boom in organized crime, recently \n     visited Bosnia.\n       According to Bosnian government and Western sources. Tuta \n     and Stela gained a stranglehold on Mostar in 1993, running \n     anti-terrorist units in the Bosnian Croatian Army that drove \n     minorities from the city and set up local detention camps.\n       Tuta, a Canadian Croat who is close to Croatian Defense \n     Minister Gojko Susak, is described as having been the brains \n     behind the operation; Stela, who had a lengthy criminal \n     record before the war, the front man. ``Tuta gave the orders, \n     and Stela obeyed,'' said one Western official here.\n       Officials allege that ``Stela'' Martinovic and his thugs--\n     the ``ATG Mrmak,'' identifiable by their sunglasses and \n     shaved heads--drove out Muslims and Serbs from West Mostar, \n     killing and raping as they went. ``Our whole neighborhood was \n     kicked out by Stela's team,'' said Azra Hasanbegovic, 49, \n     now in East Mostar. ``My 74-year-old mother was badly \n     beaten with rifle butts . . . there were a lot of rapes.''\n       Bosnian government sources allege that Tuta and Stela \n     established a prison camp at the local helicopter base. \n     Testimony from camp survivors, compiled by the Bosnian \n     government and delivered to the Hague, includes accounts of \n     people forced to eat feces,\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\n     denied water under beating sun and made to watch their \n     children raped or killed.\n       Even local Croats were not safe. Both Tuta and Stela \n     reportedly levied a ``war tax'' on those who refused to fight \n     the Muslims.\n       Today, the two men continue to exercise power with \n     impunity. Stela prowls Mostar in his green Jaguar, Mercedes \n     600 or Mercedes 124; Tuta lives next door to Susak in the \n     village of Siroki Brijeg. Bosnian government sources allege \n     the two men are now involved in counterfeiting money, running \n     drugs, prostitution, smuggling cigarettes and protection \n     rackets.\n       Western authorities say they are aware of the allegations, \n     but cannot prove them. But they do think the two hold sway \n     over Bosnian Croat police, who have done nothing about 50 \n     cases so far this year involving the expulsion of Muslims \n     from their homes.

Leahy,\n     Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg and Senator Leahy: We are writing \n     to express our strong support and thanks for your \n     legislation, the ``War Crimes Prosecution Facilitation Act.''\n       We are outraged that 66 of the 75 persons who have been \n     indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for some of the worst crimes in this \n     half-century--including genocide, systematic rape and other \n     crimes against humanity--remain at large. As you know, many \n     of the indicted are living openly and comfortably in the \n     region, continuing to wield political and economic power.\n       We are united in our concern that bilateral and \n     multilateral reconstruction assistance not strengthen and \n     enrich those indicted war criminals and the governments that \n     are failing to assist in their apprehension and transfer to \n     the Tribunal. It is essential to the peace process that we \n     carefully direct aid so as to encourage compliance with the \n     Dayton Agreement's core elements--apprehension of indicated \n     war criminals, freedom of movement, and return of refugees \n     and displaced persons--rather than strengthen those who are \n     flouting their sworn commitments to do so.\n       We are particularly pleased that your legislation \n     recognizes the undeniable political realities of the region \n     and holds each Dayton signatory country responsible for the \n     actual extent of its authority and ability to assist the \n     Tribunal. Specifically, Croatia and Serbia have an obligation \n     not only to arrest indicted persons who are within their \n     borders but also to exercise their decisive political and \n     economic influence in the sections of Bosnia-Herzegovina they \n     effectively control to ensure that the indicted who are there \n     are arrested and sent to the Tribunal for trial.\n       The continued presence of indicted war criminals in the \n     region and continued political and economic strength of their \n     protectors are the major obstacles to reform and \n     implementation of Dayton. Reconstruction will not be \n     successful--and U.S. tax dollars and those of other donors--\n     will be wasted unless such assistance is provided in a manner \n     that supports reconciliation and the rule of law, rather than \n     rewards the very people most responsible for genocide and \n     ethnic cleansing.\n       Thank you very much for your leadership and concern.\n           Sincerely,\n         Coalition for International Justice.\n         Human Rights Watch.\n         Physicians for Human Rights.\n         Action Council for Peace in the Balkans.\n         International Human Rights Law Group.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Lautenberg's legislation, the War Crimes \nProsecution Facilitation Act of 1997.\n  Senator Lautenberg has consistently called for stronger action to \nbring war crimes in the former Yugoslavia to justice, and I appreciate \nhis efforts and commend him for keeping the spotlight on this.\n  I am not going to repeat what Senator Lautenberg has already said \nabout why this legislation is needed. He has discussed it in detail. It \nis simply outrageous that people who are believed to be responsible for \nsome of the most heinous crimes in this century have been living and \ntraveling freely within the former Yugoslavia, their whereabouts a \nmatter of public knowledge.\n  My own view is that NATO forces, or some special contingent \nspecifically constituted to capture war criminals, should go after \nthese people. The longer we wait, the more powerless NATO appears, and \nthe more convinced these people are that they have nothing to fear. But \nuntil that happens, at the very least, we should not give aid to \ngovernments that harbor war criminals, especially considering that they \npledged to cooperate fully with the War Crimes Tribunal.\n  That is the purpose of this legislation--to deny aid to governments \nof the former Yugoslavia until they arrest and turn over indicted war \ncriminals who are within territory under that control, or to projects \nin communities whose local authorities are protecting war criminals or \npreventing refugees from returning home. Frankly, that should already \nbe U.S. Government policy. There should be no need for this \nlegislation. Since our goal is to promote reconciliation, the bill does \nmake appropriate exceptions for humanitarian and other limited \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator Lautenberg for his \nleadership, I hope that the administration will respond by telling us \nthat they are in agreement with this legislation and will conform their \npolicy accordingly.\n  By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Harkin): S. 805. A bill to reform \nthe information technology systems of the Department of Agriculture, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n          THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INFORMATION REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \nhelp Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman in his efforts to make USDA \na more efficient user of taxpayer money. The Department of Agriculture \nhas a long history of wasteful spending on information technology \n[IT]--telecommunications and computers. Over the past 10 years, USDA \ninvested almost $8 billion on IT purchases that were often poorly \nplanned, incompatible, and redundant. Recently Secretary Glickman \nlamented the stovepipe mentality that pervades USDA planning and \npurchases of information technology. That is, each agency of the \nDepartment protects its own turf and budget, and is reluctant to \ncoordinate its IT planning and purchases with other agencies.\n  The Secretary's observations are consistent with messages we have \nsent to USDA in years past. Five years ago, Senator Leahy and I warned \nthat ``money invested by USDA in computer technology over the past \nseveral years has been spent without a clear understanding of what was \nbeing purchased\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nor what was operationally required to increase efficiency within the \nDepartment.'' We asked then Secretary Madigan to curtail computer \npurchases until a ``strategic plan or vision for Department \nreorganization is completed.'' We still await a final version of the \ncurrent strategic plan.\n  For over a decade, audits of USDA's IT purchases have uncovered the \nsame root problems: inadequate control, planning, and direction of IT \ninvestments. Historically, USDA's administration has failed to exercise \nthe authority to control the IT expenditures of its 30 agencies. These \nagencies' independent IT purchases have led to systems that are unable \nto communicate across the Department. This has impeded program delivery \nand resulted in a labyrinth of duplicative and incompatible systems \nthat has wasted hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  The 104th Congress passed the Clinger-Cohen Act, which requires \nperformance and results-based management in IT planning and purchases \nthroughout Government. Clinger-Cohen created the position of the Chief \nInformation Officer [CIO], a high-level executive responsible for \nachieving program delivery through prudent and coordinated IT \ninvestments. The concept of CIO coordination of IT planning and \npurchases is already widespread in the private sector.\n  To be successful, the CIO must have significant legal and budgetary \nauthorities. The CIO at USDA has neither. Individual agencies, which \ncontrol their own budgets, can ignore the CIO. Currently, USDA's CIO \nhas the responsibility to coordinate IT investments across agencies, \nbut lacks the planning and budgeting authority to meet this \nresponsibility. Without such authority, the problems of the past are \nsure to continue.\n  The legislation I introduce today builds on Clinger-Cohen by giving \nthe CIO at USDA the legal and budgetary authorities necessary to manage \nIT across USDA's 30 agencies. This bill accomplishes three things. \nFirst, the CIO is given the legal and budget authorities necessary to \nsucessfully manage IT to benefit the Department as a whole. Second, the \nCIO is given subcabinet rank within USDA, and will report directly to \nthe Secretary. Third, the CIO is given the authority to approve or \ndisapprove all purchases for telecommunications and computers.\n  One important provision of this bill transfers to the CIO 10 percent \nof all USDA agencies' appropriations for salaries and expenses, to be \nused for IT planning and purchases. This amount can be adjusted by the \nSecretary. When the CIO approves an expenditure, the funds are released \nback to the agency. My purpose in including this provision is to \nprovide the CIO with sufficient authority to control IT throughout \nUSDA. I understand that Secretary Glickman may prefer alternative \nmethods of achieving this goal. I look forward to working with him to \ncraft the best means of accomplishing our common objective, because I \ngenuinely intend this legislation to be helpful to his efforts and want \nto be supportive.\n  Secretary Glickman sincerely wants to change the stovepipe mentality \nthat pervades decisionmaking among USDA's 30 agencies. The Secretary \nhas expressed a desire to reform the planning and budgeting of IT \nexpenditures. He has stated a desire to halt the pattern of \nuncoordinated planning and ill-advised purchases that has resulted in \nthe waste of taxpayer dollars. I believe the Secretary agrees that we \ncannot afford the operating procedures which exist today.\n  However, the challenge of effecting change in the long-standing \npattern of stovepipe agencies operating on their own is formidable. By \nintroducing this bill today, I offer my assistance to the Secretary in \nthis difficult and heretofore elusive task.\n  The intent of this legislation is to help the Secretary realize his \nvision of a common USDA spirit by allowing him to implement reforms \nacross the entire Department of Agriculture. I look forward to working \nwith him to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of IT purchases \nand in so doing improve delivery of USDA programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \nfrom income taxation income derived from natural resources activities \nby a member of an Indian tribe directly or through a qualified Indian \nentity; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 NATIVE AMERICAN TAX RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nBen Nighthorse Campbell, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, in \nintroducing a series of tax relief bills designed to encourage \ninvestment, economic development, and growth on Indian reservations and \nother native American communities throughout the United States. The \nfour bills that I am introducing today would amend the Tax Code to give \nIndian tribes the tools with which to improve their economies.\n  In simple terms, native Americans as a group have experienced \ngrinding poverty of epidemic proportions since the days when they were \nfirst uprooted from their homelands or overrun by settlers. At the end \nof World War II, the United States assisted in rebuilding the economies \nof Germany and Japan to the advancement of peace,\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\nstability, and our own prosperity. Since the time native America lost \n``the war,'' their economy has never been rebuilt. The treaties that \nthe United States made with tribes in exchange for their land and peace \nhave, for the most part, not been honored.\n  The economic conditions on Indian reservations have not improved even \nduring those periods of economic growth that have swept much of the \nrest of our Nation. Instead, Indians have long suffered the indignity \nof promises broken and treaties discarded, and a personal hopelessness \nthat reaches tragic dimensions. Many Indian reservations are, \nrelatively speaking, islands of poverty in the ocean of wealth that is \nthe rest of America.\n  In previous Congresses, I have offered these amendments to the \nFederal Tax Code to create incentives for private sector investment on \nIndian reservations and remove inequities in the Tax Code so that \ntribal governments can enjoy the same tax benefits accorded other \nnontaxable government entities. I have offered these provisions, not to \nprovide an advantage to Indians, but merely to give them the same kind \nof tax incentives and benefits the Congress has given other \neconomically depressed areas and other units of government. Given the \nextremely underdeveloped economies of native American communities, I \nbelieve we must authorize these reasonable measures to stimulate \neconomic growth and productivity for Indians.\n\n\n                   RESERVATION INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. President, the first bill I am introducing today is the Indian \nReservations Jobs and Investment Act of 1997. This bill would provide \ntax credits to otherwise taxable business enterprises if they locate \ncertain kinds of income-producing property on Indian reservations. The \nbill does not provide any tax credit for reservation property used in \nconnection with gaming activities.\n  I am very concerned by how little private enterprise is present on \nIndian reservations. Typically, the only economic activity is that \ngenerated by the Federal or tribal governments. We must begin to see \nprivate investment attracted to Indian reservations if we are to \nrealize any significant improvement in the economies of Indian tribes.\n\n\n               TRIBAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX EQUITY AND RELIEF\n\n  Mr. President, the second measure is the Indian Tribal Government \nUnemployment Compensation Act Tax Relief Amendments of 1997. This bill \nwould correct a serious oversight in the way the Internal Revenue Code \ntreats Indian tribal governments for unemployment tax purposes under \nthe unique, State-Federal unemployment program authorized by the \nFederal Unemployment Tax Act [FUTA]. It would clarify existing tax \nstatutes so that tribal governments are treated as State and local \nunits of governments for unemployment tax purposes.\n  Unless this problem is resolved, many former tribal government \nemployees will continue to be denied benefits by State unemployment \nfunds. I believe that Indian and nonIndian workers who are separated \nfrom tribal governmental employment should be included in our Nation's \ncomprehensive unemployment benefit system, and this bill will go a long \nway toward ensuring mandatory participation by tribal governments on a \nfair and equitable basis in the Federal-State unemployment fund system. \nI can think of nothing more fair than the approach clarified in this \nbill.\n\n\n                    TRIBAL TAX-EXEMPT BOND AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. President, a third measure I am introducing is the Tribal \nGovernment Tax-Exempt Bond Authority Amendments Act of 1997. This bill \nwould bring new investment dollars to Indian reservations where capital \nformation is so desperately needed. There are serious deficiencies in \nthe basic infrastructure on Indian reservations, primarily because \nincreasingly tight fiscal restraints have limited the ability of the \nUnited States, through direct appropriations, to fund construction and \nother activities. Reservations lag far behind the rest of the United \nStates in terms of sanitation, housing, roads, basic utilities, and \npublic service facilities necessary to support a society and a \ncompetitive economy. I believe that providing additional tax-exempt \nbond authority to tribal governments will go a long way toward \nattracting new sources of capital to Indian reservations.\n\n\n                   TRIBAL NATURAL RESOURCE TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. President, finally, I am introducing the Treatment of Indian \nTribal Natural Resource Income Act of 1997. This bill would extend an \nexemption to income derived by individual Indians from the harvest of \nnatural resources from tribal trust land that is now extended to income \nderived by individual Indians from treaty-protected Indian fishing \nactivity. In 1988 Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to provide \nthe treaty fishing exemption under section 7873, which serves as a \nmodel for this bill.\n  The bill would apply only to tribal members and only with regard to \nnatural resources, underlying title to which is owned by the United \nStates in trust for a tribe. It would remove the existing anomaly which \nallows a tribe as a whole to harvest or process such resources free of \ntax, but imposes an income tax on an individual tribal member of that \ntribe carrying out activity permitted by the tribe.\n  Mr. President, native Americans need to have the appropriate tools to \novercome years of economic hardship and deprivation. They need to be \ngiven a full and fair opportunity to improve their quality of life \ntoday and to become more self-sufficient in the future. These bills \nwill help to achieve these goals by spurring economic development on \nIndian reservations and tribal industries. I urge all of my colleagues \nto join in supporting early passage of these measures.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I would like to co-sponsor the \nIndian Tribal Government Unemployment Compensation Act Tax Relief \nAmendments of 1997 introduced by Senator McCain. The Federal \nUnemployment Tax Act of 1935 [FUTA] is a joint Federal-State tax system \nwhich imposes on each employer a tax on wages paid to their employees. \nThese taxes are used to provide unemployment insurance to out-of-work \ncitizens. The Federal portion of the tax can range up to 6.2 percent on \nwages paid, and the State portion ranges from near zero to 9 percent of \nwages paid.\n  Indian tribes from around the country have contacted me expressing a \ngreat deal of confusion with the FUTA tax system and the difficulties \nthey are having in planning as a result of the varying interpretations \ngiven FUTA by the IRS and the Labor Department. This problem is \nnational in scope and experienced by tribes in the Great Lakes region \nsuch as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians and the Fond du Lac Band \nof Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, and by tribes in my own State of \nColorado--the Ute Mountain Ute and the Souther Ute tribes.\n  The FUTA encourages States to undertake their own unemployment \ninsurance programs by permitting employers to take the State \nunemployment insurance taxes they have paid and use them to offset \ntheir Federal unemployment insurance tax bill.\n  This legislation is necessary to clarify the status of tribal \ngovernments under the FUTA and the Internal Revenue Code. As \nindependent sovereign entities, Indian tribal governments should be \nafforded the same tax treatment, in this instance with regard to FUTA, \nas other governments--Federal, State, and local. Indian tribal \ngovernments are legitimate governments and, in fact, are one in four \nsovereign governments mentioned in the U.S. Constitution; the others \nbeing foreign nations, the several states, and the Federal Government. \nThis is critical because FUTA treats private, commercial employers \ndifferently than it does foreign, State and local government employers. \nPrivate employers are subject to both State and Federal unemployment \ninsurance taxes.\n  In brief, the FUTA exempts foreign, Federal, State, and local \ngovernment employers from the 0.8 percent Federal unemployment tax; and \nexempts foreign and Federal Government employers from the State \nunemployment insurance tax. FUTA allows state and local government \nemployers to pay a favorable, lower State unemployment insurance taxes, \nand for tax purposes treats tax-exempt charitable organizations the \nsame as State and local governments.\n  The problem is that the FUTA does not expressly include Indian tribal \ngovernment within the ``government employer'' category it has created \nfor State and local government employers. As a result tribal \ngovernments across\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\nthe country have been subjected to widely differing interpretations of \nthe FUTA statute, with inconsistent results. Some tribes's good faith \ninterpretation of the statute led them to believe that they, as units \nof government, were immune from the Federal tax. These tribes face \nlarge tax liabilities as a direct result of the way the act is being \napplied. Other tribes, again in good faith, did not participate in \nState unemployment insurance programs. In these instances, employees of \ntribal governments, both Indian and non-Indian, have been denied \nunemployment insurance benefits, pointing to the lack of participation \nby the tribes.\n  Not surprisingly, the agencies charged with administering the tax and \nlabor laws have not arrived at a consensus on the FUTA issue. For the \npast several years, various Internal Revenue Service field offices have \ninterpreted the FUTA in different ways. The varying interpretations \nhave resulted in differences in benefits availability for tribal \nemployees, Indians as well as non-Indians, and differing degrees of tax \nliability for tribal governments themselves. The bottom line is that \nfor Federal FUTA tax purposes, the treatment for tribes often depends \non where they are located. Absent explicit recognition from Congress \nclarifying the status of tribal governments, this is a problem that \nwill go on.\n  Because State governments, the IRS, and the U.S. Labor Department \ncannot seem to agree on the status of Indian tribal governments under \nthe FUTA, the time is right for the Congress to act and to clarify this \nissue so that tribal members can secure benefits they are entitled to \nand the tribes will have certainty and predictability in their \nemployment and hiring decisions.\n  Tribal government employers will benefit from this measure by the \nuniform application of the FUTA statute. The increased certainty that \nit will provide to tribal employers, their employees, and separated \nemployees will enhance the tribal work environment, reduce litigation, \nand provide assurances to all parties involved. This bill would require \nthat Indian tribal government employers receive the same treatment as \nFederal, State, and local governments and tax-exempt organizations \nreceive for FUTA purposes.\n  The Joint Tax Committee has been requested to estimate the revenue \nimpact of this measure. Similar estimates performed in 1995 indicated \nthe impacts to be minor. The development of tribal economies is a \ncritical element in encouraging tribal self-sufficiency and political \nself-determination. Increasing the ability of tribal government \nemployers to attract and retain the best skilled employees is one of my \nmain objectives as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. If the \nconfusion and lack of certainty that has plagued tribal governments \ncontinues, employment with an Indian tribe will be increasingly \nunattractive, and tribes will suffer.\n  By providing equitable FUTA treatment to tribal government employers, \nthis legislation will assist in the long-term growth and stability of \ntribal economies and tribal governments. I urge my colleagues to join \nin supporting this crucial measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Fond du Lac Reservation,\n\n\n                                           Business Committee,\n\n                                      Cloquet, MN, March 27, 1997.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     RE: H.R. 294, to amend the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As Chairman of the Reservation \n     Business Committee of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior \n     Chippewa Indians, I write to request your support of H.R. \n     294, a bill to amend the Federal Unemployment Tax Act to \n     clarify that Indian tribes, like state and local governments, \n     are exempt from this tax.\n       State and local governments in recognition of their \n     sovereignty, are not required to pay federal unemployment \n     taxes. In 1987, the IRS took the same position with regard to \n     Indian tribes. At that time, the IRS specifically advised the \n     Fond du Lac Band that the Band was not subject to FUTA and \n     was therefore not required to pay the federal unemployment \n     tax. The IRS actually refunded federal taxes that the Band \n     had previously paid. A copy the IRS letter to us is enclosed.\n       The IRS has since changed its mind, and has initiated an \n     action against the Band which is now being litigated before \n     an Administrative Law Judge. In these proceedings, the IRS \n     seeks over $2 million in back taxes and penalties from the \n     Band. The government's change of position on the issue is not \n     only unfair to tribes, but has generated litigation that is \n     expensive and inefficient for both the tribes and the federal \n     government to pursue.\n       Moreover, the IRS is pursuing this matter even though the \n     Fond du Lac Band has voluntarily participated in the State's \n     unemployment compensation plan. The Band has done so, not \n     because the Band is required to, but because the welfare of \n     our employees and our former employees is of the utmost \n     importance to us.\n       The legal uncertainty about the applicability of FUTA to \n     tribes, and the IRS' inconsistent position on that question, \n     results in a situation that should be fixed. FUTA should be \n     amended to recognize the tribes' status as sovereigns. The \n     Fond du Lac Band--like the State of Minnesota and the local \n     communities within the state--is responsible for providing a \n     myriad of services to Band members and Reservation residents. \n     Established federal Indian policy has--for many years--been \n     directed to encouraging tribal self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency. And numerous federal statutes--\n     enacted to further those ends--recognize and confirm tribal \n     status as separate sovereigns. It is inconsistent with tribal \n     sovereignty, and the federal policy of encouraging tribal \n     self-determination, to treat tribes differently from state \n     and local governments, and to subject tribes to the payment \n     of a federal tax from which state and local governments are \n     exempt.\n       H.R. 294, introduced by Congressman Shadegg, would resolve \n     this disputed question. The bill is identical to S. 1305 \n     introduced by Senator McCain and yourself in the 104th \n     Congress. The measure was further supported by Senator Grams. \n     A copy of Senator Grams' letter to the Senate Finance \n     Committee on this matter is attached. The bill strikes an \n     appropriate balance between tribal sovereignty--in that it \n     clarifies that tribes, like every other government in this \n     country, are exempt from FUTA taxes--while also ensuring that \n     tribal employees are provided unemployment benefits, by \n     requiring tribes to either voluntarily participate in state \n     plans, as Fond du Lac is now doing, or to reimburse the state \n     plans for any payment made to Tribal employees.\n       We urge you to show your support of this measure by \n     introducing companion legislation in the Senate. We look \n     forward to working with you and your staff to see enactment \n     of this important legislation and we thank you for your \n     consideration of our request.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Robert B.

Because the Department of Labor's enclosed \n     Unemployment Insurance Letter (UIPL) was forwarded to all \n     state employment security agencies, this problem will \n     eventually effect all tribes across the nation.\n       The documents I am providing include; 1. The UIPL issued by \n     Labor; 2. Letter received from the Colorado Department of \n     Labor; 3. The draft resolution presented to NCAI; 4. The \n     signed NCAI resolution passed at their recent Phoenix meeting \n     \\1\\; 5. Copies of relevant portions of FUTA, and; 6. Copies \n     of 26 USC Sec. 7871 concerning Indian tribe's tax status \n     under the Internal Revenue Code.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In person, I will explain in more complete detail the \n     chronology of this issue. Both Colorado Ute tribes thought we \n     solved this problem several years ago. The crux of the issue \n     is that states and their political subdivisions are exempt \n     under FUTA. State agencies are thus charged with the \n     responsibility of insuring their political subdivisions. \n     Tribes were not included in the state law as political \n     subdivisions and therefore we received no unemployment \n     insurance benefits whatsoever.\\2\\ Finally, the Colorado State \n     Legislature amended state law to include the two Colorado Ute \n     tribes as political subdivisions. We were then able to \n     participate in the program and were given the favorable rate \n     afforded to such entities.\n       Because the Colorado Department of Labor is afraid its \n     program will be decertified per the UIPL, they are now \n     placing us at a new employer rate and demanding back payments \n     to January 1, 1996. See, enclosed letter. While they have \n     informed us we will be considered a ``continuing employer,'' \n     the rate is a much higher rate than that afforded to \n     political subdivisions.\n       It is our attorney's initial position the matter can be \n     resolved by amending the federal law on Indian tribe's tax \n     status. Simply put, this and other tribes need an amendment \n     to 26 USC Sec. 7871 adding FUTA to the other excise taxes \n     which tribes are considered as states for purposes of.\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\n       We would like to request the assistance of the Native \n     American Rights Fund attorneys and policy staff on this \n     issue. Some coordination of effort would be greatly \n     appreciated. I firmly believe it is an issue which will \n     affect all tribes in the very near future. The impacts of \n     Labor's UIPL surely will negatively affect sovereignty and \n     degrade the government-to-government relationship which \n     President Clinton affirmed by Executive Order a few years \n     ago.\n       I thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Judy Knight-Frank,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ At the time of writing, I am still awaiting a facsimile \n     copy of the NCAI Resolution and will forward it immediately \n     when it is received.\n     \\2\\ We did not pay our IRS FUTA tax bills since we received \n     no benefit therefrom.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Campbell: On behalf of the National Congress \n     of American Indians, the oldest and largest national Indian \n     organization, I am writing to voice the support of more than \n     200 tribal governments for legislation to fix the inequitable \n     treatment of tribal governments under the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA).\n       Since its enactment in the 1930's, FUTA has treated \n     foreign, federal, state and local governments employers \n     differently from commercial business employers. FUTA also \n     treats tax-exempt charitable organizations the same as state \n     and local governments. It is well-settled that tribal \n     governments are not taxable entities under the federal tax \n     code because of their governmental status. However, because \n     FUTA does not expressly include tribal governments within the \n     definition of governmental employers, the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) is forcing tribal governments to pay the high \n     tax rates that apply to commercial business employers.\n       To correct this situation, Representative Shadegg has \n     introduced H.R. 294, the Indian Tribal Government \n     Unemployment Compensation Tax Act. H.R. 294 would give tribal \n     governments the same options that FUTA gives to all state and \n     local governments. I have attached a resolution passed by the \n     NCAI member tribes that supports such an amendment to FUTA.\n       Thank you very much for your efforts to take this issue \n     under consideration.

A bill to impose certain sanctions on the People's Republic \nof China, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n          the china sanctions and human rights advancement act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to address United States \npolicy toward China. When Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984, he \ndeclared in a speech that:\n\n       Economic growth and human progress make their greatest \n     strides when people are secure and free to think, speak, \n     worship, choose their own way and reach for the stars.\n\n  While China has made great strides since Ronald Reagan spoke those \nwords, it is clear today that the people of China are not free to \nthink, speak, worship, or choose their own way.\n  The question is how the United States, a nation conceived in liberty, \nshould respond to continuing violations of basic human rights in China \nand other actions of the Chinese leadership.\n  Religious persecution, abuses against minorities, coercive family \nplanning, military threats, and weapons proliferation and attempts to \nimproperly influence American elections. All of these policies have \nbeen and continue to be undertaken by the Chinese Government. And all \nof them must stop.\n  One thing is clear, Mr. President: As the world's leading democracy, \nthe United States cannot simply look the other way, ignoring the \nChinese Government's record on human rights.\n  And, despite the real and measurable expansion of freedom in some \nspheres in China, problems remain. The organization Amnesty \nInternational has stated that:\n\n     a fifth of the world's people are ruled by a government that \n     treats fundamental human rights with contempt. Human rights \n     violations continue on a massive scale.\n\n  In addition, there have been numerous reports of religious \npersecution in China. These reports by Amnesty International and Human \nRights Watch/Asia do not state that China has recently been targeting \nreligious leaders for execution. But some religious leaders have been \nexecuted along with others in remote provinces. And long and arduous \nsentences have been handed out to certain Chinese religious leaders.\n  For example, Tibetan abbot, Shadrel Rimposh, was in charge of the \noriginal search in that country to find the missing child whom the \nTibetans consider the reincarnation of the Pansen Lama.\n  The abbot was missing for more than a year, officially labeled ``a \ncriminal and a scum of Buddhism'' by the government. Recently the \ngovernment sentenced him to 6 years in prison. Other religious leaders \nhave been sent to labor camps.\n  The people of Tibet have been subject to particularly harsh abuse \nfrom the Chinese Government because their form of the Buddhist religion \nis so closely tied to their independence movements; movements that have \nmet with brutal suppression.\n  Allow me to quote at length from a 1997 Human Rights Watch/Asia \nreport:\n\n       In the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan areas of \n     Chinese provinces the effects of a July 1994 policy \n     conference on Tibet combined with the Strike Hard campaign \n     produced more arrests of suspected independence supporters, a \n     stepped-up campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama as a \n     religious leader, crackdowns in rural areas as well as towns, \n     a major push for ridding monasteries and nunneries of \n     nationalist sympathizers, and the closure of those that were \n     politically active.\n       Monks who refused to sign pledges denouncing the Dalai Lama \n     or to accept a five-point declaration of opposition to the\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n     proindependence movement, faced expulsion from their \n     monasteries.\n       In May 1994, a ban on the possession and display of Dalai \n     Lama photographs led to a bloody confrontation at Goneden and \n     to searches of hotels, restaurants, shops, and some private \n     homes. Over 90 monks were arrested; 53 remained in detention \n     as of October despite Chinese official reports that none of \n     the 61 arrested were still being held. At least one person \n     and perhaps two others are known to have died in the melee.\n       Chinese authorities acknowledge that they are holding \n     Jendune Yee Kneema the child recognized by the Dalai Lama but \n     rejected by Chinese authorities as the reincarnation of the \n     Pansen Lama, under the protection of the government at the \n     request of his parents.\n\n  The whereabouts of this missing child should be a major source of \nconcern for every one who cares about religious liberty.\n  But Tibetan Buddhists are not the only people of faith who face \npersecution at the hands of the Chinese Government. Under a 1996 state \nsecurity law, all religious institutions must register with the state. \nThose who do not so register and choose instead to operate underground \nface the government's wrath.\n  Human Rights Watch/Asia reported recently that:\n\n       Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were targeted \n     by the government during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at \n     forcing all churches to register or face dissolution, \n     resulted in beating and harassment of congregants, closure of \n     churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and sentences. In \n     Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or \n     meeting points were closed down by the security authorities \n     in April alone.\n       From January through May, teams of officials fanned out \n     through northern Haybay, a Catholic stronghold, to register \n     churches and clergy and to prevent attendance at a major \n     Marian shrine. Public security officers arrested clergy and \n     lay Catholics alike, forced others to remain in their \n     villages, avoid foreigners, refrain from preaching, and \n     report to the police anywhere from one to eight times daily. \n     In some villages, officials confiscated all religious medals. \n     In others, churches and prayer houses were torn down or \n     converted to lay use.\n\n  In addition to religious belief and practice, there are other \ntroubling issues of moral conscience. I am referring in particular to \nthe Chinese Government's birth control policies.\n  Mr. President, the Chinese Government claims that family planning is \nvoluntary in that nation. Yet, according to Amnesty International, \nbirth control has been compulsory since 1979. As a result:\n  Pregnant women with too many children have been abducted and forced \nto have abortions and/or undergo sterilization.\n  Pregnant women have been detained and threatened until they have \nagreed to have abortions.\n  Above-quota new-born babies have reportedly been killed by doctors \nunder pressure from officials.\n  The homes of couples who refuse to obey the child quotas have been \ndemolished.\n  Relatives of those who cannot pay fines imposed for having had too \nmany children have been held hostage until the money was paid.\n  And those helping families to have above-quota children have been \nseverely punished.\n  Just one example, if I may, Mr. President, this one provided by \nAmnesty International:\n\n       An unmarried woman in Haybay Province who had adopted one \n     of her brother's children was detained several times in an \n     attempt to force her brother to pay fines for having too many \n     children. In November 1994 she was held for 7 days with a \n     dozen other men and women. She was reportedly blindfolded, \n     stripped naked, tied, and beaten with an electric baton.\n\n  These stories bespeak an often brutal disregard for the rights of \nconscience, for the sanctity of marriage and family, and for human life \nitself. They are evil acts, Mr. President, nothing less than government \nperpetrated evil.\n  Let me now shift to the military sphere.\n  Here, Mr. President, we see Chinese Government practices that include \nmilitary intimidation and the selling of advanced weaponry to rogue \nstates.\n  For example, on the eve of Taiwan's 1996 elections, China engaged in \nthreatening missile firings unnecessarily close to Taiwanese cities. \nThe Taiwanese were not cowed, they are a brave people. But these \nprovocations, so soon after China's 1995 military exercises and missile \nlaunches in direct proximity to Taiwanese territory, have led the \nTaiwanese people to consider whether they need nuclear weapons to \ndefend their homes.\n  In addition, the Chinese Government has threatened international \nstability through its weapons sales to regimes, including Iran and \nIraq, that sponsor terrorism and pose a direct threat to American \nmilitary personnel and interests. Most dangerous has been the Chinese \nwillingness to supply the Iranians with the technology and basic \nmaterials for their own chemical weapons program.\n  Mr. President, these weapons pose a direct threat to American troops \nas well as stability and peace in the Middle East.\n  Moreover, the Chinese Government apparently does not limit itself to \nmilitary means as it tries to influence the policies of other nations.\n  Allegations of Chinese involvement in our political system are \ndisturbing, particularly considering the various implications that this \nhas for our relations with that country. These allegations may involve \nboth civil and criminal violations of our laws by individuals \nassociated with the Chinese Government.\n  The press has reported serious allegations that the Government of \nChina attempted to influence last year's Presidential election by \ndiverting illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National \nCommittee.\n  FBI investigators have found significant evidence that the Chinese \nGovernment targeted 30 legislators, and that it funneled money through \nbusinesses it controlled in America to the DNC. If proven, these \nallegations would signal violations of Federal Election Commission laws \nregarding foreign campaign contributions by the Chinese Government.\n  Mr. President, this is a damning list, a list that cries out for \naction. As the world's sole remaining superpower and, perhaps more \nimportant, as the birth place of liberty and individual rights, we have \na duty to uphold the principles of liberty wherever possible.\n  Liberty continues to suffer abuse from the Chinese Government. And we \nshould do something about it.\n  In response to the serious problems I have raised some have called \nfor an end to China's most-favored-nation trading status with the \nUnited States. In fact, the debate has focused almost exclusively on \nMFN.\n  I believe that is the wrong approach. I support a 1-year extension of \nMFN for China.\n  Why? First, because it is the best policy for American consumers. \nThose consumers will have a wider choice of affordable goods with MFN \nthan without. To revoke MFN would be to increase tariffs on goods \npurchased by the American people. It would amount to a tax hike, and I \nam not in favor of tax hikes, particularly ones imposed on the basis of \nanother government's behavior.\n  Second, I am convinced that revoking MFN would target the wrong \nparties for punishment. We should keep in mind, in my view, that it is \nnot the people of China with whom we have a quarrel; it is their \ngovernment.\n  Trade and United States investment in China have a positive effect in \nproviding more opportunities for average Chinese citizens.\n  Even in the short term, we should not underestimate trade and \ninvestment's positive impact.\n  In China,\n\n     employees at United States firms earn higher wages and are \n     free to choose where to live, what to eat, and how to educate \n     and care for their children,\n\nwrites China policy expert Stephen J. Yates of the Heritage Foundation.\n\n       This real and measurable expansion of freedom does not \n     require waiting for middle-class civil society to emerge in \n     China; it is taking place now and should be encouraged.\n\n  Third, Mr. President, I am convinced that terminating MFN would be \ndamaging to the people of Hong Kong, currently involved in a transfer \nof power from British to Chinese rule.\n  All of us in Congress are concerned that China may violate the 1994 \nSino-British Joint Declaration and squash political and economic \nfreedom once Hong Kong again comes under Chinese rule.\n  With 35,000 United States citizens and 1,000 United States firms in \nHong Kong, America must be certain that China honors its agreement and \nwe must remain watchful over the coming months and years.\n  However, in formulating United States policy with regard to Hong\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\nKong we must remember that repealing MFN for China will hit Hong Kong \nhard, particularly because so much trade goes through there. Goods from \nHong Kong would face the same steep tariff as those from other parts of \nChina.\n  Hong Kong Governor, Chris Patten, has said that rescinding MFN would \ndevastate Hong Kong's economy.\n\n       For the people of Hong Kong there is no comfort in the \n     proposition that if China reduces their freedoms the United \n     States will take away their jobs.\n\n  The letter from Governor Patten also said:\n\n       There is one particular contribution which the United \n     States of America, and Congress in particular, can make to \n     ensure that Hong Kong remains well-equipped to face the \n     future. That is to grant the unconditional renewal of China's \n     MFN trading status, on which the continued strength of Hong \n     Kong's economy depends. * * * This is one issue on which \n     there is complete unanimity in Hong Kong across the \n     community, and across the political spectrum.\n\n  It is not good policy to attempt to help Hong Kong by taking an \naction that is opposed by the people we say we are trying to help.\n  Mr. President, I have another important reason for supporting a 1-\nyear extension of MFN: American jobs.\n  Using the Commerce Department's rules of thumb, United States exports \nto China account for roughly 200,000 American jobs. Should we stop \ndoing business with China, I have no doubt but that other nations will \nstep in to take our place, and to take jobs now occupied by Americans \nboth here and in China. Thus, we would not significantly punish the \nChinese Government, but we would visit hardship on our own workers.\n  Rather than eliminate jobs and stifle growth through increased \ntariffs, in my view, it would be better to take actions showing our \ndispleasure with the Chinese Government, while encouraging China to \nbecome a more free and open society.\n  I believe that Members of this body can agree on the need for strong \nAmerican actions responding to human rights abuses in China. That is \nwhy I am introducing the China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement \nAct.\n  And I am convinced that Members on both sides of the MFN debate can \nagree that the sanctions I am proposing today are necessary and \njustified, and that they will be effective.\n  The goal of these sanctions will be to show our disapproval of the \nactions of the Chinese Government, while at the same time encouraging \nworthwhile economic and cultural exchanges that can lead to positive \nchange in China.\n  This legislation would focus on: First, who the United States allows \ninto the country from China; second, United States taxpayer funds that \nsubsidize China; third, United States Government votes and assistance \nin international bodies that provide financial assistance to China; \nfourth, targeted sanctions of PLA companies; and fifth, measures to \npromote human rights in China.\n  Let me be specific. Under my bill, the U.S. Government would take the \nfollowing actions:\n  First, it would prohibit issuance of U.S. visas to human rights \nviolators.\n  The bill would prohibit the granting of United States visas to \nChinese Government officials who work in entities involved in the \nimplementation and enforcement of China's law and directives on \nreligious practices.\n  Specifically, this targets high-ranking officials of the state \npolice, the Religious Affairs Bureau, and China's family planning \napparatus. The same would go for all those involved in the massacre of \nstudents in Tianenman Square.\n  Written notice from the President to Congress explaining why the \nentry of such individuals overrides our concerns about China's human \nrights abuses would be required for such individuals to enter the \nUnited States.\n  Second, the bill would prohibit direct and indirect United States-\ntaxpayer financed foreign aid for China.\n  We can no longer ask U.S. taxpayers to subsidize a Communist \nleadership and government with which we have so many serious \ndisagreements.\n  Between 1985 and 1995 the United States supported 111 of 183 loans \napproved by the World Bank Group and 15 of 92 loans that the Asian \nDevelopment Bank approved. In addition, the United States Government is \nproviding assistance through international family planning institutions \nthat provide money and services to support China's restrictive policies \non reproduction.\n  Under my bill, United States representatives would be required to \nvote ``no'' on all loans to China at the World Bank, Asian Development \nBank, and the International Monetary Fund.\n  An exception would be made in the case of humanitarian relief in the \nevent of a natural disaster or famine.\n  In addition, for every dollar a multilateral development bank or \ninternational family planning organization gives to China, my bill \nwould subtract out a dollar in United States taxpayer funding to those \nbodies.\n  Simply put, America should not be subsidizing current Chinese \nGovernment policies. If China continues its current behavior then it \ncan fund programs by reducing the money it spends on building up its \nmilitary or in propping up state enterprises. We do not want to \nencourage China to postpone tough decisions on moving to a free-market \neconomy.\n  Though we are standing on principle, we know from past experience \nthat these measures will be more effective with help from our allies. \nThat is why the bill requires the President to begin consultations with \nthese allies on enacting similar measures and for the President to \nreport to the Congress on the progress of those consultations.\n  Third, the legislation includes actions targeted at companies \nassociated with the Chinese military.\n  There is increasing concern in America about Chinese companies backed \nby the People's Liberation Army.\n  My bill would require the U.S. Government to publish a list of such \ncompanies operating in the United States. That would allow informed \nconsumers and other purchasers to make a choice about whether they wish \nto do business with such companies.\n  Most troubling have been the actions of two Chinese companies--\nPolytechnologies Inc., known as Poly, and Norinco, the China North \nIndustries Group.\n  On May 22, 1996, officials from the United States Customs Service and \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrested seven individuals and \nseized 2,000 Chinese-made AK-47 machine guns.\n  On June 4, 1996, a grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of California indicted these seven individuals, along \nwith seven others not in the United States, for violating 12 different \nsections of Federal law, including conspiracy, smuggling, and unlawful \nimportation of defense articles.\n  Those indicted individuals worked for Poly and Norinco. Leading \nexecutives of the firms, as well as Chinese Government officials, were \nindicted.\n  The People's Liberation Army owns a majority share of Poly, while \nNorinco's operations are overseen by the State Council of the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  Undercover agents were told by a representative of Poly and Norinco \nthat Chinese-made hand-held rocket launchers, tanks, and surface-to-air \nmissiles could also be delivered. And who were to be the ultimate \npurchasers of the AK-47's and other military hardware? According to \nFederal agents, California street gangs and other criminal groups.\n  This type of activity cannot be tolerated by the U.S. Congress. These \ncompanies need to be held responsible for their actions.\n  Under my bill, for a period of 1 year, Poly and Norinco will not be \nallowed to export to, or maintain a physical presence in, the United \nStates. Senator DeWine plans to introduce a separate bill that will \ntarget these two companies and I applaud him and Representative Chris \nCox for their leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, these tough measures are justified and necessary. But \neven as we implement them we should not cut off valuable interchange \nwith China. We must always be open to more contact and exchange of \nideas with the Chinese people.\n  That is why the legislation calls for a doubling of current United \nStates funding for student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs \nbetween the United States and the People's Republic of China, as well \nas doubling the funding for Radio Free Asia and programs in China \noperated through the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n  In addition, adopting a measure advocated by Representatives Frank \nWolf and Chris Smith, the bill requires additional and extensive \ntraining for U.S. asylum officers in recognizing religious persecution.\n  The legislation would require an annual report by the President on \nwhether there has been improvement in China's policy of religious \ntoleration and in its overall human rights record, including during the \ntransition in Hong Kong.\n  The sanctions would sunset after 1 year. This will allow Congress to \nevaluate the situation to determine whether and in what form sanctions \nshould be continued.\n  In my judgment, the combination of these sanctions and a 1-year \nextension of MFN offers the best approach to change the behavior of the \nChinese Government.\n  Mr. President, these measures will direct punishment where it \nbelongs, with the Chinese Government, not the Chinese people.\n  By refusing to allow known violators of basic human rights to enter \nthis country we can signal our revulsion at these practices.\n  By refusing to use taxpayer money to subsidize Chinese activities we \ncan show our disapproval of their military actions and make them choose \nbetween prosperity and belligerence.\n  By banning Chinese companies from this country for attempting to sell \nweapons to violent street criminals we can show our willingness to \ndefend our streets and our insistence that the Chinese Government cease \nits intrusive, illegal practices.\n  In closing, Mr. President, we should not forget the government-led \nmassacre of students in Tianenman Square. It has been less than 10 \nyears since the atrocity, and we should not let it slip from our minds.\n  Let me read you a dispatch filed from Beijing by New York Times \nreporter Nicholas Kristoff on June 4, 1989:\n\n       The violence against students and workers in Tianenman \n     Square was most obvious today, because for the most part they \n     were the ones getting killed * * * To be an American on the \n     square this morning was to be the object of fervent hope and \n     inarticulate pleas for help. ``We appeal to your country,'' a \n     university student begged as bullets careened overhead. ``Our \n     Government is mad. We need help from abroad, especially \n     America. There must be something that America can do.''\n\n  Through this legislation, America can stand with the Chinese people, \nand stand by the principles of political, religious, and economic \nliberty on which our Nation was founded.\n  Let's not punish American and Chinese families by raising tariffs. \nInstead, let's punish specific abuses and encourage the further \ndevelopment of the economic and political liberties we cherish.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\nThe China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act--Executive Summary\n\n\n                      american concerns with china\n\n       The United States has serious policy disagreements with the \n     People's Republic of China. Such differences in the way China \n     treats its own people and U.S. interests requires appropriate \n     action by the United States Congress. Unfortunately, \n     Administration policy in this area has been lacking. That is \n     why the China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act will \n     enable America to respond in a manner consistent with our \n     values and interests as a nation.\n       As the world's leading democracy, the United Stats cannot \n     simply look the other way at the Chinese government's record \n     on human rights and religious persecution. ``A fifth of the \n     world's people are ruled by a government that treats \n     fundamental human rights with contempt,'' reports Amnesty \n     International. ``Human rights violations continue on a \n     massive scale.'' What is the best response to Chinese \n     government repression of its citizens, including increased \n     repression of religious believers? The status quo, it \n     appears, is not the answer.\n       China's willingness to abide by international agreements is \n     already being tested in Hong Kong. The 1994 Sino-British \n     Joint Declaration is an international agreement registered \n     with the United Nations. In it, China promises that the \n     people of Hong Kong will rule Hong Kong with autonomy, except \n     in the areas of defense and foreign affairs. With 35,000 U.S. \n     citizens and 1,000 U.S. firms in Hong Kong America must be \n     certain that China honors its agreement.\n       China's attempt to intimidate Taiwan and the activities of \n     its military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), both in the \n     United States and abroad, are of major concern. In addition, \n     the efforts of two Chinese companies, NORINCO and POLY, \n     deserve special rebuke for their involvement in the sale of \n     AK-47 machine guns to California street gangs. Finally, there \n     are numerous press reports of Chinese government efforts to \n     influence the course of U.S. elections through political \n     donations.\n\n\n                           the larger picture\n\n       Trade, investment, and people-to-people exchanges must be a \n     part of America's relationship with China. Countries the size \n     of China and the United States will always trade with each \n     other, the debate over MFN is the terms of that trade. Yet \n     those who disagree on MFN should be able to unite behind \n     measures that, for example, end subsidies for China, yet seek \n     to promote democratic values and human rights in China. There \n     is no doubt that trade and U.S. investment in China has a \n     positive effect in providing more opportunities for average \n     Chinese citizens. Even in short term, we should not \n     underestimate trade and investment's positive impact. \n     ``Employees at U.S. firms earn higher wages and are free to \n     choose where to live, what to eat, and how to educate and \n     care for their children,'' writes China policy expert Stephen \n     J. Yates. ``This real and measurable expansion of freedom \n     does not require waiting for middle-class civil society to \n     emerge in China; it is taking place now and should be \n     encouraged.''\n\n\n                         summary of legislation\n\n       The time has come to take steps that would signal to \n     Chinese leaders that their current behavior is unacceptable \n     to the American people and the American Congress. In crafting \n     the best response to Chinese government policy we must be \n     careful not to punish the innocent with the guilty. Our \n     quarrel is with the Chinese political leadership, not with \n     the Chinese and American peoples.\n       The Abraham ``China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement \n     Act'' takes aim at U.S.-China government-to-government \n     programs and contacts. It is time for Congress to end U.S. \n     taxpayer subsidies and other foreign aid to China and to set \n     more appropriate limits on who we allow into this country \n     from the Chinese government.\n       The legislation focuses on (1) who the United States allows \n     into the country from China; (2) U.S. taxpayer funds that \n     subsidize China; (3) U.S. government votes and assistance \n     in international bodies that provide financial assistance \n     to China; (4) targeted sanctions of PLA companies; and (5) \n     measures to promote human rights in China.\n     Contents of China sanctions and human rights advancement act\n       Under the legislation, the U.S. government will take the \n     following actions:\n     No U.S. visas for human rights violators\n       Prohibit the granting of U.S. visas to Chinese government \n     officials who work in entities involved in the implementation \n     and enforcement of China's laws and directives on religious \n     practices and coercive family planning. This measure would \n     deny visas to high ranking officials who are employed by the \n     Public Security Bureau (the state police), the Religious \n     Affairs Bureau, and China's family planning apparatus. An \n     exception is made in the case of individuals whose presence \n     in the United States is deemed necessary for an ongoing \n     criminal investigation or judicial proceedings as determined \n     by the Attorney General.\n       Prohibit the granting of U.S. visas to Chinese government \n     officials found to be materially involved in the ordering or \n     carrying out of the massacre of Chinese students in Tiananmen \n     Square.\n       The President of the United States must provide written \n     notification to Congress each time a proscribed individual is \n     to enter this country that explains why awarding such visas \n     is in the national interest of the United States and \n     overrides U.S. concerns about China's human rights practices \n     past and present.\n       The legislation also mandates additional and extensive \n     training for U.S. asylum officers in recognizing religious \n     persecution.\n     No U.S. taxpayer subsidies for China\n       Require U.S. representatives to vote ``no'' on all loans to \n     China at the World Bank. Between 1985 and 1995 the United \n     States supported 111 of 183 loans approved by the World Bank \n     Group and 15 of 92 loans that the Asian Development Bank \n     approved. An exception in the legislation is provided for \n     human needs arising from a natural disaster or famine.\n       Require U.S. representatives to vote ``no'' on all loans to \n     China at the Asian Development Bank.\n       Require U.S. representatives to vote ``no'' on all loans to \n     China at the International Monetary Fund.\n       Reduce U.S. contributions to multilateral development banks \n     (World Bank, etc.) by the amount of the loan commitments made \n     to China in the coming year. Stipulate the Secretary of \n     Treasury shall reduce the amount the World Bank can borrow in \n     U.S. capital markets to no more than 82% of what the World \n     Bank borrowed in the United States in the previous year.\n       Require the Secretary of Treasury to oppose and instruct \n     the U.S. executive director of the World Bank to oppose any \n     change in the World Bank's rules that limit the total share \n     of the bank's lending that can be made in any one country.\n       Require the President to begin consultations with major \n     U.S. allies and trading partners to encourage them to adopt \n     similar measures contained in this bill and to lobby our \n     allies to vote against loans for China at\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\n     multilateral development banks. Within 60 days of a G-7 \n     meeting, the President shall submit a report to Congress on \n     the progress of this effort.\n       Reduce annually U.S. financial assistance to international \n     bodies and organizations that provide family planning \n     assistance to China by the amount of such annual assistance \n     and services made by such institutions to China in the prior \n     fiscal year. This would include funding provided to U.N. \n     agencies and affiliates.\n     PLA companies: targeted sanctions and more public information\n       On an annual basis, the U.S. Government shall publish a \n     list of all companies owned in part or wholly by the People's \n     Liberation Army (PLA) of the P.R.C. who export to, or have \n     an office in, the United States.\n       For a period of one year, China North Industries Group \n     (NORINCO) and the PLA-owned company China Poly Group (POLY) \n     will not be allowed to export to, nor maintain a physical \n     presence in, the United States. The attempted illegal sale of \n     AK-47 machine guns to street gangs in California warrant \n     these targeted sanctions against these firms.\n     Promoting Democratic Values in China\n       The U.S. government shall double the U.S. funding available \n     to existing students, cultural, and legislative exchange \n     programs between the United States and the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       The U.S. government shall double the authorization of funds \n     available to Radio Free Asia.\n       The U.S. government shall double the funding available to \n     the National Endowment for Democracy's programs in China.\n\n\n    in one year: an opportunity to discontinue, maintain or add new \n                               sanctions\n\n       The legislation requires an annual report by the President \n     on whether there has been improvement in China's policy of \n     religious toleration and in its overall human rights record, \n     including during the transition in Hong Kong. The sanctions \n     sunset after one year, allowing Congress an opportunity to \n     evaluate the situation and determine whether and in what form \n     sanctions should continue.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The legislation emphasizes appropriate limits on U.S. and \n     Chinese government-to-government contacts and U.S. taxpayer \n     subsidies, while seeking to promote greater freedom in China. \n     These measures would signal to China's leadership that it \n     cannot simply be business as usual with the U.S. government \n     so long as it mistreats its citizens and tramples on their \n     fundamental right to practice the religion of their choice. \n     It also applies appropriate measures with regard to PLA \n     companies. The United States must stay engaged with China, \n     and trade and investment is a valuable avenue for that \n     engagement, but there is no reason the U.S. government should \n     be subsidizing a government with whom we have so many serious \n     and fundamental disagreements. This approach is designed to \n     signal our displeasure with China's policies, encourage its \n     leaders to improve the treatment of its citizens, and to end \n     U.S. taxpayer subsidies for a repressive regime while \n     expanding basic interaction between the American and Chinese \n     people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 812. A bill to establish an independent commission to recommend \nreforms in the laws relating to elections for Federal office; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n           the campaign finance reform commission act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important issue \nbefore the Senate--campaign finance reform. First, let me state that I \nam a cosponsor of S. 25, Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold's \nSenate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1997. I cosponsored S. 25 because \nI feel it is the best legislation moving through the Congress to reform \nour campaign finance system. My Wisconsin colleague, Senator Feingold \nand Senator McCain deserve our gratitude and praise for keeping this \nissue alive. It's been nearly 20 years since Congress enacted \nmeaningful campaign finance reform, and they have come closer than \nanyone at passing a bipartisan plan.\n  We are at a crossroads in this debate. America's campaign finance \nlaws have not been significantly altered since the 1970's. Since that \ntime we've seen an explosion in the costs of running campaigns and a \ngrowing public perception that special interests are far too \ninfluential in the electoral process. The last election cycle saw the \nproblems in our system grow to new proportions, and we are now \nwitnessing two congressional investigations and a Justice Department \ninvestigation into alleged illegalities and improprieties. Despite \nthese widely agreed-upon problems, Congress and the President seem \nincapable of enacting a campaign finance reform bill.\n  We have seen initiatives by Democratic and Republican Presidents. \nDemocratic and Republican Congresses, even widely hailed bipartisan \napproaches all fail. One can easily conclude that this issue is so \nmired in partisan politics, trapped in a quagmire of self-interest and \nspecial interest, that Congress will not be able to craft a \ncomprehensive reform bill. S. 25 is the best legislation to be proposed \nin two decades, and yet, when we voted on the measure in the last \nCongress, we could not get 60 Senators to support it, and the House of \nRepresentatives leadership wouldn't even bring it up for a vote.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that this important piece of \nlegislation may face the same fate this year. I support S. 25, and will \ncontinue to strongly support it until we have a clear vote on the \nmeasure this year. However, I do not believe it would be in the \ncountry's best interest to let another campaign cycle go by without the \nCongress taking clear action to reform our campaign finance system.\n  Therefore, I am introducing today the Campaign Finance Reform \nCommission Act of 1997. Let me be clear from the outset: I would prefer \nto pass a bill such as S. 25, and I desperately hope that we do. But, \nin the case that we do not, Congress needs to be ready with legislation \nthat moves us toward a better system.\n  The Campaign Finance Reform Commission is modeled on the successful \nBase Realignment and Closure Commissions. The legislation would \nestablish a balanced, bipartisan commission, appointed by Senate \nleaders, House leaders, and the President to propose comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform. Like the BRAC Commissions, the proposals of \nthe Campaign Finance Reform Commission would be subject to \ncongressional approval or disapproval, but no amendments would be \npermitted. The Commission would have a limited duration--1 year after \nits creation. And Congress would have a limited time to consider the \nCommission's proposals.\n  Mr. President, there are many who will object to this plan and argue \nthat, through the creation of a commission, the Congress is conceding \nthat it cannot solve this problem on its own. To the contrary, the \ncreation of a Campaign Finance Reform Commission would be a concrete \nsign to the American public that Congress is serious about reforming \nour election laws. We have seen the success of the BRAC Commissions in \nremoving political influences from the decision-making process. This \nsame formula could be used for our campaign finance reform laws.\n  When Congress enacted the first BRAC Commission law, it was argued \nthat a nonpartisan commission was required because the closure of \nmilitary bases was so politically sensitive, Congress could not be \nexpected to make the tough choices of closing bases. Well, Mr. \nPresident, if closing military bases is considered tough, altering the \ncampaign laws that literally determine whether Members could retain \ntheir jobs must be just as politically sensitive, if not more so.\n  Again, I wish to praise the efforts of Senators Feingold, McCain, and \nthe broad coalition of grassroots organizations which have kept the \ncampaign finance issue in front of the American public and the \nCongress. I hope that they succeed in their efforts with their bill and \nwe can present the American public with a new campaign system before \nthe 1998 election. I offer this bill today only as an alternative to be \nconsidered, if, and only if, we cannot pass S. 25 this year.\n  Mr. President, like all commonsense ideas, the idea of a Campaign \nFinance Reform Commission did not spring from a text book but came from \na simpler setting. Two years ago President Clinton and House Speaker \nNewt Gingrich held an historic conversation at a New Hampshire meeting. \nThe first question came from a retiree, Mr. Frank McConnell, Jr. Mr. \nMcConnell had a simple, commonsense idea--form a commission like the \none that closed the military bases to reform our election system, so, \nin Mr. McConnell's words, ``it would be out of the political scene.'' \nThe time for Mr. McConnell's idea has come.\n  I am pleased to put Mr. McConnell's idea into legislative form. If S. \n25 fails this year, this Commission could give us the reform we all \ndemand. And, it\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nwould give the American public a restored faith that their democratic \ninstitutions have responded to their cry for change in our electoral \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 91 of title 18, United States Code, \nto provide criminal penalties for theft and willful vandalism at \nnational cemeteries; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n             the veterans' cemetery protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this coming Monday, May 26, our Nation \nwill observe Memorial Day. For some Americans, Memorial Day is simply \nthe opening of the summer vacation season. However, for millions of \npatriotic Americans this day is much more. To us, Memorial Day is the \nday we pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in \ndefending this Nation and our freedoms.\n  Honoring those who died in war is a practice and custom of many \ncultures and countries. In the United States, tributes to fallen \nsoldiers took place in many locations during the War Between the \nStates. An early observance occurred on May 30, 1865, in Charleston, \nSC, when a group of school children scattered flowers over trenches in \nwhich the remains of several hundred Union soldiers had been interred. \nAnother commemoration occurred in Columbus, MS, on April 25, 1866, when \na group of women visited a cemetery to decorate the graves of \nConfederate soldiers who had fallen in battle at Shiloh. Flowers were \nplaced on the nearby bare and neglected graves of Union soldiers as \nwell. Throughout the North and South, this practice of decorating \ngraves became more widespread.\n  On May 5, 1868, Gen. John A. Logan issued a general order that \ndesignated the 30th day of May, 1868, as a day for decorating the \ngraves of comrades who died in defense of their country. Decoration \nDay, as it came to be celebrated, was first observed that day at \nArlington National Cemetery, which held the remains of 20,000 Union \ndead and several hundred Confederate dead. By the end of the 19th \ncentury, Memorial Day, or Decoration Day ceremonies were being held \nthroughout the Nation. In 1971 Memorial Day was declared a national \nholiday, and was placed on the last Monday in May.\n  Mr. President, Memorial Day services will be held throughout the \nNation next Monday, in our national cemeteries, where thousands of war \ndead are buried. A national service will be held at Arlington Cemetery. \nLocal traditions will be included in ceremonies at the Punchbowl Center \nin Hawaii. Decorations will be placed in the 114 national cemeteries \noperated by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery \nSystem. A few other national cemeteries are under the jurisdiction of \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of Interior. I encourage \nmy colleagues, and all citizens of this Nation, to visit these \ncemeteries and pay respect to those who have given their life for their \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately not all activities at our national \ncemeteries have honored the dead. There have been, unfortunately, \ninstances of vandalism and theft at our national cemeteries. Last \nmonth, the Punchbowl in Hawaii, the National Memorial Cemetery of the \nPacific, was desecrated by vandals. Vandals caused over $20,000 in \ndamage by spray painting racial epithets and obscenities on graves, \nmarble memorials, and other parts of the cemetery. Other cemeteries, \nprivate and State, were also damaged that same weekend. Last year, at \nthe Riverside National Cemetery in California, engraved grave markers \nwere stolen from 128 graves. Months before that incident, over 500 \nmarkers were stolen from a storage facility.\n  The time has come to demand a stop to this type of insulting \nbehavior. That is why I am introducing the Veterans' Cemetery \nProtection Act of 1997. This bill is a companion bill to one introduced \nin the House, H.R. 1532. This bill imposes criminal penalties for \nvandalism and theft at national cemeteries operated by the VA, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the Department of Interior. Penalties for \nvandalism and theft, are consistent with similar crimes against other \nFederal property. In addition, the bill establishes penalties for\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\nattempted vandalism and theft. I am delighted that Senator McCain, a \nfellow veteran and true national hero, joins me in introducing this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, as we pause to remember our fallen comrades, it is \nappropriate that we protect their final resting places. I invite may \ncolleagues to join Senator McCain and me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Veterans' \nCemetery Protection Act of 1997, sponsored by my colleague and \ndistinguished veteran, Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  There is nothing more egregious than the desecration of our Nation's \nveterans' cemeteries. These men and women gave their lives to defend \nthe United States and freedom throughout the world. This act will \npropose a penalty for theft or destruction of any property of a \nnational cemetery. This is a simple piece of legislation and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will give their full support to this critical \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Gorton, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 815. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax treatment for foreign investment through a United States regulated \ninvestment company comparable to the tax treatment for direct foreign \ninvestment and investment through a foreign mutual fund; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               the investment competitiveness act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, the U.S. mutual fund industry has become a \ndominant force in developing, marketing, and managing assets for \nAmerican investors. Since 1990, assets under management by U.S. mutual \nfunds have grown from $1 trillion to about $3.5 trillion today. Yet, \nwhile direct foreign investment in U.S. securities is strong, foreign \ninvestment in U.S. mutual funds has remained relatively flat.\n  Mr President, today I am introducing, along with Senators Gorton and \nMurray, the Investment Competitiveness Act of 1997. This legislation, \nwhich I have had the honor of cosponsoring in each of the last three \nCongresses, would eliminate a major barrier to attracting foreign \ncapital into the United States while improving the competitiveness of \nthe U.S. mutual fund industry.\n  This legislation would remove a barrier to the sale and distribution \nof U.S. mutual funds outside the United States. The bill would change \nthe Internal Revenue Code to provide that foreign investors in U.S. \nmutual funds be accorded the same tax treatment as if they had made \ntheir investments directly in U.S. stocks or shares of a foreign mutual \nfund.\n  Under current law, most kinds of interest and short-term capital \ngains received directly by an investor outside the United States or \nreceived through a foreign mutual fund are not subject to the 30-\npercent withholding tax on investment income. However, interest and \nshort-term capital gain income received by a foreign investor through a \nU.S. mutual fund are subject to the withholding tax. This result occurs \nbecause current law characterizes interest income as short-term capital \ngain distributed by a U.S. mutual fund to a foreign investor as a \ndividend subject to withholding.\n  The Investment Competitiveness Act would correct this inequity and \nput U.S. mutual funds on a competitive footing with foreign funds. The \nbill would correctly permit interest income and short-term capital gain \nto retain their character upon distribution.\n  Current law acts as a prohibitive export tax on foreign investors who \nchoose to invest in U.S. funds. That is why the amount of foreign \ninvestment in U.S. mutual funds is small.\n  Mr President, it is time to dismantle the unfair and unwanted tax \nbarrier to foreign investment in U.S. mutual funds. The American \neconomy will benefit from exporting U.S. mutual funds, creating an \nadditional inflow of investment into U.S. securities markets without a \ndilution of U.S. control of American business that occurs through \ndirect foreign investment in U.S. companies. Moreover, the legislation \nwill support job creation among ancillary fund service providers \nlocated in the United States, rather than in offshore service \nfacilities.\n  Mr President, I very much appreciate the efforts of Senators Gorton \nand Murray in cosponsoring this legislation and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 816. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a \nnational standard in accordance with which nonresidents of a State may \ncarry certain concealed firearms in the State, and to exempt qualified \ncurrent and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting \nthe carrying of concealed handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE PERSONAL SAFETY AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Personal Safety and \nCommunity Protection Act.\n  In recent years, a movement has swept the Nation to enable \nindividuals to carry concealed firearms for their protection. Forty-two \nof the fifty States have some right-to-carry permit mechanism in place, \nand they are finding these laws make a significant impact on crime.\n  The benefits of right-to-carry laws were verified by a landmark study \nreleased late last year. Following a comprehensive analysis of annual \nFBI crime statistics from all the Nation's counties, over 15 years, the \nauthors concluded:\n\n       [a]llowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters \n     violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase in \n     accidental death or suicides. If those states who did not \n     have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them \n     in 1992, approximately 1,800 murders and over 3,000 rapes \n     would have been avoided yearly . . .\n\n  The primary author of the study, John R. Lott Jr. of the University \nof Chicago Law School, has pointed out that the benefits of concealed-\ncarry laws are not limited to those who carry the weapons but extend to \ntheir fellow citizens, as well. The drop in crime is not necessarily \nthe result of using firearms in self-defense, but of criminals changing \ntheir behavior to avoid coming into direct contact with a person who \nmight have a gun--which in a concealed-carry State could extend to a \nwide cross-section of the public.\n  The legislation I am introducing today builds on the experience of \nthe States. It is designed to protect the rights of citizens no matter \nwhere they may travel in the United States, and to enhance the \nprotection of our communities.\n  This bill applies to any person holding a valid concealed firearm \ncarrying permit or license issued by a State, and who is not prohibited \nfrom carrying a firearm under Federal law.\n  In States that issue concealed carry permits, the individual would be \nable to carry a concealed firearm in accordance with State laws. In \nStates that do not have right-to-carry laws, the bill sets a \nreasonable, bright-line Federal standard that would permit carrying \nexcept in certain designated places, such as police stations; \ncourthouses; public polling places; meetings of State, county, or \nmunicipal governing bodies; schools; passenger areas of airports.\n  The second part of the bill provides an exemption for certain \nqualified current and former law enforcement officers, who bear valid \nwritten identification of their status, from laws prohibiting the \ncarrying of concealed firearms. The bill does not override any existing \ntraining requirements or restrictions on gun ownership or use by \ncurrent or former law enforcement officers. The individuals covered by \nthis section of the bill have proven records of responsible, lawful gun \nuse in defense of their fellow citizens and communities.\n  Again, Mr. President, this portion of the bill takes a practical, \nexperience-based approach to self defense and community protection.\n  I'm pleased to note that my bill is a companion to H.R. 339, \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Cliff Stearns \nand cosponsored by more than 40 Members from nearly half the States.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us in protecting the rights of your \nconstituents and enhancing the protection of your communities by \nsupporting the Personal Safety and Community Protection Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\n                                 S. 816\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the economic conditions and supply of \nhousing in native American communities by creating the Native American \nFinancial Services Organization, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n    the native american financial services organization Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Native American \nFinancial Services Organization Act of 1996 [NAFSO]. This bill, based \non a similar measure I introduced in the last Congress, seeks to \nprovide new opportunity and hope for native American families by \naddressing the serious lack of private capital on Indian reservations.\n  Having access to banking services is more than just a convenience. It \nmeans being able to get a loan to fix a leaky roof. It means getting \nthe money to buy computers to start a small business. It means having \nenough money to send your son or daughter to college. It means buying \nyour own home.\n  Too often, these dreams never become a reality for Indian families. \nMany opportunities and services most of America takes for granted are \nnot available in Indian country. Native Americans can't simply walk \ninto a local bank to open a checking account or get a loan for a new \nhouse because for the most part, these institutions are nowhere near \nIndian reservations.\n  NAFSO is not about new Government programs or bureaucracy. NAFSO is \nabout supporting private banks that will not only provide basic \nservices, but take the time to educate people, to bring them into the \nmainstream of financial services and give them a chance to build a home \nor start a business.\n  NAFSO gives native Americans the same kind of access to banking \nservices that other Americans enjoy. By eliminating provisions dealing \nwith the secondary mortgage market, this version of NAFSO allows the \norganization to focus where the rubber meets the road. Working in \nconjunction with the community development financial institutions fund, \nNAFSO's primary role is to expand the availability of basic banking \nservices through the creation and support of Native American Financial \nInstitutions [NAFI's]. This provides the services that families need \nthe most--checking accounts, mortgages, and other basic banking \nservices.\n  NAFSO will also play a crucial role in assisting NAFI's by providing \nthem with much-needed technical assistance and developing specialized \nassistance to overcome barriers to lending on reservations. The \norganization will also work with the secondary market and other \nimportant financial mechanisms to identify barriers to private lending \nand make recommendations about how banks, Tribes, and government can do \nmore to help this process.\n  NAFSO does more than support new lending institutions or existing \nIndian-oriented banks and begins to address the historical barriers to \nprivate banking in Indian country. The trust status of reservation land \nand the inability to transfer title are serious concerns of bankers \nthat need to be overcome and understood. Equally as challenging is the \nneed to overcome stereotypes about Indian families and their social or \neconomic condition. Often, banks decide Indians are not a good credit \nrisk without ever having gone to the reservation.\n  By providing information and interested in becoming more involved in \nIndian country, NAFSO can foster a new understanding of the real \nchallenges we face. It can eliminate some of these misconceptions and \nmyths and bring the private market and Indian communities together in \nways never thought possible before.\n  I had hoped that we would be assisted in this process by a report by \nthe community development financial institutions fund at the Department \nof Treasury on Indian banking issues. Regrettably, work on that report, \nwhich was\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\ndue almost 9 months ago, has not yet begun. Nevertheless, I feel that \nwe should not delay our work. We need to concentrate now on finding \nreal solutions to the economic, social and cultural challenges facing \ntribes and native American families.\n  Mr. President, most people agree that Government cannot be the \nsolution to all of this great Nation's problems. We can fix the \nGovernment programs, we can make them more efficient, but now we need \nto get the private sector involved in the challenges facing Indian \ncountry. The road to economic independence for all native American \ncommunities is a long one, but this bill is a big step in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 818\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n     Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n     United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) Congress has carried the responsibility of the United \n     States for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes \n     and the resources of Indian tribes through the endorsement of \n     treaties, and the enactment of other laws, including laws \n     that provide for the exercise of administrative authorities;\n       (3) despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians suffer \n     rates of unemployment, poverty, poor health, substandard \n     housing, and associated social ills to a greater degree than \n     any other group in the United States;\n       (4) the economic success and material well-being of \n     American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian \n     communities depends on the combined efforts of the Federal \n     Government, tribal governments, the private sector, and \n     individuals;\n       (5) the lack of employment opportunities and affordable \n     homes in the communities referred to in paragraph (4) is \n     grounded in the almost complete absence of available private \n     capital and private capital institutions to serve those \n     communities;\n       (6) the lack of capital referred to in paragraph (5) has \n     resulted in a multigenerational dependence on Federal \n     assistance that is--\n       (A) insufficient to address the magnitude of needs; and\n       (B) unreliable in availability;\n       (7) a review of the history of the United States bears out \n     the fact that solutions to social and economic problems that \n     have been crafted by the Federal Government without the \n     active involvement of local communities and the private \n     sector fail at unacceptably high rates; and\n       (8) the twin goals of economic self-sufficiency and \n     political self-determination for American Indians, Alaska \n     Natives, and Native Hawaiians can best be served by making \n     available to address the challenges faced by those groups--\n       (A) the resources of the private market;\n       (B) adequate capital; and\n       (C) technical expertise.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Based upon the findings and \n     recommendations of the Commission on American Indian, Alaska \n     Native and Native Hawaiian Housing established by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of \n     1989, Congress has determined that--\n       (1) housing shortages and deplorable living conditions are \n     at crisis proportions in Native American communities \n     throughout the United States; and\n       (2) the lack of private capital to finance housing and \n     economic development for Native Americans and Native American \n     communities seriously exacerbates these housing shortages and \n     poor living conditions.\n       (b) Policy of the United States To Address Native American \n     Housing Shortage.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     improve the economic conditions and supply of housing in \n     Native American communities throughout the United States by \n     creating the Native American Financial Services Organization \n     to address the housing shortages and poor living conditions \n     described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to help serve the mortgage and other lending needs of \n     Native Americans by assisting in the establishment and \n     organization of Native American Financial Institutions, \n     developing and providing financial expertise and technical \n     assistance to Native American Financial Institutions, \n     including assistance concerning overcoming--\n       (A) barriers to lending with respect to Native American \n     lands; and\n       (B) the past and present impact of discrimination;\n       (2) to promote access to mortgage credit in Native American \n     communities in the United States by increasing the liquidity \n     of financing for housing and improving the distribution of \n     investment capital available for such financing, primarily \n     through Native American Financial Institutions; and\n       (3) to promote the infusion of public capital into Native \n     American communities throughout the United States and to \n     direct sources of public and private capital into housing and \n     economic development for Native American individuals and \n     families, primarily through Native American Financial \n     Institutions.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Con. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania are undergoing a historic process of democratic and \n     free market transformation after emerging from decades of \n     brutal Soviet occupation;\n       Whereas each of the Baltic countries has conducted peaceful \n     transfers of political power since 1991;\n       Whereas the governments of the Baltic countries have been \n     exemplary in their respect for human rights and civil \n     liberties and have made great strides toward establishing the \n     rule of law;\n       Whereas the governments of the Baltic countries have made \n     consistent progress toward establishing civilian control of \n     their military forces and, through active participation in \n     the Partnership for Peace and the peace support operations of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (in this resolution \n     referred to as ``NATO''), have clearly demonstrated their \n     ability and willingness to operate with the forces of NATO \n     nations and under NATO standards;\n       Whereas each of the Baltic countries has made progress \n     toward implementing a free market system which has and will \n     continue to foster the economic advancement of the people of \n     the Baltic region;\n       Whereas the Baltic region has often been a battleground for \n     the competing territorial designs of nearby imperial powers \n     which, along with other factors, has contributed to a history \n     of insecurity and instability in the region;\n       Whereas NATO has been a force for stability, freedom, and \n     peace in Europe since 1949;\n       Whereas NATO has indicated it will begin to invite new \n     members in 1997; and\n       Whereas Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, exercising their \n     inherent right as participating states in the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe, have voluntarily \n     applied for membership in NATO: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are to be commended for \n     their progress toward political and economic liberty and \n     meeting the guidelines for prospective NATO members set out \n     in chapter 5 of the September 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement;\n       (2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania would make an \n     outstanding contribution to NATO if they become members;\n       (3) eventual extension of full NATO membership to Estonia, \n     Latvia, and Lithuania would make a singular and lasting \n     contribution toward stability, freedom, and peace in the \n     Baltic region;\n       (4) upon satisfying the criteria for NATO membership, \n     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to become \n     full members of NATO at the earliest possible date; and\n       (5) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to \n     attend the NATO summit in Madrid on July 8 and 9, 1997.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lie on the \nnorthwestern border of Russia. These three tiny Baltic nations have \nhistorically served as a crossroads as bargaining chips between great \npowers. As a result, they have been invaded and dominated by foreign \ncountries throughout\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\ntheir history. The Baltics were occupied and oppressed by the Soviet \nUnion during all of the cold war, but are now on a quick path to full \ndemocracy and free market economies.\n  As we meet in Madrid this July with our NATO partners to discuss \nexpansion of the alliance, we should also consider extending an \ninvitation to our friends in the Baltics. Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania have all made significant progress toward the NATO \nrequirements of irreversible democracy, free market economies, and \ncivilian-controlled militaries. They have participated in NATO's \nPartnership for Peace initiative by supplying troops to NATO \npeacekeeping efforts. The Baltic nations have requested, and deserve, \nconsideration for full NATO membership. That is why I am introducing \nlegislation today recommending the integration of Estonia, Lativa, and \nLithuania into NATO at the earliest possible date.\n  Having traveled to Estonia recently, I have a very personal interest \nin its entry into NATO. Estonia is a beautiful nation on the Baltic \nSea, inhabited by brave men and women dedicated to democracy and \nfreedom from foreign domination. The people of Estonia have been under \nforeign rule throughout almost their entire history. They were ruled by \nGermans in the 13th century, Swedes in the 16th and 17th centuries, and \nby Tsarist Russia in the 19th century. Finally, after World War I, \nEstonia fought for independence for 2 years and won. The people of \nEstonia established a parliamentary democracy and their republic \nflourished for nearly two decades until the Soviet Union, and then Nazi \nGermany invaded during World War II. With the end of Soviet domination, \nEstonia and their Baltic neighbors look to the West for protection of \ntheir right to independence.\n  Unfortunately, the subject of NATO expansion to Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania has become taboo. Many in the U.S. national security \ncommunity believe the Baltics, lying so close to Russia and within the \narea Yaltsin considers to be Russia's sphere of influence, should not \nbe considered for NATO membership. In fact, in February, Russian \nPresident Boris Yeltsin stated that Baltic membership in NATO would \nhave an ``extremely negative impact'' on stability in the region and \nthat the preservation of the Baltic nations' status outside blocs could \ndispel ``still lingering fears for their security.'' We should not \nallow these threatening comments to influence our efforts to expand \nNATO.\n  Out of fear of isolating Russia, the United States and our European \nallies may forsake three tiny nations that did so much to promote the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the eradication of communism \nthroughout Eastern Europe.\n  Cold war history is replete with tragedy. The expansion of the Soviet \nUnion across Eastern Europe is one of history's darkest moments. \nEstonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all independent nations since 1918, \nfell victim to secret negotiations between Hitler and Stalin during \nWorld War II. Under the auspices of the Molotove-Ribbentrop Pact of \n1939, the Soviet Union laid claim to the Baltics, invaded, and ruled \nthem with an iron fist from 1945 until 1991. Now it is time for NATO to \ntake decisive action to rectify the past and protect the nations of \nEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from any future foreign \nirredentism.\n  Future NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is \nessential to their safety and prosperity. Democracy and economic reform \nand expansion may be at risk to security if the Baltics continue to \nexist, unprotected, in the shadow of an increasingly nationalistic \nRussia. The United States must ensure that the Baltic nations are \ninvited to the NATO summit in Madrid and must work toward eventual \nmembership in our security alliance for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and thank Senators \nD'Amato and Durbin for joining me as a original cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5138-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 30--RELATIVE TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON \n                                 TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 30\n\n       Whereas the Republic of China on Taiwan (hereafter referred \n     to as ``Taiwan'') possesses a free economy with the 19th \n     largest gross domestic product in the world;\n       Whereas Taiwan has the 14th largest trading economy in the \n     world and the 7th largest amount of foreign investment in the \n     world and holds one of the largest amounts of foreign \n     exchange reserves in the world;\n       Whereas Taiwan is a democracy committed to the economic and \n     political norms of the international community;\n       Whereas the purpose of the International Monetary Fund \n     (hereafter referred to as ``IMF'') is to promote exchange \n     stability, to establish a multilateral system of payments, to \n     facilitate the expansion of world trade, and to provide \n     capital to assist developing nations;\n       Whereas the membership of Taiwan in the IMF would benefit \n     the world economy, especially those developing countries in \n     need of capital, and would contribute to the purposes of the \n     IMF;\n       Whereas the IMF aims to further economic liberalization and \n     globalization and conducts conferences, exchanges, and \n     training programs in international monetary management which \n     would be beneficial to Taiwan;\n       Whereas the IMF aims to further worldwide economic \n     relationships and is not a political entity, as evidenced by \n     the fact that Taiwan remained a member of the IMF from 1972 \n     until 1980 after it had been forced to give up its membership \n     in the United Nations; and\n       Whereas membership in the IMF is a prerequisite for \n     accession to the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development and to regional banks in which the membership of \n     Taiwan would be beneficial and fully justified: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Senate (the House of \n     Representatives concurring) that it should be United States \n     policy to support--\n       (1) the admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan \n     (hereafter referred to as ``Taiwan'') to membership in the \n     International Monetary Fund;\n       (2) the admission of Taiwan to membership in the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and\n       (3) the admission of Taiwan to membership in all \n     appropriate regional multilateral economic institutions.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I are submitting \ntoday a Senate concurrent resolution in support of Taiwan's admission \nto the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n  There is simply no reason that Taiwan should be excluded from these \nmultilateral economic institutions. Taiwan has one of the largest \ntrading economies in the world. In fact, in the time it took me to \ndraft this concurrent resolution, Taiwan went from the 20th largest \ngross domestic product, to the 19th largest.\n  Moreover, Taiwan is a democracy and a responsible member of the \ninternational community. This is more than one can say about many other \nnations who are currently members of these multilateral institutions.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this resolution is straightforward. It \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that Taiwan deserves to belong to \nthese organizations. This resolution is not directed against any other \nnation. It simply puts the Senate on record in favor of justice for \nTaiwan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5139-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5139-S5140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 90--AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING OF A PUBLICATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Cleland) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, today I rise to submit a resolution \nestablishing July 2 of this year and the next as National Literacy Day.\n  Mr. President, the ability to read is something most of us often take \nfor granted. For most of us, it is difficult to imagine not being able \nto read a menu, street sign, magazine or phone book. But for many of \nour citizens, these seemingly simple activities are impossible. This is \nso because they are illiterate. I am submitting this resolution to draw \nattention to the issue of illiteracy by establishing July 2, 1997 and \nthe following year as National Literacy Day. I hope my colleagues will \ncosponsor this resolution.\n  All of us should be more aware of the problem of illiteracy. A recent \nstudy found that over 44 million adults cannot read. An additional 35 \nmillion read below the level needed to function successfully in \nsociety. These numbers alone are alarming and warrant our special \nattention. But even more disturbing are the personal hardships people \nmust face each day due to their inability to read. The embarrassment \nparents face when they cannot read to their children. The \ndiscouragement able workers feel when they cannot fill out a basic job \napplication. The disappointment we all endure as the ranks of the \nilliterate grow annually by over 2 million adults.\n  Mr. President, the 18th Century writer, Joseph Addison, once wrote \n``Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.'' I could not \nagree more. Reading enriches our lives in countless ways. But there are \nfar too many of our citizens who cannot read the instructions on a \ndoctor's prescription bottle, let alone share the experience of reading \none of Addison's great poems. This needs to change.\n  Therefore, we must focus our attention on the problem of illiteracy. \nAll of us should make sure we do our part to ensure that citizens who \nneed help know where services are available. We need to recognize the \ndetrimental effects illiteracy has on our society. Most important, more \nof us need to enlist in the battle to close the book on illiteracy.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I am submitting a resolution to \ndesignate July 2, 1997 and July, 2, 1998 as National Literacy Day. I \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5140-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5140-S5141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 93--RELATIVE TO NATIONAL FAMILY WEEK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to The \nAmerican Medical Association [AMA] and to submit a resolution to \ncommemorate its 150th Anniversary.\n  The American Medical Association was founded by Nathan Smith Davis, \nM.D., in 1847 when he was 30-years-old. At that time, the field of \nmedicine was still based on apprenticeship programs and very little \neducation was required to become a physician. Nathan Davis recognized \nthe need to establish a code of educational principles to elevate the \nstandard of medicine by eliminating quackery and other nonscientific \nforms of medicine. Through standardized medical education, students \ntrained in the field of medicine now have unified course work and \ntraining. The accreditation process also guides curriculum development \nin order to ensure that core ethical values and beliefs are instilled \nin the physicians of the future.\n  Today, the American Medical Association continues to hold high its \nstandards and remains dedicated to maintaining the sanctity of the \npatient-physician relationship, upholding the ethical standards within \nthe medical profession that lead to a better, stronger, house of \nmedicine.\n  Mr. President, the American Medical Association's contribution to the \nhealth of our country has been a fixture of American culture. Indeed, \neven their symbol has long served as a sign of high quality health care \nmaterials. We have come to expect quality in every endeavor from the \nAmerican Medical Association as they have built a 150-year reputation \nof caring for our country.\n  For example, the American Medical Association's Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association [JAMA] has long contributed to the \npositive reputation of the association through the distribution of peer \nreviewed health information. Another example of caring for our country, \nJAMA, founded in 1880, expanded the dissemination of scientific data \nand health policy information among physicians and other health \nprofessionals. JAMA serves as a respected voice in the areas of \nclinical science and disease prevention. In addition, JAMA has \ncontributed a great deal to the area of public health, an area in which \nthe AMA continues to be vitally involved, as it strives to prepare \npatients and physicians for the 21st century by promoting the science \nand art of medicine.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the American Medical \nAssociation on its 150th anniversary and all its accomplishments and I \nencourage the AMA to continue caring for our country into the next \nmillennium.\n  On a personal note, I wish to acknowledge the lifelong contribution \nof my late father, Dr. John W.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nsacrifices made by the millions of men and women who have served in the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  While Members of this body have perhaps thousands of constituent \nservice men and women on the rolls from their State, men and women who \nhave served and are serving be they active duty, Reserve, National \nGuard, or retired, I want to draw special attention to one story in \nparticular, an uncommon story of valor and courage, that is truly \nrepresentative of the thousands of veterans in Alabama and all over \nthese United States.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak today about the supreme sacrifice many \nAmericans made for our country as prisoners of war. Mr. Hubert Davis, \nof Tuscaloosa, AL, is one such hero. As a B-17 fighter tail gunner in \nWorld War II, Mr. Davis' plane was hit while approaching a bombing \ntarget over Schweinfurt, Germany, on April 13, 1944. After his B-17 \nbecame engulfed in flames, Mr. Davis struggled with an awkward British \nparachute as the plane capsized, like a ship caught in a terrible storm \nat sea and crashed to the ground. Mr. Davis barely managed to escape \nfrom the B-17 and immediately pulled his ripcord. He parachuted to the \nground and was captured by the German forces. As the D-day invasion was \nstill some weeks away there was no hope of escaping to Allied lines in \nEurope. During his prison experience, Mr. Davis was subsequently moved \nfrom prison camp to prison camp while suffering from injuries sustained \nin the rough parachute landing. He was subjected to interrogations in \nwhich life and limb was threatened--all for our freedom.\n  Mr. Davis' family received a telegram notifying them that their son \nwas lost-in-action and a second telegram 10 days later announcing that \nhe was killed-in-action. Eventually, however, Mr. Davis was liberated \nby the 13th Armored Division of Patton's 3d Army and now resides in \nTuscaloosa, AL.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Davis was prepared to pay the ultimate price for \nhis country. While I have highlighted the odyssey of one tailgunner, \nand one ex-POW from World War II, Mr. Davis is emblematic of the \nthousands of men and women who dedicated the very fabric of their being \nfor the greatest democracy known to history. From the Revolutionary War \nto the Persian Gulf, we have been blessed by an exemplary group of \npatriots who have served their country admirably and with distinction. \nSince our country has enjoyed many years of relative peace as a result \nof the heroic efforts of men and women like Hubert Davis, I hope his \nstory reminds each of us of the trials and tribulations our forebears \nhave endured to preserve the precious freedom we all so deeply enjoy \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, to further recognize the valor of our many veterans, I \nask to have printed in the Record along with my brief remarks Gen. \nDouglas\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nMacArthur's farewell speech to the cadets at West Point, May 12, 1962. \nSince its delivery, this speech has been known as MacArthur's ``Duty, \nHonor, Country Speech.'' It is plain spoken and on the day when we \nreflect on those who have given so much, it serves to remind us all \nwhat it means to be an American. God bless the United States.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   Gen. Douglas MacArthur: Duty, Honor, Country; May 12, 1962, U.S. \n                    Military Academy, West Point, NY\n\n       No human being could fail to be deeply moved by such a \n     tribute as this [Thayer Award], coming from a profession I \n     have served so long and a people I have loved so well. It \n     fills me with an emotion I cannot express. But this award is \n     not intended primarily to honor a personality, but to \n     symbolize a great moral code--a code of conduct and chivalry \n     of those who guard this beloved land of culture and ancient \n     descent. For all hours and for all time, it is an expression \n     of the ethics of the American soldier. That I should be \n     integrated in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense \n     of pride, and yet of humility, which will be with me always.\n       ``Duty,'' ``honor'', ``country''--those three hallowed \n     words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can \n     be, what you will be. They are your rallying point to build \n     courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when \n     there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when \n     hope becomes forlorn.\n       Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of diction, \n     that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor \n     to tell you all that they mean.\n       The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, \n     but a flamboyant phrase. Every pedant, every demagogue, every \n     cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and, I am sorry \n     to say, some others of an entirely different character, will \n     try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and \n     ridicule.\n       But these are some of the things they do. They build your \n     basic character. They mold you for your future roles as the \n     custodians of the Nation's defense. They make you strong \n     enough to know when you are weak, and brave enough to face \n     yourself when you are afraid.\n\n\n                          What the Words Teach\n\n       They teach you to be proud and unbending in honest failure, \n     but humble and gentle in success; not to substitute words for \n     actions, not to seek the path of comfort, but to face the \n     stress and spur of0difficulty and challenge; to learn to \n     stand up in the storm, but to have compassion on those who \n     fall; to master yourself before you seek to master others; to \n     have a heart that is clean, a goal that is high; to learn to \n     laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the \n     future, yet never neglect the past; to be serious, yet never \n     to take yourself too seriously; to be modest so that you will \n     remember the simplicity of true greatness, the open mind of \n     true wisdom, the meekness of true strength.\n       They give you a temperate will, a quality of the \n     imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a freshness of the deep \n     springs of life, a temperamental predominance of courage over \n     timidity, of an appetite for adventure over love of ease.\n       They create in you heart the sense of wonder, the unfailing \n     hope of what next, and joy and inspiration of life. They \n     teach you in this way to be an officer and a gentleman.\n       And what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead? Are \n     they reliable? Are they brave? Are they capable of victory?\n       Their story is known to all of you. It is the story of the \n     American man-at-arms. My estimate of him was formed on the \n     battlefield many, many years ago, and has never changed. \n     I regarded him then, as I regard him now, as one of the \n     world's noblest figures; not only as one of the finest \n     military characters, but also as one of the most \n     stainless.\n       His name and fame are the birthright of every American \n     citizen. In his youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he \n     gave all that mortality can give. He needs no eulogy from me; \n     or from any other man. He has written his own history and \n     written it in red on his enemy's breast.\n       But when I think of his patience in adversity of his \n     courage under fire and of his modesty in victory, I am filled \n     with an emotion of admiration I cannot put into words. He \n     belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples \n     of successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the \n     instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty \n     and freedom. He belongs to the present, to us, by his virtues \n     and by his achievements.\n\n\n                        witness to the fortitude\n\n       In 20 campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a \n     thousand camp fires, I have witnessed that enduring \n     fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that \n     invincible determination which have carved his statue in the \n     hearts of his people.\n       From one end of the world to the other, he has drained deep \n     the chalice of courage. As I listened to those songs [of the \n     glee club], in memory's eye I could see those staggering \n     columns of the first World War, bending under soggy packs on \n     many a weary match, from dripping dusk to drizzling dawn, \n     slogging ankle deep through the mire of shell-pocked roads to \n     form grimly for the attack, blue-lipped, covered with sludge \n     and mud, chilled by the wind and rain, driving home to their \n     objective, and for many to the judgment seat of God.\n       I do not know the dignity of their birth, but I do know the \n     glory of their death. They died, unquestioning, \n     uncomplaining, with faith in their hearts, and on their lips \n     the hope that we would go on to victory.\n       Always for them: Duty, honor, country. Always their blood, \n     and sweat, and tears, as we sought the way and the light and \n     the truth. And 20 years after, on the other side of the \n     globe, again the filth of murky foxholes, the stench of \n     ghostly trenches, the slime of dripping dugouts, those \n     boiling suns of relentless heat, those torrential rains of \n     devastating storms, the loneliness and utter desolation of \n     jungle trails, the bitterness of long separation from those \n     they loved and cherished, the deadly pestilence of tropical \n     disease, the horror of stricken areas of war.\n\n\n                         swift and sure attack\n\n       Their resolute and determined defense, their swift and sure \n     attack, their indomitable purpose, their complete and \n     decisive victory--always through the bloody haze of their \n     last reverberating shot, the vision of gaunt, ghastly men, \n     reverently following your password of duty, honor, country.\n       The code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest \n     moral law and will stand the test of any ethics or \n     philosophies ever promulgated for the things that are right \n     and its restraints are from the things that are wrong. The \n     soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the \n     greatest act of religious training--sacrifice. In battle, and \n     in the face of danger and death, he discloses those divine \n     attributes which his Maker gave when He created man in His \n     own image. No physical courage and no greater strength can \n     take the place of the divine help which alone can sustain \n     him. However hard the incidents of war may be, the soldier \n     who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his \n     country is the noblest development of mankind.\n       You now face a new world, a world of change. the thrust \n     into outer space of the satellite, spheres, and missiles \n     marks a beginning of another epoch in the long story of \n     mankind. In the five or more billions of years the scientists \n     tell us it has taken to form the earth, in the three or more \n     billion years of development of the human race, there has \n     never been a more abrupt or staggering evolution.\n       We deal now, not with things of this world alone, but with \n     illimitable distances and as yet unfathomed mysteries of the \n     universe. We are reaching out for a new and boundless \n     frontier. We speak in strange terms of harnessing the cosmic \n     energy, of making winds and tides work for us, of creating \n     unheard of synthetic materials to supplement or even replace \n     our old standard basics; to purify sea water for our drink; \n     of mining ocean floors for new fields of wealth and food; of \n     disease preventatives to expand life into the hundreds of \n     years; of controlling the weather for a more equitable \n     distribution of heat and cold, of rain and shine; of \n     spaceships to the moon; of the primary target in war, no \n     longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy, but instead \n     to include his civil populations; of ultimate conflict \n     between a united human race and the sinister forces of some \n     other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to \n     make life the most exciting of all times.\n       And through all this welter of change and development your \n     mission remains fixed, determined, inviolable. It is to win \n     our wars. Everything else in your professional career is but \n     corollary to this vital dedication. All other public \n     purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, \n     great or small, will find others for their accomplishments; \n     but you are the ones who are trained to fight.\n\n\n                         the profession of arms\n\n       Yours is the profession of arms, the will to win, the sure \n     knowledge that in war there is no substitute for victory, \n     that if you lose, the Nation will be destroyed, that the very \n     obsession of your public service must be duty, honor, \n     country.\n       Others will debate the controversial issues, national and \n     international, which divide men's minds. But serene, calm, \n     aloof, you stand as the Nation's war guardian, as its \n     lifeguard from the raging tides of international conflict, as \n     its gladiator in the arena of battle. For a century and a \n     half you have defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed \n     traditions of liberty and freedom, of right and justice.\n       Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our \n     processes of government: Whether our strength is being sapped \n     by deficit financing indulged in too long, by Federal \n     paternalism grown too mighty, by power groups grown too \n     arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown too \n     rampant, by morals grown too low, by taxes grown too high, by \n     extremists grown too violent; whether our personal liberties \n     are as thorough and complete as they should be.\n       These great national problems are not for your professional \n     participation or military solution. Your guidepost stands out \n     like a ten-fold beacon in the night: Duty, honor, country.\n       You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric \n     of our national system of defense. From your ranks come the \n     great captains who hold the Nation's destiny in their hands \n     the moment the war tocsin sounds.\n       The long, gray line has never failed us. Were you to do so, \n     a million ghosts in olive\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\n     drab, in brown khaki, in blue and gray, would rise from their \n     white crosses, thundering those magic words: Duty, honor, \n     country.\n\n\n                            Prays for Peace\n\n       This does not mean that you are warmongers. On the \n     contrary, the soldier above all other people prays for peace, \n     for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of \n     war. But always in our ears ring the ominous words of Plato, \n     that wisest of all philosophers: ``Only the dead have seen \n     the end of war.''\n       The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. \n     My days of old have vanished--tone and tint. They have gone \n     glimmering through the dreams of things that were. Their \n     memory is one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears and coaxed \n     and caressed by the smiles of yesterday. I listen vainly, but \n     with thirsty ear, for the witching melody of faint bugles \n     blowing reveille, of far drums beating the long roll.\n       In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of \n     musketry, the strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield. \n     But in the evening of my memory always I come back to West \n     Point. Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty, honor, \n     country.\n       Today marks my final roll call with you. But I want you to \n     know that when I cross the river, my last conscious thoughts \n     will be of the corps, and the corps, and the corps.\n       I bid you farewell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5142-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Memorial Day is a time for Americans \nto stop and think about those who have given their lives for our \nNation's freedom.\n  This week, the Senate passed a resolution commemorating the 15th \nAnniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial. I was proud to be included as an original cosponsor of this \nimportant resolution. The resolution encourages Americans to remember \nthe sacrifices of our Nation's veterans and extends the Senate's \nsympathies to those who suffered the loss of family and friends in \nVietnam. Since its dedication 15 years ago, the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial has been a sanctuary where survivors and families have \nmourned, where soldiers have reflected on the past, and where youth \nhave explored our history.\n  Memorial Day serves as a strong reminder of the effects of war. The \nVietnam Veterans Memorial contains the names of more than 58,000 men \nand women who lost their lives from 1957 to 1975 in the Vietnam combat \narea or who are still missing in action. No person is able to walk \nalong the wall without being moved by its simple message of loss.\n  Of the many names which mark ``the wall,'' 2,660 are from Michigan. \nOne Michigan Vietnam veteran whose name is on the wall is Capt. James \nL. Huard of Dearborn, MI. Captain Huard disappeared on July 12, 1972 \nwhile flying his F-4 Phantom over North Vietnam. For nearly 25 years, \nCaptain Huard was missing-in-action. In 1988, the Vietnamese government \nturned over what were believed to be the remains of a number of United \nStates servicemen. After many years of forensics work, Huard's remains \nwere identified and returned to his family on January 29, 1997. On May \n1, Capt. James L. Huard was given an official burial at Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  In 1989, the Dearborn City Council passed a resolution which ordered \nthe POW/MIA flag to fly above City Hall until ``Huard is returned \nhome.'' On Memorial Day, the flag will be lowered as a final most \nappropriate and moving tribute to Captain Huard.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Capt. James L. Huard \nand the many men and women who have given their lives in the service of \nour Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5144-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO DAVID CARTER FOR HIS SUCCESSFUL CLIMB TO THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT \n                                EVEREST\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments and draw attention to a remarkable example of a Federal \ninvestment in science and technology that is producing a return to the \nbenefit of society. In this case, it was the vision of an individual, \ncombined with technical knowledge derived from space research, which \nhas created an exciting new industry. Back in 1984, the inventor's idea \nwas to design a robot that could be used in hospitals and eventually \nhomes. Today, robots manufactured by HelpMate Robotics, Inc., of \nDanbury, CT, roam hospital hallways, delivering medications, meals, x-\nrays and patients' records. Handling these errands allows orderlies and \nnurses more time to concentrate on patient care.\n  Central to the story of the hospital robots is the 72-year-old \nfounder of HelpMate Robotics, Dr. Joseph Engelberger. Dr. Engelberger \nis widely acknowledged as the father of the industrial robot, an idea \nhe had much more success selling to Japan's auto industry than in \nAmerica. As a consequence, Japan grew to dominate the world robotic \nmarket and this was one of the factors that for many years enabled it \nto retain a competitive advantage over American automakers. Not content \nwith having helped start one revolution, Engelberger founded HelpMate \nRobotics with the idea to use hospital robots as a step in the process \ntoward design of machines that would be useful in personal homes.\n  I am especially pleased to report that many of the achievements of \nDr. Engelberger and HelpMate Robotics were made possible through close \ncooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The \nnew technologies necessary in the design of a robot that is capable of \navoiding people in busy hospital hallways, summoning elevators, and \nrecognizing familiar territory, were derived from research already \nunderway at NASA. HelpMate has won several NASA SBIR [Small Business \nInnovative Research] awards, which were established to stimulate \nconversion of Government-funded R into commercial applications. \nTransfer of knowledge and expertise has also flowed from the company \nback to NASA. Late last year, the space agency awarded an SBIR grant to \nHelpMate for development of a prototype robot for terrestrial \nexperiments that anticipate space utilization of robotics. The space \nrobot will begin to pave the way for the next step in Dr. Engelberger's \ndream--a robot capable of helping the elderly stay at home by \nperforming the myriad number of tasks that become difficult later in \nlife. Also helpful in the commercialization of NASA technology was a \nunique program developed by the National Technology Transfer Center in \nWheeling, WV, and Unisphere Institute in Washington, DC.\n  The story of Dr. Engelberger and HelpMate Robotics is an example of \nthe way that a patient Federal investment in science and technology can \nlead to new products that employ Americans and make for a better \nquality of life. It is also the story of one man's creative genius and \nuntiring devotion in making a dream become reality. I salute Dr. \nEngelberger for his accomplishments with HelpMate and upon his receipt \nof the prestigious Japan Prize.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5144-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5144-S5145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO SIX GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nsix outstanding young women who are being presented with the Girl Scout \nGold Award by the Vermont Girl Scout Council. They are Melissa Jones \nand Tina Newell of Vergennes, Kathleen Lomedico of Colchester as well \nas Jennifer Tobin, Vincenza Tortolano, and Lori Brown of Rutland. They \nare being honored on May 29, 1997 for earning the highest achievement \naward in U.S. Girl Scouting.\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\n  The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in \nthe areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and \npersonal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14-17, or \nin grades 9-12. To receive the award, these Girl Scouts first earned \nfour interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior \nGirl Scout Leadership Award and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge as well \nas designing and implementing a Girl Scout Gold Award project to meet a \nspecial need in their communities.\n  As members of the Vermont Girl Scout Council, Melissa and Tina first \nearned badges in understanding yourself and others, child care, games, \ncreative writing, and reading. The girls then combined their efforts in \na project to combat illiteracy. They designed a series of three \nworkshops for young children about the magic of books which they put on \nat their local town library. The workshops featured a magician, hired \nwith money the girls raised themselves, magic tricks and crafts taught \nby the girls, and wonderful stories featuring magic. They attracted a \nlarge number of youngsters. The girls reported ``everything we did \ninterested and excited the children; they wanted to read more books and \nthey now know the library and are planning to come to their future \nchildren's programs''.\n  Jennifer and Vincenza put their efforts into making a special place \nfor some elderly members of their community. The girls designed and \nestablished a conversation garden to give nursing home residents and \ntheir guests access to sidewalks, shade, and beauty, putting in two \nsettees and planting bulbs and a flowering crabapple tree, all financed \nby the girls' sale of handmade cookbooks. To quote the nursing home \nadministrator, ``these two young people have earned the respect and \nappreciation of 125 nursing home residents and 160 employees of Eden \nPark''.\n  As a member of the Vermont Girl Scout Council, Lori first earned \nbadges in child care, reading, music, games, well being and \nunderstanding yourself and others. She then used these skills to design \nand implement a series of Lenten workshops for the younger children in \nher parish church. Kathleen earned badges in artistic crafts and \nexploration among others. After learning leadership skills through Girl \nScouting, she served as the editor of her high school yearbook. As her \nGirl Scout Gold Award project she spent the last year organizing and \nleading a youth group for teens which meets every other week and a \nyouth band which plays every Sunday for her church parish. Kathleen \nwanted the young people in her parish to ``feel a sense of home in the \nchurch.'' Both girls used the skills they learned in Girl Scouting to \nhelp the church of their faith.\n  These six Senior Girl Scouts have earned my respect and admiration. I \nbelieve all the girls should receive the public recognition due them \nfor such significant services to their communities and their \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5144-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDWARD P. SCOTT\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I rise \ntoday to note the impending retirement of Edward P. Scott, Assistant \nSecretary for Congressional Affairs with the Department of Veterans \nAffairs [VA]. Ed has served in this position since his confirmation by \nthe Senate in May 1993, after being nominated by President Clinton.\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have greatly \nappreciated Ed's successful efforts to maintain close relations with \nlegislators and keep Congress apprised of VA operations, programs, and \npolicies. During his tenure, VA confronted the impact of judicial \nreview on veterans' claims; addressed the health care, research, and \ncompensation needs of Persian Gulf veterans suffering from undiagnosed \nillnesses; and, in the face of unprecedented fiscal pressures, began \nthe most comprehensive restructuring of its health care and benefits \nadministrations in history. Ed has played a critical role in developing \nand implementing VA's response to each of these challenges, while \nkeeping Congress fully informed of, and involved in, major \ndevelopments.\n  Mr. President, prior to his administration appointment, Ed enjoyed a \nlong and varied career in public service. After graduating cum laude \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1963, where he was \nLaw Review editor, he clerked for New Jersey Supreme Court Associate \nJustice Nathan Jacobs. He then joined the Air Force for 3 years, \nworking as an assistant staff judge advocate at Keesler Air Force Base \nbefore retiring in the rank of captain. Soon after, he joined the Peace \nCorps, serving as deputy director and, later, country director, in \nKorea. Returning to the United States, he signed on as a staff attorney \nto the Mental Health Law Project in Washington, DC. In 1977, he joined \nthe staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, thus embarking on a long \nand distinguished career in the veterans arena. In the 16 years he was \nemployed on the committee staff, he alternately served as majority and \nminority general counsel and, ultimately, staff director and chief \ncounsel.\n  As a committee staffer, Ed was instrumental in creating the Vet \nCenter Program, enacting the Montgomery GI bill, elevating VA to \ncabinet rank, and establishing the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals. \nDuring the 102d Congress, one of the most productive legislative \nperiods in the committee's history, he helped revamp VA physician pay, \nimprove homeless veterans programs, create a fairer system of \ncompensation for survivors of disabled veterans, bring educational \nbenefits in line with inflation, heighten concern for minority \nveterans, and establish a program to help treat women who were sexually \nabused in the military. In addition, under the leadership of my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Daschle and Senator Rockefeller, \nrespectively, he helped resolve controversial matters relating to agent \norange exposure and VA drug pricing.\n  Mr. President, I should also note that Ed played an important role in \nimproving health care benefits and services for Hawaii's 120,000 \nveterans. Ed had an opportunity to visit Hawaii, gaining firsthand an \nappreciation of the unique needs of our multiethnic veterans population \nas well as of the special problems that confront the community as a \nconsequence of Hawaii's insular geography and isolation from the \nmainland. He materially supported the Hawaii Delegation's efforts, \ninitiated by my late predecessor, Senator Spark Matsunaga, to establish \na VA medical center on Oahu; triple the size of the Honolulu VA \noutpatient clinic; and, establish vet centers, primary care clinics, \nand a residential post-traumatic stress disorder treatment center in \nthe neighbor islands.\n  Mr. President, however extensive Ed's achievements, what is most \nremarkable about this good man is the grace and sense of balance he has \nbrought to public service. In dealing with many different organizations \nand personalities, each with a separate agenda, often on extremely \ncontentious issues, he brought calm to rough waters and comfort to \nbruised egos. His willingness to consider every side to an issue, his \nability to rise above partisan and personal concerns, truly elevated \nthe level of debate on veterans issues. By his example, he constantly \nreminded us of our primary obligation, which is to promote the welfare \nof veterans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. Ed's departure from public service is a \nloss to all who care about good government. I offer him and his wife, \nJane, my best wishes as they embark on a new, and I hope rewarding, \nphase of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5145-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5145-S5146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL STROKE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few \nminutes to discuss National Stroke Awareness Month.\n  Every year in our country, approximately 28 out of every 100,000 \npeople will suffer from a stroke. In fact, the third leading cause of \ndeath in the United States is a stroke. However, advances in medical \ntechnology and better control of high blood pressure have greatly \nreduced the number of strokes per year.\n  The number of strokes can be reduced even further if just a few \npreventive steps are taken. Periodic medical checkups and being on the \nlook out for warning signs like high blood pressure, heart disease, \nage, and heredity are several basic ones.\n  A stroke occurs when blood vessels carrying oxygen and nutrients to \nthe brain either become clogged or burst.\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\n The result is that the brain does not receive the flow of blood it \nrequires and brain cells become deprived and start to die. Stroke \nvictims often suffer from changes to their senses, ability to \nunderstand speech, behavioral and thought patterns, and memory. \nAdditionally, stroke victims may cry easily, laugh inappropriately, or \nbecome easily irritated.\n  Luckily, Mr. President, advances in treatment and rehabilitation \nallow many stroke victims to return to an active lifestyle. Even though \nrecovery is very possible, these stroke victims must often learn a \nwhole new set of skills because old ones were lost and new skills are \nrequired.\n  Another result of a stroke may be aphasia. Aphasia is the total or \npartial loss of the ability to speak and understand speech and in \napproximately 20 percent of strokes a serious loss of speech occurs. \nThis change in speech may turn into an extremely frustrating experience \nbecause both speech and hearing are extremely important components \nwithin our society.\n  People with aphasia may use unusual words or sounds when expressing \nthemselves. Consequently, slurred speech may often result and thus, the \nappearance of being drunk. People recovering from a stroke may also \nbecome isolated from others because they cannot communicate. As a \nresult, the person may become depressed and indifferent to \nrehabilitation, judgment may become impaired, and memory lapses may \noccur.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe it is extremely important that we as a \nsociety take steps to become more aware of a stroke's effects. Charles \nHuston of Albuquerque, NM, has done just that for the past 30 years. \nCharles suffered a stroke in 1963 and ever since he has dedicated his \nlife to making others aware of the effects of a stroke.\n  Charles has specifically involved himself with the issue of aphasia. \nIn fact the stroke he suffered left him with aphasia. As a result, \nCharles spent many years just relearning how to speak, painstakingly \nrelearning individual words, one at a time. The hard work and \ndetermination paid off because Charles has led a highly successful \npersonal life.\n  In particular, Charles has focused on the misperception that people \nsuffering from aphasia are merely drunk. He has tirelessly promoted a \ndocument known as the Aphasic Patient's Bill of Rights. The document \nexplains the difficulties a person with aphasia may face and also \nstates that people with aphasia have the right for others to treat them \nwith dignity and consideration in all situations.\n  As part of Charles' work to make others aware of the effects of \naphasia, he has focused on educating the New Mexico State Police. \nWithin just the past year, he presented the State police with 13 copies \nof the Aphasic Patient's Bill of Rights and the State police will hang \none of the documents in each of the Department's 13 district offices.\n  I think Charles Huston has set an example for all of us to follow. He \nhas shown a remarkable amount of determination and resiliency in not \nallowing the stroke he suffered over 30 years ago to defeat him. \nAdditionally, Charles has applied that same amount of determination to \neducating people about the effects of aphasia. I think we would all do \nwell to take a little time and educate ourselves about the issues \nCharles Huston has been advocating for so many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5145-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNITION OF WORLD WAR II EXERCISE TIGER OPERATION\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this past April 28, 1997, the \nMissouri and New Jersey Exercise Tiger Associations, in conjunction \nwith Veterans of Foreign War Post 280 of Columbia, MO recognized a \ngroup of heroic men. Until recently, few people knew of the secret \noperation code named ``Exercise Tiger,'' because the details of the \ntragedy were not disclosed until after the Battle of Normandy and even \nthen proper recognition was not given.\n  In December 1943, several training operations began in order to \nprepare for the Battle of Normandy. These operations, organized by the \nUnited States Army, were undertaken off a beach in Devon, England. It \nwas known by all participating parties the dangers they could \nencounter. At the time, several German ships patrolled this stretch of \nwater looking for American and English ships. One such evening during \npractice operations, with only one English ship to guard, there was a \nsurprise attack on the American ships.\n  On April 28, 1944, the German Navy ``E'' boats, patrolling the \nEnglish Channel, attacked the Eight American tank landing ships who \nbecame aware of the attack only after the U.S.S. LST-507 was struck by \nan incoming torpedo. Next, the U.S.S. LST-531 was attacked and sunk in \na matter of minutes. The convoy returned fire and the last ship to be \ntorpedoed, the U.S.S. LST-289, valiantly struggled to reach Dartmouth \nHarbor.\n  Even after this frightening turn of events, to its credit, Exercise \nTiger continued operations and remained on schedule. Normandy was \nattacked as planned and the D-day invasion was a success.\n  Information of the fatalities was not released until after the D-day \ninvasion due to the secrecy of the mission and in order to keep the \nGermans from becoming aware of the impending strike. It took many \nyears, and the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, to learn of \nthe significance of these missions. I feel now is the time for these \ncourageous men to get the long-awaited recognition they deserve.\n  Four thousand men participated in this operation and of those, nearly \na quarter were killed in action. Records from the Department of Defense \nestimate 749 men died consisting of 551 Army and 198 Navy casualties. \nOf Tiger's death toll, 201 men were from the 3206th quartermaster \ncompany in my home State of Missouri.\n  This Memorial Day weekend commemorates the heroic actions of the men \nwho participated in Exercise Tiger and particularly the ones who lost \ntheir lives in this crucial preparation for the D-day invasion. The \nExercise Tiger Associations and VFW Post 280 have the great privilege \nof being first in the State of Missouri to recognize these brave \nindividuals.\n  In the words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, ``Old soldiers never die, \nthey just fade away * * * '' I hope that through this long delayed \nacknowledgment of these fine soldiers, their memory will not fade away, \nbut will remain in our minds and hearts for years to come. These men \nwere an example for all American soldiers to live by and a credit to \nthe United States as it remains the free and great country that it is \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5146-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5146-S5147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT BILL\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nFaircloth, along with Senators Craig, Reid, Jeffords, Lott, Mack, and \nHutchinson, as a co-sponsor of S. 50, the Educational Opportunity Tax \nCredit Bill.\n  S. 50 will help thousands of folks earn a 2-year college degree \nwithout creating a new Federal program. S. 50 is simple: it provides \nfor a non-refundable tax credit of up to $1,500, depending on the cost \nof attendance, for students attending a 2-year school, full-time or \npart-time. To receive the tax credit students must maintain a minimum \ngrade point average as determined by the college.\n  Mr. President, this morning I read an Associated Press article with a \nGreat Falls byline entitled ``Regents OK $7.6 million increase in \ncollege tuition, fees.'' The AP reports that tuition rates at 2-year \nand 4-year schools in Montana will rise an average of 6.5 percent, \nclimbing to 7.5 percent when student fees are factored in. At Montana's \ncolleges of technology, whose students this bill will help, the new \ntuition and fees vary from $1,871 to $2,121, an increase as high as \n11.3 percent. The education and training two-year schools provide is \nmore important for our workforce than it has ever been, but it is also \nmore expensive than it's ever been. A tax credit is a simple way to put \na degree within reach of thousands of students.\n  There are numerous tax credit proposals out there for 4-year schools, \nand I support some of these proposals. But it is vital that Montanans \nhave the specialized training demanded by employers in the technology \nsector--one of the fastest growing sectors in our entire labor force--\nand it is our 2-year schools that provide much of that training. This \ntax credit is a jobs credit: a well-trained workforce not only benefits \nexisting businesses, but will\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nattract new businesses to Montana as well.\n  During the just-concluded debate on the fiscal year 1998 budget \nresolution, I was pleased to support a sense of the Senate resolution \noffered by Senator Faircloth which puts the Senate on record as \nsupporting a tax credit for the expenses of two-year colleges. As \ndebate on the budget continues, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on enacting this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5146-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               S. 625, THE AUTO CHOICE REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. On April 22, 1997, I introduced S. 625, the Auto \nChoice Reform Act of 1997, along with Senators Joe Lieberman, Mitch \nMcConnell, Slade Gorton, and Rod Grams. S. 625 is designed to reform \nthe Nation's auto-insurance system by giving motorists a low-cost \nalternative for bodily injury coverage that provides quicker, more \ncomprehensive recovery of economic losses.\n  The Auto Choice Reform Act would remove many incentives for fraud, \nwhich is endemic to the current auto-insurance system. On Wednesday, \nMay 21, 1997, for instance the Nassau County District Attorney's office \narrested 20 people involved in a massive insurance fraud scam. Those \narrested by operation backbone included lawyers, chiropractors, and a \ndoctor. Our bill would eliminate many of the incentives that promote \nthis kind of abuse.\n  I ask that the Newsday article, ``Real Charges: Fake Injuries Lead to \n20 Arrests in Insurance Scams,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From Newsday, Thursday, May 22, 1997]\n\n                              Real Charges\n\n                            (By Pete Bowles)\n\n       After prepping a ``patient'' for four minutes on how to \n     fake injuries during a medical exam--including a \n     demonstration on moaning ``ooh and aah''--Hempstead \n     chiropractor Martin Drasin said his client was ready for an \n     award-winning performance, according to a videotape made by \n     an undercover investigator.\n       ``I know how they are going to try to trick you up,'' \n     Drasin told the agent, who carried a hidden video recorder. \n     Drasin advised the man on what to do when asked to move his \n     legs up and down at the exam. ``Give an ooh and an aah and \n     say, `I can't do that,' '' he said, and added: ``Move slow. \n     You'll get the Oscar here.''\n       Drasin, 42, whose video performance was played by Nassau \n     District Attorney Denis Dillon at a news conference, was \n     among 20 people--including 12 chiropractors, four attorneys \n     and an orthopedist--charged yesterday with submitting \n     fraudulent claims for automobile no-fault insurance, \n     disability and workers' compensation insurance.\n       Dillon said the 20 were nabbed during a two-year \n     investigation called Operation Backbone, in which law-\n     enforcement agents posing as accident victims sought legal \n     and medical assistance from attorneys and chiropractors. The \n     targets had been selected by insurance companies who \n     suspected skullduggery.\n       All the meetings were recorded, Dillon said. Playing the \n     part of accident victims were undercover operatives from the \n     DA's office, the Nassau County Police Department, the \n     National Insurance Crime Bureau and the U.S. Postal \n     Inspection Service.\n       All but one of the suspects were arrested yesterday on a \n     variety of charges, including insurance fraud, grand larceny, \n     scheming to defraud and falsifying business records.\n       Freeport attorney Alvin Dorfman, 62, a former Democratic \n     committeeman who challenged Dillon for the Democratic \n     designation for district attorney in 1974, was said to be in \n     Israel on vacation and is expected to surrender next week for \n     arraignment in U.S. District Court in Uniondale. He was \n     charged with mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.\n       ``Both my clients maintain they are completely innocent,'' \n     said Dorfman's attorney, Stephen Scaring, who also represents \n     Garden City attorney Gerard McLoughlin, 49, who was charged \n     with insurance fraud and attempted grand larceny. ``We are \n     somewhat shocked that this kind of undercover operation would \n     occur, and we are confident that the tapes themselves will \n     likely establish the innocence of each of these defendants.''\n       Seventeen defendants pleaded innocent in First District \n     Court in Hempstead and were released. They face up to 7 years \n     in prison if convicted. Two others, Dorfman's legal \n     assistant, Mariela Brito, 33, and Woodbury chiropractor \n     Jonathan Tepper, were arraigned in federal court in Uniondale \n     on mail fraud and conspiracy charges and ordered held on \n     $50,000 bond each. They face up to 5 years' imprisonment if \n     convicted.\n       Calls left at the offices of the 20 were not returned.\n       At a news conference with local and federal law-enforcement \n     officials, Dillon said the medical providers billed insurance \n     companies for services not rendered and gave undercover \n     agents letters stating they were disabled and unable to work \n     because of injuries suffered in accidents. He said the \n     accidents were on ``paper only'' and were filed with police \n     as a ruse.\n       In some instances, Dillon said, the agents received \n     chiropractic treatment fewer than 12 times but the \n     chiropractors billed insurance companies for more than 100 \n     visits.\n       He charged that chiropractor George Mitzman, 41, of \n     Westbury, treated one agent 11 times and billed the insurance \n     company for 150 visits. Another defendant, chiropractor \n     Michael Roth, 29, with offices in Bellmore and Syosset, \n     treated an agent once but billed for 90 visits, Dillon said.\n       Dillon said the four attorneys assisted the purported \n     accident victims in fabricating phony lost-wages claims, \n     while in fact the victims said they were working, and \n     submitted falsified documents supporting the claims. He said \n     the attorneys also referred victims to medical providers to \n     obtain disability letters and advised them how to exaggerate \n     injuries.\n       In one case cited by Dillon, Hempstead attorney Mitchell \n     Rachlin, 47, was charged with collecting more than $626,000 \n     from his insurance carrier for a phony disability claim he \n     filed in 1990 for injuries he sustained in an accident.\n       Rachlin, who claimed to be totally disabled, was shown on a \n     videotape walking around his law office as he advised an \n     undercover agent on how to file a claim for lost wages for a \n     traffic accident.\n       On another videotape played by Dillon, Dr. Martin Lehman, \n     64, a Wantagh orthopedist, is shown meeting with an \n     undercover operative who tells Lehman she was working despite \n     being injured in an accident. ``You are not working as far as \n     insurance is concerned,'' Lehman is heard telling the woman. \n     Without performing a physical examination, Lehman gave the \n     woman a disability form, Dillon said.\n       Also charged were: chiropractors Robert Moore, 43, and Jay \n     Levine, 44, with offices in Franklin Square, and their \n     receptionist, Maureen MacPherson, 30; Rockville Centre \n     chiropractor Joseph Huseman III, 39; Franklin Square attorney \n     Scott Garil, 29; North Bellmore chiropractor Susan Schulman, \n     36; Plainview chiropractor Christopher Haas, 32; Oceanside \n     chiropractor Jeffrey Finkelstein, 41; Lynbrook chiropractor \n     Steven Angel, 40; Port Washington, chiropractor Charles \n     Schnier, 45; and Robert Cannon, 59, of Massapequa, a medical-\n     supply distributor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5147-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO DONALD HALL FOR RECEIVING THE PLYMOUTH STATE COLLEGE'S \n                ROBERT FROST CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN AWARD\n\n Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Donald Hall, poet, essayist, and playwright, for being the \n16th recipient of Plymouth State College Robert Frost Contemporary \nAmerican Award. I commend his outstanding achievement and compliment \nhim on this well-deserved honor.\n  Donald is internationally known for his poetry and prose. He and his \nwife Jane, a late poet, too, moved to Wilmot in 1975. Their family \nhomestead, Eagle Pond Farm, has provided him much inspiration for many \nof his works.\n  Donald was a Guggenheim fellow in 1963-1964 and 1972-1973, and poet \nlaureate of New Hampshire from 1984 to 1989. He was elected to the \nNational Institute and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in \n1989. His book of poetry, ``The One Day,'' won the National Book \nCritics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Award the same \nyear. In 1994, Donald received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.\n  His first book of poems, ``Exiles and Marriages,'' was written in \n1955. Among other prose works are ``String Too Short To Be Saved,'' \n``Henry Moore,'' ``Writing Well,'' ``Their Ancient Glittering Eyes,'' \nand ``Ox Cart Man.'' His recent works include ``Old and New Poems'', \nwhich was published in 1990 and ``The Old Life'' published in 1996.\n  The Frost award is given in honor of Robert Frost, a late poet \nlaureate who taught at Plymouth Normal School in 1911-1912. The \nPlymouth State Alumni Association inaugurated the award in 1970 to \nrecognize northern New Englanders who exemplified Frost's traits of \nindividuality, hard work, humanitarianism, and devotion to the Granite \nState.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate Donald for his outstanding \naccomplishment. I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5147-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5147-S5148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 JUMPSTART THE URBAN CLASSROOM NETWORKS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues an opinion piece from Eric Behnamou, Chairman and CEO of \n3Com Corp., regarding the Federal Communications\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\nCommission's [FCC] May 7th decision regarding universal service and the \nSnowe-\nRockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment.\n  While this op-ed piece speaks for itself, I think it is good to note \nthe interest and support of business leaders for education technology \nand the specific initiative to link classrooms and libraries to the \ninformation superhighway. Thoughtful business leaders understand the \nimportance of computer literacy. A California study estimated that 60 \npercent of the new jobs by the year 2000 will require skills possessed \nby only 22 percent of workers--clearly we must do better. I believe \nthat linking up our classrooms will help a great deal.\n  I ask that the article from the May 7, 1997, Los Angeles Times be \nreprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 7, 1997]\n\n                Jump-Start the Urban Classroom Networks\n\n                         (By Eric A. Benhamou)\n\n       Just as cars aren't particularly useful without roads and \n     freeways, the same is true of an information highway without \n     well-planned onramps and offramps. This is particularly \n     evident in our schools.\n       While classroom connectivity increased from 6% to 14% \n     between 1994 and 1996, most of these networks are low-speed \n     analog connections, the computer equivalent of unpaved roads.\n       President Clinton advocates connecting all classrooms to \n     the Internet, and this message has been heard by principals, \n     administrators and school boards anxious to have their \n     students log on. However, this presidential mandate has been \n     largely unfunded, with private money/state projects and \n     volunteer efforts substituting for systemic programs. Poor \n     schools have suffered or been relegated efforts substituting \n     for systemic programs. Poor schools have suffered or been \n     relegated to the slow lane or no lane.\n       The Snowe-Rockefeller amendment to the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1996 corrected this deficiency by funding the \n     necessary telecommunications infrastructure. But the Federal \n     Communications Commission must still approve it.\n       This is critical if we're going to solve the problem of \n     getting all U.S. classrooms hooked up by 2000. The \n     amendment's plan to provide the largest hookup discounts for \n     ``have-not'' schools will help jump-start connectively. \n     Today, 47% of schools with more than 70% of their students \n     qualifying for federal lunch subsidies have no Internet \n     access; only 22% of the schools where less than 11% qualify \n     for free lunches are not hooked up. This gap must be closed.\n       Studies from pilot programs show higher test scores in \n     English and math from Internet-enabled classrooms. More \n     important, technology raises test scores more for \n     underprivileged kids than for wealthy kids, more for kids who \n     have interactive hands-on experience (e.g. the Internet) and \n     more where schools invest in teacher training. Unfortunately, \n     only 7% of urban schools mandate advanced telecommunications \n     and networking skills training for teachers.\n       President Eisenhower's conception and subsequent \n     implementation of the U.S. highway system fostered our mobile \n     society, creating industries and jobs. President Clinton's \n     vision of a nation of learners benfiting from the Internet \n     offers similar return. Companies like Netscape and America \n     OnLine are already providing jobs for American youth.\n       The amendment isn't perfect, but it provides for much \n     broader and systematic introduction of networking into our \n     schools. It earmarks $2.25 billion annually for \n     communications and networking equipment. The FCC \n     commissioners should make the tough trade-offs and approve \n     this highway construction project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5147-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ACTIONS BY THE PALESTINIAN\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr President, during the past few weeks we have all \nheard disturbing news coming forth from the territories under \nPalestinian Authority control.\n  The idea that Chairman Arafat even hinted of his support much less, \nhis embrace of a policy to sanction the assassination of his own people \nfor selling real estate to Jews is abhorrent and beyond the pale.\n  That individuals were actually murdered because of this policy should \nserve as a wake-up notice to those who attempt to push the principals \ninto agreements before they are ready.\n  We also have been appraised of the situation facing Mr. Daoud Kuttab, \na United States citizen, who during the exercise of his right under \nPalestinian Authority rule, was arrested for complaining about the \njamming of his radio station which was broadcasting the legislative \ncouncil session of the Palestinian Authority. This activity, much like \nC-SPAN, I believe, is a core freedom of a democratic government. An \nAmerican citizen, holding a Jerusalem identity card, as Mr. Kuttab \ndoes, is exempted from jurisdiction of the PA.\n  The road to democracy is not an easy one. It is filled with what may \nseem to be impossible impasses, but they are not. The right of a free \npress to operate and the right of free speech and the right of an \nindividual to dispose of his own property in a free and legitimate \nmanner are core to a democratic state.\n  I call upon the President of the United States to reiterate to Mr. \nArafat, our Nation's commitment to those freedoms and our inability to \naccept anything less than a full compliance with those freedoms or face \nthe withdrawal of our continued support. I also call upon the President \nto voice through appropriate channels, our condemnation of the policies \nand resulting actions which we have seen occur in the recent weeks in \nthe areas under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction.\n  While I am firmly committed to the principle that the United States \nremain a neutral and honest mediator, I must speak up when those very \nprinciples for which we stand and for which the parties claim to be \nattempting to achieve are ignored and violated flagrantly.\n  I hope that President Clinton will be forthcoming with some \ninitiative to address these and other issues such as the revocation of \nthe clauses calling for the destruction of Israel within its charter, \nand that we hold the Palestinian Authority responsible for implementing \ndemocratic ideals which will be critical to a strong and vibrant \nPalestinian Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5148-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FRANKLIN S.

In \naddition, I would like to take this opportunity and commemorate his \ndistinguished service as a Federal judge.\n  Bill's career has been dedicated to serving the people of Vermont in \na wide array of positions. He first served the Green Mountain State as \nassistant secretary of the Senate from 1949 to 1953. He was later \nselected to represent the Woodstock area as a member of the Vermont \nHouse. During his tenure, Bill was elected speaker of the Vermont \nGeneral Assembly in 1963 and 1965, which were tumultuous \nreapportionment years for the State. In 1975, he was appointed to the \nVermont Supreme Court and subsequently chosen to serve as Chief \nJustice. He concluded his career as the U.S. district court judge for \nthe district of Vermont.\n  Throughout his efforts, Bill has remained consistently committed to \nstandards of professionalism above reproach as well as an unwavering \nrespect and dedication to ethics. His uncanny ability to see beyond the \nsurface, while considering some of the most complicated legal matters, \nis testimony to a keen intellect.\n  Once again, I would like to extend my best wishes and congratulations \nto Judge Bill Billings. He has set an example which we should all \nstrive to emulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5148-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5148-S5149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, on Monday May \n26 our Nation observes Memorial Day; a day of remembrance for all the \nmembers of our Armed Forces who gave their lives so that our Nation \ncould be free. Sometimes it seems as if, in our haste to address the \nissues of the day, we forget that the freedom we enjoy--the freedom we \ntake for granted--was not free. Countless American soldiers, seamen, \nmarines, and pilots paid for our freedom with their lives. On the last \nMonday of May each year we honor our veterans, fly the flag at half-\nstaff, and pause to remember their sacrifice.\n  It is unfortunate that if you look in the newspapers or watch the ads \non TV, you might think that the only purpose Memorial Day serves is to \nannounce the beginning of another summer season or the start of a new \nsales drive. But if you spend some time talking with veterans like \nthose who returned from Europe, Korea, or Vietnam; if you talk with \nthose who landed at Normandy or those who survived the Bataan Death \nMarch, you learn the real purpose of Memorial Day--to honor the men and \nwomen who gave their lives, most at a very young age--in defense of our \nNation.\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\n  Today the United States stands alone as the world's only superpower. \nToday, more often than not our foreign policy debates concern trade, \nrather than war; economic issues rather than military issues. It is at \ntimes like this, times of peace, that we should pay extra attention to \nthe true purpose of Memorial Day.\n  The good news is that American citizens understand and respect the \nrole veterans have played in our Nation's history. If you look at the \nsize of the crowds that visit the Korean War Memorial and the Vietnam \nWar Memorial here in DC you get a sense of how Americans feel about \ntheir veterans. The same scene is duplicated time and time again at \nveterans' memorials all across the country. Recently I had the honor of \nparticipating in a ceremony marking the progress of the new Veterans' \nMemorial Park being built in Albuquerque. It is with the creation of \nspecial places like this park that our Nation continues to honor the \nservice and sacrifice of all our veterans.\n  Mr. President, we set aside one day each year to officially honor \nthose who died for our freedom. For all that our military veterans have \ndone for us, it is the least we could do.

Mr. President, it is easy to take for granted the \nfreedom we have here, in the United States, and too often we lose sight \nof that and resort to complaining about one thing or another, but the \nfact is, we live in the most blessed Nation in the world, we enjoy the \ngreatest freedom of choice, we enjoy so much, but those freedoms were \npurchased and protected at a very high cost.\n  As we prepare to celebrate Memorial Day this year, I call upon my \nfellow Missourians and all Americans to pause and remember the \nsacrifice of our soldiers, sailors, Marines, and air men and women \nstationed around the world today protecting us with a blanket weaved \nwith the battle flags from places with names like Lexington, Concord, \nGettysburg, Belleau Wood, Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Iwo Jima, Saint Lo, \nBastogne, Chosin Reservoir, Khe Sahn, Beirut, Wadi Al-Batin, and Medina \nRidge in Iraq and most recently, those taken from us in Somalia and by \nthe brutal and cowardly bombing of Kobart Towers.\n  We must remember the sacrifices of those who came before us, and \nthose whom we most recently lost--the fathers, mothers, sons, and \ndaughters who gave their most precious of gifts, their lives, that we \nmight continue to enjoy the freedoms we hold so dear.\n  We must remember them so we will focus our determination, as a \nnation, that we never, ever, waste a life because it is too hard or too \nexpensive to do the right thing. We must take this opportunity to re-\ndedicate ourselves to make that effort and to ensure that our military \npersonnel are the best trained, equipped and prepared in the world, \nbecause we ask so much of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5149-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ORDERS FOR MAY 27, MAY 30, JUNE 2, AND JUNE 3, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nrecognize a member of my staff who will be retiring next Friday after \nmany years of service to me, the State of Idaho, the Senate, and the \nNation.\n  Norman G. Arseneault came to my office as an American Political \nScience Association fellow from the Forest Service, USDA more than 6 \nyears ago. He served with distinction in that fellowship program, \ntaking on numerous natural resources problems facing the State of Idaho \nand working diligently to find solutions. When he completed the \nfellowship, he returned to the Forest Service to resume what I am sure \nwould have been a distinguished career.\n  Shortly after he had returned to the Forest Service, it became clear \nto me that solutions to the natural resources problems we faced--the \nwilderness debate in my State, endangered species listing, and a host \nof others--would benefit from Norm's skills. I offered him a permanent \nstaff position, and, fortunately for Idaho, he accepted.\n  Since then, all in my office have benefited from Norm Arseneault's \nprofessionalism, good humor, and integrity. He has developed a \nreputation on the Hill and in the State of Idaho for honesty, \nstraightforwardness, fairness, and competence. It has been my good \nfortune to have been among those who have known and worked with him on \na day-to-day basis.\n  As Norm moves on to a new phase in his life, I know the traits that \nhave made him so effective in my office over the past 6 years will \nservice him well in his future endeavors. I am proud to know Norm \nArseneault and to have called him friend. I speak for all in my office \nwhen I say he will be dearly missed. We wish him the best and God \nspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5149-6", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5149-S5150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY, 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on Monday, many of us will be about the \nland, speaking to veterans on Memorial Day. Throughout this Nation's \nhistory and\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\nthroughout the world's history valiant soldiers have struggled, \ndistinguished themselves, advanced their cause, and fallen in battle. \nYet a Memorial Day commemorating America's brave heroes was a long time \nin coming.\n  A national memorial occasion was observed for the first time in 1886. \nIt began with the Grand Army of the Republic, the organization of Union \nArmy veterans. They started, on a nationwide scale, what some southern \nwomen in several Dixie cities had been doing as a local spring \nceremony--remembering the Civil War dead by placing flowers on their \ngraves.\n  Since then, all too many generations have confronted the savagery of \nwar and added their own list to the role of the fallen heroes. What \nbegan as a memorial to casualties of one war is now our day to honor \nthose from all of our wars.\n  In the beginning, Memorial Day was more popularly known as Decoration \nDay. I grew up, as probably the President did, knowing it as Decoration \nDay. I remember my folks saying now we have to go to the graves and to \nthe cemetery to honor our dead In our family on Decoration Day. It was \nobserved by decorating the graves with flowers and flags. That \ntradition is still a strong one and many thousands of Americans will go \nto the graves of their loved ones and to veterans and veterans' graves \nand memorials on Monday to recognize our veterans.\n  Our emphasis today should be to remember the supreme sacrifice so \nmany made to protect our great Nation and secure the freedoms we enjoy.\n  Gen. John A. Logan, the commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, \ncalled for the observance of Memorial Day in 1886. Today, his words are \nstill eloquent and meaningful, and it is fitting that we recall them. \nHe said, ``Let no ravages of time testify to coming generations that we \nhave forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided Republic.''\n  On this Memorial Day, 1997, that we are soon to celebrate, let us \nacknowledge the terrible cost and honor the fallen heroes who paid for \nit have made, by rededicating ourselves to their cause. Let us \nconcentrate on preserving our Nation and honoring our cherished \nfreedoms by recognizing those who preserve them for us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/23/senate-section/article/S5149-7", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M., TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
