Mr. President, I want to talk about a subject that is \nvery important and close to my heart, and that is national parks, for \nat least two reasons. One is I grew up right outside of Yellowstone \nPark in Wyoming. We have Teton Park in Wyoming as well.\n  I am also chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks. We have had \na series of two hearings on the future of the National Park System, \nand, as chairman, I am committed to the formulation of a proparks \nagenda which will allow us to enrich parks well into the next century.\n  Before speaking on the issue of the future, however, let me briefly \ndiscuss the current status of the system and some of the real problems \nthat do confront us. Today's National Park System is comprised of 375 \npark units and is visited each year by millions of visitors. The parks \nare immensely popular destinations, of course, intended to protect and \ncommemorate this country's most significant natural, historical, and \nculture resources.\n  According to recent testimony from our hearings, this diverse \ncollection of units stimulates over $10 billion annually in revenue to \nlocal economies and supports 230,000 tourism-related jobs. Each year, \n12 million foreign visitors are drawn to our parks, contributing \nsignificantly to a $22 billion international travel trade surplus. So, \nin addition to protecting our most precious resources, they are also an \neconomic stimulus, of course.\n  The Park Service is currently authorized to employ 20,342 full-time \nworkers. This system includes approximately 80.2 million acres. The \n1997 budget is authorized at roughly $1.4 billion.\n  This relatively small agency, managing a large land base enjoying \nunparalleled popularity and generating significant tax and business \nrevenues, faces a pressing dilemma. At a time when the American \ntaxpayers are serious about smaller Government and lower taxes, \nAmericans have also demonstrated an equally serious interest in their \nparks.\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\n Unfortunately, their interest has not, as yet, been translated into a \nserious and long-range plan nor commitment for the care of parks. The \nresult is a legacy of critical problems plaguing the National Park \nService.\n  Today, we face an overwhelming inventory of unfunded National Park \nService programs. Over the years, the National Park Service has been \npulled in a wide variety of directions. Each change, each new \ndirection, each new responsibility has caused an adverse effect in the \nsystem.\n  The Park Service has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that you can do \nmore with less. But, in adding new areas and new responsibilities, the \nagency is forced into a scenario of doing less with less in terms of \nservice and protection. As a result of decisions made by the Congress \nand the administration, we face an unbelievable backlog of unfunded \nPark Service programs. The budget shortfall is staggering. Let me touch \nbriefly on some of the problems.\n  Within the 375 units of the Park Service we have approximately $1.4 \nbillion of authorized land acquisitions. These are private lands that \nare authorized within authorized park boundaries, but these lands have \nnever been acquired. There are 823 billion dollars worth of national \nresource management projects which have gone unfunded. It is almost \nimpossible to make a sound management decision based on scientific \nevidence if we are lacking the basic information on the extent and the \ncondition and the inventory of these valuable natural resources.\n  It is more than difficult to protect something if you do not have a \nclue as to what you are protecting.\n  In the area of cultural resource management projects, the unfunded \nbacklog is $331 million. Again, these valuable cultural resources are \nnot protected or stabilized.\n  There are 1.5 billion dollars worth of building-related projects for \nwhich there is no budget provision. For the benefit of my colleagues, I \nwould like to point out that if Congress decided to fully fund this \nitem, we would only provide needed repairs to existing deteriorating \nfacilities. No new facilities would be constructed under this scenario.\n  There are $304 million of utility systems that are in advance states \nof disrepair throughout the system. Potable water and sewage systems \nthat meet specifications are an absolute necessity if we want visitors \nto continue to come to our parks.\n  In the identified resource protection work that needs to be \naccomplished, $1.8 billion would begin to arrest the digression of \nnatural resources of our parks before we lose those resources that we \nare committed to protect.\n  Mr. President, $2.2 billion is required for road and bridge repair \nand transportation systems. In my own State of Wyoming, the cost of \nroad repair in Yellowstone Park exceeds $300 million. This cost will \nautomatically increase if the road repairs are ignored.\n  I might add, in the last few years, something like $8 million has \nbeen committed to this $300 million deficit.\n  In many cases, employee housing is substandard. There are parks where \nthe occupants of the National Park Service need not look outside to see \nif it is snowing. They only have to check the snow level in their \nliving room. The pricetag to get employee housing to an acceptable \nstandard is $442 million. If we cannot afford to take care of the \ncaretakers, then there is something radically wrong.\n  The total unfunded backlog in maintenance, resource stabilization, \ninfrastructure repair and employee housing is $8.7 billion. This price \ntag does not include the concessions which also need, of course, to \nkeep pace.\n  Mr. President, $8.7 billion is a major problem. We need to take \npositive steps to correct this deficiency. Forward-thinking, new, \ninnovative approaches will be required. It is a problem that cannot be \nresolved in the short term.\n  I am happy to report, however, that there is, I think, reason for \noptimism and a favorable prognosis. It is going to be difficult, but I \nthink we can do it.\n  As a result of our hearings on the future of the parks, there are \nmany ideas to be discussed and evaluated, but now is the time to \naddress the long-term solutions and to reinvigorate the National Park \nService so that our park system will stand as an example to the world \nwell into the next century.\n  Most importantly, we need to ensure that we are conserving and \nprotecting the resources, protecting the natural and historic objects \nand the wildlife, while at the same time ensuring that the parks will \nbe visited and will be an enjoyable experience.\n  Within the next few weeks, we plan to circulate a strategic plan to \nour colleagues and to the administration which will chart a course to \ndeal with this serious dilemma, a plan to serve as a foundation for a \nprogram to reinvigorate the parks by the year 2010.\n  The Thomas plan--we have not thought of a better name--will contain \nsome proposals for legislative initiatives, as well as some concepts \nthat the administration can implement. As a result of our hearings on \nthe future, it became very apparent that we need to incorporate some of \nthe best ideas.\n  Several financial concepts will, out of necessity, be discussed. As a \nstart, the plan will include a bonding initiative. Many of our parks \nare essentially small villages or towns. In essence, they are towns \nthat are required to have roads and utility systems and infrastructure. \nIt seems to me we cannot expect to bring those up to operating \ncondition out of annual operating funds. So the municipalities can show \nus the way. They have over the years bonded to do that. We do not have \nthe money.\n  The process is relatively simple. We can establish a Federal \ncorporate entity within the Department to administer the bonds. We need \nto establish a dependable system to pay off the bonds, and we can do \nthat. There are additional options that ought to be considered.\n  I anticipate our plan would be built on the fine work of Senator \nGorton in the last session making the fee demonstration permit and \nextending it to all units of the national parks, a proposal where the \nrevenues collected in those parks stay where they are collected.\n  A number of our witnesses spoke about establishing a strict criteria \nfor the establishment of new additions. When we are $8.7 billion \nbehind, we need to be careful about the additional authorizations we \nmake. This is not suggesting we should delete any of the units, but we \nought to be careful about the new ones and, frankly, not make a \npolitical decision that a State park or local park be converted to a \nFederal park so the Feds will take over. The Park Service was never \nintended to be a redevelopment agency.\n\n  There are other programs, of course, that need help. Our plan will \ninclude a concession reform which turns away from the failed practice \nof trying to repair and refurbish the existing and inadequate law. We \nwill take an innovative approach and, hopefully, there will be some \nhigher fees paid to maintain the parks.\n  We should turn to the private sector for expertise in the management \nand operations of concessions. These are multimillion-dollar programs.\n  As a result, we ought to have an asset manager in the Park Service--\nit is a huge financial operation--someone who is experienced and who \nhas a background and training in assets. We can do that.\n  On a different issue, our hearings revealed the need for better \nemployee training. We can do that, largely with the use of universities \nand schools that are there.\n  We need to continue progress made in more cost-effective management, \ninsisting on efficiency-oriented management goals, linked with the \nreduction of the size of the Washington office and put the folks in the \nparks where they really need to be. I am not suggesting a personnel \nreduction, but I am suggesting a reallocation.\n  Many of our parks are funding maintenance departments that would be \nthe envy of small towns. There are ways to streamline this. There is no \nreason why the private sector cannot be contracted to do many of these \nthings and do them more efficiently and save money.\n  Mr. President, the Park Service identifies backlogs and other \nproblems. It is fine to do park planning, but the process and the \ncontent needs to be timely and realistic. Park general management plans \nhave been sitting on the shelves for years. It is time to update, \nimplement and really go forward.\n  This is an ambitious agenda, but, in my opinion, there are concepts \nthat\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\ncan be enacted. We can collectively achieve a great victory in the \npreservation of something that we all support.\n  My home State of Wyoming is now famous for its parks--Yellowstone, \nTetons, Devils Tower. Like most Americans, I take great pride in those. \nSo we want to set a standard for national parks for the 21st century. \nWe have invited, of course, the administration to join with us. Among \nother things, I have sent a letter to the President asking that he \nappoint a park director. There is not one now. In order to have some \nplans and work together, we do need some leadership there.\n  I am suggesting and want my colleagues to know I am prepared to \nundertake this issue, and together we can cause something constructive \nto happen. We have a great opportunity. The time is now, the time is \nright, and I am willing to work any time with anyone to bring the \nNational Park Service into the 21st century alive, vibrant, efficient, \neffective, and lasting, more importantly, an agency that would provide \nexcellent service to visitors and provide excellent service to the \nresource. We can do that.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nhis statement and his sincere commitment to our National Park System. \nAs chairman of the Parks Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, he offers this country tremendous leadership in \nthe area of parks and park management. I am sure his statement this \nmorning is well received and clearly demonstrates some of the \ndifficulties our Park Service now experiences that this Congress ought \nto be actively and responsibly dealing with.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my visit to \nMinnesota last week to see firsthand the floods that have ravaged my \nState, as well as North and South Dakota, and the damage left behind in \nthe water's wake. For the many Minnesotans who live and work in \ncounties devastated by these floods, this continues to be a very \ndifficult and emotional time.\n  Let me say first that President Clinton has approved the request of \nMinnesota Governor Arne Carlson to declare an additional 25 counties a \nmajor disaster area. That would help to bring to 46 the total number of \ncounties eligible to receive Federal disaster assistance.\n  As Governor Carlson said in making his request to the President, this \nassistance will help to get people back into their homes.\n  The worst may not be over for many Minnesotans, however, especially \nthose in the Red River Valley. Upstream on the Red River at \nBreckenridge, over 400 people were evacuated yesterday from the \nsouthern section of the community. It appears that the river may have \nstopped rising, and efforts will continue today to try and save the \nrest of the city.\n  There is still the danger that the river might crest all at once from \nWahpeton south of Fargo to Grand Forks on the north because of water \ncreated by melting snow.\n  Last Thursday, I traveled with Senators Conrad and Dorgan of North \nDakota, Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, and other members of the \ncongressional delegation, along with James Lee Witt, the Director of \nthe Federal Emergency Management Administration, to the cities of Ada, \nMoorhead, and many others. I traveled the next day with Vice President \nAl Gore to survey the damage in Breckenridge and elsewhere in western \nMinnesota.\n  On Saturday, I visited Red Cross and emergency service centers with \nMinnesota Lieutenant Governor Joanne Benson. At each stop over those 3 \ndays, we witnessed widespread devastation and the strength of \nMinnesota's community spirit, as we spoke with many citizens whose \nlives have been turned upside down by the floods.\n  The disastrous flooding has severely disrupted the lives of many \nMinnesotans. Dreams of enjoying warm spring weather after a brutally \nlong Minnesota winter has been replaced with efforts to ensure families \nand communities are safe and that adequate food, water, and shelter is \navailable.\n  I am pleased that both State and Federal tax filing deadlines have \nbeen extended for those taxpayers living within the disaster areas.\n  Later this week, I will introduce legislation modeled after a bill I \nsigned into law during the Midwest floods of 1993 to help ease lending \nregulations in those disaster-declared areas as well. This will make it \neasier for the restructuring of loans and prevent unnecessary \nforeclosures on farmers and other small businesses. The flooding--and \nthe snow, the ice, and the cold that made relief efforts extremely \ndifficult--has been an exhausting nightmare for those who are in it, \nand it has been agonizing for the rest of the Nation to watch. The \nMinnesotans I met with at the flood sites we traveled to have been \ntested time and time again.\n  The floods of 1997 are creating an agricultural disaster as well. \nWhile hard numbers do not exist yet, more than 2 million acres of \nMinnesota cropland are now under water, affecting thousands of farms, \nand all of Wilkin County's 400,000 acres of cropland are flooded. In \nClay County, it is 200,000 acres under water.\n  It has been estimated that farmers who already lost more than $100 \nmillion due to the blizzards that caused the floods could now have \nflood losses totaling over $1 billion.\n  Dairy farmers have been hit especially hard, forcing them to dump \nhundreds of thousands of pounds of milk because milk trucks could not \nreach them. The biggest problem has been getting out to the farms that \nare surrounded by water.\n  Spring planting, which is normally just 2 weeks away, will be a \nproblem in parts of southern Minnesota. Along the Red River Valley, \nmore than 40 percent of the sugar beet crop is normally planted by the \nend of April. No one will be planting by then this year.\n  According to the National Weather Service, flood warnings remain in \neffect until April 20 along the Mississippi from St. Paul to Red Wing, \nas well as for portions of the St. Croix and the Minnesota rivers.\n  Red Cross volunteers have begun to close emergency shelters and are \nnow distributing flood cleanup kits. By the end of last week, the Red \nCross had served more than 55,000 meals to sandbaggers and those people \nin shelters.\n  While tough times are still ahead, I was moved by Minnesotans coming \ntogether for the common goal of protecting and cleaning up their \ncommunities.\n  In Ada, people are tense, weary from days of flood relief work, and \nstill shaken by their losses. For those lucky enough to remain in their \nhomes, the loss of heat and electricity were devastating in the harsh, \nwinter-like conditions.\n  You may have read the story of Ada residents Warren and Colleen \nGoltz. Although the Goltzes lost electricity as water in a nearby \ndrainage ditch began to rise, they decided to stay in their house. Four \nfeet of water seeped into the basement, ruining many of their \npossessions.\n  They burned old newspapers in the fireplace to keep warm, but the \ntemperature fell to 38 degrees. Finally, a friend arrived with a \ngenerator, another dropped off firewood, and another opened his house \nso they could use the phone.\n  As Rev. Earl Schmidt of the Zion Lutheran Church of Ada said, ``It's \ngoing to make us much more caring for each other. I hope it makes us \nlook to God more, obviously. And it's given us a quick lesson in \nsurvival.''\n  We have been inspired once again by people of Minnesota, who have \nrallied together for their communities as they always do when tragedy \nstrikes. It is during critical times such as these that we finally \nunderstand the importance of neighbor helping neighbor.\n  At a time when we rarely make the effort to get to know and \nappreciate our neighbors, Minnesotans in a great many of our \ncommunities have formed lasting bonds over this past week and found \ntheir civic spirit had been restored.\n  Mr. President, I was equally impressed with the efforts of \nMinnesota's\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nyoung people. All too often we hear and read about young people who are \nnot responsible, who do not care about their community.\n  Last week, I witnessed countless occasions when young and old worked \ntogether, filling and hauling sandbags, feeding those who had lost \ntheir homes, and finding them shelter. They set a remarkable example \nfor the rest of the Nation.\n  Much work has been done, but the most difficult work is yet to be \naccomplished, and that will be the cleanup that takes place over the \nnext few months, after the news crews have moved on, the TV cameras \nhave been hauled away, and the spotlight has shifted to another part of \nthe country.\n  I will be working with the Governor's office and with local officials \nto ensure that available Federal assistance will be distributed to \nthose counties that so desperately need it.\n  Mr. President, last week I witnessed neighbor helping neighbor and \nvolunteers working side by side to help save their communities. It is \nthis kind of determination that will lead people through these \ndifficult times, as we deal with what one Minnesotan described as ``a \nflood frozen in place.''\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have reserved an hour, I believe, in \nmorning business. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues will be on the \nfloor presently. I would like to begin the hour and will be yielding \ntime to some of my colleagues. But I do want to follow, in the first 5 \nminutes or so, the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nGrams, on the issue of flooding.\n  We intend, during this hour, to talk about the chemical weapons \ntreaty and the critical vote that will be coming up on that in the \nSenate next week on that issue. I will get to that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3235-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3236-S3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FLOODING IN THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, let me respond to the issue of \nflooding. The Senator from Minnesota said it very well. I was with him \nas we toured part of the Red River Valley last week.\n  The Red River, which is one of the only rivers that I know of that \nflows north, flows into a watershed up north that is still frozen. The \nRed River often has problems with flooding. We often cope with the \nchallenges of dealing with a flood in the Red River. But this is a \nflood of historic proportions, a century flood, on the heels of a \nwinter in which we had five to seven blizzards, the last of which a \nweek and a half ago put, in many cases, up to 20 inches of snow in our \nregion.\n  A massive flood, the worst blizzard in 50 years, massive power \noutages all around the region, and then you understand a little about \nthe challenges faced by people in the Northern Great Plains.\n  This has been very, very difficult. The Red River today has turned \ninto a lake that is now 200 miles long. If you fly over it, it is \nalmost inappropriate to characterize it as a river. It is a 200-mile \nlake that is held in by the heroic efforts of some people to fill bags \nwith sand and stack them on top of each other and hope that that \nsandbagging will keep water from their homesteads, their farms or their \nhouses.\n  Also, there are the heroic efforts of the Corps of Engineers, \ncontracting with wonderful contractors to build emergency dikes. It is \nsome effort in North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota to watch the \nfight to stem the tide of this difficult flood.\n  Last weekend, I was in a shelter in Grafton, ND, where people had \ngone in order to seek refuge. They had been for days without any \nelectricity in their homes. An 89-year-old woman living alone in her \nhome had finally decided, ``I must go to a shelter.'' I talked to her, \nand typical of the tough, gritty Norwegian and German stock in North \nDakota, she said, well, it was not so bad, that, you know, she was \ngetting through it--89 years old, no complaints, fighting the flood, \nfighting the elements, living in a shelter, but she knew that we would \nget through this. And that is the spirit that exists in our part of the \ncountry.\n  There was a woman in north Fargo named Sylvia Hove. Just before I \nleft, to come back to the Senate here in DC for votes this week, I \nstopped by Sylvia's house. The amount of diking they had to do to keep \nthe wall of water out from the back of her house and her backyard is \ntruly extraordinary. Then, at 4 o'clock in the morning, with this very \ntall dike that they had built--and I helped pile some of the sandbags \non that dike the week previous--the dike springs a leak.\n  Sylvia's son, who is there from out of State, hailed down a \npoliceman. The policeman put out the alert on the radio. And at 4 \no'clock in the morning there were four policemen there, just like that. \nThe policemen routed their cars, stacking sandbags, dealing with the \nleak in the dike until others came.\n  It is the way that neighbors have helped neighbors, and, yes, in \nMinnesota, in Breckenridge, the North Dakota side, all up and down, \nespecially the valley, the Red River Valley in North Dakota and \nMinnesota.\n  Unfortunately, this is a flood that comes and stays. Most floods we \nsee on television are some raging river, completely out of control, \ntaking houses with it down the middle of the stream. That is not the \nway the flood on the Red River occurs. It is a river that runs north; \nit runs very, very slow. It has a very insignificant grade, and the \nresult is the crest comes but the flood will stay for a long, long \nwhile.\n  They will be fighting the flood in North Dakota and Minnesota yet for \nsome weeks. It is truly a very significant challenge and a heroic \neffort on the part of mayors and city councils and young people and old \nfolks and just ordinary folks who are doing extraordinary things to try \nto deal with this calamity.\n  I was at a sandbagging operation in Grand Forks. They put out a call \nfor volunteers. I went into this giant area where they have two big \nsandbagging operations. There must have been 200 volunteers there \nranging from 15 years old, I think, probably to 80 years old, all of \nthem working hard piling sandbags on trucks. It really is quite an \nextraordinary thing to see.\n  There are a couple of outstanding issues. The head of the Corps of \nEngineers, Colonel Wonsik, called me last evening at home and gave me a \ndescription of where we are with respect to Wahpeton and Breckenridge, \nFargo, Grand Forks, Grafton, Drayton, Pembina, all the way up and down \nthe valley. He feels that they are making some progress, but it is an \nenormous challenge.\n  The mayor of Fargo called me about an hour ago. Again, it is an \nenormous challenge, but they are fighting a significant battle. All of \nthe preparation they are doing is preventing the enormous damage that \ncould have been done had we not had the diking that is now in place.\n  Some have asked the question about the emergency help that is going \nto be available on a 75 percent/25 percent ratio, 75 percent Federal, \n25 percent State and local. The Governor had asked for a 90-10 ratio. I \nwill just observe on that point the folks in FEMA and the \nadministration have a formula: If the damage in a region goes above $40 \nmillion, then they go to a 90-10 formula. That will almost certainly \noccur in our region, probably has already occurred. That will be \nretroactive. So it is almost certain that our region will have this 90-\n10 formula in which the rest of the country reaches out in a disaster \nto say, we are here to help you, just as we have reached out on \nearthquakes and tornadoes and floods in other regions of our country. \nSo that is something that is important.\n  Second, the Internal Revenue Service has been very helpful. As you \nknow, there was a traffic jam in the District of Columbia last night; \npeople at midnight trying to post their income tax returns on time. The \nInternal Revenue Service extended the date for filing to May 30 in the \nDakotas and Minnesota where disaster has been declared. That is going \nto be helpful. They indicated they did not have authority to waive the \ninterest charge during that 45-day extension.\n  I introduced a piece of legislation last evening in the Senate to \nwaive that interest charge. It seems to me if the IRS says--and I \nappreciate the fact they have said it--that a tax return will be timely \nfiled if it is filed by May\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\n30, you ought not charge the interest on something you consider timely \nfiled. So I would like to see that interest charge waived.\n  But we very much appreciate the cooperation of the Internal Revenue \nService. People out there trying to man dikes and fill sandbags and so \non are not able to get back to find their records to file a tax return \nif they had not already done it. They have been working on this flood \nand responding to it now for several weeks, so we appreciate the \ncooperation of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I especially, as I conclude, want to echo the words of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. The men and women in our region of the country have had \nabout as tough a time as you can have this winter and now this spring. \nI am enormously proud of what they are doing. I have been privileged to \nbe there the last two weekends and most of the week previous to be a \npart of that. We will get through it. North Dakotans and Minnesotans \nand South Dakotans are tough people who have faced tough challenges in \nthe past. We will get through it and rebuild and have better days ahead \nof us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3236-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3237-S3243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, next week we will have an enormously \nimportant vote in the U.S. Senate.\n  There are days when people come to the floor of the Senate and debate \nalmost nothing or find almost nothing to debate about. But, of course, \nalmost nothing can provoke a debate in the Senate. We tend to get \ninvolved in discussions back and forth and find reasons to dispute each \nother over the smallest word or the smallest nuance in a piece of \nlegislation. Sometimes that is a little frustrating, especially if you \ncame here wanting to do some important things and some big things.\n  Next week we will do something important and tackle a big issue. It's \nthe chemical weapons treaty. It is an attempt by a group of countries, \nhopefully including our country, to ban an entire class of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  The negotiation on a Chemical Weapons Convention to ban chemical \nweapons was begun by President Ronald Reagan. President Bush was active \nas Vice President and as President in supporting the treaty. The treaty \nwas the great achievement of the last month of his administration. \nToday, he very strongly supports ratification. President Clinton back \nin 1993 submitted the treaty to the Senate for ratification.\n  This treaty is the result of decades of negotiation and leadership by \nour country. The treaty which came from those negotiations needs to be \nratified by the U.S. Senate, and it has been hanging around for some \nlong while. It was supposed to be voted on last year, but it got caught \nup in Presidential politics. We need to ratify it by April 29 if we, as \na country, are to be involved in the regime that sets up the monitoring \nand the processes by which this treaty is implemented.\n  We are told that next week we will vote on this treaty. We also \nunderstand that it is going to be a close vote. I want to tell you why \nI think this is important. We will have several other Members of the \nSenate here in the next hour to describe why it is important from their \nstandpoint.\n  What are chemical weapons? Well, simply, they are poison gases, \nhorrible weapons of war, highly toxic gases or liquids that can be used \nin bombs, rockets, missiles, artillery shells, mines, or grenades. This \ntreaty says let us ban entirely poison gases, let us outlaw this class \nof weapons completely.\n  Some do not like any treaties on arms. Some in this Senate will stand \nup and say we should not have arms treaties. Some have opposed START I, \nSTART II, the nuclear arms treaties. They are inappropriate, they say.\n  Well, I held up on the floor of the Senate about a year ago a piece \nof metal about the size of my fist. The piece of metal came from a \nmissile silo, a silo that housed a missile in Pervomaisk, Ukraine, a \nsilo that held a missile with a nuclear warhead that was aimed at the \nUnited States of America.\n  I held up a piece of that silo in my hand because the silo has been \ndestroyed, the missile has been destroyed, the warhead is gone, and \nwhere a missile once sat, aimed at the United States of America, is now \na patch of dirt planted with sunflowers.\n  Why was a missile taken out, a silo destroyed, and sunflowers planted \nwhere there once was a missile aimed at the United States? Because the \narms control treaties required it--required it--required that missiles \nbe destroyed. We are destroying missiles on nuclear weapons. So is the \nformer Soviet Union. The Ukraine is now nuclear free. The fact is, we \nhave had success with arms control agreements. Are they perfect? No. Do \nthey work? Yes. We have had success with arms control agreements. This \nis a treaty on arms control. We need to ratify it. We will vote on that \nnext week.\n\n  Let me describe, again, what this is about. It is a treaty to try to \nban a class of weapons of mass destruction. Not many people probably \nknow what chemical weapons are. I really don't. I have obviously not \nseen chemical weapons used. Very few people have.\n  Let me read from a poet, Wilfred Owen, a famous poet from World War \nI, and the lines he wrote about a gas attack. Germany was the first \nnation in modern times to use chemical weapons, in the World War I \nbattle at Ypres, a town in Belgium, April 22, 1915. It is said that a \nhissing sound came from German trenches as 6,000 cylinders spewed \nchlorine gas aimed at the allied lines. That is a gas that attacks the \nlungs, causes severe coughing and choking and death. It had a \ndevastating effect on the allied soldiers, who were unprepared. \nSoldiers breathing that gas began to cough up blood, their faces \nturning purple, their bodies writhing in the trenches. There were \n15,000 casualties that day, we are told. Chlorine gas, mustard gas, and \nblister gas caused a million casualties in World War I.\n  Wilfred Owen, the poet, wrote a description of a gas attack in the \nFirst World War. A company of exhausted soldiers is marching back from \nthe front lines, when suddenly someone shouts:\n\n       ``Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!''\n       An ecstasy of fumbling,\n       Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\n       But someone still was yelling out and stumbling;\n       And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime. . . .\n       Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\n       As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n       In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\n       He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n       If in some smothering dreams you too could pace\n       Behind the wagon we flung him in,\n       And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\n       His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;\n       If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\n       Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\n       Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\n       Of incurable sores on innocent tongues. . . .\n\n  That is Wilfred Owen describing a gas attack, an attack using \nchemical weapons.\n  Modern armies have the capability of protecting themselves in many \ncircumstances against chemical weapons with protective devices and \nprotective gear.\n  But of course civilians are the most vulnerable to chemical weapons. \nPerhaps the example that most of us remember was the attack at the \nTokyo subway by a terrorist group, a cult headquartered in Japan but \nactive in America. They used the nerve gas sarin in a terrorist attack. \nThe cult released the gas on March 20, 1995, during the morning rush \nhour at a busy Tokyo subway station. In that attack, 12 were killed, \nover 5,000 were injured. We are told that it was very close to a \ncircumstance in which thousands would have been killed from that \nattack. We all remember the frightening television images of people \nstaggering up out of the subway with their handkerchiefs over their \nmouths and collapsing on the street. Not surprisingly, the Japanese \nDiet, or parliament, ratified the chemical weapons treaty within a \nmonth of the Tokyo subway attack.\n  This raises the question of why the Senate has yet to do the same.\n  Why would people come to the floor of the Senate and say this is an \ninappropriate treaty and they intend to oppose it with every fiber of \ntheir being? Let me go through some of the myths we will hear about the \nchemical weapons treaty.\n  Myth one: by ratifying the chemical weapons treaty the United States \nwill\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\nsurrender a vital deterrent to chemical attack. That is not true at \nall. This is not about our weapons. It is about other countries' \nweapons. President Reagan already made a decision back in the 1980's \nthat we were going to get rid of our stock of chemical weapons. The \nquestion now is whether other countries will similarly abandon their \nstock of chemical weapons and join us in an approach that will verify \nthat other countries in the world are not producing chemical weapons.\n\n  Myth two: rogue states will refuse to join the treaty, so it will \nonly tie our hands, not theirs. As I just indicated, we are not \nproducing chemical weapons, we are destroying the stock of chemical \nweapons we now have. So it will not tie our hands. But the Chemical \nWeapons Convention will shrink the chemical weapon problem down to a \nfew rogue states and help curb their ability to get the materials \nnecessary to make chemical weapons.\n  Some say if you cannot prevent murder why should you have a law \nagainst murder. Common sense says murder is wrong, you have a law that \nprovides penalties for murder. The production of chemical gasses ought \nto be wrong and we ought to have a convention that says we intend as a \ncountry to be part of an effort to ban it from the world. The fact we \nmight have a few rogue nations wanting to produce them does not mean we \nought not decide to ratify this treaty. What we ought to do is join all \nof our friends around the world who feel similarly and go after the \nrogue nations to demand and make certain that they are not producing \nchemical weapons.\n  The treaty is unverifiable, people say. Well, no treaty is perfectly \nverifiable. We should not be making the perfect the enemy of the good. \nWe will be able to adequately verify this treaty.\n  The military use of chemical weapons requires significant testing and \nequipping or training of forces that will be difficult to hide in the \nface of the kind of investigation that will occur if this treaty is \napproved.\n  I will intend to proceed further with the myths that we will hear on \nthe floor of the Senate about the Chemical Weapons Convention, but let \nme do that at another time, because I intend to come to the floor on a \nnumber of additional occasions and talk about this subject. But other \nSenators are joining me on the floor to speak about this. Senator Levin \nfrom the State of Michigan is here. He has been one of the most \neloquent spokesman on this issue in the U.S. Senate and feels \npassionately about it. I am pleased he has joined me. Senator Bingaman \nis also coming to the floor, as are a couple of others.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from North \nDakota. His eloquent voice is indeed critical to the ratification of \nthis convention.\n  It is long overdue, Mr. President, that the Senate take up the \nChemical Weapons Convention and that we promptly provide our advice and \nour consent to its ratification so that the United States can join the \nconvention as an original party.\n  I will focus just for a few moments this morning on the military \nissues and the military implications as they relate to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention from my perspective as the ranking member on the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Under the 1985 treaty which was signed by President Reagan, we are \nalready unilaterally destroying our stockpile of unitary chemical \nweapons. We are doing this without a treaty, without being required to \ndo so, because of our own decision as to their limited military \nusefulness. This process is scheduled to be completed by the year 2004. \nThis is a point which Secretary Cohen makes very, very effectively.\n  This is not an issue of saying we will give up our chemical weapons \nif the other guys do the same thing. We are already unilaterally \ndestroying our chemical weapons. The question now is whether we will \njoin a convention where other countries are going to do what we are \nalready doing unilaterally. So the destruction of our chemical weapons \nwill take place whether or not the Senate ratifies this convention. It \nwill require other nations to do what we are already doing and will \nreduce the risk of chemical attacks against our troops and our country \nin the process.\n\n  This convention will enter into force on April 29, with or without \nthe United States being a party. So the question before the Senate is \nnot whether the Chemical Weapons Convention is a perfect treaty. It is \nwhether or not we want the United States to have a role in overseeing \nand implementing this convention so that it greatly enhances our \nsecurity. Our military and our civilian defense leadership give a \nresounding yes to the question of whether or not the United States \nshould ratify this convention.\n  First, here is the testimony of General Shalikashvili, the Chairman \nof our Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the Foreign Relations Committee, \nlast March 28, 1996. This is what General Shalikashvili said:\n\n       From a military perspective, the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention is clearly in our national interest. The \n     Convention's advantages outweigh its shortcomings. The United \n     States and all other CW capable state parties incur the same \n     obligation to destroy their chemical weapon stockpile. While \n     less than perfect, the verification regime allows for \n     intrusive inspections while protecting national security \n     concerns. The nonproliferation aspects of the convention will \n     retard the spread of chemical weapons and, in so doing, \n     reduce the probability that U.S. forces may encounter \n     chemical weapons in a regional conflict. Finally, while \n     foregoing the ability to retaliate in kind, the U.S. military \n     retains the wherewithal to deter and defend against a \n     chemical weapons attack. I strongly support this convention \n     and respectfully request your consent to ratification.\n  General Shalikashvili told this to the Foreign Relations Committee a \nyear ago.\n  Then he said in another point in his testimony to the Armed Services \nCommittee last month that all of the chiefs of staff and the commanders \nin chief of our combatant commanders support the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``I fully \nsupport early ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and in \nthat respect I reflect the views of the Joint Chiefs and the combatant \ncommanders.''\n  Now, this is really quite an important point, I believe, for the U.S. \nSenate. We have the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, we have all of the \nChiefs, all of our combatant commanders urging us to ratify the \nChemical Weapons Convention because our troops will be safer with the \nconvention in effect than if it is not in effect. That ought to count \nheavily with the U.S. Senate. It is not always true that you have that \nkind of a unified position on the part of our uniformed military. It is \nnot always true that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs can say that all \nof the Chiefs, all of the combatant commanders, agree that a certain \ncourse of action ought to be taken in the U.S. Senate. But it is true \nin this case.\n  As I mentioned, Secretary Cohen, when he was still the Secretary-\ndesignate for his current position, testified as follows, before the \nArmed Services Committee, when asked whether or not he supports the \nratification of the convention prior to the April 29 deadline, and \nthis, basically, is his answer:\n\n       Yes. The CWC, as both a disarmament and a nonproliferation \n     treaty, is very much in our national security interest \n     because it:\n       No. 1, establishes an international mandate for the \n     destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles;\n       No. 2, prohibits the development, retention, storage, \n     preparations for use, and use of chemical weapons;\n       No. 3, increases the probability of detecting militarily \n     significant violations of the CWC; and\n       No. 4, hinders the development of clandestine CW \n     stockpiles.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the detailed explanation \nof Secretary Cohen for each of those conclusions be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Establishes an international mandate for the destruction of \n     chemical weapons (CW) stockpiles. Congress has mandated that \n     the Army, as executive agent for CW destruction, eliminate \n     its unitary CW, which constitute the bulk of its CW \n     stockpile, by 31 December 2004. That destruction process is \n     well under way at the CW destruction facilities at Johnston \n     Atoll and Tooele, UT. The CWC mandates that state parties \n     destroy, under a strict verification regime, their entire CW \n     stockpiles within 10 years after the\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\n     Convention enters into force (April 2007). Given that the \n     U.S. does not need CW for its security, and given that we are \n     currently legally committed to eliminating unilaterally the \n     vast majority of our CW stockpile, common sense suggests that \n     it would be preferable to secure a commitment from other \n     nations to do the same.\n       Prohibits the development, retention, storage, preparations \n     for use, and use of CW. These expansive prohibitions \n     establish a broadly accepted international norm that will \n     form a basis for international action against those states \n     parties that violate the CWC. Unlike the 1925 Geneva \n     Protocol, which only bans the use of CW in war, the CWC: \n     includes a verification regime; restricts the export of \n     certain dual-use CW precursor chemicals to non-state parties; \n     prohibits assisting other states, organizations, or personnel \n     in acquiring CW; and requires state parties to implement \n     legislation prohibiting its citizens and organizations from \n     engaging in activities prohibited by the Convention. The CWC \n     also contains mechanisms for recommending multilateral \n     sanctions, including recourse to the UN Security Council.\n       Increases the probability of detecting militarily \n     significant violations of the CWC. While no treaty is 100% \n     verifiable, the CWC contains complementary and overlapping \n     declaration and inspection requirements. These requirements \n     increase the probability of detecting militarily significant \n     violations of the Convention. While detecting illicit \n     production of small quantities of CW will be extremely \n     difficult, it is easier to detect large scale production, \n     filling and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Over time, \n     through declaration, routine inspections, fact-finding, \n     consultation, and challenge inspection mechanisms, the CWC's \n     verification regime should prove effective in providing \n     information on significant CW programs that would not \n     otherwise be available.\n       Hinders the development of clandestine CW stockpiles. \n     Through systematic on-site verification, routine declarations \n     and trade restrictions, the Convention makes it more \n     difficult for would-be proliferators to acquire, from CWC \n     state parties precursor chemicals required for developing \n     chemical weapons. The mutually supportive trade restrictions \n     and verification provisions of the Convention increase the \n     transparency of CW-relevant activities. These provisions will \n     provide the U.S. with otherwise unavailable information that \n     will facilitate U.S. detection and monitoring of illicit CW \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Secretary Cohen concluded by saying the following:\n\n       I strongly support the Chemical Weapons Convention and the \n     goal of U.S. ratification of the convention by April 29, 1997 \n     . . . U.S. ratification of the Convention prior to this date \n     will ensure that the U.S. receives one of the 41 seats on the \n     Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of \n     Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international organization that \n     will oversee CWC implementation. Early ratification will also \n     ensure that U.S. citizens will fill key positions within the \n     OPCW and act as inspectors for the Organization. Direct U.S. \n     involvement and leadership will ensure the efficacy and \n     efficiency of the OPCW during the critical early stages of \n     the Convention's implementation. The U.S., upon ratification \n     and implementation of the CWC, will also receive CW-related \n     information from other state parties. As a state party and a \n     member of the Executive Council, the U.S. will be in the best \n     position to assure the effective implementation of the \n     Convention's verification provisions.\n  Now, that is our former colleague, Bill Cohen. It is an exceptionally \nclear and cogent statement of why the CWC is in our international \ninterest. Defense Secretary Perry before him, said the following before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on March 28, 1996:\n\n       In conclusion, the Department of Defense considers the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention a well-balanced treaty that, in \n     conjunction with our other efforts against CW proliferation, \n     a robust chemical protection program and maintenance of a \n     range of nonchemical response capabilities, will serve the \n     best interests of the United States and the world community. \n     The Department of Defense strongly supports the Convention. I \n     respectfully request that the Senate give its advice and \n     consent to ratification this spring.\n\n  Mr. President, our military, today, enjoys a high level of protection \nagainst chemical weapons. The treaty specifically permits that level of \nprotection and any additional level of protection to continue. We spend \nabout $500 million a year on chemical and biological defenses. The \nSenate should help assure that our forces maintain an effective \ncapability to defend themselves. We plan on doing just that in the \nbudget that we will be submitting to the Senate.\n  But by not ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention, we would be \ngiving other nations an excuse for delaying or rejecting ratification, \nwhile taking the pressure off of pariah states to join the treaty.\n  General Schwarzkopf, retired now, recently testified as follows:\n\n       I am very, very much in favor of the ratification of that \n     treaty. We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future \n     warfares. And, frankly, by not ratifying that treaty, we \n     align ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea, and \n     I'd just as soon not be associated with those thugs in this \n     particular matter. So I am very, very much in favor of \n     ratification of that particular treaty.\n\n  Admiral Zumwalt, now retired, said the following relative to this \ntreaty. He was the Chief of Naval operations in the early 1970's. He \nsaid:\n\n       If we refuse to ratify, some governments will use our \n     refusal as an excuse to keep their chemical weapons. \n     Worldwide availability of chemical weapons will be higher, \n     and we will know less about other countries' chemical \n     activities. The diplomatic credibility of our threat of \n     retaliation against anyone who uses chemical weapons on our \n     troops will be undermined by our lack of ``clean hands.''\n\n  Admiral Zumwalt, who, in this article I am quoting from in the \nWashington Post of January 6, 1997, pointed out that he is not a dove. \nAs a matter of fact, he said he helped lead the opposition to the SALT \nII treaty because he was convinced that it would give the Soviet Union \na strategic advantage. This is someone who has a history of being \nskeptical in terms of arms control agreements. Admiral Zumwalt in the \nWashington Post that day added the following:\n\n       At the bottom line, our failure to ratify will \n     substantially increase the risk of a chemical attack against \n     American service personnel.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Admiral Zumwalt's entire article in the \nWashington Post of January 6, 1997, be printed in the Record at this \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 6, 1997]\n\n                    A Needless Risk for U.S. Troops\n\n                         (By E.R. Zumwalt Jr.)\n\n       It has been more than 80 years since poison gas was first \n     used in modern warfare--in April 1915 during the first year \n     of World War I. It is long past time to do something about \n     such weapons.\n       I am not a dove. As a young naval officer in 1945, I \n     supported the use of nuclear weapons against Japan. As chief \n     of naval operations two decades ago, I pressed for \n     substantially higher military spending than the nation's \n     political leadership was willing to grant. After retiring \n     from the Navy, I helped lead the opposition to the SALT II \n     treaty because I was convinced it would give the Soviet Union \n     strategic advantage.\n       Now the Senate is considering whether to approve the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. This is a worldwide treaty, \n     negotiated by the Reagan administration and signed by the \n     Bush administration. It bans the development, production, \n     possession, transfer and use of chemical weapons. Senate \n     opposition to ratification is led by some with whom I often \n     agree. But in this case, I believe they do a grave disservice \n     to America's men and women in uniform.\n       To a Third World leader indifferent to the health of his \n     own troops and seeking to cause large-scale pain and death \n     for its own sake, chemical weapons have a certain attraction. \n     They don't require the advanced technology needed to build \n     nuclear weapons. Nor do they require the educated populace \n     needed to crate a modern conventional military. But they \n     cannot give an inferior force a war-winning capability. In \n     the Persian Gulf war, the threat of our uncompromising \n     retaliation with convention weapons deterred Saddam Hussein \n     from using his chemical arsenal against us.\n       Next time, our adversary may be more berserk than Saddam, \n     and deterrence may fail. If that happens, our retaliation \n     will be decisive, devastating--and no help to the young \n     American men and women coming home dead or bearing grevious \n     chemical injuries. What will help is a treaty removing \n     huge quanities of chemical weapons that could otherwise be \n     used against us.\n       Militarily, this treaty will make us stronger. During the \n     Bush administration, our nation's military and political \n     leadership decided to retire our chemical weapons. This wise \n     move was not made because of treaties. Rather, it was based \n     on the fact that chemical weapons are not useful for us.\n       Politically and diplomatically, the barriers against their \n     use by a First World country are massive. Militarily, they \n     are risky and unpredictable to use, difficult and dangerous \n     to store. They serve no purpose that can't be met by our \n     overwhelming convention at forces.\n       So the United States has no deployed chemical weapons today \n     and will have none in the future. But the same is not true of \n     our potential adversaries. More than a score of nations now \n     seeks or possesses chemical weapons. Some are rogue states \n     which we may some day clash.\n       This treaty is entirely about eliminating other people's \n     weapons--weapons that may some day be used against Americans. \n     For the American military, U.S. ratification of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention is high gain and low or no pain. In that \n     light, I find it astonishing that any American opposes \n     ratification.\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\n       Opponents argue that the treaty isn't perfect: Verification \n     isn't absolute, forms must be filled out, not every nation \n     will join at first and so forth. This is unperuasive. Nothing \n     in the real world is perfect. If the U.S. Navy had refused to \n     buy any weapon unless it worked perfectly every time, we \n     would have bought nothing and now would be diarmed. The \n     question is not how this treaty compares with perfection. The \n     question is now U.S. ratification compares with its absence.\n       If we refuse to ratify, some governments will use our \n     refusal as an exuse to keep their chemical weapons. Worldwide \n     availability of chemical weapons will be higher, and we will \n     know less about other countries' chemical activities. The \n     diplomatic credibility of our threat of retaliation against \n     anyone who uses chemical weapons on our troops will be \n     undermined by our lack of ``clean hands.'' At the bottom \n     line, our failure to ratify will substantially increase the \n     risk of a chemical attack against American service personnel.\n       If such as attack occurs, the news reports of its victims \n     in our military hospitals will of course produce rapid \n     ratification of the treaty and rapid replacement of senators \n     who enabled the horror by opposing ratification. But for the \n     victims, it will be too late.\n       Every man and woman who puts on a U.S. military uniform \n     faces possible injury or death in the national interest. They \n     don't complain; risk is part of their job description. But it \n     is also part of the job description of every U.S. senator to \n     see that this risk not be increased unnecessarily.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter written by a very distinguished group of retired four-star \ngenerals and admirals who support the Chemical Weapons Convention be \nprinted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 3, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As former members of the United States \n     Armed Forces, we write to express our strong support for \n     Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). \n     This landmark treaty serves the national security interests \n     of the United States.\n       Each of us can point to decades of military experience in \n     command positions. We have all trained and commanded troops \n     to prepare for the wartime use of chemical weapons and for \n     defenses against them. We all recognize the limited military \n     utility of these weapons, and supported President Bush's \n     decision to renounce the use of an offensive chemical weapons \n     capability and to unilaterally destroy U.S. stockpiles. The \n     CWC simply mandates that other countries follow our lead. \n     This is the primary contribution of the CWC: to destroy \n     militarily-significant stockpiles of chemical weapons around \n     the globe.\n       We recognize that the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, including chemical agents, presents a major \n     national security threat to the U.S. The CWC cannot eliminate \n     this threat, as terrorists and rogue states may still be able \n     to evade the treaty's strict controls. However, the treaty \n     does destroy existing stockpiles and improves our abilities \n     to gather intelligence on emerging threats. These new \n     intelligence tools deserve the Senate's support.\n       On its own, the CWC cannot guarantee complete security \n     against chemical weapons. We must continue to support robust \n     defense capabilities, and remain willing to respond--through \n     the CWC or by unilateral action--to violators of the \n     Convention. Our focus is not on the treaty's limitations, but \n     instead on its many strengths. The CWC destroys stockpiles \n     that could threaten our troops; it significantly improves our \n     intelligence capabilities; and it creates new international \n     sanctions to punish those states who remain outside of the \n     treaty. For these reasons, we strongly support the CWC.\n         Stanley R. Arthur, Admiral, USN (Ret); Michael Dugan, \n           General, USAF (Ret); Charles A. Horner, General, USAF \n           (Ret); David Jones, General, USAF (Ret); Wesley L. \n           McDonald, Admiral, USN (Ret); Merrill A. McPeak, \n           General, USAF (Ret); Carl E.

Woerner, General, USA (Ret); Admiral E.R. \n           Zumwalt, Jr., Admiral, USN (Ret).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one paragraph from that letter says the \nfollowing:\n\n       On its own, the CWC cannot guarantee complete security \n     against chemical weapons. We must continue to support robust \n     defense capabilities, and remain willing to respond--through \n     the CWC or by unilateral action--to violators of the \n     Convention. Our focus is not on the treaty's limitations, but \n     instead on its many strengths. The CWC destroys stockpiles \n     that could threaten our troops; it significantly improves our \n     intelligence capabilities, and it creates new international \n     sanctions to punish those states who remain outside of the \n     treaty. For these reasons, we strongly support the CWC.\n\n  Former Secretary of State, Jim Baker, spoke out very strongly in \nsupport of the CWC the other day and said:\n\n       If we fail to ratify the convention, we will imperil our \n     leadership in the entire area of nonproliferation, perhaps \n     the most vital security issue of the post-cold war era.\n\n  Mr. President, before we have a chance to vote on the CWC, we will be \nvoting on a bill introduced by Senator Kyl, S. 495. It is a 70-page \nbill that effects our efforts relative to chemical and biological \nweapons. The contrast between the lack of analysis of that bill, the \ncontrast between the absence of hearings on that bill and the \nthoroughness with which the Chemical Weapons Convention has been \nanalyzed, is enormous. We have had about 18 hearings on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. We have had dozens of briefings for Senators and \nour staffs. We have had 1,500 pages of information on the CWC, which \nhas been provided to the Senate by the administration: 300 pages of \ntestimony; 500 pages of answers to letters and reports; 400 pages of \nanswers to questions for the record; 300 pages of other documentation. \nThat is what we have had in the 3\\1/2\\ years that the Chemical Weapons \nConvention has been before us. The bill introduced by Senator Kyl has \nbeen in front of us for a few weeks.\n  So we have had the convention before us for 3\\1/2\\ years, with 18 \nhearings, hundreds of pages of documents, answers, et cetera, a \nthorough and complete and exhaustive analysis of this convention. It is \nlong, long overdue that it come before the Senate. Hopefully, we are \ngoing to ratify it and not be deterred from ratification in any way by \na bill recently introduced, just a few weeks ago, with 70 pages of \ncomplicated text relative to the same subject, but which doesn't affect \nanybody else's weapons, only our own.\n  Mr. President, I want, again, to thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his leadership in this area. It is important to this Nation's \nposition and posture in the world as a leader that a convention that \nwas designed by us, negotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush, supported \nby them, a bipartisan convention, be finally brought before the Senate \nfor debate and ratification.\n  I thank the Chair and my friend from North Dakota for yielding me \nsome time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me, first of all, \ncompliment my colleague from Michigan on his excellent statement. I \nagree with each of his points. It is past time for the Senate to bring \nthis issue to the floor for debate, to debate it seriously, to make \nwhatever modifications or changes or conditions the Senate believes is \nappropriate, if any, and to get on with ratifying the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Mr. President, one of the challenges in discussing the Chemical \nWeapons Convention is to figure out how to bring this home to the \naverage American that this is an issue and a concern that is important \nto them. Many people say, well, this is long term, this is \ninternational, this doesn't relate to me right here in River City, or \nSanta Fe, NM, or Silver City, NM, or wherever their hometown happens to \nbe. But, in fact, the convention intends to reduce the likelihood that \nany of our troops or any American civilians in the future will be \ninjured or killed as a result of chemical weapons.\n\n  The history of the use of chemical weapons is better known by others \nthan by me. My understanding is that the first time there was \nsignificant use of chemical weapons was in the First World War. There \nhave been instances since then. We have heard much in the news \nrecently, for example, about the injuries that some of our personnel in \nthe gulf war encountered by virtue of the accidental destruction of \nIraqi chemical weapons by some of our own military actions.\n  So the issue is real, and the question is, what can we do as a \nnation? What can we do as a Senate to lessen the risk that chemical \nweapons will, in fact, injure Americans in the future? I think\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nratifying this treaty at this time is clearly the most important thing \nwe can do.\n  I hope very much that we go ahead and enter a into a unanimous-\nconsent agreement today and begin formal debate of the treaty. We are \nnot in formal debate as of yet because we have been unable to get \nagreement among all Senators to bring the treaty to the floor. We need \nto get that agreement and bring it to the floor, and we need to go \nahead with the debate. The reason that it is time-sensitive, Mr. \nPresident, is that the treaty goes into effect on the 29th of this \nmonth. Now, some say it doesn't matter whether we are part of it at the \ntime it goes into effect or whether we are not part of it. They say we \ncan come along later. The problem is that international agreements have \nbeen made for the treaty to go into effect. American experts have been \nworking with experts from other countries in putting together protocols \nand plans for implementing this treaty and the inspections that would \nbe made under the treaty. All of that has been ongoing. If we are not \npart of the initial group of ratifying nations--it's a very large \ngroup; I think 161 nations have signed this treaty. If we are not part \nof that group when the treaty goes into effect, then the experts from \nour country that have been involved in establishing protocols and plans \nfor inspection will be excluded from management and inspection teams \nand others will be put in their place. Perhaps at a later date we could \njoin, but, clearly, it is not in our interest to have an international \ntreaty of this importance begin without us being a part of it.\n  I also point out an obvious point, which I am sure has been made many \ntimes in this debate. The sanctions called for in this treaty against \ncountries that are not party to the treaty will be imposed on our own \nchemical companies. Many of the objections that have been raised about \nthe treaty are, in fact, in my view, groundless for the simple reason \nthat our own chemical manufacturers in this country have come out in \nstrong support of the treaty. They want to be part of this. They \nunderstand the inspections that will be taking place. They readily \nsubject themselves to those inspections, and they do not want sanctions \nimposed upon them that keep them from selling chemicals that can be \nused for chemical weapons, but can also have commercial uses at the \nsame time. They would like to continue to be major participants in the \nworld market in chemicals. They estimate that the loss to our chemical \nmanufacturers could be around $600 million per year if we don't ratify \nthe treaty and if sanctions are imposed on us because we are outside \nthe treaty.\n  Mr. President, there are various objections that have been raised. In \nmy opinion, I have never seen a treaty where there has been more effort \nto accommodate very groundless objections. We have some objections \nwhich are not groundless--I will acknowledge that--and concerns that \nare valid and need to be considered and addressed. We are doing that. \nBut many of the objections that have been raised, in my opinion, are \nreally grasping at straws by people who are trying to find some basis \nupon which to oppose this treaty.\n  The context in which this needs to be considered--this, again, has \nbeen said many times here, and I have said it myself--is that we passed \na law while President Reagan was in the White House that renounced the \nuse of chemical weapons by this country and which put us on a path to \ndestroy our own chemical weapons capability. President Reagan signed \nthat law. That has been the policy of our Government through the Reagan \nadministration, through the Bush administration, through the Clinton \nadministration, and now into the second Clinton administration.\n  We have unilaterally made the decision that we do not need chemical \nweapons in order to look out for national security concerns. We have \nmany other ways to deal with countries that would use chemical weapons.\n  By signing this agreement, by going ahead and ratifying the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, we are not giving up any of the other arrows in our \nquiver, so to speak. We have the ability to retaliate against the use \nof chemical weapons in any way we determine to retaliate, whether we \nare a signatory or not. So we do not lose anything by ratifying it and \nbecoming part of this convention. We gain, however, a substantial \namount. For that reason, I think the treaty should go forward.\n  Since we have unilaterally decided not to have chemical weapons, not \nto produce chemical weapons, not to maintain a stockpile of chemical \nweapons, and not to use chemical weapons in the future, how can it not \nbe in our interest to try to ensure that other countries make that same \ndecision? How can it not be in our interest to join with international \ninspection groups to investigate and ascertain that the countries that \nare signatories to this treaty do not in fact violate the convention?\n  As I indicated before, our manufacturers agree. If you want to \ninspect us, come on in. We are glad to have you come in and inspect our \nplants. We are not going to have chemical weapons, we are not going to \nstockpile chemical weapons, and, therefore, come on in and investigate \nus.\n  If we ratify this treaty, we can be part of the inspection teams that \ngo to other countries to make the same determination. Some people say, \n``Well, the problem with it is that not all nations are going to sign \nonto the treaty.'' That is true. Not all nations are. That is very, \nvery true. To deal with that circumstance, the treaty calls for \nsanctions against those countries that don't ratify the treaty. We \ncannot enforce the treaty against countries that don't ratify the \ntreaty, but we can impose sanctions upon their ability to purchase or \nto sell chemicals that have dual use--that can be used in chemical \nweapons as well as in commercial purposes. That is a significant tool \nthat this convention will give us.\n  I do not know of another circumstance--at least in the time I have \nbeen here in the Senate--where we have made the unilateral decision to \ntake action that a treaty calls for us to take. For us to now say, \n``OK, we have already decided to take the actions that the treaty calls \nfor us to take, but we do not know whether we want to go ahead and \nratify the treaty so that others also will take those same actions'' is \nnonsensical to me. We need to recognize that in the large scheme of \nthings, this country needs to provide leadership in the world. That \nleadership includes ratifying this treaty and going forward with \nputting the protocols for its enforcement in place and participating in \nthe inspection teams required for its implementation. That is exactly \nwhat is required. There have been endless negotiations within the \nForeign Relations Committee in an effort to accommodate concerns that \nhave been raised. I was not party to those negotiations. I have seen \nthe results of them. Quite frankly, I am amazed at the extent of the \nconditions that we have agreed should be adopted to allay concerns of \ndifferent Members. I think that is fine. I have no problem with any of \nthe conditions. I also support whatever is acceptable to the \nadministration, which has primary authority in this area and primary \nresponsibility to enforce the treaty. If they believe these conditions \nare acceptable, then fine, they are acceptable to me as well. But we do \nneed to get on with ratifying the treaty. We need to get on with \nproviding the additional confidence we can to the American public and \nto assure them that their security concerns are being dealt with \nresponsibly.\n\n  I believe very strongly that this treaty is in the best interest of \nour country and the best interest of the people of my State. I think it \nwould be a travesty for us to fail to ratify it, and particularly it \nwould be a travesty if we failed to even bring it before the Senate for \na vote. That has not happened. I understand the majority leader has \nworked very diligently to bring that about, and I believe he is on the \nverge of doing so. I commend him for that. But the reality of the \nsituation is very straightforward--this treaty needs to be ratified. It \nneeds to be ratified soon. The clock is ticking. Our leadership \nposition in the world is at stake, and the security of future \ngenerations is also at stake.\n  I see that we have both Senators from Massachusetts ready to speak. I \ndo not want to delay them. I ask if either of them wishes to speak on \nthe treaty at this point.\n  How much time remains on the treaty?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 11 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have had a long history in the world of \nattempts to rid the planet of the scourge of chemical weapons. That \neffort began after World War I, as a result of the searing experiences \nof troops in Europe during that war near the beginning of this century \nwhen chemical weapons were used for the first time in a general way in \nwarfare. Those efforts in the early part of the century resulted, in \n1925, in the negotiation in Geneva of an accord that bans the use of \nchemical weapons.\n  Since that time, the world's more powerful nations have not used them \nin war, including World War II. There are a couple of rogue states that \nhave used them. Iraq's use against the Kurds and in its war with Iran \nis the instance most often cited. But despite the progress in seeking \nto eliminate the use of chemical weapons, the fact is that efforts to \nban the manufacture and storage of poisonous gas has hit one brick wall \nafter another over the years.\n  In the past 25 years a substantial effort has been made to achieve an \ninternational agreement to ban manufacture and storage of chemical \nweapons. The Nixon and Ford administrations--both of whom, of course, \nwere Republicans--worked toward this objective, albeit without success. \nThe administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan reinvigorated \ninternational efforts to achieve such an agreement during the early \n1980's. When Vice President Bush was elected President, his \nadministration assumed the responsibility for continuing those \nnegotiations that were handed off by the predecessor administration in \nwhich he had served as Vice President, and I believe most people \nultimately will judge that President Bush and his administration's \nnegotiators acquitted themselves well in this regard.\n  After intense and lengthy negotiations, initial success was achieved \nin 1992 when the Chemical Weapons Convention was completed in Geneva \nand was approved by the United Nations. In early 1993, shortly before \nleaving office, the Bush administration, representing the United \nStates, joined with 129 other nations to sign the convention, and the \nprocess of ratification of the treaty began. On November 23 of that \nyear, the Clinton administration submitted the convention formally to \nthe Senate for its advice and consent.\n  So here we are now, 4 years from the time when the convention became \navailable for ratification, finally about to exercise our \nconstitutional responsibility in the Senate.\n  I wish that we had acted sooner. But it is my understanding that we \nnow are going to act--that the majority leader has made a commitment to \nbring up the resolution of ratification on the Senate floor next week \nso that we can act prior to the critical day of April 29.\n  Let me digress to address the subject of the importance of April 29 \nto this treaty. April 29, less than 2 weeks from today, is the day on \nwhich the convention takes effect. Some Members and others have \nsuggested in hearings and elsewhere that this is not a critical date; \nthat we somehow have an extraordinary power to unilaterally dictate the \nUnited States can impose changes in the convention beyond that date. \nThe fact is that April 29 is the date on which all the nations that \nhave ratified the convention expect the convention to take effect, per \nits terms to which all signatory nations including the United States \nagreed. They believe they have a right to expect that others will have \nlived by the same rules by which they have lived.\n  There is a certain contradiction in suggesting that you are going to \ntake the leadership in drafting and seeking support for a treaty which \nis designed to become international law, and which establishes a set of \nrules that you and others propose to follow, and before it even takes \neffect you unilaterally decide you are going to break the first rule it \ncontains which is the date by which you must agree to be a full \nsupporter and participant in order to have a part in setting up on the \nongoing procedures and regulations that will apply its terms to all \nparticipants. I think those who suggest the United States can simply \nignore this deadline--while still seeking international support for \nsome treaty to address the chemical weapons concern, a treaty they \nbelieve should be altered in various ways from the treaty that is now \nbefore the Senate--are evidencing a kind of arrogance on behalf of our \ncountry that often gets us in trouble with our allies and friends and \nwith nations we would like to have as allies and friends.\n  Even more troubling, Mr. President, is the fact that there are some \nin the Senate, some Members of the Republican Party, who seem to have a \ndeep-seated aversion to any kind of arms control treaty. As we draw \nclose to the point where the Senate will exercise its constitutional \nrole of advise and consent, we are seeing a desperate effort launched \nto grab onto any kind of straw to suggest that this treaty is not good \nfor the United States of America. We are seeing a host of problems \nconjured up, and I do mean literally conjured up, to prevent the \nassembly of a two-thirds majority of the Senate to approve the \nresolution of ratification.\n  I only have a brief amount of time in the Chamber today, but I want \nto address some of the principal arguments that are being advanced as a \nrationale for suggesting that this treaty is not in the best interests \nof the United States. I have spoken previously at some length in this \nChamber about the convention, and I will speak again as we formally \ntake up the debate, but today I want to address briefly several of the \nclaims made by opponents.\n  First, opponents say that the convention could jeopardize \nconfidential business information through frivolous so-called challenge \ninspections that the critics claim would provide international \ninspectors with extraordinary access to files, data, and equipment of \nU.S. chemical companies, and that the inspectors themselves could be \nspies for adversary nations or for nations whose chemical industries \ncompete with our own. These critics, in effect, are anointing \nthemselves the great protectors of the U.S. chemical industry from an \nespionage threat they perceive.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there is a person in this Chamber \nthat does not want to take all needed steps to thwart espionage, but \nlet me note the facts. The Chemical Manufacturers Association strongly \nsupports the Chemical Weapons Convention. Its representatives helped \nwrite the rules contained in the convention pertaining to treatment of \nconfidential business information. Not surprisingly, protecting trade \nsecrets was at the very top of their priority list during the treaty \nnegotiations.\n  Further, the CMA conducted seven full-fledged trial inspections of \nchemical facilities just as would be conducted under the treaty's \nterms, to make certain that the protections against industrial \nespionage were strong. The Chemical Manufacturers Association is \nsatisfied that those protections are sufficient to safeguard U.S. trade \nsecrets. Furthermore, the treaty gives our Government the right to \nreject ahead of time for any reason whatsoever any inspectors that we \nbelieve would try to spy at U.S. facilities.\n\n  Second, Mr. President, opponents say that the convention inspection \nrequirements may involve unreasonable search and seizure which would \nviolate the fourth amendment to the Constitution.\n  Again, they are wrong. The facts are that at the insistence of our \nown negotiators who were fully cognizant of issues of search and \nseizure, the Chemical Weapons Convention explicitly allows party \nnations to take into account their own constitutional obligations when \nproviding access for a challenge inspection. Constitutional rights in \nthe United States have not been weakened or relinquished. Both the CWC \nand its draft implementing legislation fully protect U.S. citizens, \nincluding businesses, from unreasonable search and seizure. In \naddition, the treaty allows sensitive equipment information or areas of \nan inspected facility not related to chemical production or storage \nthat are the subjects of the inspection to be protected during any \nchallenge inspection by adhering to approved managed access techniques.\n  Further, treaty proponents are prepared to accept, and Senator Biden \nhas\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nnegotiated with Senator Helms, a condition of ratification which will \nprovide that search warrants will be obtained through the normal \nprocess for all challenge inspections.\n  A third issue: Opponents say that adherence to the convention's \nprovisions by party nations cannot be perfectly verified. What is \noccurring here is that the opponents are trying to make the perfect the \nenemy of the good. I can say that, in the 12 years I have been in the \nSenate as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and deeply \ninvolved in work on a number of arms control agreements, I do not think \nI have ever seen an arms control agreement that is absolutely, \nperfectly, 100 percent verifiable. I do not think anybody who \nnegotiates arms control agreements believes such perfection is \nattainable.\n  Perfection is not the standard by which we should make a judgment as \nto whether we have a good or bad treaty. Both our national defense \nleadership and intelligence community leadership have testified \nrepeatedly that this treaty will provide them with additional tools \nthat they do not have today which will help them gain more and better \nknowledge about what is happening in the world regarding chemical \nweapons and their precursors.\n  So the test is not can you perfectly verify compliance with the \nConvention's requirements; the test is do you enhance the security and \nintelligence interests of your country beyond where they would be \nwithout the treaty. Our defense and intelligence community leaders \nanswer a resounding yes to that question.\n  Fourth, opponents say that the nations about whose chemical \nactivities we are most greatly concerned, the rogue nations like Iraq \nand Libya and North Korea, will not become parties to the treaty and, \nif they are not parties to the treaty, it will not give us enough \nprotection from chemical weapons to warrant our being a party to it.\n  This is a red herring of enormous proportions for the following \nreasons. As I stand in the Chamber today and the Presiding Officer sits \non the dais, there is absolutely nothing to prevent those rogue nations \nfrom doing exactly what people say they fear. There is not even an \ninternational regime in place that makes manufacture and storage of \nchemical weapons illegal, or that provides a way to track the movement \nof such chemicals and their precursors so that there is a greater \nlikelihood the world will know when rogues are engaging in conduct we \nbelieve should not occur, or that gives the world a way in which to \nhold such nations accountable.\n  I pose a simple question: Is the United States in a stronger position \nif it is a party to an international treaty in force, to which most \nnations of the world are trying to adhere, when a nation not a party to \nthe treaty is seen to be engaging in behavior violating the treaty's \nterms, or is the United States better off with every nation just going \nabout its own business without any protocol at all, without any \ninternational standard, without any means to obtain accountability when \na nation violates a standard of behavior to which the great majority of \nthe world's nations have formally decreed they believe all nations \nshould adhere.\n\n  I think most people would say that if the United States ratifies this \nConvention, our circumstance relative to rogue nations is in no way \nworse than it is now. We give up nothing, but we gain important \nadvantages. What are they?\n  First, under present circumstances, the manufacture and storage of \nchemical weapons is not illegal under international law or custom. The \nConvention will provide that law and custom. It will then be possible \nto focus international opprobrium on nations violating its standards, \nbe they participant or nonparticipant nations.\n  Moreover, with 72 nations already having ratified, and others certain \nto follow, especially if the United States ratifies before April 29, \nthere will be a quantum leap forward in the capacity to track the \nmanufacture and sale of chemicals that can be used as weapons, or \nprecursor chemicals, and this enhanced capacity will help us determine \nwhat nations might be acting in a way that ultimately could do injury \nto our country.\n  It is important for everyone to remember that this treaty will \ngreatly assist our efforts to impede the production and storage of \nchemical weapons. Therefore, it will make it less likely that our \ntroops or our civilians will ever be put in harm's way by being \nsubjected to an attack by chemical weapons.\n  I might remind my colleagues that, no matter what we do with respect \nto this treaty, we are not going to be manufacturing chemical weapons \nin the United States. That is the track we are on under our current \nlaw. The logic seems unassailable to me that the United States will be \na lot better off if we bring the family of nations into a regimen which \nhelps us guard against trafficking in those chemicals and which \nrequires party nations to dispose of their own stocks of chemical \nweapons and not manufacture others.\n  Fifth, opponents say that participating in the chemical weapons \ntreaty will make the United States less vigilant about the risks of \nchemical attacks by organized armies or by terrorists and about the \nneed to maintain defenses against those threats. Well, shame on us if \nthat were to be true. I do not think anybody who is supportive of this \ntreaty wants--and I know I do not want--to let down our guard with \nrespect to the possibility of another nation, rogue or otherwise, \ncreating a chemical weapon and using it against us. I absolutely \nbelieve it is vital that we have a robust defense which will protect us \nin the event that someone were to try to break out and do that. But I \nthink this is a tactic of desperation, because if you follow the logic \nof this criticism to its conclusion, we ought to make certain that our \nadversaries have chemical weapons to be sure we have sufficient \nincentive to defend against them, if that is what it takes in order to \nbuild our defenses.\n  I emphasize two points here. First, there is nothing whatsoever that \nany arms control agreement does that necessarily lessens our resolve to \ndefend against the threat that the agreement is intended to reduce. \nAnd, second, neither the Clinton administration nor this Congress is \ngoing to play ostrich on this issue. The Clinton administration's \nbudget calls for $225 million in increases in the Defense Department's \nfunding for chemical and biological defense over the next 6 years. A \n$225 million increase hardly equates to a notion that we are being \nlulled to sleep or into some kind of complacency. I am willing to bet \nwith any Member of this body that the ratification of the CWC will not \nresult in a reduction of our chemical weapons defense efforts.\n  Mr. President, in the next few days we will face a debate which I \nhope will be conducted on the facts. I devoutly hope that we do not \nwaste time debating the question of whether this treaty is a perfect \ntreaty--of course it is not. Instead, I hope we squarely face and \ndebate the question of whether the security of the United States of \nAmerica and of the entire world is improved by United States \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I respectfully submit to my colleagues that when they look at the \nfacts, when they measure what the U.S. chemical industry has done to \nprotect itself, when they measure what we are doing to strengthen our \ndefenses against chemical weapons, when they measure what being a party \nnation to the Convention will provide us in terms of intelligence and \ninformation, when they measure what this does in terms of the ability \nto track chemicals throughout the rest of the world, when they measure \nthe importance to the United States of our being part of this effort \nbefore the Convention takes effect on April 29, I believe our \ncolleagues will decide that the answer to the question of whether the \nConvention improves the security of the United States is an unequivocal \nyes, and that they will respond by voting to approve the resolution of \nratification and against any debilitating amendments that any treaty \nopponents offer to it.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3237-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3243-S3245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A NATIONAL AGENDA FOR YOUNG CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow, the White House is hosting an \nextraordinary conference on ``Early Childhood Development and Learning: \nWhat the newest research on the brain tells us about our youngest \nchildren.'' It is the first time a President has focused national \nattention on this issue.\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nExperts from across America will explore the implications of new \nscientific research on the intellectual development of young children. \nIn their early years, children have an ability to assimilate far more \nknowledge than at any other time in their lives. If a child's curiosity \nis encouraged and his or her mind regularly stimulated, the capacity to \nlearn can be substantially expanded.\n  If, conversely, a child receives little interaction and stimulation, \nthat capacity declines just as an unexercised muscle atrophies. These \nfindings dramatically reinforce the urgency of programs which will \nprovide parents with the support they need to enrich their children's \nearly years.\n  There is no more important responsibility which we in the Senate have \nthan to provide a secure foundation on which America's children can \nbuild their futures. Now that we have a far greater understanding of \nthe significance of the early childhood years in an individual's \ndevelopment, we know the extraordinary impact which the quality of care \nand nurturing in those years can have on a child's intellectual and \nemotional growth. Does a child have access to good preventive medical \ncare? Are parents able to spend time with their child or are they \nunable to leave work? Do the hours spent in child care provide a real \nlearning experience?\n  Does the child have access to a quality preschool education program? \nThe answers to questions like these will have a substantial effect on a \nchild's long-term ability to reach his or her full potential. The \nopportunity lost cannot be recaptured. Making these basic opportunities \nthe birthright of every child should be our national agenda for young \nchildren. It should be our highest priority.\n  Congressional action this year could bring the essential elements of \nsound early childhood development within the reach of every child. Such \nan agenda for young children has four key elements: First, providing \naffordable child health insurance coverage for working families. The \nHatch-Kennedy bill will make health care more accessible for the 10 \nmillion children whose families cannot afford insurance. Many of these \nchildren currently see a doctor only when they are acutely ill. They \nnever receive the preventive health care which is so essential to \nproper growth and development.\n  Second, extending the Family and Medical Leave Act to 13 million more \nemployees so that they have the same opportunity to spend precious time \nwith a newborn child or to care for a seriously ill child. Giving each \nemployee 24 hours of leave a year to accompany their child to a school \nevent or on a visit to the pediatrician would also strengthen parental \ninvolvement.\n  Third, improving the quality of child care for infants and toddlers \nby providing incentive grants to States to make child care programs \nearly learning opportunities. Programs that encourage a child's \ncuriosity and stimulate communication skills can enhance long-term \neducational development.\n  Fourth, fully funding Head Start and expanding the Early Start \ninitiative for younger children.\n  This program is widely recognized for its success in providing \nchildren from low-income families with a firm educational foundation. \nYet, funding levels currently limit access to only 40 percent of the \neligible 4- and 5-year-olds and a much smaller percentage of young \nchildren.\n  In the words of the Carnegie Task Force on Meeting the Needs of Young \nChildren: ``The earliest years of a child's life * * * lay the \nfoundation for all that follows.'' It calls for a comprehensive \nstrategy to ``move the nation toward the goal of giving all children \nthe early experiences they need to reach their full potential.''\n  Collectively, these four legislative initiatives will provide all \nparents with the tools they require to enrich their children's early \nyears.\n  Each element--medical care, parental involvement, quality child care, \nand early learning opportunity--is essential to maximizing a child's \npotential. Let me explain how each of these programs would work:\n\n\n                         children's health care\n\n  Today, more than 10.5 million children have no health insurance. That \nis 1 child in every 7. The number has been increasing in recent years. \nEvery day, 3,000 more children are dropped from private health \ninsurance. If the total continues to rise at the current rate, 12.6 \nmillion children will have no medical coverage by the year 2000.\n  Ninety percent of these children are members of working families. \nTwo-thirds are in two-parent families. Most of these families have \nincomes above the Medicaid eligibility line, but well below the income \nit takes to afford private health insurance today.\n  Too many young children are not receiving the preventive medical care \nthey need. Uninsured children are twice as likely to go without medical \ncare for conditions such as asthma, sore throats, ear infections, and \ninjuries. One child in four is not receiving basic childhood vaccines \non a timely basis. Periodic physical exams are out of reach for \nmillions of children, even though such exams can identify and correct \nconditions that can cause a lifetime of pain and disability. Preventive \ncare is not only the key to a healthy child, it also is an investment \nfor society. Every dollar in childhood immunizations, for example, \nsaves $10 in hospital and other treatment costs.\n  Every American child deserves an opportunity for a healthy start in \nlife. No family should have to fear that the loss of a job or a hike in \ntheir insurance premium will leave their children without health care.\n  Children and adolescents are so inexpensive to cover. That's why we \ncan and will cover them this year--in this Congress. The cost is \naffordable--and the positive benefits for children are undeniable.\n  The legislation that Senator Hatch and I have introduced will make \nhealth insurance coverage more affordable for every working family with \nuninsured children. It does so without imposing new Government \nmandates. It encourages family responsibility, by offering parents the \nhelp they need to purchase affordable health insurance for their \nchildren.\n  Under our plan, $20 billion over the next 5 years will be available \nto expand health insurance coverage to children. When fully phased in, \nit will provide direct financial assistance to as many as 5 million \nchildren annually. Millions more will benefit because their families \nwill be able to buy good quality coverage for their children.\n  The plan will be administered by the States, under Federal guidelines \nto guarantee that the coverage is adequate and meets the special needs \nof children, including good preventive care and good prenatal care. \nStates will contract with private insurance companies to provide child-\nonly health coverage to families not eligible for Medicaid. Eligible \nfamilies will receive a subsidy through their State to help pay the \ncost of private insurance coverage for their children. Funding will \nalso be available to help provide prenatal services to uninsured \npregnant women.\n  For the youngest children, this medical care is the most vital. It \ncan prevent serious illnesses and long-term developmental problems.\n  It is the first priority if we are to help children grow to their \nfull potential.\n\n\n                        family and medical leave\n\n  Passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993 was a true \nlandmark for America's families. For the first time, millions of \nworking men and women were freed from the threat of job loss if they \nneeded time off for the birth of a child or to care for a sick family \nmember.\n  The act has worked well--for employees and for their employers. \nEmployees are now able to take a leave of absence to be with their \nchildren or with a sick relative at a crucial time for the family, so \nthat they can provide the special care and compassion which are the \nglue that binds a family together. In the 4 years since its enactment, \nit has already helped millions of families.\n  In more and more American homes today, both parents must have jobs in \norder to support their families. A substantial majority of children \nlive in families where neither parent is at home during the day because \nof their jobs. If we value families--if we are serious about helping \nparents meet the needs of their children--then family medical leave is \nessential.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act currently applies to businesses \nwhich employ 50 people or more. It is time to extend the benefits of \nthis landmark\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nlaw to an additional 13 million people who work for firms with between \n25 and 50 employees. Their families face the same crises. Their \nchildren deserve the same attention. I concur wholeheartedly with \nSenator Dodd, the original architect of the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, who has proposed this expansion.\n  There is another very important leave issue for working families--the \nneed for a brief break in the workday to meet the more routine, but \nstill very important, demands of raising children. Every working parent \nhas experienced the strain of being torn between the demands of their \njob and the needs of their children. Taking a child to the \npediatrician, dealing with a child care crisis or meeting with a \nteacher to discuss a problem at school, accompanying a child to a \npreschool or school event--all of these often require time off from \nwork. No parent should have to choose between alienating the boss and \nneglecting the child.\n  Many employers understand this, and allow their workers to take time \nfor family responsibilities. But many other companies refuse to \naccommodate their workers in this way.\n  The ability of parents to meet these family obligations should not be \ndependent on the whim of their employer. In a society that genuinely \nvalues families, it should be a matter of right.\n  Under legislation already proposed by Senator Murray, working parents \nwould be entitled to 24 hours of leave a year to participate in their \nchild's school activities. I would add time for a parent to take a \nchild to the doctor. Employers would have to receive at least 7 days \nadvance notice of each absence, so that employers will have ample \nopportunity to arrange work schedules around the brief absence of the \nemployee.\n  Clearly, this legislation is needed. A recent survey of 30,000 PTA \nleaders found that 89 percent of parents cannot be as involved in their \nchildren's education as the would like because of job demands.\n  A Radcliffe Public Policy Institute study completed last year found \nthat the total time that parents spend with their children has dropped \nby a third in the past 30 years. This disturbing trend must be \nreversed.\n  Greater involvement of parents in their children's education can make \na vital difference in their learning experience. A big part of that \ninvolvement is more regular contact between parent and teacher, and \nmore regular participation by parents in their children's school \nactivities. Many of those meetings and activities are scheduled during \nthe work day. As a result, millions of parents are unable to \nparticipate because their employers refuse to allow time off. \nPermitting a modest adjustment in a parent's work day can greatly \nenrich a child's school day. All children will benefit from this kind \nof parental support and encouragement, and so will the country.\n\n\n                           quality child care\n\n  Child care for infants and young children is essential for the \nmajority of mothers who work outside the home. However, quality child \ncare for these youngsters is often hard to find. A 1995 GAO study found \na shortage of infant care in both inner city and rural areas.\n  Even where facilities are available, they often do not provide the \ntype of care which would be an enriching experience for young children. \nA majority of children in child care spend 30 hours or more per week. \nTheir well being requires more than merely a safe and clean place to \nstay while their parents are at work--though even this is currently out \nof reach for far too many families. Young children--even infants and \ntoddlers--need regular interaction with attentive caregivers to \nstimulate their curiosity and expand their minds.\n  This requires a much lower staff to child ratio than most providers \ncan afford and it requires a level of training, supervision, and \ncompensation which is seldom present. The early years are too \nprecious--their potential too great--for children to spend them in \ncustodial rather than educational care. Yet according to the Work And \nFamily Institute, only one in seven child care centers offers quality \ncare and only 9 percent of family child care homes are found to be of \nhigh quality.\n  To say this is not to criticize those currently providing care. Most \nwork hard to create the best atmosphere for children they can given the \ncurrent level of resources. However, a simple comparison with the kind \nof support required under the Military Child Care Act demonstrates how \nmuch better we could be doing with the civilian child care system.\n  Under the military statute, each child care provider participates in \nan individualized training program and receives salary increases based \non their training. Each child care center is monitored at least four \ntimes a year and has an on-site teacher mentor. In addition, the \nmilitary has established family child care networks designed to serve \ninfants and toddlers where similar supports are provided. As a result \nof these provisions, provider salaries have dramatically increased when \ncompared to civilian child care and staff turnover is negligible. Staff \nto child ratios have been reduced and individualized care and attention \nincreased. The quality of the services provided reflects these changes. \nThe children of working families deserve no less.\n  I am proposing that we provide incentive grants to States to model \ntheir child programs after the high quality services offered by the \nmilitary.\n  This would include lower ratios as well as better training, \nsupervision, salaries, and support. In this way, those who regularly \ncare for our youngest children would be able to provide them with the \nnurturing and individualized attention they need and deserve. The time \nspent by children in child care would then become a valuable learning \nexperience for them.\n\n\n                               head start\n\n  Head Start is widely recognized for its success in providing children \nfrom low income families with a solid developmental foundation. It \nfocuses on the complete child--education, emotional growth, physical, \nand mental health, and nutrition. It strongly encourages parental \ninvolvement. Most importantly, it allows at-risk youngsters to enter \nschool ready to learn. Head Start works extremely well for those it \nserves.\n  However, even with recent funding increases, it serves only 40 \npercent of eligible children. There are few legislative initiatives \nwhich make more sense than fully funding Head Start. It could truly \nchange the lives of many of those children currently excluded.\n  In 1994, we established a new Early Head Start initiative for infants \nand toddlers. HHS has awarded 142 grants nationwide for programs to \nprovide basic early education, nutritional and health services for \nchildren under 3 years of age from low income families. This pilot \nprogram has proven very successful. The scientific research I alluded \nto earlier makes a compelling case for services directed to children in \ntheir earliest years. If we are seriously concerned about helping \nchildren expand their learning capacity, the Senate should fund a major \nexpansion of Early Start.\n\n\n                           disabled children\n\n  As we make these reforms for the benefit of all children, we must not \nforget to provide for the special needs of disabled children. Despite \ntheir disabilities, these children hold great potential. With adequate \nsupport and assistance from us that potential can be realized. We \ncannot in good conscience leave the families of these children to face \nsuch enormous challenges alone.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The national agenda for young children which I have outlined today \nwill give children--regardless of their family's income--a fair chance \nto reach their full potential. What occurs during a child's earliest \nyears will make a lifetime of difference.\n  We know how important preventive health care, parental involvement, \nquality child care, and early learning opportunity during those years \nare to that child's later development. How can we fail to act? These \nissues are compelling and they deserve a strong bipartisan response. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make this agenda for \nyoung children a high priority for Congress in 1997.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if the Chair would alert me when I have 1 \nminute remaining, I would appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I rise to give my third report on the \ndisaster\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nthat is still developing in North Dakota after the most severe winter \nstorm in 50 years on top of the most heavy snowfall of any winter in \nour history on top of the worst flooding in 150 years. Last night, late \nyesterday, we had a serious situation develop because the main dike \nprotecting Fargo, ND, which is the largest city in my State, sprang a \nleak. I talked last night to both the mayor and the head of the Corps \nof Engineers for our area, Colonel Wonzik. They told me they intended \nto build a second dike inside of the main dike to contain any burst \nthat might occur.\n  I am pleased to report this morning that that effort is well underway \nand that the leaking has been contained at this point. But all of us \nunderstand that this is an extraordinary situation. These dikes are \nexpected to stand up for much longer than would usually be the case \nbecause the flood conditions are so unusual. We have now been told that \nthe crest may last for as long as a week, and that puts enormous \npressure, not only on the dikes that were constructed by the Corps of \nEngineers, but on the dikes that were constructed by literally hundreds \nof individual homeowners who, in some cases, built walls of sandbags 15 \nfeet high to protect their homes and neighborhoods.\n  I brought with me today some photographs that show the extent of the \ndamage that has been done by this extraordinary storm. This first chart \nshows power lines. I do not know if people are able to see it, but it \nshows about 3 inches of ice that line the power line. Of course, what \nhas happened is first we had a massive ice storm and then 70-mile-an-\nhour winds. The result was the power poles came down. They snapped like \nthey were toothpicks. It is really extraordinary.\n  I drove into one town, and coming from the north side there was power \npole after power pole just snapped off. This is a condition that led to \nover 80,000 people being without power. Thankfully, most of those \npeople's power is now restored, although power for some still is not, \nand this is from a week ago Saturday. Can you imagine being without \npower for that extended period of time when conditions outside were, at \ntheir worst, 40 below wind chill and no heat? We have reports of one \nfellow who started burning fence posts in his house to keep warm. \nOthers who were using propane heaters, putting them in one room and the \nfamily gathering around the propane heater in order to keep warm.\n  This picture shows a string of power poles, all knocked down by these \nextraordinary conditions. Let me just say, if I can, that there has \nbeen an extraordinary response. We want to say thank you to the power \ncompanies that supply North Dakota for flying in extra crews from \naround the country to help out. I want to take this moment to \nespecially thank our neighbors to the north, because the Governor \ninformed me last Monday that we were faced with a situation in which \nManitoba Hydro wanted to send in crews to help us restore power lines, \nbut they were being held up at the border by the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. We called them and they immediately gave us a \n2-week waiver on all of their requirements at the border, and Manitoba \nHydro sent in over 100 people, crews, to help rebuild power lines in \nNorth Dakota--I think just an extraordinary act of neighborliness by \nour neighbors to the north in Canada. We deeply appreciate their \naction.\n  This shows the conditions and the power of this storm. You see this \npicture shows this power pole just snapped, again, like a toothpick. It \nis absolutely shattered by the force of these ice storms followed by \nextraordinarily high winds.\n  This photo shows the difficult conditions that the workers had to \ncontend with in trying to rebuild these lines. Again, 80,000 people \nwithout power, most of them for 4 or 5 days. Here they are, working in \nthese very difficult conditions, trying to rebuild lines.\n  This photo shows, on a farmstead, the kind of heavy equipment that \nwas needed just to get an opening to get through to where the power \npoles were down. We had in parts of our State 24 inches of snow in this \nlast storm. The people at the University of North Dakota tell me this \nwas the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, and in North Dakota we \nhave had some powerful winter storms. This year alone we have had eight \nblizzards and six winter storms that put over 100 inches of snow on the \nground before this storm. And this storm, of course, was extraordinary \nby anyone's measure.\n  This picture shows, again, the extraordinarily difficult conditions \nthe workmen were facing trying to rebuild lines. Jobs that would \nnormally take 2 or 3 hours were taking 10 to 12 hours in order to \nrebuild these facilities and get power back to people so they could \nhave heat.\n  Can you imagine being without power? We have all gotten so used to \nhaving electricity that I think we sometimes forget how  important and \ncentral it is to our lives. Just heat alone in our part of the country \nis absolutely critical. Can you imagine being without any heat in your \nhome for a week when it is extremely cold outside? And not having \nelectricity for any of the conveniences of modern life? This is what \nthese people have been contending with.\n\n  I must say, we have seen really heroic actions. I remember being in \none town and the mayor described how one of the underground tunnels \nthat carried water was blocked. They called in the fire department that \nhad a man who was a diver. They asked him--remember, this is 40-below \nwind chill--they asked him to dive down in 6 or 7 feet of water to open \nup that valve so the water could flow. That takes courage. That young \nfellow did not hesitate. He went down and unblocked that line that \notherwise would have led to far greater flooding. These kinds of heroic \nefforts have been repeated over and over.\n  We have had Coast Guard crews in North Dakota. Some people must be \nwondering, Coast Guard in North Dakota? North Dakota is landlocked. Why \nwould we be having Coast Guard crews in a State like North Dakota?\n  Very simply, those Coast Guard crews have background and experience \nand training in water rescue. They can tell some harrowing tales of \ngoing out and rescuing people who were in automobiles or were in homes \nthat were surrounded by water. One of the things members of these \nrescue crews said to me is: Senator, we have never worked in a \nsituation in which we were blocked by ice. We are used to dealing with \nwater, but we are not used to dealing with ice on top of the water and \nhaving to break through ice in order to get through to people to save \nthem.\n  Obviously, not all of the stories have had happy endings. We had a \nterrible tragedy of a young woman and her 3-year-old daughter who were \nin a car that went off the road. Water filled it. They were able to \nescape somehow and then tried to walk to a home that they knew about \nthat was out in the country, a farmstead. Unfortunately, the rivers in \nthis part of the State wind in a very unpredictable way and what they \nencountered, as they were walking in the bitterly cold weather, soaking \nwet, was, once again, the river. That young woman and her child died in \na field south of Fargo, ND.\n  There are many other stories, tragic stories, and stories of \nextraordinary heroism, where people were able to make a difference in \nsaving lives and saving property.\n  I will just conclude by saying I hope we move the disaster \nsupplemental bill with dispatch. I hope we move that legislation in a \nway that will provide sufficient funding to be able to manage this \nlatest crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I introduced a joint resolution on February \n6 to amend the Constitution in order to clarify that document's intent \nwith regard to prayer in our public schools. Senators Lott, Hollings, \nFord, and Smith of New Hampshire have indicated a desire to have their \nnames added as cosponsors. At the conclusion of my remarks I will ask \nthat be done.\n  Mr. President, my proposed amendment is short, but it \nconstitutionalizes what the Supreme Court has upheld on a number of \noccasions; namely, that the Founding Fathers did not intend for \nGovernment and the schools to be opponents of religion but rather that \nthey should be neutral and impartial in allowing the practice of all \nreligious beliefs by American citizens and by even the schoolchildren \nof our Nation.\n  I have long been concerned by the trends in our schools and in our \ncourts to overzealously eliminate all references--all references--to \nreligion and religious practices. It is now uncommon and rare to see \nany acknowledgment of the religious underpinnings of major holidays. \nThe unfortunate effect of this misguided overzealousness has been to \nsend the subtle but powerful message to our children that religious \nfaith and practice is something unsanctioned, unimportant, and \nunsophisticated--something that only small handfuls of people practice, \nand usually then only on weekends. Indeed, this exorcism of religion \nfrom the school day and from most of American life has reached even \ninto the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance and other important \nAmerican documents.\n  I was here on June 7, 1954, when the House of Representatives, of \nwhich I was then a Member, added the words ``under God'' to the Pledge \nof Allegiance. The next day, on June 8, the Senate likewise added the \nwords ``under God'' to the Pledge of Allegiance. I think it was on June \n20 of that year, 1954, that the President signed the additional \nlanguage into law.\n  I understand the thinking of the Founding Fathers when they drafted a \nConstitution that specifically forbade the establishment of a state \nreligion and that intended to--and does--protect the freedom of all \nreligions to observe the rituals and the tenets of their faith. The \nFounding Fathers and many of the earlier settlers of this country had \nfled from nations where State-sanctioned religions had resulted in \nexclusion from Government participation or even persecution of \nbelievers in nonsanctioned faiths. They were generally--talking about \nthe founders of this Nation, the framers of the Constitution, the \nFounding Fathers, those who voted in the various conventions for the \nnew Constitution--they were generally religious men, as the number of \nplaques in local churches here attest, proclaiming proudly, for \nexample, that ``George Washington attended church here.'' The freedom \nto worship was important to them, and they sought at all cost to \nprohibit the Government of our Republic--the Government of our \nRepublic, not our democracy; our Republic--from assuming the \ndictatorial powers of a king. Indeed, the Federalist Papers 59, in \ndiscussing the differences between the President and a king, \nspecifically observes that the President has ``no particle of spiritual \njurisdiction.'' There would be no ``Church of America,'' permitted by \nthe Constitution.\n\n  But in discussing the qualifications of elected officials and \nelectoral college members, the authors are clear in encouraging \nparticipation by members of all faiths, and they pointedly note that \nreligious belief is not a bar to election or selection. So whether you \nare a Catholic or whether you are a Jew or whether you are a Baptist or \nMethodist, Episcopalian is not something that will bar one from \nelection. In Federalist 57, James Madison writes: ``Who are the objects \nof popular choice? Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to the \nesteem and confidence of his country. No qualification of wealth, of \nbirth, of religious faith, or of civil profession is permitted to \nfetter the judgment or disappoint the inclination of the people.'' But, \nseeking to keep the Government from dictating a particular religion \ncertainly did not mean that all public professions of faith must be \nbanned, and the courts have sustained that view.\n  Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for the Court in Lynch v. \nDonnelly emphasized what he called ``an unbroken history of official \nacknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of \nreligion in American life from at least 1789.''\n  Now, Mr. President, the words ``In God we trust,'' those words appear \non our Nation's currency. Proclamations of days of thanksgiving and \nprayer, legislative chaplains, the invocation ``God save the United \nStates and this Honorable Court'' at the opening of judicial \nproceedings--all these and more reinforce what Chief Justice Burger was \nasserting when he wrote that the Constitution does not require \n``complete separation of church and state . . . (but) affirmatively \nmandates accommodation . . . of all religions, and forbids hostility \ntoward any.''\n  An acknowledgment that faith is, and should be, a part of the \neveryday life of those who desire it, not just an occasional weekend or \nholiday exercise, is a message that our children need to absorb. \nSchools, principals, and administrators should not react in dismay when \na student-initiated religious group seeks to meet in a classroom after \nschool. What is wrong with that? That sort of extracurricular activity \nshould be encouraged, not frowned upon. We need not sanctimoniously \nstrike a Christmas carol from the euphemistically named ``Winter \nConcert,'' nor tiptoe around the observance of a daily ``moment of \nsilence'' for reflection, meditation, or even, if the child wishes, \nprayer. And it certainly must be permissible to discuss the role that \nvarious religious faiths have played in world history and in the \nhistory of our own Nation. Actually, it is imperative to the study of \nhistory.\n\n  Especially in these troubled days, it is important, in these very \nsignificant ways, to send a positive message to children about private \nfaith and religious practice. They spend 6 or more hours a day in \nschool, 180 days or more each year. More and more, in a society where \nboth parents work, schools are where children absorb much of their \n``life instruction'' and develop behavioral and social attitudes, in \naddition to academic knowledge. School is one of the few places besides \nchurch where clean and positive messages are, or should be, instilled \nin our children, counterbalancing the pervasive violence and seamy \nmorals of television. We put a premium on the diversity of education \nthat they receive in literature, history, geography, science, and \nmathematics; yet, most public schools are a spiritual dead zone--a \nspiritual dead zone--completely devoid\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nof even the unspoken understanding that religious faith ought to play a \npart, perhaps a major part, in people's lives. For fear of offending \nthe sensibilities of the few--we are living in this age of so-called \n``political correctness.'' I don't know what that means, and I don't \ncare and don't intend to change my ways and attitudes to be in \naccordance with ``political correctness.'' For fear of offending the \nsensibilities of the few, we have denied the needs of the many. A \nclimate of openness and an acknowledgment that many people, including \nchildren, can profess and practice different faiths, are needed in our \nschools, which should not be a spiritual wasteland where even the mere \nrecognition of any spiritual faith is banned.\n  Mr. President, I am normally and naturally reluctant to amend the \nConstitution. But I am not one who would say never, never amend the \nConstitution. Regarding amendments to require a balanced budget, or to \nprovide the President with the line-item veto, I have been vociferously \nand adamantly opposed. These amendments would fundamentally alter the \nchecks and balances established in the Constitution. But on the \nfinancing of political campaigns, I have been willing to seek a \nconstitutional remedy to that scourge of public trust, a scourge that \nno legislation has ever been able to control. And on this issue of \nopenly acknowledging and accepting the role that prayer and religion \ncan and ought to play in our lives, I believe that an amendment to \nreaffirm the appropriate neutrality of the Constitution toward prayer \nand religious activity in school is necessary to swing the pendulum \nback toward the middle, toward the neutral middle, away from both the \nexisting pole, where the state seems, at least, to have become inimical \ntoward the exercise of religious freedom, and away from the opposite \nand clearly unconstitutional pole of dictating one religious profession \nof faith over any other. We do not have to completely discourage any \nrecognition of a Supreme Being in order to avoid favoring one religious \nfaith over another. And to do so is, in effect, a form of religious \ndiscrimination which the Founding Fathers would never have sanctioned.\n  The sum total of this collective effort to bend over backwards to \navoid any recognition of a Supreme Being in our schools has had the \nextremely damaging effect of making any expression of such a belief \nappear to be undesirable, unfashionable, and even something to be \nstudiously avoided. If one mentions a Supreme Being in some circles, he \nis considered to be unsophisticated. Children pick up on such messages \nquickly. And as a result, we have produced several generations of young \npeople largely devoid of spiritual values in their daily lives. \nEverywhere they turn, they meet the subtle, and perhaps not so subtle, \nputting down of spiritual values.\n  Recently, I noted an article in the Washington Post which proclaimed \nthat only 40 percent of U.S. scientists believe in God. Although this \nis precisely the same percentage as was revealed in a similar survey in \n1916--and I am glad it hasn't deteriorated or gotten worse in the \nmeantime, and that is almost worthy of some amazement that it hasn't--I \nfind such a result personally unfathomable.\n  Who, more than a man or a woman of science, should be more acutely \naware that the wonders of the universe could not have just happened? \nWho, more than an astronomer or a mathematician, or a physicist, or a \nbiologist, intimately familiar with the laws of probability, could \nbetter understand the impossibility of the wonders of the universe and \nall creation occurring simply as a byproduct of fortunate accident?\n  I wonder how many of these scientists who answered the poll, which \nindicated that only 40 percent of the scientists believe in a Supreme \nBeing, have read Charles Darwin? Well, no less a pioneering scientific \nintellect than Charles Darwin, the originator of the theory of natural \nselection--I have the book here in my hand--refused to rule out a \nDivine Creator; and he even refers to a Divine Creator in his book, \n``The Origin of Species.''\n  Darwin asks a very penetrating question, and I'm reading from page \n193 of Charles Darwin's volume of ``The Origin of Species.'' Here is \nthe question that he asks: ``Have we any right to assume that the \nCreator works by intellectual powers like those of man?'' Now, that is \nan incisive question because I think we are prone to think of God's \nintellect in the context of what we think to be or know to be our own \nintellectual processes, our own intellects. But Darwin asks the \nquestion: ``Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by \nintellectual powers like those of man?'' That is a great question.\n\n  Darwin continues the dovetailing of his scientific theory with the \nworks of the Creator when he writes this on page 194: ``Let this \nprocess go on . . .''--he is talking about the process of natural \nselection--``Let this process go on for millions of years; and during \neach year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not \nbelieve that a living optical instrument . . . might thus be formed as \nsuperior to one of glass. . . .'' He speaks of a living optical \ninstrument--in other words, the eye, which can adjust itself to light \nand to distance, and so on, automatically and virtually immediately; \nwhereas, the best camera that the Presiding Officer, Pat Roberts, has \nwill have to be adjusted a little bit for light and distance, and he \nwill have to look through it a little bit and adjust this and adjust \nthat. Well, that is what Darwin is talking about when he says: ``Let \nthis process go on for millions of years; and during each year on \nmillions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a \nliving optical instrument (the eye) might thus be formed as superior to \none of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man?''\n  So Charles Darwin himself is not backward about speaking of a \nCreator. ``Let this process''--the process of natural selection--``go \non for millions of years; and during each year on millions of \nindividuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical \ninstrument (the eye) might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, \nas the works of the Creator are to those of man?''\n  So it is clear that even such a scientific genius as Darwin did not \nthink it to be unsophisticated to believe in a Creator, or make \nreference to a Creator, a Supreme Being.\n  I have read and reread many times, Mr. President, the account of \ncreation as set forth in the Book of Genesis in the Holy Bible. I \nthought it well to read Darwin's theory of ``Natural Selection'' also. \nAnd I have done that. As a matter of fact, when I first read that book \nsome years ago, and it made reference to the Creator in Darwin's \n``Origin of Species,'' I was somewhat amazed. I never thought that, \nafter hearing about Darwin's theory--the theory of evolution, and so \non--I didn't think he would be so unsophisticated as to make any \nreference to a Supreme Being, to a Creator. But I found differently.\n  So it is clear that such a scientific genius as Darwin did not feel \nthe need to rule the Creator out of creation just because man in his \nlimited, narrow, finite intelligence might be arrogant enough to do so. \nIt may just be that such surveys reveal only the desire of some in the \nscientific field to avoid appearing unsophisticated to their \ncolleagues. For in the minds of many misguided people, to be truly \nintelligent one must avoid any alignment with the alleged superstition \nand naivete of religion. What poppycock! For any serious student of \nscience not to express wonder at the mystery of life and the universe \nand to claim instead that it is all purely a result of an accidental \nnatural physics or chemical reaction is surely an admission of true \nignorance and arrogance.\n  This is not something I know a great deal about, Mr. President. I \ndon't profess such. But I can tell you one thing. There is a hunger in \nthis Nation for a return to spiritual values. It can be seen in the \nmisguided tragedy of the Heaven's Gate cult, looking for a space ship \nlurking in the tail of a comet to take them to Heaven and away from \nthis miserable, material world. It can be seen in the political \nstrength of the religious right.\n  Mr. President, I am not of the religious right. I am not of the \nreligious left. I just plainly believe in the old-time religion which I \nsaw exemplified and practiced by two humble parents--foster parents of \nmine--over the years that I lived with them. It can be seen in the need \nfor our children to focus on something beyond material things in which \nto anchor their perceptions\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nabout right and wrong and good and evil.\n  In today's turned-around, upside-down society with its diminished \nvalues and its emphasis on easy money, casual sex, violence, material \ngoods, instant gratification and escape through drugs and alcohol, our \nyoung people need to know that it is OK to have spiritual values, it is \nOK to follow one's own personal religious guideposts, it is OK to pray, \nit is OK to recognize and then to do morally the right thing, it is OK \nto go against the crowd, OK to read the Bible, and OK to read Darwin's \ntheory of natural selection--who knows? This may have been God's way of \ncreating man--and that such activities are not strange, or uncool, or \nstupid, or unsophisticated.\n  The language of my amendment is as follows: ``Nothing in this \nConstitution, or amendments thereto, shall be construed to prohibit or \nrequire voluntary prayer in public schools or to prohibit or require \nvoluntary prayer at public school extracurricular activities.''\n  I will not take the time today. But one day I want to take the floor, \nand I want to quote from every President's inaugural speech--every \nPresident's, from Washington down to Clinton's--to show that every \nPresident was unsophisticated enough to make reference to the Supreme \nBeing in his inaugural speech. All we need to do is travel around this \ncity and see the inscriptions on the walls of the Senate and on the \nwalls of public buildings and museums and monuments to understand that \nthe framers of the Constitution, the founders of this Republic, \nbelieved in a higher power. They believed in a Supreme Being. Isn't it \nfolly to claim that the schoolchildren of this Nation should not say a \nprayer, not be allowed to say a prayer in an extracurricular exercise, \nat a graduation exercise, if the students want to have a prayer? Who \nwould claim that the framers of the Constitution would be against that?\n\n  So my amendment is simple language. It mandates nothing and it \nprohibits nothing. It simply allows voluntary prayer in our schools and \nat school functions for those who wish it. Such a course correction is \nneeded to restore balance to a raft of court decisions in the past \nseveral years that sometimes in their eagerness to maintain the ``wall \nof separation'' in church/state relations have seemingly ruled against \nthe freedom of a large majority of believing Americans to publicly \naffirm their faiths.\n  Such a situation is not right, it is not fair, it is not wise, and it \ncertainly is not what the framers had in mind. Their intent was the \nfreedom to practice one's individual faith as one saw fit. Somehow we \nhave gone far, far afield from that original and very sound conception \nto a point where any public religious practice is actually discouraged. \nThat is certainly the wrong track for a nation founded largely on moral \nand spiritual principles, and any serious scrutiny of the state of \nAmerican culture today clearly demonstrates just how badly off track we \nhave wandered.\n  So I urge all Senators to carefully consider my amendment, and it is \nmy hope that the Committee on the Judiciary will hold hearings this \nyear. This is an urgent matter--an urgent matter for the future of our \nchildren and for the future of our country. There is nothing political \nabout it. It doesn't need to be.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Lott, Mr. Hollings, \nMr. Ford, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire be added as cosponsors of my \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1003) to clarify Federal law with respect to \n     restricting the use of Federal funds in support of assisted \n     suicide.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nits immediate consideration.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, rarely do we see a showing of bipartisan \nagreement similar to the one we witnessed last Thursday when the House \nof Representatives voted 398 to 16 to pass H.R. 1003, the Assisted \nSuicide Funding Restriction Act. I look forward to the same showing of \nbipartisanship today as the Senate considers identical legislation. \nExcept for a minimum of differences, H.R. 1003 is substantively the \nsame as S. 304, which Senators Dorgan, Nickles, and I introduced in \nFebruary; 33 Senators are now cosponsors of this bill, which simply \nsays and directs that Federal tax dollars shall not be used to pay for \nor to promote assisted suicide.\n  This bill is urgently needed to preserve the intent of our Founding \nFathers. The integrity of our Federal programs serving the elderly and \nseriously ill are at stake without this measure. These are programs \nwhich were intended to support and enhance health and human life, not \nto promote their destruction. Government's role in our culture should \nbe to call us to our highest and our best. Government has no place in \nhastening Americans to their graves. However, our court system is on \nthe brink of allowing Federal taxpayer funding for assisted suicide.\n  On February 27, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated \nOregon's law known as Measure 16. It was the first law in America to \nauthorize the dispensation or the giving of lethal drugs to terminally \nill patients to assist in their suicide. Oregon's previous Medicaid \ndirector and its Health Services Commission chair have both said \nindependently that once assisted suicide is legal--in other words, when \nthe legal obstacles have been cleared away--assisted suicide would be \ncovered by the State's Medicaid plan, which is paid for in part by \nFederal taxpayers, individuals from all across America. According to \nthe Oregon authorities, the procedure will be listed on Medicaid \nreimbursement forms under what I consider to be a misleading but \ngrotesque euphemism. The administration of lethal chemicals to end the \nlives of individuals will be listed as comfort care.\n  Although the ninth circuit ruling is subject to further appeals, \nOregon may soon begin drawing down Federal taxpayer funds to pay for \nassisted suicide unless we, the representatives of the people, take \naction to pass the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act.\n  Additionally, a Florida court recently found a right to assisted \nsuicide in the State's constitution on the right to privacy. If upheld \nby the Florida State Supreme Court, this decision would raise the \nquestion of State funding for assisted suicide. Such actions would \nimplicate Federal funding in matching programs, just as would the \nsituation in Oregon, programs such as Medicaid. And they would raise \nquestions about the permissibility of assisted suicide in federally \nowned health care institutions in that State.\n  So action in Congress is needed at this time to preempt and \nproactively prevent this imminent Federal funding of assisted suicide \nwhich effectively may take place at any moment in the event that the \ncourts clear the way in regard to the situation in Oregon and in \nFlorida.\n  It is important to note that there was overwhelming approval for this \nmeasure in the House of Representatives. As I stated earlier, the House \npassed this measure by a resounding vote of 398 to 16. Shortly after \nthat vote, the White House issued a policy statement saying, ``The \nPresident has made it clear that he does not support assisted suicides. \nThe Administration, therefore, does not oppose enactment of H.R. 1003, \nwhich would reaffirm current Federal policy prohibiting the use\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nof Federal funds to pay for assisted suicides and euthanasia.'' In \nlight of these events, the Senate should act swiftly to pass this \nlegislation so that it will become the law of the land.\n  I would like to give the legislative history for the Assisted Suicide \nFunding Restriction Act in order to respond to some people who might \nsay that the Senate is taking up this legislation too quickly.\n  The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act is not new. It has \nreceived more than adequate consideration. It was introduced in both \nHouses in the last session of Congress. On April 29 of last year the \nHouse held hearings. On February 12, 1997, the Senate introduced its \nbill. On March 6, the House held hearings on the topic of ``Assisted \nSuicide: Legal, Medical, Ethical and Social Issues.'' On March 11, \n1997, the House introduced legislation. On March 13, the House Commerce \nCommittee Subcommittee on Health and Environment met in open markup \nsession and approved H.R. 1003 for full committee consideration. On \nMarch 18 the bill was ordered favorably reported by the Ways and Means \nSubcommittee to the full committee by a voice vote. Because he found \nthe legislation to be noncontroversial, Chairman Archer decided that a \nmarkup in the full Ways and Means Committee was unnecessary, and he \nturned out to be a prophet in suggesting its lack of controversy when \nin fact on April 10 the House of Representatives passed the measure by \na vote of 398 to 16.\n  Of course, the House legislation is virtually identical to S. 304, \nand the intention of the bill simply is to say that we do not think it \nappropriate that funds which were gathered and taxed in order to \nprovide medical assistance to individuals to enhance their lives should \nbe used to end their lives.\n  It is important also, though, to take a look and clearly develop an \nunderstanding of what this bill does not do. While it is clear that the \nAssisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act prevents Federal funding and \nFederal payment for or promotion of assisted suicide, it is also just \nas important to understand there are things this bill is not designed \nto do. This is a proposal that is very limited and very modest.\n  No. 1, it does not in any way forbid a State to legalize assisted \nsuicide or even to provide its own funds for assisted suicide. It \nsimply says Federal resources are not to be used to promote or conduct \nassisted suicides. After passage of this bill, States might choose to \nlegalize or fund assisted suicide, but they would not be able to draw \non Federal resources normally drawn upon in joint efforts between the \nState and the Federal Government for the provision of health services.\n  No. 2, this bill also does not attempt to resolve the constitutional \nissue that the Supreme Court considered in January when it heard the \ncases of Washington versus Glucksberg and Vacco versus Quill. Those \ncases involved the question of whether there is a right to assisted \nsuicide or whether there is a right to euthanasia.\n  This bill does not try to answer that complex question. This bill \nsimply says the Federal Government should not be involved in funding or \npaying for assisted suicides or paying for the promotion of assisted \nsuicide.\n  As the bill's rule of construction clearly provides as well, it does \nnot affect abortion. It is not designed to deal with the question of \nabortion. Members of this body have a widely divergent set of views on \nthat important issue, as I do personally, but this bill is not designed \nto affect that issue. It does not affect complex issues such as the \nwithholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, even of nutrition \nand hydration. Those issues are not affected by this measure.\n\n  Nor does this legislation affect the dispensation of large doses of \ndrugs that are designed to ease the pain of terminal illness. We know \nthat virtually all medical procedures have some risk of not achieving \nthe therapeutic impact desired but as a matter of fact may impair the \nhealth of an individual. This bill is not designed for those situations \nand instances. This bill is designed to prohibit Federal funding of the \nadministration of lethal doses of drugs and other methods used for the \npurposes of assisting in suicide or for using Federal funding to \npromote such assisted suicide.\n  It is with that in mind that we believe there should be a broad \nbipartisan consensus which will support this bill and we hope will \ncarry it forward in a way similar to the way in which the House of \nRepresentatives has so done. This legislation has wide support from the \npublic and important organizations as well and has wide support in the \nSenate.\n  It is crystal clear to me and I think to most around us that the \nAmerican people do not want their tax dollars spent on dispensing toxic \ndrugs with the sole intent of assisting suicide. Recently, a national \nWirthlin poll showed that 87 percent of the public opposed such a use \nof public funds. We would be derelict in our duty were we to allow a \nfew officials in one or two States to command the taxpayers of all the \nother jurisdictions in America to subsidize the practice of assisted \nsuicide, especially when that practice is against the intention of the \nindividuals in those other States.\n  The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act has been endorsed by \nsuch groups as the American Medical Association and the National \nConference of Catholic Bishops, both of which have submitted letters of \nsupport to the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The American Medical Association (AMA) \n     is pleased to support H.R. 1003, the ``Assisted Suicide \n     Funding Restriction Act of 1997,'' as passed overwhelmingly \n     by the House of Representatives on April 10th, and the \n     companion bill, S. 304, sponsored by Senators Ashcroft and \n     Dorgan. We believe that the prohibition of federal funding \n     for any act that supports ``assisted suicide'' sends a strong \n     message from our elected officials that such acts are not to \n     be encouraged or condoned.\n       The power to assist in intentionally taking the life of a \n     patient is antithetical to the central mission of healing \n     that guides physicians. While some patients today regrettably \n     do not receive adequate treatment for pain or depression, the \n     proper response is an increased effort to educate both \n     physicians and their patients as to available palliative \n     measures and multidisciplinary interventions. The AMA's \n     Ethics Institute is currently designing just such a far-\n     reaching, comprehensive education effort in conjunction with \n     the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (see attached materials).\n       The AMA is particularly pleased to note that H.R. 1003 \n     acknowledges--in its ``Rules of Construction'' section--the \n     appropriate role for physicians and other caregivers in end-\n     of-life patient care. The Rules properly distinguish the \n     passive intervention of withholding or withdrawing medical \n     treatment or care (including nutrition and hydration) from \n     the active role of providing the direct means to kill \n     someone. Most important to the educational challenge cited \n     above is the Rule of Construction which recognizes the \n     medical principle of ``secondary effect,'' that is, the \n     provision of adequate palliative treatment, even though the \n     palliative agent may also foreseeably hasten death. This \n     provision assures patients and physicians alike that \n     legislation opposing assisted suicide will not chill \n     appropriate palliative and end-of-life care. Such a chilling \n     effect would, in fact, have the perverse result of increasing \n     patients' perceived desire for a ``quick way out.''\n       We are fully supportive of the amendment to H.R. 1003, \n     adopted by the House Commerce Committee, which would provide \n     for further opportunity to explore and educate physicians and \n     patients on avenues for delivering improved palliative and \n     end-of-life care. We caution, however, against any amendment \n     that may be offered during the bill's Senate consideration \n     which might have the effect of mandating specific medical \n     education curriculum in this area. The AMA has a long \n     standing policy against federal mandates being placed on \n     medical school education.\n       The AMA continues to stand by its ethical principle that \n     physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with \n     the physician's role as healer, and that physicians must, \n     instead, aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the \n     end of life. We are pleased to support this carefully crafted \n     legislative effort, and offer our continuing assistance in \n     educating patients, physicians and elected officials alike as \n     to the alternatives available at the end of life.\n           Sincerely,\n     P. John Seward, MD.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         National Conference of Catholic Bishops, Secretariat for \n           Pro-Life Activities,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: Having been approved 42-to-2 by the House \n     Commerce Committee and 398-to-16 by the full House of \n     Representatives, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act \n     (H.R. 1003) will soon be considered\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\n     on the Senate floor. I write to urge your support for this \n     important legislation.\n       While no federal funds are being used for assisted suicide \n     at present, federal programs generally lack a written policy \n     on the issue; those few programs which address it do so only \n     in program manuals or interpretive memoranda. Current efforts \n     to legalize assisted suicide by referendum (Oregon) or \n     interpretation of state constitutions (Florida) have raised \n     questions about the use of federal funds and health \n     facilities with a new intensity. In our view, this \n     fundamental issue deserves and demands clear policy guidance \n     from Congress.\n       This bill will prevent the use of federal funds and health \n     programs to support and facilitate assisted suicide, even if \n     the practice becomes legal in one or more states. It will not \n     prevent a state from legalizing assisted suicide or \n     supporting it with state funds. The bill also clearly states \n     that it will have no effect on distinct issues such as \n     abortion, withdrawal of medical treatment, or the use of \n     drugs needed to alleviate pain even when life may be \n     shortened as an unintended side-effect. Due to its clear and \n     limited scope, H.R. 1003 has received strong bipartisan \n     support and been endorsed by religious, medical and \n     disability rights leaders who may differ on other issues.\n       Section 12 of H.R. 1003 encourages the Department of Health \n     and Human Services to fund demonstration projects for \n     improved care for persons with disabilities and terminal \n     illness. This section also urges HHS to emphasize palliative \n     care in its programs and to study the adequacy of current \n     medical school curricula on pain management. Information \n     gathered through these modest efforts will, we hope, lead to \n     more extensive and carefully formulated improvements in care \n     for these vulnerable populations in the future.\n       No one should see H.R. 1003 as a complete response to the \n     inadequacies of our health system in its treatment of \n     disability and terminal illness. The bill's central goal is \n     both modest and urgently necessary: ensuring that the federal \n     government will play no part in legitimizing and \n     institutionalizing assisted suicide as a response to health \n     problems. As acting Solicitor General Walter Dellinger \n     recently said in opposing the idea of a ``right'' to assisted \n     suicide, ``the least costly treatment for any illness is \n     lethal medication.'' In a health care system too often driven \n     by cost pressures, Congress should say loud and clear that it \n     does not hold human life to be so cheap.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Richard M. Doerflinger,\n                        Associate Director for Policy Development.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Additionally, groups such as the National Right to \nLife, the American Geriatrics Society, Family Research Council and \nPhysicians for Compassionate Care have endorsed this legislation, and \nnearly one-third of the Senate has signed on as cosponsoring the \nAssisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act, 33 Senators from both sides \nof the aisle. I am confident that our vote later today will prove that \nan even greater number of Senators will support and do support this \nmeasure.\n  This is not just something which I feel should be prohibited because \nmost Americans are against it. I feel it is wrong for Kevorkian's house \ncalls to be paid for by Federal tax dollars. The next time Kevorkian \ndecides to end a life, we should not foot the bill. And unless we take \naction, that can happen.\n  I feel it is wrong and would argue against allowing for assisted \nsuicide altogether. In cultures where the focus is on assisted suicide, \nthere is not much emphasis on how to ease pain or how to help people \nconfront those life-ending illnesses through hospice programs. There \nare some dramatic differences among European countries that have \ndiffering policies on assisted suicide. England, which prohibits \nassisted suicide, has a substantial effort directed at helping people \nin the terminal stages of disease, while the Netherlands, which allows \nassisted suicide, has not made such efforts.\n  So public policy in this arena does make a difference, and it makes a \ndifference on moral grounds. Really, we are focused on very narrow \ngrounds in this particular instance. We are focused on the idea of \nwhether or not tax resources of the Federal Government should be used \nto assist in suicide.\n  Obviously, there are practical reasons not to allow Federal funding \nfor assisted suicide. There are cases, many of them in the literature, \nwhere there was an improper diagnosis, so that it appeared there was a \nterminal disease but when someone's autopsy was conducted after an \nassisted suicide, it was found it was not a terminal disease.\n  That is a mistake which is irreversible. I believe that for us to \nfund assisted suicides is to be involved in an extremely risky \nbusiness; it is to deny the will of the people of the United States; it \nis to engage in the ending of life rather than the enrichment of life, \nwhich is what these medical programs were all about when they were \ncreated and funded in the Congress.\n  I believe it is clear we should signal our intention, an intention \nconsistent with the President of the United States, who has basically \nendorsed this measure after its passage by the House, consistent with \nthe American Medical Association and a wide variety of other groups \nthat indicate that Federal funding of assisted suicide would be \ninappropriate.\n  Our Government's role should be to protect and preserve human life. \nFederal health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid should provide a \nmeans to care for and protect our citizens, not become vehicles for \ntheir destruction. The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act will \nensure that our policy in this area will continue.\n  Today, the Senate has an opportunity to act proactively, to take the \nright steps in advance of these threats which are imminent but are not \nquite upon us, the threat that these legal obstacles might be cleared \naway and we would be called upon to participate in the funding of \nassisted suicide under something as misleading and grotesque as the \nconcept of ``comfort care'' in the State of Oregon.\n  Today, the Senate has an opportunity to act responsibly before the \nsituation arises in which Federal health care dollars would be used to \nend the lives of citizens of this country. I urge my colleagues to join \ntogether to pass the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act.\n  We should not hook up Dr. Kevorkian to the U.S. Treasury, especially \nwhen he tries to sever the lifeline to individuals who are in distress. \nThe next time Dr. Kevorkian makes a house call, taxpayers should not \nfoot the bill. It is time for us to respond to what we know the \nAmerican people's desire to be. It is time for us to say we will not \nallow the use of Federal funds to assist in suicide.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I rise in strong support of the \nAssisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act, which would prevent Federal \nfunds and Federal programs from promoting and paying for the practice \nof assisted suicide.\n  We must send a clear signal that Federal tax dollars should not be \nused for a practice which is neither universally permitted nor \naccepted, and one which is clearly immoral and unethical.\n  Many people may be wondering, ``Why do we need Federal legislation to \nprohibit the use of Federal funds for such an abhorrent practice?'' Let \nme take a few moments to lay out the reasons.\n  Both the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York and the Ninth \nCircuit Court in San Francisco have struck down State laws that \ncriminalized assisted suicide in the States of New York and Washington \non the grounds that the laws violate the due process clause and the \nequal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  In January of this year, the U.S. Supreme Court entered this \nemotional debate by hearing oral arguments on the aforementioned cases. \nA highly anticipated decision is expected within the next couple of \nmonths.\n  The plaintiffs are contending they have a constitutional right to \nphysician assisted suicide. If these circuit court decisions are \nupheld, then there would be a nationwide constitutional right to \nassisted suicide, euthanasia, and mercy killing and the issue of \nwhether Federal funding, under Medicare, Medicaid, title XX, and other \nprograms, for such an action would immediately be at hand.\n  Moreover, Oregon has passed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which \nmakes it legal for physicians to prescribe lethal doses of drugs in \ncertain circumstances. Although a preliminary injunction blocking the \nlaw's enactment has been granted, Oregon's Medicaid director and Health \nServices Commission chair have both said that once assisted suicide is \nlegal, the State would begin subsidizing the practice under Oregon's \nMedicaid plan.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration has said that killing \npatients is not a proper form of treatment and therefore should not be \ncovered under\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\nMedicare. I am, of course, pleased that we have those administrative \ninterpretations out there.\n  But there are others who are prepared to go to court to fight for a \ndifferent interpretation. A March 6 Reuters newswire story quotes \nHemlock Society spokeswoman Dori Zook as saying, ``Obviously, we feel \nthat Medicaid and Medicare should be used for assisting suicide.''\n  All it takes is for one district court judge to concur with that \nbelief. Federal law uses broad language in determining what Federal \nprograms will and will not pay for. For instance, Medicare pays for \nservices that are ``reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis and \ntreatment of illness or injury.'' If just one judge agrees with the \nHemlock Society and believes that assisted suicide is appropriate \nmedical treatment, then Federal tax dollars could fund assisted suicide \nin a State where the practice is legal.\n  If the Supreme Court were to rule that there is a constitutional \nright to assisted suicide, euthanasia advocates will certainly bring \nsuit for it to be considered just another medical treatment option that \nmust be eligible for funding under Medicare, Medicaid, and other \nFederal programs.\n  We need this legislation to prevent this from happening.\n  And it is not too soon to do so. Far too often, Congress reacts to \nproblems. Today, however, we have an excellent opportunity to be pro-\nactive, not simply reactive. We do not want to wait until the money is \nalready flowing and then try to stop it. We want to stop it before it \neven starts.\n  On a related note, it is imperative that we focus this debate on how \nwe, as a decent society, can support and comfort life instead of \npromoting destructive practices such as euthanasia and assisted \nsuicide. We must work together to ensure the provision of compassionate \ncare for dying persons and their families. We must practice effective \npain management, encourage patient self-determination through the use \nof advance directives, promote the utilization of hospice and home \ncare, and offer emotional and spiritual support when necessary.\n  Five Catholic health care systems and the Catholic Health Association \nof the United States have set out to achieve these goals and have \nformed Supportive Care of the Dying: A Coalition for Compassionate \nCare. The coalition, including Carondelet Health System, Daughters of \nCharity, Franciscan Health System, PeaceHealth, Providence Health \nSystem, and CHA, is developing comprehensive delivery models, practice \nguidelines, and educational programs--all with the goal of promoting \nappropriate and compassionate care of persons with life-threatening \nillnesses and their families.\n  These are the goals our Nation must strive for and support. We must \npromote death with dignity and respect, and not death by the draconian \nmeans of assisted suicide.\n  Let me close with a quotation from an eminent bioethicist at \nGeorgetown University who believes that assisted suicide, and therefore \nthe funding of assisted suicide, tears down the moral structure of our \nsociety. He has written that rules against killing ``are not isolated \nmoral principles, but pieces of a web of rules that form a moral code. \nThe more threads one removes then the weaker the fabric becomes.''\n  And indeed, assisted suicide is a form of killing, and if we allow \nfor the federal funding of this horrific act, then we risk minimizing \nthe importance of life.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate and am impressed \nwith the thoroughness with which the two Senators from Missouri have \ncovered this particular issue, but I do have a few additional comments \nI would like to add.\n  I do rise in support of the Assisted Suicide Restriction Act of 1997, \nH.R. 1003. I am reminded of the story that I heard when I was very \nyoung, and it had an impression which has carried over the years.\n  It is a story of a kid out playing, and he saw his father carrying \nthis large basket. He went over and asked his dad what it was all \nabout.\n  He said, ``Well, you know, your grandfather had not been very well, \nnot doing well at all, not able to contribute anymore. We sensed he \nreally did not enjoy life anymore. So he is in the basket, and I am \ntaking him down to the river.''\n  The little boy was not impacted much from that. The kid said, ``What \nare you going to do with the basket when you are done?\"\n  He said, ``Why are you so concerned about the basket?\"\n  He said, ``Because some day I am going to need it for you.''\n  It is important that we as a Congress reaffirm our commitment to the \nsanctity of human life in all its stages. This is one of the primary \nduties of the U.S. Senate and as members of a civilized society. The \nsanctity of human life was clearly articulated in our Nation's charter. \nThe Declaration of Independence counts the right to life as one of the \nself-evident and unalienable rights with which we have all been endowed \nby our Creator.\n  By safeguarding the right to life, our Government fulfills its most \nfundamental duty to the American people. By violating that right to \nlife, we violate our sacred trust with our Nation's citizens and the \nfamilies of our country and the legacy that we will leave to those not \nyet born.\n  The legislation now before us takes an important step in restoring \nour Nation's commitment to the importance of the lives of all \nAmericans, especially those who suffer from serious illnesses. This \nbill would prohibit the direct or indirect use of any Federal funds for \nthe purpose of causing the death of a human being by assisted suicide. \nIt would assure the American people that their hard-earned tax dollars \nwould not be used to fund a principle that they do not believe in--\nsuicide. It would also help Federal dollars to be provided in the form \nof grants to public and private organizations to help people with \nchronic or serious illnesses who may be considering suicide.\n  This legislation would not affect individual States' living will \nstatutes regarding the withholding or withdrawing of medical treatment \nor medical care. It simply prohibits the Federal Government from \ndirectly, or indirectly, funding assisted suicides. We, as a society, \nmust demonstrate our respect for the life of all Americans, especially \nthose who are sick and needy.\n  Mr. President, when I ran for office, I campaigned on the pledge that \nI would fight for all life. I was elected on that pledge and sent to \nWashington where I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution \nof the United States. Physicians also take on the rigors of a campaign \nto become doctors. Although they are not voted into office, they work \njust as hard to fulfill their commitments and receive their degrees. \nUpon graduation, all physicians are intimately familiar with the \nHippocratic Oath and its basic premise: First, do no harm. If I might \nquote from that oath specifically, it says:\n\n       I will use treatment to help the sick according to my \n     ability and judgment, but I will never use it to injure or \n     wrong them. I will not give poison to anyone though asked to \n     do so, nor will I suggest such a plan.\n\n  Those powerful words reflect a great insight and wisdom into the \nhuman condition. Though they were written so many years ago, they still \nresonate today. I share them with my colleagues as I urge their support \nfor this legislation. It is our future, too.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise to join my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, in support of this \nlegislation. This piece of legislation was passed by our colleagues in \nthe U.S. House with overwhelming and bipartisan support last Thursday, \nApril 10. The Senate version of this legislation was introduced on \nFebruary 12 by Senator Ashcroft and myself, and we had 33 bipartisan \ncosponsors for that version.\n  This is not the first time this bill has been introduced in the \nSenate. Senator Ashcroft and I also introduced this legislation in the \nlast Congress, but that Congress was not able to take up this \nlegislation, so we reintroduced it earlier this year. I am pleased the \nSenate is today considering this legislation as it has been passed by \nthe House of Representatives.\n  This legislation is very, very simple. It will ensure that Federal \ntax dollars\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\nare not used to pay for the costs associated with assisted suicides. \nMr. President, I do not know about all of the anguish, the torment and \ndifficulties that are faced by terminally ill individuals toward the \nend of life who must make critical decisions. I recall before my \nfather's death sitting in the hospital one evening in North Dakota and \nhearing the cries of pain suffered by someone in a room down the hall, \nsomeone who mercifully died the next morning.\n  I thought that evening about some of these issues, and I do not know \nwhat I or others might do in a similar circumstance. I am not here to \nmake judgments about those types of decisions. The decision about \nwhether assisted suicide is protected by the Constitution will be made \nacross the street by the Supreme Court. We do not attempt in this \nlegislation to address the question of whether someone has a right to \nend one's life. This bill does not address that at all, and I do not \nstand here today making judgments about it.\n  Rather, the decision we are faced with today in the Senate, about \nwhether Federal funding should pay for this practice, is a decision \nthat was really presented to us by an action one State has taken. The \nState of Oregon has decided it will sanction and pay for physician-\nassisted suicides through its Medicaid program, which is paid for with \nmatching Federal dollars. As a result of these decisions by the State \nof Oregon, Federal health care dollars may soon be used to pay for \nthose physician-assisted suicides without Congress ever having made an \naffirmative decision to allow that.\n  When Oregon's referendum to legalize assisted suicide passed by a \nnarrow margin, it was contested in the courts, and its implementation \nhas been held in abeyance since then. However, the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals dismissed the challenge to Oregon's law on a technicality in \nlate February. That decision is being challenged by opponents of \nOregon's law, but this action means that Federal funding for assisted \nsuicide in Oregon could soon be a reality.\n  What Senator Ashcroft and I and others are saying is that we do not \nwant Federal tax dollars, through the Medicaid Program or any other \nprogram, to ever be used to help pay for physician-assisted suicides. \nWe do not believe that is what American taxpayers ever intended should \nbe done with their tax dollars that come to Washington, DC. Tax dollars \nused for health care purposes ought to be used to enhance life, not end \nlife. So again, our legislation very simply says that we will prohibit \nthe use of Federal funding to assist in suicides.\n  I have told you what this legislation does. Now let me tell you what \nit does not do. First of all, this legislation says that the ability of \nterminally ill patients to decide to withhold or withdraw medical \ntreatment or nutrition or hydration is not limited for those who have \ndecided they do not want their life sustained by medical technology. In \nother words, this legislation does not address this issue at all. The \nwithdrawal of medical treatment or services, which is already legal in \nour country and which patients in conjunction with their families and \ndoctors decide they want to do, is not prohibited at all by our \nlegislation. Our legislation does not speak to this issue. Our \nlegislation speaks to the narrow, but important, issue of Federal \nfunding for physician-assisted suicides.\n\n  Our legislation also does not put limits on using Federal funding for \nhealth care or services that are intended to alleviate a patient's pain \nor discomfort, even if the use of this pain control ultimately hastens \nthe patient's death.\n  Finally, our legislation does not prohibit a State or other entity \nfrom using its own dollars to assist a suicide. We are not saying what \na State may or may not do. We are only saying that a State may not use \nFederal money to pay for assisted suicide. We have raised and \nappropriated money at the Federal level to do certain things in our \nFederal system. One of these important purposes is to help pay for \nhealth care, and I am convinced that our constituents want this funding \nto be used to extend life, not to end life. This legislation is \nimportant because it reaffirms the principle that Federal health care \ndollars should be used to improve and prolong life. This bill will \nreaffirm that all people are equal and deserving of protection, no \nmatter how ill or disabled or elderly or depressed a person may be.\n  Some might say, ``Well, you have come to the Congress with a bill \nthat is premature, because there is not now Federal funding for \nassisted suicide.'' That is correct for now but that situation may soon \nchange. The law already exists in one State that forms the basis for \nrequiring Federal funding of assisted suicides if Congress does not \nact. Therefore, the Congress must intervene to say that is not our \nintention that Federal money be used for that purpose. So this is not \npremature at all.\n  Those who say, ``Federal funding of assisted suicide is not \nhappening, therefore, you need do nothing,'' do not understand that if \nwe do not act, we effectively allow the use of Federal funds for use in \nassisted suicides. I think we speak for the vast majority of the \nAmerican people when we say that tax money should not be used to \nfacilitate assisted suicides.\n  Let me end where I began by saying that this is not legislation that \nintends to make legal of moral judgments about assisted suicide. For \nStates and citizens around our country, this is a very difficult and \nwrenching issue, and it has gotten a lot of press because of one doctor \nwho facilitates assisted suicides.\n  I expect behind all of those news reports are patients and families \nwho are faced with these very difficult decisions about pain they \nbelieve cannot be controlled, life they think is not worth living. I \nhave seen too many circumstances in which I feel really unqualified to \npass judgment on the decisions of others. But I do stand here with a \ngreat deal of certainty about what uses we ought to be sanctioning for \nlimited tax dollars. When we raise precious tax dollars to spend in \npursuit of public health care, I am convinced that the vast majority of \nthe American people do not believe those dollars ought to be spent in \nthe pursuit of assisted suicides. And that is what our legislation \nreaffirms simply and plainly.\n  I am pleased to have worked with the Senator from Missouri, Senator \nAshcroft, who has done a substantial amount of work in this area. I \nhope and expect we will enact our legislation here today in the Senate \nand send this bill to the President. When we pass this bill later this \nafternoon, we will have done something that is worthy and has great \nmerit.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Likewise, I would like to extend my thanks and the \nthanks, I believe, of the American people, to Senator Dorgan for taking \nthis important step and for having the foresight to do it in advance of \nsome commitment of the Treasury. We are perilously close to having \nFederal funds used in this respect. A court decision stands between us \nand that potential. But having the foresight to prepare in advance is \nappropriate, and I thank him for his excellent work.\n  I am pleased to note that there are others who want to speak on this \nissue. I look forward to hearing Senator Hutchinson's remarks.\n  I would just say that one of the reasons I am not eager to see \nFederal funding provide the resource for assisted suicide is that in so \nmany cases that I have known, the diagnosis was missed. It seems to me \nparticularly tragic to think you would seek to fund a suicide on one \nset of facts and to find out that it was not the case.\n  I am reminded of a case reported in the Washington Post--and I make \nreference to it and will submit it for inclusion in the Record--from \nJuly 29, 1996.\n  A twice-divorced, 39 year-old mother of two from California, \nallegedly suffering from multiple sclerosis, checked into a Quality Inn \nand received a lethal injection--becoming the most recent person to die \nwith Dr. Kevorkian's help. Though her death warranted little notice \nnationwide, authorities at least had one major question.\n  According to the doctor who autopsied her body--``She doesn't have \nany evidence of medical disease.'' The county medical examiner said in \nan interview, ``I can show you every slice from her brain and spinal \ncord,'' obviously, from the pathology reports, ``and she doesn't have a \nbit of MS.

He went on \nto say, ``He could have lived another 10 years, at least.''\n  It seems to me it would be particularly ironic to be forced to spend \nresources that we have committed to protecting and preserving health if \nwe were to be committing those resources unduly and inappropriately \nbased on mistaken diagnoses to destroy individuals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From The Washington Post, Monday, July 29, 1996]\n\nJust How Sick was Rebecca Badger?; Jack Kevorkian Helped End Her Life, \n                  and That's When the Questions Began\n\n                           (By Richard Leiby)\n\n       There's no question that Rebecca Badger wanted to die. At \n     39, she was using a wheelchair, losing bowel and bladder \n     control, and enduring what she called ``excruciating'' pain. \n     Multiple sclerosis, her doctors said--a debilitating disease \n     that can be treated but not cured.\n       There's also no question that Badger suffered from episodes \n     of depression, as many MS patients do. In her misery, she \n     turned to the man she considered her only hope for release: \n     Jack Kevorkian, the retired pathologist widely known as ``Dr. \n     Death.''\n       On July 9, the twice-divorced mother of two from California \n     checked into a Quality Inn here and received a lethal \n     injection--becoming the most recent person to die with \n     Kevorkian's help, No. 33 for those keeping track.\n       Though her death warranted little notice nationwide, for \n     authorities here at least one major question persists: Was \n     Badger actually sick?\n       Not according to the doctor who autopsied her body. ``She \n     doesn't have any evidence of medical disease,'' L.J. \n     Dragovic, the county medical examiner, said in an interview \n     last week. ``I can show you every slice from her brain and \n     spinal cord, and she doesn't have a bit of MS. She looked \n     robust, fairly healthy. Everything else is in order. Except \n     she's dead.''\n       If Dragovic's findings are accurate, the Badger case \n     presents an intriguing medical mystery amid an ongoing debate \n     over how to ensure that people who choose euthanasia are \n     mentally competent and not hastening their deaths because of \n     depression.\n       Kevorkian's screening methods were examined in three \n     criminal trials involving five deaths, and he was acquitted \n     each time. Those cases included a 58-year-old woman with a \n     history of psychiatric problems who suffered from severe \n     pelvic pain for which doctors could find no physical \n     cause.\n       Multiple sclerosis, which afflicts an estimated 350,000 \n     Americans, is a disease of the central nervous system that \n     tends to strike young adults. It is often difficult to \n     diagnose and sometimes cannot be confirmed until the patient \n     has died and the brain and spinal tissue can be examined.\n       Attorneys for Kevorkian would not make their client \n     available for comment. One of them called the medical \n     examiner ``a liar,'' insisting that ``hundreds'' of medical \n     records proved that Badger had an advanced case of multiple \n     sclerosis. Christy Nichols, Badger's 22-year-old daughter, \n     who held her mother's hand as she died, said: ``All I know is \n     that her pain was insurmountable. I would not want to inflict \n     that on anyone.''\n       ``She was constantly hospitalized with constant and \n     crippling MS,'' said lawyer Geoffrey Fieger, who has \n     represented Kevorkian for six years. Fieger petitioned the \n     U.S. Supreme Court last week to end Michigan's ban on \n     Kevorkian's work. Today they will appear at the National \n     Press Club in Washington as part of their crusade to legalize \n     what Kevorkian calls ``medicide.''\n       That crusade has gathered increasing support since \n     Kevorkian's first assisted suicide six years ago. Earlier \n     this year, federal appeals courts struck down laws against \n     physician-assisted suicide in the states of Washington and \n     New York, ruling that mentally competent, terminally ill \n     adults have a constitutional right to assistance in ending \n     their lives.\n       Even proponents of euthanasia say the ambiguities of some \n     of the Kevorkian cases point to the need for tight \n     regulation. An Oregon law, approved by voters in 1994 but \n     blocked by a federal judge, forbids a doctor to write a \n     lethal prescription for a terminally ill patient if the \n     doctor suspects that the person suffers from depression.\n       ``The Badger case is clearly worrying,'' said Derek \n     Humphry, founder of the pro-euthanasia Hemlock Society and \n     author of the million-selling book ``Final Exit.'' ``There \n     must be the most careful evaluation of such cases. We need a \n     sound, broad law which permits hastened death in justifiable \n     cases, and we need very thoughtful guidelines that the \n     medical profession can work with.''\n       Interviews with Badger's doctors and daughter leave several \n     questions unresolved: Most important, what was the cause of \n     her illness? Also, how severe were her psychological \n     problems? Were her California physicians properly consulted \n     by Kevorkian's advisers? And could Badger's suffering have \n     been solely the result of a psychiatric disorder--a \n     possibility not discounted by one of her doctors?\n       ``Would a competent psychiatrist have been better than a \n     lethal injection? I understand the question--I've been asking \n     it myself,'' said Johanna Meyer-Mitchell, a family \n     practitioner in Concord, Calif., who treated Badger for \n     nearly 11 years. ``There never was any objective evidence as \n     to why she was in as much pain as she said she was in.''\n       Meyer-Mitchell said she was unaware that her patient was \n     seeking the services of Kevorkian when Badger recently \n     requested that her medical records be sent to two Michigan \n     doctors. ``If I had known this is what she was planning or \n     thinking of, I would have tried to intervene to get her \n     psychiatric help,'' Meyer-Mitchell said.\n       Badger didn't want to take antidepressants and was \n     displeased with the outcome of an earlier consultation she'd \n     had with a psychiatrist, according to Meyer-Mitchell. ``She \n     said, `They think this is all in my head.'''\n       Fieger released some of Badger's medical records to the \n     Washington Post, saying they would prove that Dragovic's \n     autopsy results were false. But the records--which included \n     case summaries from Badger's two primary physicians--and \n     interviews with other experts left open the possibility that \n     Badger did not have MS.\n       A case summary by Meyer-Mitchell states there was ``fairly \n     minimal'' evidence that Badger had the disease. Badger's \n     doctors said her brain scans were inconclusive, and spinal \n     fluid tests suggested MS but were not definitive. In such \n     cases doctors render a diagnosis of ``possible MS'' because \n     nothing else explains the patient's symptoms.\n       ``She didn't have the nice, well-wrapped-up package of MS \n     symptoms that many other patients have,'' said neurologist \n     Michael Stein, of Walnut Creek, Calif. Stein said he made the \n     diagnosis of possible MS in 1988 and said his confidence \n     increased because of progressive symptoms that included limb \n     weakness--Badger limped and also used a walker--and bladder \n     and bowel dysfunction. By June 24, when he wrote a note to \n     accompany Badger's medical records, his diagnosis was \n     unqualified: ``She has multiple sclerosis.''\n       But in a interview Friday, Stein said he was never \n     absolutely sure. ``There was concern, and there was a \n     question about it. That an autopsy didn't find it, I'm \n     surprised, is all I can say.''\n       Stein also stated in the June 24 note that Badger never \n     suffered from depression ``to my knowledge.'' In an \n     interview, he said, ``I concerned myself with MS.'' But he \n     acknowledged that Badger followed the typical pattern of \n     what is called ``relapsing, remitting'' MS, during which \n     symptoms--and spells of depression--come and go.\n       Meyer-Mitchell's records explicitly state a diagnosis of \n     depression. And a May 20, 1996, record of Badger's visit to \n     Meyer-Mitchell's office shows that the patient herself \n     checked off ``depression,'' ``confusion'' and ``trouble \n     concentrating'' among her problems.\n       Badger also was ``a survivor of sexual abuse as a child,'' \n     Meyer-Mitchell wrote, and had ``a history of chemical \n     dependency and alcoholism.''\n       On July 2, Stein said, he received a fax from Georges \n     Reding of Galesburg, Mich., who identified himself as a \n     ``psychiatric consultant'' to Kevorkian and stated that \n     Badger was a candidate for physical-assisted suicide.\n       According to Stein, Reding inquired about putting Badger on \n     Demerol for pain control. Stein said he faxed back a note \n     saying that Reding should contact Meyer-Mitchell. Reding \n     never contacted her, Meyer-Mitchell said.\n       ``The next thing I hear [on the radio eight days later] is \n     that she's an assisted suicide,'' recalled Stein. ``I said, \n     `What!?' * * * I presumed they would talk her out of it. I \n     was dead wrong.''\n       Reding, who in May signed a death certificate in another \n     Kevorkian-assisted suicide of an MS patient, did not respond \n     to a request for comment.\n       Since that May 6 suicide, Kevorkian has been advised by a \n     small group of doctors calling itself Physicians for Mercy. \n     The group, which since then apparently has been involved in \n     six assisted suicides, has developed guidelines that promise \n     a thorough review of a patient's medical records, a \n     consultation with a ``specialist dealing with the patient's \n     specific affliction'' and an evaluation by a psychiatrist \n     ``in EVERY case.''\n       ``If there is any doubt about it--the slightest doubt--the \n     patient will be turned down,'' said internist Mohamed El \n     Nachef of Flint, Mich., a member of the group. He added that \n     patients approved for doctor-assisted suicide ``are making \n     rational decisions. They are not depressed and they are not \n     lunatics, and their requests are very reasonable. You cannot \n     deny them their request to stop suffering.''\n       El Nachef would not comment on whether he medically \n     evaluated Badger or was present at her death but said, ``I \n     don't think there is any doubt about the extent of her \n     disability or about her diagnosis.''\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n                              a hard life\n\n       Badger's adult life, by several accounts, was one of \n     disappointment, recurring medical woes and financial worries. \n     Married at 17, divorced by 19, she raised two girls largely \n     on her own in Contra Costa County, east of Oakland. In 1985 \n     she was diagnosed with cancer and rarely was able to work \n     after that.\n       Badger had a hysterectomy to remove the cancer and surgeons \n     later removed her ovaries. She was free of cancer, Meyer-\n     Mitchell said, but the MS symptoms and other maladies \n     persisted.\n       Doctors prescribed Badger morphine and Demerol for pain and \n     Valium for spasms. But according to Nichols, her elder \n     daughter, some physicians also believed her mother might have \n     been abusing drugs.\n       ``She lost total faith in the system,'' Nichols said.\n       Badger's second marriage, in the early '90s, broke up after \n     only a year. Her symptoms worsened steadily after that, she \n     grew despondent, and by 1994 she mentioned to Nichols that \n     she might want to seek out Kevorkian. In January, Badger \n     moved south to live with her daughter near Santa Barbara.\n       Nichols said it's ``ridiculous'' for anyone to conclude \n     that her mother did not have a major physical disease. ``I \n     would literally have to drag her to the restroom. She would \n     have her arms wrapped around my neck--who wants a life like \n     that?\n       ``She was sick. Do you think I would let my mother go [to \n     Michigan] and I would hold her hand while she was dying if it \n     wasn't true?''\n       Nichols and her mother flew to Detroit on July 8, a Monday. \n     About 8 the next morning, Kevorkian and three others joined \n     Badger and her daughter in a suburban hotel room.\n       Nichols said Kevorkian asked her not to discuss in detail \n     what happened that night, or identify any other participants. \n     But they included a psychiatrist who had talked with her \n     mother on the telephone ``numerous times'' in the past, she \n     said.\n       The psychiatrist's on-site assessment lasted about a half-\n     hour, Nichols said. The result?\n       ``He told my mother she was more sane than he was.''\n       Badger signed forms and some of the proceedings were \n     videotaped, as is Kevorkian's custom. He often asked Badger, \n     ``Are you sure this is what you want?'' and told her she \n     could ``stop the process at any time.'' Nichols recalled.\n       Badger's right arm had a dime-size bruise consistent with \n     an injection, autopsy photos show. In previous deaths, \n     Kevorkian has used a so-called ``suicide machine'' that \n     delivers a heart-stopping does of potassium chloride, and \n     also allows the patients to press the button that delivers \n     the poison.\n       Nichols doesn't recall her mother's exact last words. ``She \n     said she loved me, repeatedly.''\n       Kevorkian wheeled Badger's body into the emergency room at \n     Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital around 11:45 p.m. He was \n     accompanied by another doctor whose identity has not been \n     released.\n       Departing this life, Badger wore dark leggings and a loose \n     T-shirt advertising ``Time Warner Interactive.'' In the \n     coroner's snapshots, her brown hair was unkempt and her face \n     bereft of makeup.\n\n\n                          the autopsy dispute\n\n       Dragovic, the medical examiner, said it was still unclear \n     what killed Badger. Her blood contained morphine and it was \n     ``highly likely that potassium chloride was part of the \n     combination,'' he said. Police have filed no charges.\n       Fieger, Kevorkian's attorney, has often publicly criticized \n     Dragovic, whose office has performed autopsies in 26 of the \n     33 cases Kevorkian has been involved with since 1990.\n       Fieger once offered to wager $1 million that the \n     pathologist's findings were wrong in the autopsy of a woman \n     whose breast had been removed because of cancer. Dragovic \n     said his examination showed no invasion of the cancer to \n     vital organs, but Fieger insisted that her body was ravaged \n     by the disease.\n       ``Dr. Dragovic is a liar,'' Fieger said last week about the \n     Badger case, again offering a bet: ``I will put up a million \n     dollars that Rebecca Badger had severe and crippling MS.''\n       ``Could he double the stakes?'' Dragovic responded, \n     laughing. ``With $2 million, we could improve the building \n     here. She did not have MS, and that's the end of it.''\n       Two multiple sclerosis experts contacted by The Post \n     agreed that symptoms of severe MS are almost certain to \n     show up in a properly conducted autopsy.\n       ``It's inconceivable to me that the autopsy wouldn't pick \n     it up. I would be very skeptical as to whether this woman had \n     MS,'' said Aaron Miller of Maimonides Medical Center in New \n     York, who chairs the professional education committee for the \n     National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n       Miller said certain characteristics of Badger's cerebral-\n     spinal fluid, cited as evidence of MS in her medical records, \n     ``don't make the diagnosis.'' Those signs could be indicative \n     of Lyme disease, syphilis or other inflammatory diseases, he \n     said. ``And it might be seen where the patient has no \n     clinical disease.''\n       ``The very best confirmatory test for MS'' is the autopsy, \n     said Fred Lublin, a professor of neurology at Thomas \n     Jefferson University in Philadelphia. ``At death, that's how \n     one proves it.''\n       Kevorkian's ``patients'' have included six persons with MS \n     diagnoses. Spokesmen for the National Multiple Sclerosis \n     Society point out that the disease is not terminal and that \n     most patients do not develop cases that result in disabling \n     paralysis.\n       The group recently issued a statement on suicide that says \n     in part, ``Although we respect our clients' right to self-\n     determination, we as a Society affirm life.''\n       In an interview with a Santa Barbara television station two \n     days before she died, Badger made a different kind of \n     declaration. She cried out in agony and said, ``The pain that \n     I live with is excruciating.\n       ``I know what the future holds,'' she added. ``I know \n     finally there is a man out there with a heart of gold who \n     will help me.'' Asked about Kevorkian's ``Dr. Death'' \n     nickname, Badger said: ``I hate when he's called that. He's \n     just the opposite.''\n       Meyer-Mitchell, who knew Badger better than any other \n     doctor did, has no ready answers to the questions surrounding \n     her patient's death. She only wishes that the Michigan \n     doctors who received her June 24 letter had paid more \n     attention to the last line:\n       ``I hope you are able to assist this unfortunate woman to \n     have a more comfortable life.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 1, 1996]\n\n              Terminal Illness Absent in Kevorkian Suicide\n\n       Pontiac, Mich.--A medical examiner said yesterday an \n     autopsy reveals a North Carolina psychiatrist who took his \n     life with Dr. Jack Kevorkian's help was not terminally ill.\n       Dr. Richard Faw, 71, who reportedly suffered from terminal \n     colon cancer, took his life Sunday, becoming Dr. Kevorkian's \n     41st known assisted suicide.\n       ``There was some residual cancer in the colon but none \n     present in the Kidney, lungs or liver--none of the vital \n     organs,'' said Medical Examiner Ljubisa Dragovic. ``There \n     could be some cancer in the bone which could have caused \n     pain, but this man was not terminal. He could have lived \n     another 10 years, at least.''\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to note the presence of Senator Hutchinson \nfrom Arkansas. I look forward to his remarks.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor H.R. 1003. I want to commend the Senator from Missouri for his \noutstanding leadership on this issue, his willingness to be proactive \nabout an issue that is very important to the future of our Nation, and \nalso the Senator from North Dakota for his support of this measure as \nwell.\n  H.R. 1003 will prohibit Federal funding and promotion of assisted \nsuicide and euthanasia. It is critically important that the Federal \nGovernment not appear to sanction suicide as a form of medical \ntreatment in our varied Federal health care programs. Without this \nbill, that would be the very message we could be sending as we would \npotentially find ourselves funding and covering so-called mercy killing \nwith Federal tax dollars.\n  It should be mentioned that this bill passed overwhelmingly in the \nHouse of Representatives by a vote of 398 to 16. It enjoys obvious \noverwhelming bipartisan support. It involves only a prohibition of \nfunding and does not affect the legality of assisted suicide or \neuthanasia. The bill simply says that the Federal Government will not \nbe a part of the practice of assisted suicide and will not force all \ntaxpayers to be a part of that practice.\n  The Clinton administration should also be able to support this bill. \nWhen asked in the 1992 campaign about legislation to allow assisted \nsuicide, President Clinton said, ``I certainly would do what I could to \noppose it.''\n  On November 12, 1996, the Clinton administration filed a friend-of-\nthe-court brief with the Supreme Court in opposition to physician-\nassisted suicide. In the brief for the administration, Solicitor \nGeneral Walter Dellinger wrote:\n\n       [T]here is an important and commonsense distinction between \n     withdrawing artificial supports so that a disease will \n     progress to its inevitable end, and providing chemicals to be \n     used to kill someone.\n\n  Given these statements, the President should be able to sign \nlegislation that has the very modest effect of simply not funding \nassisted suicide.\n  I agree with the statement of Walter Dellinger, Solicitor General. A \npatient may always decline or discontinue medical treatment even if \nthat may incidentally lead to the patient's death. But that is a far \ncry from administering a lethal injection or providing lethal drugs to \nthat patient. The former is a longstanding and recognized medical \npractice; the latter is medicalized\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\nkilling. The Federal Government must not make all taxpayers be involved \nin such killing.\n  Some may object that neither suicide nor the attempt at suicide are \nillegal. If people have a legal right to kill themselves, they \ncontinue, then it makes no sense to deny them the help of a physician \nin doing so, or to cut off the payment for doing that as this bill \ndoes. That is the logic.\n  But it is incorrect to say that people have a right to kill \nthemselves simply because we do not throw them in jail if they attempt \nto do so.\n  Think of the following. We have a first amendment right to protest \nand denounce the policy choices of our elected officials in, say, a \npublic park. If a supporter of that politician tried to physically \nrestrain such speech, that person would be subject to criminal charges \nof assault and battery.\n  On the other hand, suppose someone else tries physically to restrain \nanother from committing suicide. As the Minnesota Supreme Court said in \na 1975 case:\n       [T]here can be no doubt that a bona fide attempt to prevent \n     a suicide is not a crime in any jurisdiction, even where it \n     involves the detention, against her will, of the person \n     planning to kill herself.\n\n  In fact, if public authorities detect someone in the act of \nattempting to commit suicide, they will typically not only interfere, \nbut also place the person in the custody of mental health authorities. \nAnd posing a danger to oneself is a basis for involuntary commitment \nfor mental health treatment.\n\n  In short, it is not accurate to say that at present people have the \nlegal liberty to commit suicide because they can be, and frequently \nare, legally restrained from doing so.\n  Others may suggest that this is only for suicide attempts by the \nhealthy. Everyone deplores the suicide of young, healthy people. But \nthey contend some suicides are rational, like those of terminally ill \npatients.\n  Contrary to the assumptions of many in the public, a scientific study \nof people with terminal illness published in the American Journal of \nPsychiatry found that fewer than one in four with terminal illness \nexpressed a wish to die, and of those who did, every single one \nsuffered from a clinically diagnosable depression. We must remember \nthat it is the depression, not the terminal illness, that prompts a \ndesire to die or to commit suicide. And that depression is treatable in \nthe sick, the terminally ill, as well as in the healthy.\n  Psychologist Joseph Richman, former president of the American \nAssociation of Suicidologists, the professional group for experts who \ntreat the suicidal, points out that ``[E]ffective psychotherapeutic \ntreatment is possible with the terminally ill, and only irrational \nprejudices prevent the greater resort to such measures.''\n  Dr. David C. Clark, a suicidologist, observes that depressive \nepisodes in the seriously ill ``are not less responsive to medication'' \nthan depression in others.\n  So the solution for those among the terminally ill who are suicidal \nis to treat them for their depression, not pay to send them to Dr. \nKevorkian.\n  This bill sends us on the way to just that: not paying for patient \nkilling so that we can focus on real medical treatment for the patients \nwho need it.\n  So I am glad to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. \n1003, and in so doing, to send a very important message to the people \nof our Nation and to the culture of our country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask to be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I appreciate this opportunity to speak briefly \non this issue before the Senate. I begin by thanking my colleagues, \nSenator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan, and their staffs for their \nleadership on this issue.\n  As yet, only one State, the State of Oregon, my State, has passed \nlegislation to allow assisted suicide. In 1994, Oregon voters approved \nballot measure 16, called the Death With Dignity Act, which exempts \nfrom criminal and civil liability physicians who assist their patients \nin committing suicide. Since its approval, a ruling in March by the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals has prevented the law from taking \neffect, leaving the ultimate decision to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  However, I believe it is our responsibility to address this issue \nbefore other States, including New York and Washington, have to face \nthe dilemma that now confronts Oregon. Oregon has taken the initiative \nin meeting the health care needs of our most needy and vulnerable \ncitizens. Through the implementation of the Oregon health plan, I was a \nlegislator who helped to enact and to pass and to fund that act. \nHowever, ballot measure 16 threatens the lives of those we have worked \nso hard to help.\n  The Oregon health plan rations medicine in an honest way. What it \ndoes is rank the procedures that promote and provide preventive \nmedicine. I am concerned, as an Oregonian, as an American, as a \ntaxpayer, that this system that has been enacted with the very best of \nmotives will provide a slippery slope that will make the right to die \ninto a duty to die. In a time when we have few health care dollars and \nso many of those dollars are expended late in life, I fear the \nfinancial incentive that is built into the system if soon the right to \ndie becomes, under financial extremis, a duty to die.\n  Now, lest you think that I am exaggerating in my fears, the Oregon \nMedicaid director has recently publicly stated that once the legal \nissues have been resolved, Oregon will begin subsidizing physician-\nassisted suicide through the Oregon health plan. As one of Oregon's \nSenators, I cannot, on ethical, moral and other grounds, allow this to \nhappen when I have the opportunity to prevent it.\n  H.R. 1300 and Senate 304 is legislation that is not an attempt to \ncircumvent the Supreme Court. Rather, this legislation is to determine \nwhether we should require the American taxpayer to pay for these \nservices through Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program, health care services provided to Federal prisoners \nunder the military health care system.\n  The potential legal practice of physician-assisted suicide sets a \nstandard for our entire Nation. We should, instead of subsidizing a \npath to death, try to strengthen the quality of hospice and end of life \ncare. Let's offer support, not suicide, as the acceptable and \nresponsible, viable option.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, it is with great concern and with a \nheavy heart that I ask your support in passing this important and \ntimely legislation. Oregon is a beautiful State in which to live, to \nvisit, to raise a family. I ask today that you do not help Oregon \nbecome a State where people now come to die.\n  As I have said to the people and press of Oregon, the only thing that \nwe should be killing around here is Federal funding for assisted \nsuicide. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I urge their support for \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, some people have asked me whether this \nbill would create any new restrictions or limitations on such practices \nas the withholding or withdrawing of medical care; the withholding or \nwithdrawing of nutrition or hydration, abortion, or the administration \nof drugs or other services furnished to alleviate pain or discomfort, \neven if the drugs or services increase the risk of death.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is an important question, and one I want to clarify. \nH.R. 1003 would not create any new restrictions in those areas.\n  In fact, section 3(b) of the bill explicitly states that none of \nthose practices or services would be affected by the bill. This means \nthat we do not create any new limitations, and none of the practices \nand services you described would be prohibited or further restricted by \nthis bill. I also want to make clear that this bill would not place any \nnew restrictions on the provision of hospice care, which I strongly \nsupport.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have also been asked about whether the bill would \nprohibit legal services lawyers or other\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nlegal advocates receiving Federal funds from talking to their clients \nabout assisted suicide.\n  Mr. DORGAN. H.R. 1003 prohibits the use of Federal funds for legal or \nother assistance for the purpose of causing an assisted suicide; \ncompelling any other person or institution from providing or funding \nservices to cause an assisted suicide, or advocating a legal right to \ncause or assist in causing an assisted suicide.\n  However, the bill does not impose any kind of gag rule on legal \nservices or other attorneys receiving Federal funding to provide legal \nservices. An advocacy program could provide factual answers to a \nclient's questions about a State law on assisting suicide, since that \nalone would not be providing assistance to facilitate an assisted \nsuicide. Similarly, the bill does not prohibit such programs from \ncounseling clients about alternatives to assisted suicide, such as pain \nmanagement, mental health care, and community-based services for people \nwith disabilities.\n  In addition, the bill is not intended to have the effect of defunding \nan entire program, such as a legal services program or other legal or \nadvocacy program, simply because some State or privately funded portion \nof that program may advocate for or file suit to compel funding of \nservices for assisted suicide. The bill is intended only to restrict \nFederal Funds from being used for such activities.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, inasmuch as there are no Members wishing \nto speak on the pending legislation, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3249-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3257-S3258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A MESSAGE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to ask if someone at the Federal \nReserve Board might be willing to spend a quarter and buy the \nWashington Post and read the article on the front page above the fold \non the left side. If they are unwilling to do that, I will at least \nread the headline for them: ``Consumer Prices Nearly Flat in March.''\n  Why is this headline important? Because the most recent tax increase \nimposed in Washington, DC, was imposed by Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, and his Board of Governors, who, meeting \nweeks ago, in a frenzy decided that the problem in our country is that \nour economy is growing too rapidly, there are too many people working \nand too few people unemployed and our economy is moving too rapidly. \nTheir solution: Increase interest rates, impose a higher interest rate \ncharge on every single American for every purpose. Of course, that is, \nin effect, imposing a tax on everybody, isn't it? The difference is, if \nsomebody were to propose a new tax, it would have to be done here in \nthe open, in debate. But in this dinosaur we call the Federal Reserve \nBoard, it is done behind closed doors, in secret, outside of the view \nof the public, by a bunch of folks in gray suits, coming from their \nbanking backgrounds, or as economists, peer through their glasses and \ntry and see what the future holds. The future is no clearer to them \nthan it was to the augurs in Roman times when practicing the rites \ncalled augury. These high priests would read the entrails of birds, the \nentrails of cattle, observe the flights of foul in order to portend the \nfuture.\n  Well, we now have economists who, of course, practice the study of \neconomics. I sometimes refer to it as ``psychology pumped up with a \nlittle helium.'' The economists now tell us what the future will hold. \nWhat does the future hold for us? The economists at the Federal Reserve \nBoard, believed by the Board of Governors, say that our country is \nmoving too fast. It is like that Simon and Garfunkel tune, ``Feeling \nGroovy,'' although I doubt that they would play that there. It says, \n``Slow down, you're moving too fast * * *'' The country is moving too \nfast, they say --2\\1/2\\, 3 percent economic growth. Lord, what is going \nto happen if we have 3 percent sustainable economic growth? You can't \ndo that because the Fed wants to put the brakes on. They want people to \npay higher interest rates to slow our country down.\n  You know, the Federal Reserve Board had told us forever that if \nunemployment dropped below 6 percent, what would happen? A new wave of \ninflation would come. Unemployment has been below 6 percent for 30 \nmonths; inflation is going down. The Consumer Price Index is nearly \nflat. In fact, Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nsays to us, ``I think the Consumer Price Index overstates the rate of \ninflation by probably 1 full percent and maybe a percent and a half.'' \nIf that's the case, there is no inflation in our country. If there is \nno inflation in our country, why did those folks go behind the closed \ndoors, lock it up, do their banking business in secret, and come out \nand announce to us that they were imposing a new tax on every American \nin the form of a higher interest rate?\n  I ask the Fed today to buy a paper, read the story, convene a meeting \nand put interest rates where they ought to be. Your Federal funds rate \nis a full one-half of 1 percent, and now, after your last action, \nnearly three-quarters of 1 percent above where it ought to be, given \nthe rate of inflation. What does that mean? It is a premium imposed on \nthe American people--a tax in the form of higher interest. It is \nimposed on every American, without public debate.\n\n  I urge the Federal Reserve Board to meet again with the new \ninformation and understand what some of us have been talking about for \nsome long while: Your models are wrong. The world has changed. We don't \nhave upward pressures on wages in our country; we have downward \npressures on wages in our country. That is why you don't see consumer \nprices spiking up. We now exist in a global economy in which American \nworkers are asked to compete against workers elsewhere around the \nworld. It is not unusual for American workers to produce a product, to \ngo into a department store to compete against a product produced in a \nforeign country by a 14-year-old child being paid 14 cents an hour, \nworking 14 hours a day in an unsafe factory. It is a global economy. \nUnfair? Yes. But it is a global economy that now puts downward pressure \non American wages. That is why consumer prices are not spiking up. That \nis why the Federal Reserve Board is wrong.\n  The Federal Reserve Board ought to countenance more economic growth \nin this country. It can be done without reigniting the fires of \ninflation. It should be done by a Federal Reserve Board that cares more \nabout all of the American people and economic growth and opportunity \nall across this country than it does about the interest of its \nconstituents, the big money center banks.\n  I did not intend to speak about this today, but when I bought the \npaper and saw the story, it occurred to me that someone ought to stand \nup and say to the Federal Reserve Board: You were wrong a couple of \nweeks ago. You ought to admit it. We don't accept your remedy. The \nAmerican people know you are wrong because they understand what is \nhappening in our economy. Our economy isn't growing too fast. If \nanything, the economic growth is too slow. We need fewer people \nunemployed and more people employed. We need more economic growth and \nmore opportunity. I hope one day the Federal Reserve Board will adopt \npolicies that will understand that.\n  Now, we have a couple of vacancies coming at the Federal Reserve \nBoard, and I expect that the Federal Reserve Board will fill the \npositions with people who essentially look the same, act the same, talk \nthe same, and behave the same as all the other folks there. Take a look \nat who is at the Fed. In fact, I have brought for my colleagues to the \nfloor a giant chart with pictures of the Board of Governors and \nregional Federal bank presidents, indicating where they are from, where \nthey were educated, their salaries. I don't want them to be anonymous. \nI want the people to see who is making the decisions that affect all of \ntheir lives.\n  Now we will have a couple of new people appointed to the Fed. \nCongress will have a little something to say about that. But the fact \nis, the nominations will be sent to us. I have said,\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nand I say again, that I would recommend my Uncle Joe. The reason I \nrecommend Uncle Joe is the Federal Reserve Board doesn't have anybody \nserving on the board like my Uncle Joe. My Uncle Joe actually has made \na lot of things in his life. He fixed generators and starters on cars. \nHe has a lot of common sense, understands what it is to start a \nbusiness, borrow some money, make a product, sell a product. So I \nrecommended my Uncle Joe. I have been doing that for a number of years \nand Joe hasn't gotten a call yet. So I expect that the Federal Reserve \nBoard will not be blessed by the membership of my Uncle Joe.\n  I say this because I would like to see some new blood at the Fed, \nsome new energy and new direction that doesn't just buy into this \nmantra that what we need is more unemployment and slower economic \ngrowth, and somehow that represents the future of our country. The Fed \nis wrong. The numbers demonstrate that the Fed is wrong. I hope as we \ngo down the road talking about this, as well as filling the positions \nat the Fed that are going to be open, we can have a broader discussion. \nI wanted to at least acknowledge today that this new information \nexists. I encourage the Fed to buy the morning paper.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3257-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3258-S3266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ASSISTED SUICIDE FUNDING RESTRICTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \npending before us, a bill to prohibit Federal funds being used to \nassist in suicides.\n  I wish to compliment my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, and also my \ncolleague, Senator Dorgan, for their leadership. I am happy to \ncosponsor this legislation. I think it is important that we pass this \nlegislation today. I am pleased that the House passed it overwhelmingly \nby a vote of 398 to 16. It is not often that we find such an \noverwhelming vote.\n  Frankly, I can't see how anyone would vote against this legislation. \nThis legislation makes sense. It is needed. Some may ask, ``Why is it \nneeded?\"\n  You might be aware of the fact that the Supreme Court held hearings \nearlier this year on whether or not there is a legal right for assisted \nsuicide. I have read the Constitution many times. I don't find that \nright in there. That doesn't mean the Supreme Court might not, nor does \nit mean that some other judge might say yes, you have a constitutional \nright for assisted suicide, and someone else say yes, that is a \nconstitutional right; therefore, it should be covered by Medicare or \nMedicaid, and, therefore, be paid for by the Federal Government.\n  So maybe this is a preemptive strike. It is unfortunate to think it \nmight even be needed. But it is needed. We want to make sure it doesn't \nhappen. We want to make sure that we don't have more Dr. Kevorkians \nrunning around the country saying, ``You have a legal right to kill \nyourself, and therefore, we will help you; and, oh, yes, we want the \ntaxpayers to pay for it.'' We don't want the taxpayers to pay for it. \nWe want to send a signal to Dr. Kevorkian that we don't agree with him.\n  Dr. Kevorkian made a statement which was reported in the New York \nTimes on April 5 talking about the fact that he publicly burned a cease \nand desist order from the State. He said, ``If you want to stop \nsomething, pass a law.''\n  That is what we are trying to do today. We are trying to make it very \nclear that the Congress of the United States overwhelmingly believes \nthat you should not use Federal funds to assist in something like \nsuicides, something that is as deadly as suicide.\n  This would clarify the law. If assisted suicide is legalized by the \nSupreme Court, or in any individual State, all it would take is one \ndistrict court judge to rule that assisted suicide fits under the \nMedicare statute's guidelines. On January 8, 1997, the Supreme Court \nheard oral arguments in two cases in which the Federal courts of \nappeals have declared a constitutional right to assisted suicide.\n  Mr. President I think we want to send a very clear signal. I might \nmention that this Congress has already passed a ban. In 1995, I offered \nlegislation banning the use of Medicaid and Medicare funds for assisted \nsuicide in the balanced budget amendment which passed this Congress. \nUnfortunately, President Clinton vetoed the legislation. But he didn't \nveto the legislation because of this.\n  An amicus brief, filed by the American Medical Association, to the \nSupreme Court on November 12, 1996, contends that assisted suicide \n``will create profound danger for many ill persons with undiagnosed \ndepression and inadequately treated pain for whom assisted suicide \nrather than good palliative care could become the norm. At greatest \nrisk would be those with the least access to palliative care--the poor, \nthe elderly, and members of minority groups.''\n  Acting Solicitor Gen. Walter Dellinger recently said in opposing the \nidea of a right to assisted suicide, ``The systemic dangers are \ndramatic . . . the least costly treatment for any illness is lethal \nmedication.'' That is reported in the New York Times on January 9 of \nthis year.\n\n  We are a nation built on the principle that human life is sacred, to \nbe honored and cherished. As public servants, we deal with issues that \naffect the lives of people every day. Caring for people is the \nunderlying aspect of nearly every piece of legislation dealt with in \nthis Senate.\n  Dr. Joanne Lynn, board member of the American Geriatrics Society, and \ndirector of the Center to Improve Care of the Dying at George \nWashington University, said, ``No one needs to be alone or in pain or \nbeg a doctor to put an end to misery. Good care is possible.''\n  Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, while dying last November, took the time \nto write the Supreme Court on assisted suicide, saying,\n\n       There can be no such thing as a ``right to assisted \n     suicide'' because there can be no legal and moral order which \n     tolerates the killing of innocent human life, even if the \n     agent of death is self-administered. Creating a new ``right'' \n     to assisted suicide will endanger society and send a false \n     signal that a less than ``perfect'' life is not worth living.\n\n  There are a lot of groups and a lot of individuals who have endorsed \nthis legislation.\n  The American Medical Association said,\n\n       The power to assist in intentionally taking the life of a \n     patient is antithetical to the central mission of healing \n     that guides physicians. The AMA continues to stand by its \n     ethical principle that physician-assisted suicide is \n     fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as \n     healer and that physicians must instead aggressively respond \n     to the needs of patients at the end of life.\n\n  That was signed by John Seward, executive vice president of the AMA, \non April 15.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is endorsed by not only the American \nMedical Association but also the National Conference of Catholic \nBishops, American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, American \nGeriatrics Society, Christian Coalition, Family Research Council, Free \nCongress, National Right to Life, Physicians for Compassionate Care, \nand the Traditional Values Coalition.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that letters be printed in the \nRecord at this point from the Catholic Health Association and also the \nChristian Coalition in support of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Christian Coalition,\n\n\n                                          Capitol Hill Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: As of this morning, the Majority Leader was \n     trying to work out an agreement to bring up the Assisted \n     Suicide Funding Restriction Act for a vote this afternoon.\n       On behalf of the members and supporters of the Christian \n     Coalition, we urge you to vote for the Assisted Suicide \n     Funding Restriction Act. This legislation overwhelmingly \n     passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 398-16.\n       The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act restricts the \n     use of tax dollars for the purpose of assisted suicide, \n     euthanasia, or mercy killing. The overwhelming majority of \n     American taxpayers oppose the use of tax\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\n     dollars for assisted suicide and euthanasia, with 87 percent \n     of Americans opposing the use of tax dollars for these \n     purposes. This widespread support, as well as the moral \n     grounds for opposing the funding of assisted suicide, compels \n     passage of this legislation.\n       This is a carefully-crafted bill and we would like to see \n     it pass in its present form. Please vote for H.R. 1003, the \n     Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. Thank you for your \n     consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brian Lopina,\n     Director, Governmental Affairs Office.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Catholic Health Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1997.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I understand that H.R. 1003, the \n     Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act, will soon be \n     considered by the full Senate. On behalf of more than 1,200 \n     health care facilities and organizations, the Catholic Health \n     Association of the United States (CHA) urges the Senate to \n     give this legislation swift and favorable consideration.\n       As health care providers, members of CHA reject physician-\n     assisted suicide as antithetical to their religious beliefs \n     and their mission as healers. Because assisted suicide \n     offends the basic moral precepts of our culture and poses a \n     grave danger to those at the margins of our society, state \n     governments have consistently outlawed its practice. \n     Unfortunately, a Florida state court and two federal Courts \n     of Appeals recently have misconstrued the Constitution to \n     ``discover'' a constitutionally protected liberty interest in \n     physician-assisted suicide.\n       In response to the threat of these cases and a recent \n     referendum in Oregon, Congress should establish the principle \n     that federal tax dollars will not be expended for the \n     purposeful taking of human life. While none are being used \n     for this purpose today, judicial activism threatens to \n     undermine our long-established societal consensus against \n     assisted suicide.\n       The legislative proposal before you properly distinguishes \n     between the withholding or withdrawing of burdensome and \n     ineffective medical treatment and the aiding of another in \n     purposefully taking human life. Catholic teaching and common \n     sense support this distinction.\n       The most important reason to pass this legislation is to \n     send a signal to disabled persons, the elderly and other \n     vulnerable people that they are valued members of the human \n     community. They enrich rather than burden society. The late \n     Joseph Cardinal Bernardin said it best in his letter to the \n     Supreme Court: ``There can be no such thing as a `right to \n     assisted suicide' because there can be no legal or moral \n     order which tolerates the killing of innocent human life, \n     even if the agent of death is self-administered. Creating a \n     new `right' to assisted suicide will endanger society and \n     send a false signal that a less than `perfect life' is not \n     worth living.''\n       CHA has a long and distinguished record of supporting the \n     goal of universal health care coverage. In addition, we \n     support meaningful efforts to improve care for the dying. \n     Yet, we do not support the views of those opposing this bill \n     on the grounds that it does not accomplish all of these \n     worthy goals in one bill. Congress should pass this bill and \n     then move on to legislation that increases health care \n     coverage and helps to provide those at the end of life with \n     the care and comfort that they deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William J. Cox.\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I wish to thank sponsors of this \nlegislation. I have had the pleasure of working with both Senators from \nMissouri. Both Senators made outstanding statements in support of this \nlegislation. In addition, Senator Dorgan--we appreciate his support for \nthis legislation. It has bipartisan support. We have a lot of \ncosponsors on both sides of the aisle.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will pass the identical bill that the \nHouse passed and that we will send it to the President.\n  Also, I have a statement from the administration. The Clinton \nadministration issued a statement of administration policy on April 10, \n1997, which states, ``The President made it clear that he does not \nsupport assisted suicide. The administration, therefore, does not \noppose enactment of H.R. 1003.''\n  Mr. President, there is no reason for us to amend this legislation. \nThere is no reason for us to delay this legislation. Let's pass this \nlegislation and send a message to Dr. Kevorkian and others that Federal \nfunding will not be tolerated and that it will not be legal to assist \nin assisted suicide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his \nexcellent statement on this issue. I appreciate his leadership on this \nissue. When this legislation was initially filed last year, I was not \naware of the fact that he had previously included it in other matters. \nBut he has been a leader in respecting the will of the American people \nnot to participate in the funding of assisted suicide.\n  Mr. President, I might add as well that while House bill 1003 is \nlargely consistent and almost totally compatible with the bill that \nSenator Dorgan and I filed here in the U.S. Senate, the House added \nsome provisions which I think improve the measure. Both bills were \nnarrowly and tightly drawn and focused on the fact that we didn't \nbelieve there should be Federal funding for assisted suicide.\n  The House measure includes provisions designed to reduce the rate of \nsuicide, including assisted suicide, among persons with disabilities or \nterminal or chronic illness, by furthering knowledge and practice of \npain management, depression identification, palliative care, and other \nissues related to suicide prevention. The bill would amend the Public \nHealth Service Act to use existing Federal funds to establish research, \ntraining, and demonstration projects intended to help achieve the goal \nof reducing the rate of suicide. That would also, of course, include \nreducing the rate of individuals interested in assisted suicide. It \nalso includes a provision directing the General Accounting Office to \nanalyze the effectiveness and achievements of the grant programs that \nare authorized by the Public Health Service Act.\n  So, resources now available to the public through the Public Health \nService Act can be used in accordance with this measure to reduce the \nrate of suicide. It is important for us not just to be concerned about \nFederal funding for suicide, but where possible to help individuals \nunderstand the potential for hope in the situation rather than despair.\n  I might just also point out that assisted suicide and the potential \nfor assisted suicide or funding for assisted suicide in a culture are \nnot really conducive to the development of other therapies. It is \ninteresting to note that Justice Breyer pointed out a number of \nimportant facts during the Supreme Court's recent oral arguments \nregarding the right to assisted suicide. He indicated that supportive \nservices for vulnerable patients remain undeveloped once a society has \naccepted assisted suicide as a quick and easy solution for their \nproblems. In particular, he noted that in England, which prohibits \nassisted suicide, there are over 180 hospices for people who are \nterminally ill; 180 facilities designed for compassionate care to help \nthese people. In a sense, each of us is terminally ill. Each of us \nultimately will die. In the Netherlands, on the other hand, which \nallows assisted suicide, rather than having 180 hospices, they have \nonly 3.\n\n  It may be inappropriate to draw a conclusion here, but it seems to me \nthat once a culture decides that the thing to do with terminally-ill \npatients is to help them die quickly, they neglect and otherwise refuse \nto develop the kinds of institutions which would help people who really \nought to live and want to live and have many things to contribute.\n  It is with that in mind that I think it is peculiarly and singularly \nimportant that this Congress respond to the voice of the American \npeople, which with near unanimity is calling for us to prohibit Federal \nfunding of assisted suicide. It is with that in mind that I urge my \ncolleagues to join by voting in favor of this proposal.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Ashcroft has just outlined a \nprovision that was included in the legislation enacted by the House of \nRepresentatives. Frankly, I think this addition improves the \nlegislation that we introduced here in the Senate. The amendment that \nwas accepted by the House and is in this legislation provides for the \nprevention of suicide, including assisted suicide. It provides \nauthorization for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to fund \nresearch and demonstration projects using existing Public Health \nService dollars to prevent suicide among people with disabilities or \nterminal or chronic illnesses. That amendment addresses an issue that \nis very significant and serious, and I think it adds to this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\n  With this legislation, we are not only saying that we want to prevent \nFederal funding of assisted suicide, but also that we want to improve \nthe availability of compassionate end-of-life care so that terminally \nor chronically ill individuals do not feel that assisted suicide is \ntheir only option for relief.\n  So I think this amendment is a good amendment, and I support it.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can move along to final passage on this \nlegislation.\n  I don't know whether there are those who intend to offer amendments. \nI see Senator Wellstone from Minnesota is on the floor. My hope is that \nwe can proceed on this noncontroversial piece of legislation and finish \nit today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the U.S. Senate considers H.R. \n1003, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997. As an \noriginal co-sponsor of S. 304, the Senate companion to H.R. 1003, I \nrise in support of this measure's reasonable and responsible action in \nprohibiting the use of Federal funds to support physician-assisted \nsuicide.\n  Modern medical technology has made a significant difference in the \nhealth care challenges that patients and providers face today. While \nfew Americans fear death from scarlet fever or cholera, a growing \nnumber are concerned about the potential for a slow, painful death from \ncancer or a degenerative neurological disorder. Advocates for \nphysician-assisted suicide package the concept as purely an issue of \npatient choice and personal liberty in seeking relief from suffering. \nMoreover, they argue that this choice harms no one. I respectfully but \nstringently disagree. Physician-assisted suicide condones the \nintentional killing of a human being as a valid method for relieving \npain and suffering when other means are available to address a \npatient's critical medical needs.\n  Advocates for physician-assisted suicide point to secondary effect, \nthe circumstance where a patient dies during treatment for pain, as a \nfactor lending legitimacy to the legalization of euthanasia. Again, I \ndisagree. A large number of Americans and a majority in the medical \ncommunity identify the critical difference between the administration \nof pain medication and physician-assisted suicide. In the former, a \nphysician makes a medical assessment and administers the level of \nmedication necessary to relieve a patient's pain and suffering. Though \nthe action is taken with the knowledge that the treatment could cause \ndeath, the physician's sole medical goal is helping the patient attain \nrelief from suffering. In contrast, physician-assisted suicide is the \nintentional administration of a drug, not for pain relief, but to kill. \nH.R. 1003 recognizes the critical difference between secondary effect \nand physician-assisted suicide.\n  While patients' rights have been raised in the debate over physician-\nassisted suicide, I want to draw attention to the broader implications \nof this action on the health care community. The American Medical \nAssociation makes clear in its Code of Medical Ethics that the \nintentional act of killing a patient is antithetical to the central \nmission of healing that bonds the physician-patient relationship. The \nAMA fully endorses H.R. 1003's purpose to assure that the integrity of \ndoctors working for Federal health care programs and in Federal health \ncare facilities is not compromised by the act of physician-assisted \nsuicide. Without H.R. 1003, doctors face a painful dilemma of whether \nthey are expected to conduct assisted suicide as a form of medical \ntreatment. The AMA rejects such a concept, and 87 percent of Americans \nagree that Federal tax dollars should not support such a questionable \npractice.\n\n  It is clear to all that patient concerns regarding the health care \nthreats of degenerative and painful disease must be addressed. This \ncritical need is one of the reasons why I and other Members of the U.S. \nSenate support Federal investment in medical research. The Federal \nGovernment should not invest in physician-assisted suicide as a \nlegitimate option for pain control however. Medicine today is capable \nof managing physical pain, but patients are forced to endure pain and \nsuffering because this information is not applied uniformly. For the \nwelfare of patients and families, we should focus our energies on \ncorrecting these failures in medical care delivery, rather than \ndiverting critical attention toward the questionable promotion of \nassisted suicide.\n  Mr. President, I support the right of Americans to decide whether or \nnot to withdraw or withhold medical treatment. I also appreciate the \ndifference between acts to relieve the pain of a dying patient and acts \nthat intentionally produce pre-mature death. H.R. 1003 does the same. \nThis measure makes clear that Federal funds do not and will not support \nphysician-assisted suicide to the detriment of patients, families, and \nthe medical community. I urge my colleagues to join in support of H.R. \n1003's intent to ensure that this vital concern for millions of \nAmericans is properly addressed.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1003 and I urge \nmy fellow Senators also to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  This bill simply prohibits the use of Federal funds for the \ncontroversial and immoral practice of assisted suicide. It rightly \nkeeps the Federal Government out of the business of killing.\n  The bill prevents the use of funds to provide health care items or \nservices ``furnished for the purpose of causing * * * the death of any \nindividual, such as by assisted suicide, euthanasia or mercy killing.'' \nDeath of the individual has been included because proponents of \nassisted suicide, mercy killing, and euthanasia often use other terms \nto describe these activities, such as physician aid in dying. In fact, \nthe Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which legalizes these actions under \ncertain circumstances, specifically provides that ``actions taken in \naccordance with [this law] shall not, for any purpose, constitute \nassisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide''--even though the actions \nprecisely are assisted suicide or mercy killing! The bill is very clear \nabout the activity that should not receive Federal funds: an item or \nservice furnished for the purpose of causing the death of any \nindividual will not be funded by American taxpayers.\n  Close observers will note that this broad language is used in \nsections 3, 4, and 7 of the bill, while more narrow language is used in \nsections 2, 5, and 6, where funds are prohibited for ``causing the \nsuicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual. The broad \nlanguage is used with regard to the general prohibition on health care \nfunding (section 3), the prohibition on the use of funds under the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Assistance Act (section 4), and the Patient \nSelf Determination Act (section 7) to ensure that the activities and \nactions intended not to receive Federal funds in fact do not receive \nthem. The broad language is necessary because proponents often describe \nthese activities in different terms; it is used without concern of \nunintended consequences because the programs covered in these instances \nare clearly and narrowly defined.\n  The narrow language is used in the bill's findings and purposes \nprovisions (section 2, which does not have the force of law), \nrestrictions on advocacy programs (section 5), and restrictions on \nfunding for mercy killing, euthanasia, and assisted suicide in national \ndefense and criminal justice programs (section 6) because broad \nlanguage, if applied to these programs, could have unintended \nconsequences. For example, if the broad language were used with respect \nto criminal justice enforcement, it may have the effect of prohibiting \ncapital punishment. But this bill is only about funding for assisted \nsuicide--mainly in Federal health care programs, because proponents of \nassisted suicide are successfully legitimizing assisted suicide--for \nsome--as a form of health or medical care.\n  Assisted suicide is not health care. Or medical care. The Federal \nGovernment, supported by all American by all American tax payers, \nshould not pay for this. This carefully crafted bill will ensure that \nthat does not happen. It deserves our support.\n  Some questions have arisen as to whether H.R. 1003 applies to the \nprovision or withholding or withdrawing of medical treatment, medical \ncare, nutrition, or hydration. My reading of the bill indicates that \nthe bill does not address such situations.\n  H.R. 1003 is a deliberately narrow piece of legislation. It deals \nwith the issue of Federal subsidies for direct killing, as by a lethal \ninjection or a lethal drug. It is not designed to address\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nor affect in any way, positively or negatively, Federal funding for the \nwithholding or withdrawal of medical treatment and medical care, \nnutrition or hydration. Nor is it designed to address affect in any \nway, positively or negatively, such withholding or withdrawal in \nveterans' hospitals, military hospitals, or other Federal facilities.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, no one should read into the adoption of \nthis legislation any expression of blanket congressional approval for \nthe practice of withholding or withdrawing of nutrition and hydration \nor, for that matter, of any lifesaving medical treatment. This Senator, \nfor one, is convinced that causing a patient to die of starvation or \ndehydration is absolutely wrong. I, for one, would not have supported \nthis bill as an original cosponsor if I believed that it authorized the \nuse of Federal funds to withhold or withdraw nutrition and hydration \nfrom a patient.\n  Indeed, I am convinced that every Member of this body, and I dare say \nof the other body as well, can think of at least some circumstances in \nwhich he or she would agree that denial of medical treatment, or of \nfood and fluids, is wrong and should not be subsidized with Federal tax \ndollars. Plainly, then in voting for this legislation we do not intend \nsome broad sanction for denial of nutrition, hydration, medical \ntreatment and care.\n  All we do in section 3(b) of H.R. 1003 is make clear the narrow scope \nof this bill: that it deals with direct killing only, and not with \nthese other practices. Thus, section 3(b) should be read simply as a \nscope limitation for this legislation, and not as expressing a \nsubstantive policy position on withholding or withdrawing medical \ntreatment, medical care, nutrition or hydration. That is a matter for \nanother day.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to express my firm belief that \nours is a Nation that should direct itself to expanding the scope of \nthe human community; to ensuring that all its members enjoy full access \nto the protection of life, liberty, and happiness. Our culture is one \nthat increasingly commits itself to death, to killing those that some \ndo not consider to be part of the human family. For years some in this \ncountry have treated the preborn child as unworthy of that protection. \nRecently, the President has vetoed a ban on partial-birth abortions--\nhas allowed the killing of a child just three inches and 3 seconds from \nfull protection of the law. Now our culture is moving toward promoting \nthe killing of the elderly, the handicapped, those who suffer \ndesperately--instead of offering them support, resources, and hope.\n  I commend the Senator from Missouri for his excellent work on this \nbill and his steadfast efforts to prevent taxpayers from being forced \nto support a culture of death. His work reclaims some of our hope that \nAmerica can again be a beacon of light in a culture of life.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thought it would be helpful to \nshare some thoughts about other important issues that I hope the \nCongress will address once action is taken on the bill before us to \nprohibit Federal funding for physician-assisted suicide.\n  Because of my involvement in health care issues and the Medicare \nProgram specifically, I have spent some time in recent months taking \nanother look at the concerns and dilemmas that face patients, their \nfamily members, and their physicians when confronted with death or the \npossibility of dying. In almost all such difficult situations, these \npeople are not thinking about physician-assisted suicide. The needs and \ndilemmas that confront them have much more to do with the kind of care \nand information that are needed, sometimes desperately.\n  I am learning more and more about the importance of educating health \ncare providers and the public that chronic, debilitating, terminal \ndisease need not be associated with pain, major discomfort, and loss of \ncontrol. We need to focus on the tremendous amount that can be done to \ncontrol a wide range of symptoms associated with terminal illness, to \nassure that the highest level of comfort care is provided to those who \nare dying or have chronic, debilitating disease.\n  The tremendous advances in medicine and medical technology over the \npast 30-50 years have resulted in a greatly expanded life expectancy \nfor Americans, as well as vastly improved functioning and quality of \nlife for the elderly and those with chronic disease. Many of these \nadvances have been made possible by federally financed health care \nprograms, especially the Medicare Program that assured access to high \nquality health care for all elderly Americans, as well as funding much \nof the development of technology and a highly skilled physician work \nforce through support of medical education and academic medical \ncenters. These advances have also created major dilemmas in addressing \nterminal or potentially terminal disease, as well as a sense of loss of \ncontrol by many with terminal illness.\n  I believe it's time for Medicare and other federally funded health \ncare programs to assure that all elderly, chronically ill, and disabled \nindividuals have access to compassionate, supportive, and pain-free \ncare during prolonged illness and at the end of life. As we discuss \nrestructuring Medicare during the present session of Congress, this \nwill be one of my primary goals.\n  Much of the knowledge necessary to assure individuals appropriate \nend-of-life care already exists. Much needs to be done, however, to \nassure that all health care providers have the appropriate training to \nuse what is known already about such supportive care. The public must \nalso be educated and empowered to discuss these issues with family \nmembers as well as their own physicians so that each individual's \nwishes can be respected. More research is needed to develop appropriate \nmeasures of quality end-of-life care and incorporate these measures \ninto medical practice in all health care settings. And finally, \nappropriate financial incentives must be present within Medicare, \nespecially, to allow the elderly and disabled their choice of \nappropriate care at the end of life.\n  I will soon be introducing legislation that addresses the need to \ndevelop appropriate quality measures for end-of-life care, to develop \nmodels of compassionate care within the Medicare Program and to \nencourage individuals to have open communication with family members \nand health care providers concerning preferences for end-of-life care. \nThese are the issues that truly need to be addressed by Congress and \nencouraged through Federal financing programs for health care, and I am \nvery committed to promoting the action that Americans and their \nphysicians are looking to us to help them with. By addressing end-of-\nlife issues in this manner, there may be a day when the divisive debate \nover physician-assisted suicide will become unnecessary.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to address the legislation \nbefore us which would further codify and clarify existing Federal law, \npractice, and policy on the prohibition of the use of Federal funds, \nwhether directly or indirectly, for physician-assisted suicide. This \nproposal has received broad bipartisan support within the Congress, \nwithin the administration, and in the medical community.\n  This is an issue that supersedes the politics of the present, and \ncuts to the heart of our concept of respect for life. As a physician, I \ntook an oath, like physicians for centuries before me, to ``first do no \nharm.'' While there are times when the best in medical technology and \nexpertise cannot save or prolong life, we should never turn those tools \ninto instruments to take life, and we must preserve the sacred trust \nbetween physician and patient.\n  I am pleased that this bill is tightly focused and disciplined in its \napproach to this controversial issue. However, I am concerned that the \nmost important issue may be obscured by this debate. Physicians have a \nresponsibility to ensure that patients are both comfortable and \ncomforted during their last precious days on Earth. As legislators \nresponsible for policy decisions impacting the federally funded health \ncare programs, we also have a responsibility. We must continue to look \nfor ways to support efforts to provide palliative care, as well as to \nsupport efforts to educate physicians, patients, and families about \nend-of-life issues.\n  We have made enormous progress in treating and managing illness at \nthe end of life. Over the last 50 years, life expectancy has risen \ndramatically as we have learned to manage the complications of \nillnesses which were previously considered terminal. The issue of \nphysician-assisted suicide is an indication of our need to focus on \nother\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nways of relieving suffering, while maintaining the dignity of the \nterminally ill and their families.\n  While I do not believe that it is the role of the Government to \nintrude upon the relationship between a physician and patient, I do \nbelieve that policymakers have an obligation to create an environment \nwhich supports the quality of care in this country. Therefore, our \nvotes in support of this bill must also be seen as our decision to take \nup a new challenge--that of finding new ways to facilitate the \ncompassionate care of the dying.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when the able Senators Ashcroft and Dorgan \ninvited me to cosponsor S. 304, a bill to prohibit the use of Federal \nfunds for assisted suicide, I unhesitatingly accepted. Now today, I do \nhope the Senate will promptly approve H.R. 1003, now pending which is \nnearly identical to S. 304 and which was passed overwhelmingly by the \nHouse this past Thursday.\n  The Supreme Court's tragic Roe versus Wade decision in 1973 \nestablished that human beings--unborn children--at one end of the age \nspectrum are expendable for reasons of convenience and social policy; \neuthanasia is now the next step. Many, including this Senator who in \n1973 had just been sworn in, argued that if we can justify in our own \nminds the destruction of the lives of those whose productive years are \nyet to come, what is to prevent our destroying or agreeing to end the \nlives of men and women who can no longer pull their own weight in \nsociety?\n  That day may arrive as early as this summer. The Supreme Court is \ncurrently reviewing two circuit courts of appeals decisions which, if \nupheld, will affirm the constitutional right of individuals to \nterminate their own lives with the assistance of Dr. Kevorkian or other \nlike-minded physicians. But inevitably, those who demand that this \nbecome an acceptable right are also expecting the taxpayers to furnish \nthe money for it.\n  At a minimum, Mr. President, surely the Senate will reject the notion \nthat tax funded programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, should be used \nto terminate the lives of human beings. Despite anybody's looking with \nfavor on euthanasia, it is absurd to suggest that the American people \nmust sponsor it with their already-high taxes.\n  The American people emphatically reject this idea. A poll conducted \nlast year by Wirthlin Worldwide revealed that 87 percent of people \noppose Federal funding of assisted suicide.\n  So, Mr. President, the bill under consideration will not outlaw \neuthanasia. But it will forbid the use of Federal tax dollars to fund \nassisted suicides. And more importantly, the Senate will heed the \nAmerican people's belief that paying for such a morally objectionable \nprocedure is just going too far.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Physician \nAssisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997. This bill would \nmaintain current Federal policy to prevent the use of Federal funds and \nfacilities to provide and promote assisted suicide. It would not \nnullify any decision by a State to legalize assisted suicide, nor \nrestrict State or privately financed assisted suicide; nor will it \naffect any living will statutes or any limitation relating to the \nwithdrawal or withholding of medical treatment or care.\n  The bill is urgently needed to protect Federal programs which have \ntraditionally been designed to protect the health and welfare of our \ncitizens. The ninth circuit recently reinstated an Oregon statute which \nprovided for physician-assisted suicide through the State's Medicaid \nProgram. This program is funded in part with Federal tax dollars. \nUnless we enact this statute, Federal dollars will be used to fund \nphysician-assisted suicide. There is an immediate and pressing need for \nthe Senate to act on this matter now. Our Nation has always been \ncommitted to the preservation of the lives of its citizens. The \nAmerican people expect that tradition to continue.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives acted in a decisive vote of \n398 to 16 to ban the use of Federal funds to support physician-assisted \nsuicide and the President has indicated that he does not oppose this \nlegislation. Mr. President, the American people do not want their tax \ndollars spent to assist individuals to commit suicide.\n  This legislation simply prohibits the use of Federal funds for \nassisted suicide. It does not address the issue that is currently \nbefore the Supreme Court in Washington versus Glucksburg. The issue in \nthat case is whether there is a liberty interest in committing suicide, \nand if so, whether that interest extends to obtaining the assistance of \na doctor to do the same. Mr. President, nothing in this legislation \nwill affect the decision that the Supreme Court will announce later \nthis summer. What this bill does is maintain the longstanding Federal \npolicy of preventing Federal funds from being used for this purpose. \nThe American taxpayer shouldn't be forced to pay for the activities of \nDr. Kevorkian and other physicians who may be engaged in assisting \nsuicide.\n  Mr. President, we are not acting prematurely by passing this \nlegislation. The State of Oregon already has decided that physician-\nassisted suicide is legal and that State Medicaid funds may be used for \nthat purpose. The long-standing policy against the use of Federal tax \ndollars is now in jeopardy, and congressional action is now needed. Tax \ndollars ought to be used to extend life, not cause death.\n  Finally, I am pleased to see that this legislation contains a \nprovision to allow for research into ways we can reduce the rate of \nsuicide among individuals with disabilities and chronic illnesses. \nModern pain management techniques are improving rapidly, and it is my \nhope that this research will reduce the demand for assisted suicide, \nwhether legal or illegal, in the future. We need to continue pain \nresearch, and make resources available to ensure that health care \nprofessionals are capable of administering these new treatments as they \ndevelop. This is a forward-looking approach and we should encourage \nthis sort of research--it will improve the quality of life for those \nwith debilitating diseases.\n  Mr. President, I think I speak for the vast majority of the American \npeople when I say that their Federal tax dollars should not be used to \nfund physician-assisted suicide. I am very pleased to support this \nbill. I commend Senator Ashcroft for bringing this issue to the \nattention of the Senate. I hope my colleagues will support the bill, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish we were not here debating this \nlegislation today--not because I don't think it is right; I do, and I \nam a cosponsor of the bill; but because I wish there was no need to \ntake up a bill like this in the first place.\n  Unfortunately, our hands have been forced, largely by the courts.\n  In March of last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that \na Washington State law prohibiting physician-assisted suicide was \nunconstitutional under the constitutional right of privacy.\n  Then, a month later, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals struck down \na similar New York State law, arguing that the equal protection clause \nof the Constitution gives the terminally ill the same rights to hasten \ntheir own death through drugs as other patients have to refuse \nartificial life support.\n  Although implementation has been delayed by the courts, in 1994, \nOregon voters approved a referendum making physician-assisted suicide \nlegal in that State.\n  The Supreme Court has heard oral arguments on the matter--and it is \nexpected to rule before the end of this term.\n  Now, if physician-assisted suicide does become legal--through the \ncourts or through State referendums or by some other means--there will \nbe no doubt an attempt made to have the Federal Government pay for \nthis.\n  I can hear the arguments already. People will demand that Medicare or \nMedicaid reimburse physicians who help people commit suicide. Mr. \nPresident, this is not such a farfetched notion.\n  After the voters approved the Oregon referendum in 1994, Oregon \nofficials actually admitted they would seek Medicaid reimbursement if \nthe law were to go into effect.\n  Now, truth in advertising here, Mr. President. I am opposed to \nphysician-assisted suicide becoming legal in this country, period. So I \ndon't want to hide under some false cloak here. I am one of those who \ndoes not support abortion, but I acknowledge that my personal religious \nview should not be imposed upon the rest of the world because, for\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nme, it is hard to determine and insist that my view on when there is a \nhuman life in being is more accurate than someone who is equally as \nreligious as me, but might have a different view. But a suicide is a \ndifferent story. There is no question that there is a human life in \nbeing. Physician-assisted suicide is the most dangerous slippery slope, \nin my view, that a nation can embark upon.\n  So I make it clear that this has nothing to do with whether \nphysician-assisted suicide should be allowed. I don't think it should \nbe. But that is beside the point today. What is at issue is--if it \nbecomes legal in one State, several States, or all States--is the \nFederal Government going to have to pay for it?\n  To that, I hope we will emphatically say ``no,'' regardless of what \neach of us thinks about the legality or constitutionality of physician-\nassisted suicide.\n  No matter where you are on the issue, under no circumstances should \nthe Federal Government be paying physicians to help people kill \nthemselves.\n  Let me say what else this debate today is not about. It is not about \nrefusing to accept medical treatment. The Supreme Court has already \nruled that individuals have a right to refuse unwanted medical \ntreatment. I am not sure how a physician or a hospital would bill \nMedicare or Medicaid for not providing a treatment that the patient did \nnot want. But, regardless of that, this bill explicitly states that the \nfunding prohibition does not apply in such circumstances and does not \napply to drugs given to alleviate pain.\n  What we are talking about is when physicians specifically give a \npatient a drug to kill them--when there is a proactive attempt to kill \na patient. That is what we are talking about--no Federal dollars \nallowed.\n  I commend Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan for their work on this \nbill. This has been a bipartisan effort from the start--going back to \nwhen this bill was first put together last summer.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we swiftly and definitively \nresolve this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. \n1003, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 304, the Senate companion bill \nto H.R. 1003. As a cosponsor, I was especially gratified to learn of \nthe overwhelming bipartisan vote of 398 to 16 by which H.R. 1003 passed \nthe House of Representatives on April 10, 1997.\n  With its resounding votes to pass both the Assisted Suicide Funding \nRestriction Act and H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of \n1997, the House of Representatives has taken two major actions aimed at \nrestoring respect for the sanctity of human life in our great Nation. I \ntrust that in the weeks ahead, the Senate will join the House by \npassing both of these bills by large majorities and sending them to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, before he passed away last November, Joseph Cardinal \nBernadin left a moving testimony to the sanctity of life. ``I am at the \nend of my earthly life,'' Chicago's Cardinal wrote in a letter \naddressed to the U.S. Supreme Court. ``Our legal and ethical tradition \nhas held consistently that suicide, assisted-suicide, and euthanasia \nare wrong because they involve a direct attack on innocent human \nlife,'' Cardinal Bernadin continued. ``Creating a new `right' to \nassisted suicide,'' the Cardinal concluded, ``will . . . send a false \nsignal that a less than perfect life is not worth living.''\n  Mr. President, by enacting H.R. 1003, the Congress will be moving to \ndefend the sanctity of human life by preventing the use of Federal \nfunds and facilities to provide and promote assisted suicide. This is \nindeed a worthy goal and I am honored to be a part of this effort.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the ban on the use of Federal \nfunds for assisted suicide, and I commend Senator Dorgan and Senator \nAshcroft for their leadership on this issue.\n  The disabled, the elderly, low-income and other Americans in need are \noften totally reliant on federally financed health care. Allowing \nFederal funds to be used for assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy \nkilling could lead to situations in which terminally ill or seriously \nill individuals are coerced into choosing assisted suicide over \ntraditional medical treatments or pain management therapies. In \naddition, many seriously ill people who suffer transient depression \ncould choose suicide, when, if their depression were treated, they \nwould not make this irrevocable choice.\n  I also support the intent of the legislation to exclude certain \nmedical treatments and procedures from the provisions of the ban. \nEvidence of this intent is found in both the language of the Senate \nbill and the language contained in the House report concerning section \n3(b). This subsection clarifies the exact nature of the medical \nprocedures and services which are not intended to be covered by the \nprohibition on the use of Federal funds. It is important to emphasize \nthat the ban does not cover individuals who do not want their lives \nprolonged by heroic medical treatments or the other specific treatments \nidentified in the language of the House report on this subsection.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I am going to in a short period of \ntime offer two amendments which I hope will be really noncontroversial. \nI just would like to talk about both of them in general terms and then \nI will come back in time to offer these amendments.\n  One of these amendments has to do with what I think is, \nunfortunately, very germane and it has to do with our failure still to \nprovide the kind of mental health services, the kind of mental health \ncoverage that is so direly needed. I know my colleagues have said one \nof the things that concerns them and concerns others is that all too \noften some of the people who take their lives are people in a severe \nstate of depression, people who have not been treated. And then, of \ncourse, you really wonder whether or not this ever should have happened \nand this is the last thing you would like to see assisted.\n  So I really feel that if, in fact, we are saying we do not want to \nsee this kind of assisted, physician-assisted suicide, or people taking \ntheir lives, that is to say, then I think we really want to make sure \nwe do not get to the point where some people, some who really want to \ntake their lives are taking their lives not even necessarily because \nthey are in terrible pain with a terrible illness but having more to do \nwith a terrible mental illness. This is an amendment we will come to in \na little while.\n  The first amendment that I will offer shortly is an amendment which \nsays it is the sense of the Senate that the Senate supports firm but \nfair work requirements for low-income unemployed individuals. I do not \nthink my colleagues would disagree with that. And low-income workers \nwho are jobless but are unable to find a job should look for work, they \nshould participate in workfare or job training programs but they should \nnot be denied food stamps without these opportunities.\n  Again, I am just waiting for response from a couple other Senators \nbefore I introduce these amendments, but just in very broad outline the \nwhy of this amendment.\n  I am going to draw from a study which comes out from the Department \nof Agriculture February 13, 1997, which really points to the \ncharacteristics of childless unemployed adult food stamp and legal \nimmigrant food stamp participants.\n  Madam President, this is not a pretty picture. We are talking about \nthe poorest of poor people. If we are going to have vehicles out in the \nChamber and there is going to be an opportunity--and these are just \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments--to really try and get the Senate on \nrecord to correct some problems that have to be corrected, then I want \nto take full advantage of it. In this particular case, we are talking \nabout people who are very poor, many\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nof them women, many of them minorities.\n  What we are saying is, yes, work, but if there is not a workfare \nprogram available and someone cannot find a job, then do not cut people \noff food stamp assistance, do not say that in a 3-year period you can \nonly get 3 months' worth of food stamp assistance.\n  Why in the world would we want to create the very situation we are \nnow creating which is you are basically taking the most vulnerable \ncitizens, the poorest of poor people and you are putting them in a \nsituation where they want to work, they cannot find a job, there is not \na workfare program available, there is not a job training program \navailable, they are suffering, struggling with HIV infection or dying \nfrom AIDS, they are struggling with mental illness, they did not even \nhave a high school education, there are no opportunities for the \ntraining, and we are now saying that we are going to cut you off food \nstamp assistance. This was the harshest provision of the welfare bill \nthat we passed.\n\n  And so, Madam President, I come to the floor, and I will in a moment \nsuggest the absence of a quorum just for a moment and then we will move \nforward with both of these amendments. But I come to the floor to \nintroduce both of these amendments. These are sense-of-the-Senate \namendments. I hope they will command widespread support. I say to my \ncolleagues I am really hopeful for a very strong vote. I know they are \nanxious to have the bill come through. I do not think these \namendments--I made them sense-of-the-Senate amendments. I think the \nlanguage is very reasonable, and I do not mean to hold up the \nlegislation at all, but on the other hand I do mean to get some \nattention focused on some areas that we really need to address.\n  Madam President, just for a moment, I would suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Minnesota suggests that these are \nmerely sense-of-the-Senate amendments and that they would not impair \nthe progress of the bill substantially. If by adding these amendments \nto the bill we send the bill to conference, we delay substantially our \nability to move this legislation to the President of the United States \nfor his signature.\n  Throughout our comments and remarks, I think it has been clear we are \nsimply at present awaiting judicial decisions which might authorize on \na momentary basis Federal funding of assisted suicide, so that it is \ncrucial we not delay this process. And sending this measure to \nconference would in fact delay the process.\n  Second, I should indicate that this is not a measure which is \ndesigned to prohibit assisted suicide. Some suggestions seem to have \nbeen made that this is a measure which would attempt to control whether \nor not States could authorize assisted suicide or whether they could \nfund it on their own or whether we would be intervening by this \nlegislation in the capacity of States to determine what is appropriate \nor inappropriate for their citizens. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  This is not a measure that relates to the commission of suicide. It \nrelates to Federal funding of assisted suicide. This bill--and many \npeople think it unfortunate it would not--does not prevent Kevorkian \nfrom acting. That would be controlled by local jurisdictions and what \nthe law in those jurisdictions is. So that the alleged relevance of \nsome of the proposed amendments simply is not consistent with the \ncontent of the measure.\n  I think it is important for us to understand we ought to act quickly. \nWe are fortunate that the courts have not already authorized Federal \npayments for assisted suicide. But for the injunction of a court in \nOregon, that would have been the case, according to the director of \nMedicaid and the Health Services Commission chair in Oregon. And now \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned that lower court's \ndecision and the matter is still suspended in the limbo of the legal \nproceedings. But as soon as the ninth circuit's opinion would become \nfinal, the Oregon officials have indicated they intend to call for \nFederal resources to participate in the funding of what they call \n``comfort care.'' I would be uncomfortable myself to receive the \n``comfort care'' offered there.\n  But it is, in my judgment, a matter of importance that we act \npromptly, that we act with dispatch. The attempt to bring unrelated \nissues to this measure is counterproductive, particularly inasmuch as \nit is likely to send this legislation to conference and to delay \nsubstantially the ability to move the will of the American people into \nthe law of the American people, and that will is that we not fund with \nFederal resources assisted suicide.\n  Madam President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that Margaret Heldring have \nthe privilege of the floor during the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no \namendments or motions be in order to the pending legislation, and that \nthere be 10 minutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual form, \nto be followed by third reading and final passage of H.R. 1003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. For the information of all Senators, a vote will occur \nwithin the next 10 minutes on passage of the assisted suicide bill. I \nthank my colleagues for their cooperation.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a statement of administration policy on H.R. 1003, \nincluding a letter to Senator Trent Lott by the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, Andrew Fois.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1997.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n      H.R. 1003--Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997\n\n       The President has made it clear that he does not support \n     assisted suicides. The Administration, therefore, does not \n     oppose enactment of H.R. 1003, insofar as it would reaffirm \n     current Federal policy prohibiting the use of Federal funds \n     to pay for assisted suicides and euthanasia.\n       However, the Department of Justice advises (in the attached \n     letter) that section 5 of the bill, which would prohibit the \n     use of any federal funds to support an activity that has a \n     purpose of ``asserting or advocating a legal right to cause, \n     or to assist in . . . the suicide . . . of any individual,'' \n     exceeds the intent of the legislation and raises concerns \n     regarding freedom of speech. Therefore, the Administration \n     urges the Senate to address\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\n     this concern as the legislation moves forward, in order to \n     avoid potential constitutional challenges and implementation \n     problems.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: This presents the views of the Department \n     of Justice on H.R. 1003, the ``Assisted Suicide Funding \n     Restriction Act of 1997.'' As you know, the President has \n     made it clear that he does not support assisted suicides. The \n     Administration therefore does not oppose enactment of H.R. \n     1003. We do, however, have a concern that we would like to \n     bring to your attention.\n       Section 5 of H.R. 1003 provides that ``no funds \n     appropriated by Congress may be used to assist in, to \n     support, or to fund any activity or service which has a \n     purpose of assisting in, or to bring suit or provide any \n     other form of legal assistance for the purpose of . . . \n     asserting or advocating a legal right to cause, or to assist \n     in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing or any \n     individual.'' This restriction, by its plain terms, would \n     apply without limitation to all federal funding. As a result, \n     we believe that the proposed bill would constitute a \n     constitutionally suspect extension of the type of speech \n     restriction upheld in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991).\n       In Rust, the Supreme Court upheld a program-specific \n     funding restriction on the use of federal family planning \n     counseling funds to provide abortion-related advice. It \n     explained that the restriction constituted a permissible \n     means of furthering the government's legitimate interests in \n     ensuring program integrity and facilitating the government's \n     own speech. See id. at 187-194. The Court stressed, however, \n     that its holding was not intended ``to suggest that funding \n     by the Government, even when coupled with the freedom of the \n     fund recipients to speak outside the scope of a Government-\n     funded project, is invariably sufficient to justify \n     Government control over the content of expression.'' Id. at \n     199. For example, the Court emphasized that the First \n     Amendment analysis might differ for restrictions on federally \n     funded services that were ``more all encompassing'' than the \n     limited pre-natal counselling program at issued in Rust. \n     Id. at 200. In addition, the Court explained that the \n     government's authority to place speech restrictions on the \n     use of governmental funds in ``a traditional sphere of \n     free expression,'' such as a forum created with \n     governmental funds or a government-funded university, was \n     far more limited. Id. at 200.\n       The Court affirmed the limited nature of Rust in \n     Rosenberger v. Rectors and Visitors of the University of \n     Virginia, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (1995). There, the Court explained \n     that Rust applies where the government itself acts as the \n     speaker. ``When the government disburses public funds to \n     private entities to convey a governmental message,'' the \n     Court explained, ``it may take legitimate and appropriate \n     steps to ensure that its message it neither garbled nor \n     distorted by the grantee.'' Id. at 2519. The government may \n     not, however, impose viewpoint-based restrictions when it \n     ``does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message \n     it favors, but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity \n     of views from private speakers.'' Id.\n       Here, the bill places a speech restriction on all uses of \n     federal funds. It would move beyond speech restrictions on \n     the use of federal funds in specific, limited programs, such \n     as the one identified in Rust, to establish a viewpoint-based \n     restriction on the use of federal funds generally. As a \n     result, the bill's restriction on speech could apply to an \n     unknown number of programs that are designed to ``encourage a \n     diversity of views from private speaker, ``Rosenberger, 115 \n     S.Ct. at 2519, and to which the Court has held application of \n     a viewpoint-based funding limitation unconstitutional. The \n     bill could also apply to a number of services that are ``more \n     all encompassing'' than the counselling program at issue in \n     Rust, see 500 U.S. at 200, and to which application of a \n     viewpoint-based funding restriction would be subject to \n     substantial constitutional challenge.\n       Moreover, the general approach that the bill employs is \n     itself constitutionally suspect. Unlike the regulation at \n     issue in Rust, H.R. 1003 does not attempt to identify a \n     particular program, or group of programs, in which a funding \n     restriction would serve the government's legitimate interests \n     in ensuring program integrity or facilitating the effective \n     communication of a governmental message. It would instead \n     impose a broad and undifferentiated viewpoint-based \n     restriction on all uses of federal funds. As a result of the \n     unusually broad and indiscriminate nature of the proposed \n     funding restriction, the bill does not appear to be designed \n     to serve the legitimate governmental interests identified in \n     Rust. Thus, the bill is vulnerable to arguments that it \n     reflects on ``ideologically driven attempt [] to suppress a \n     particular point of view [which would be] presumptively \n     unconstitutional in funding, as in other contexts.'' \n     ``Rosenberger, 115 S.Ct. at 2517 (internal quotations \n     omitted). We therefore recommend that this provision be \n     deleted from the bill.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Please do \n     not hesitate to call upon us if we may be of additional \n     assistance in connection with this or any other matter.

Mr. President, during the consideration of the annual \ndefense budget in each of the last several years, the Armed Services \nCommittee has asked each of the military services to provide a list of \nunfunded priorities--that is, programs that were not included in the \ndefense budget request submitted to the Congress. For obvious and very \nunderstandable reasons, the military services have responded to these \nrequests with a great deal of enthusiasm.\n  Again this year, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Thurmond, asked each of the military service chiefs to indicate \nto the committee how they would allocate up to $3.0 billion in \nadditional funds above the fiscal year 1998 budget request. Last month \neach of the four service chiefs provided the committee with a list of \n$3.0 billion for specific programs not funded in the budget request.\n  Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee needs to hear the \npriorities of the military services--but we also have a responsibility \nto view these priorities in a broader context. The so-called unfunded \npriority lists submitted to the committee reflect only individual \nservice priorities. They do not necessarily reflect the joint service \npriorities of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs or the warfighting \ncommanders in chief.\n  General Shalikashvili made this point earlier this year to the \ncommittee when he said during our February 12 hearing in reference to \nthese unfunded priority lists:\n\n       I would put in as strong a plea as I can that you then ask \n     what the overall prioritization is within the joint context, \n     because we are talking of a joint fight. And so to understand \n     why one system should be put forward versus another, you \n     really ought to see what the joint priority on it is, and how \n     that particular system, in the eyes of the joint warfighter, \n     then contributes to the overall fight. Obviously then you \n     will make a judgment. But I would ask that you do not look at \n     service lists without putting it in the context of a joint \n     view on the importance of that item or the other.\n\n  Mr. President, one of the driving forces behind the Armed Services \nCommittee's work on the landmark Goldwater-Nichols Department of \nDefense Reorganization Act 10 years ago--which our former colleague and \nnow Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen played a key role in--was the need \nto enhance the joint perspective within the Defense Department. I agree \nvery strongly with General Shalikashvili's view that the Armed Services \nCommittee--and the Senate--should have the benefit of the joint \nperspective before we take any action on any of the items on the \nmilitary services' unfunded priority lists. We have a responsibility to \nensure that the programs we fund make the greatest possible \ncontribution to the joint warfighting capability of our Armed Forces.\n\n  For this reason, when the committee received the four unfunded \npriority lists from the military service chiefs last month totaling \n$12.0 billion, I sent all four lists over to Secretary Cohen and \nGeneral Shalikashvili and asked two questions.\n  First, I asked which of the specific programs on the military \nservices unfunded priority lists, if any, were programs for which funds \nare not included in the Defense Department's current Future Years \nDefense Program.\n  Second, I asked for Secretary Cohen's and General Shalikashvili's \nviews on the individual programs on the services' lists from a joint \nwarfighting perspective, and whether there were any programs not \nincluded in these lists that in their view had a higher priority from \nthe joint perspective.\n  Mr. President, I recently received letters from both Secretary Cohen \nand General Shalikashvili in response to my letter. I ask unanimous \nconsent that my letter and their responses be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Secretary Cohen indicates in his letter that while the \nmilitary services' unfunded priority lists ``provide useful ways that \nthe Defense Department could apply additional funds, the President's \nbudget already provided for the Department's essential priorities.'' \nWith the exception of four specific items, Secretary Cohen also noted \nthat the items on the services' lists are included in the fiscal year \n1998-fiscal year 2003 Future Years Defense Program.\n  General Shalikashvili's response to my letter outlines his views on \nthe most important programs on the services' lists from a joint \nwarfighting perspective. General Shalikashvili's joint list totals \nabout $4.0 billion, or about one-third of the total $12 billion on the \nfour lists that the service chiefs submitted. His list includes three \ncommand, control, communications and intelligence programs that were \nnot on the services' original list. Unfortunately, General \nShalikashvili does not indicate relative priorities within the programs \non his joint list, but I intend to pursue this question further.\n  Mr. President, I think Secretary Cohen's and General Shalikashvili's \npersonal involvement in this issue of unfunded priority lists \nrepresents an important step forward in what some people have called \nthe wish list process in the last several years--a process that in my \nview had gotten a little out of hand. It is still too early to tell how \nrelevant these various lists will be this year. The outcome of the \nbudget discussions between Congress and the administration is unclear. \nI don't believe we should or need to increase the fiscal year 1998 \ndefense budget this year. If Congress does decide to make adjustments \nto the fiscal year 1998 budget, I think we are much better off with a \n$4.0 billion joint list than with four $3.0 billion lists that have not \nhad the benefit of a joint review.\n  I want to thank Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili for their \ncooperation in this effort.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1997.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense.\n\n     Gen. John M. Shalikashvili,\n     USA, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Department of Defense, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili: At the \n     request of the Committee, each of the Chiefs of the military \n     services has provided the Committee with a list of their \n     program priorities in the event that Congress decides to \n     provide additional funding to the Defense Department for \n     fiscal year 1998 above the President's budget request. I have \n     enclosed a copy of each of these four lists.\n       I would appreciate your response to two issues concerning \n     these lists which were raised during your testimony before \n     the Committee on February 12, 1997.\n       First, please indicate which programs, if any, on these \n     lists are programs for which funds are not included in the \n     Department's current Future Years Defense Program.\n       Second, during the Committee's February 12 hearing, you \n     requested that we look at the prioritization of these \n     programs within the joint context. Accordingly, please \n     indicate your views on the priority of the individual \n     programs on these lists from the joint warfighting \n     perspective. You should also indicate whether there are any \n     programs not included on these lists that have a higher \n     priority from the joint perspective.\n       I would appreciate your response to these questions by \n     April 1, 1997. Thank you for your assistance in this \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Carl: I welcomed your letter of March 18, 1997, to \n     General Shali and me because it gives me the opportunity to \n     provide my perspective on the Service unfunded priority \n     lists. While the lists provide useful\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n     ways the Department could apply additional funds, the \n     President's budget already provided for the Department's \n     essential priorities. Moreover, the vast majority of the \n     items on the lists of unfunded Service priorities are \n     included in the FY 1998-FY 2003 Future Years Defense Program \n     (FYDP). I believe that it is hard to call something a \n     priority if it does not appear in the Department's budget \n     plans anywhere in the next 5 years. Therefore, the Services \n     used inclusion in the FYDP as a key selection criterion in \n     building the lists of unfunded FY 1998 priorities. This also \n     allows the Department to reduce future expenditures to the \n     extent budgeted program completions are accelerated by \n     additions to the FY 1998 budget.\n       There has been instances where changes after preparation of \n     the FYDP justify including a few items on the unfunded \n     priorities lists that are not in the FYDP. The enclosed table \n     identifies those items and provides a brief explanation of \n     why the items are included in the lists even though they are \n     not in the FYDP.\n       I believe the enclosed table responds to your first \n     question. Your second question asked for our views on the \n     priority of the individual programs on the lists from a joint \n     warfighting perspective. I believe that General Shali is best \n     suited to answer your second question, and he will respond \n     separately.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to confirm that the \n     vast majority of the items on the Service unfunded priorities \n     lists are in the FYDP.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                                       PRIORITY LIST ITEMS NOT IN THE FYDP                                      \n                                              [Dollars in millions]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Service                          Item                           Amount                 Explanation       \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy................

Mr. President, today I introduce five pieces of \nlegislation affecting Federal lands in my home State of Colorado.\n  The purpose of these bills is to facilitate the process of \nconsolidating our Federal lands into contiguous blocks which makes \ntheir management more efficient and less costly.\n  Much of the land over which the Bureau of Land Management and the \nU.S. Forest Service has management authority contains numerous \ninholdings which may have been old mining claims or other privately \nowned parcels. This patchwork ownership often creates management \nproblems. For example, a particular parcel may block the public's \naccess to other Federal lands. The presence of an inholding may limit \nthe tools which can be used by the Federal agency to manage the land. \nIf a controlled fire is needed to clear underbrush or stop the spread \nof insects, the presence of private land in the midst of the area may \nwell preclude the use of fire as a management tool. All these \nconsiderations require much more time, and adds to the expense of \ncaring for Federal lands.\n  Whenever an owner of these private parcels willingly offers to sell \nor exchange their lands, it is important that the Federal Government is \nable to accomplish these transactions to increase\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\nmanagement efficiency and public use. The designated Federal agencies \nhave reviewed these bills and the legislation reflects their input.\n  The first bill, the Larson and Friends Creek exchange, directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to exchange lands of equal value for several \nsmall parcels within the Handies Peak Wilderness Study Area and Red \nCloud Peak Wilderness Study Area in Hinsdale County, CO. This exchange \nwill allow the study areas to better fit the definition of a wilderness \narea.\n  The second bill, the Slate Creek addition to Eagles Nest Wilderness, \nprovides for the expansion of the wilderness area in Summit County, CO. \nThe current owners of this parcel are willing to convey it to the \nUnited States only if it is added to the existing wilderness area and \npermanently managed as wilderness. This addition will increase public \naccess to the wilderness.\n\n  The third bill, Raggeds Wilderness boundary adjustment, is necessary \nto correct the effects of earlier erroneous land surveys. Certain \nlandowners in Gunnison County, CO, who own property adjacent to the \nRaggeds Wilderness have occupied or improved their property in good \nfaith based upon a survey they reasonably believed to be accurate. This \nbill is necessary to accomplish an adjustment of the boundary between \nthe private landowners and the wilderness area. The entire area \ninvolved in this adjustment is less than 1 acre.\n  The fourth bill, Miles land exchange, authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture to convey lands of equal value in exchange for the Miles \nparcel located adjacent to the Routt National Forest in Routt County, \nCO. The purpose of this exchange is to improve on-the-ground management \nof public lands which are now isolated and difficult to manage. It will \neliminate the need for long standing special use permits and add \nriparian acres to the national forest.\n  The final bill, the Dillon Ranger District transfer, allows for a \nboundary adjustment to transfer the Dillon Ranger District from the \nArapaho National Forest to the White River National Forest. The Dillon \nDistrict is already under the jurisdictional management of the White \nRiver National Forest. However, this technical correction is necessary \nbecause any official publications of the U.S. Forest Service references \nthe district as a part of the Arapaho National Forest and confuses the \npublic.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these bills be printed in the Record \nwith letters of support from various county governments in which these \nlands are located.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: We are writing in support of \n     modifying the Eagles Nest Wilderness Area boundary to include \n     a 160-acre property along the Slate Creek drainage owned by \n     Scotty and Jeanette Moser. The Board of County Commissioners \n     understands the Mosers want to transfer their property to the \n     National Forest and wish to see the property become part of \n     the wilderness area.\n       When the boundary for the Eagles Nest Wilderness Area was \n     created in the 1970's, the Moser's property was not included \n     since it was private property and could be effectively \n     ``cherry-stemmed'' out of the wilderness area. This boundary, \n     based on land ownership, has no on-the-ground basis. In fact, \n     from a land management perspective, the Moser property should \n     logically be part of the wilderness area.\n       The Mosers have gone to great lengths over the years to \n     preserve the wilderness character of their property. The \n     property contains outstanding riparian habitat, possesses \n     spectacular views, and has no development on it.\n       There is strong community support in Summit County to \n     include the Moser property in the Eagles Nest Wilderness \n     Area. We are not aware of any opposition to include the Moser \n     property in the Wilderness.\n       We respectively request your assistance to modify the \n     Eagles Nest Wilderness Area boundary during this session of \n     Congress to include the Moser's property.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Gary M. Lindstrom, Chairman,\n     Board of County Commissioners.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              Hinsdale County,\n\n                                     Lake City, CO, June 20, 1996.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On behalf of the Board of County \n     Commissioners and the citizens of Hinsdale County I am \n     writing to express Hinsdale County's support for the proposed \n     land exchange between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and \n     Lake City Ranches, Ltd. Under the agreement, Lake City \n     Ranches, Ltd will receive approximately 560 acres of land \n     adjoining the existing ranch, while the BLM will acquire long \n     sought after inholdings in or near the Handies Peak or Red \n     Cloud Wilderness Study Areas or the Alpine Loop By-way.\n       Hinsdale County is ninety six percent federally owned and \n     has always been concerned about land trades that erode the \n     amount of private property within the county. Loss of \n     property has unwanted impacts on the local economy and the \n     local government. Also, Hinsdale County firmly believes that \n     any federal actions that may impact our county, like land \n     trades or other policy decisions, must have local public \n     input and cooperation.\n       It is our understanding the proposed land trade will assist \n     the BLM in consolidating their holdings within wilderness \n     areas and preserve a beautiful and fragile environment. The \n     acquisition by Lake City Ranches, Ltd, though marginal in \n     terms of economic impact to the area, should not reduce the \n     amount of private land within Hinsdale County. Also, the \n     local BLM office has assured us that no decision regarding \n     the trade shall be made without full disclosure and local \n     input into the decision making process. Both of the above are \n     consistent with Hinsdale County's long-standing political \n     policy and objectives.\n       Again let me state that Hinsdale County supports the \n     proposed land trade between the BLM and Lake City Ranches, \n     Ltd, as long as the county's policies regarding land trades \n     and input to the decision making process are respected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               James Lewis, Chair,\n     Hinsdale County Commissioners.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        Open Space and Trails,\n\n                                   Pitkin County, August 29, 1996.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: The Open Space and Trails Board of \n     Trustees of Pitkin County respectfully requests that moneys \n     be included in the Interior Appropriations legislation for FY \n     1997 to enable the U.S. Forest Service to purchase the 158 \n     acre Warren Lakes property southeast of Aspen, Colorado. It \n     is our understanding that the House version of the bill \n     contained funds for the purchase since it is one of the top \n     nationwide priorities for acquisition identified by the \n     Forest Service, but that the Senate bill, for reasons unknown \n     to us, did not. We urge that funding be assured in the House-\n     Senate conference.\n       Public acquisition of Warren Lakes by the Forest Service \n     has been a long-term priority for Pitkin County and the Open \n     Space and Trails Board of Trustees because of the property's \n     extremely high wetland, wilderness, wildlife and recreational \n     values. In addition, the property is the only private \n     inholding in an otherwise solid block of Forest Service land, \n     making the Forest Service the logical owner for this \n     property. As you are likely aware, Pitkin County has for many \n     decades vigorously pursued the protection of open space \n     throughout the County in cooperation with the Forest Service, \n     and the acquisition of the Warren Lakes parcel by the Forest \n     Service is a key element in both entities' plans to protect \n     important areas of open space.\n       Because of its proximity to the Town of Aspen (5 miles via \n     dirt road) and to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness, public \n     ownership of Warren Lakes will provide important new access \n     to the wilderness and public lands while ensuring perpetual \n     public access along the road through the property, and open \n     up new opportunities for public recreation close to Town. \n     This, in an of itself, is a very important reason for the \n     Forest Service to pursue this acquisition. In addition, \n     Warren Lakes has three large manmade ponds which will provide \n     new fishing opportunities and pristine breeding areas for \n     fish species. The wetlands and peat bogs themselves possess \n     very significant ecological values: they support a unique \n     ecology of many rare plants and provide habitat for numerous \n     animals and birds; they act as natural filtration systems and \n     clean water supplies and replenish ground water; they trap \n     and store water preventing downstream erosion; and, they help \n     abate downstream flooding by acting as natural sponges, \n     absorbing heavy rainfall and snowmelt and then slowly \n     releasing the water downstream. Mountain peat accumulates in \n     these wetlands at only 3 to 11 inches per thousand years and \n     scientists estimate that only 1% of the land in Colorado \n     supports biological communities found in Colorado's \n     peatlands. These combined values are\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\n     exceedingly rare to find in just one piece of land, and \n     explain why both our constituents and the Forest Service are \n     so anxious to see the land conveyed into public ownership.\n       The Open Space and Trails Board urges you to do whatever \n     you can to insure that funding for this Forest Service \n     purchase is included in this year's appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William E.L. Fales,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Biden and Mr. \n        Robb):\n  S. 592. A bill to grant the power to the President to reduce budget \nauthority; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                       LINE-ITEM VETO LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have just submitted legislation at the \ndesk to create a separate enrollment version of the line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, this is the same bill word for word that passed the \nU.S. Senate on March 25, 1995, by a bipartisan vote of 69 Senators. It \nwas introduced at the time by Senator Dole.\n  It follows a long history of efforts on behalf of the separate \nenrollment approach and is different to the enhanced rescission which \nhas been found unconstitutional by the district court.\n  Back in 1985, I worked alongside Senator Mattingly, and we got 58 \nvotes for the separate enrollment version.\n  We passed similar legislation in the Senate in 1995, but lost out in \nconference when the conferees endorsed the House approved enhanced \nrescission approach rather than the separate enrollment version.\n  But the courts have now struck down that law. They have ruled that \nonce a bill is signed into law, under the Constitution, the President \ndoes not have the authority to repeal laws. Such a repeal is a \nlegislative power which article I of our Constitution reserves for the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, the line-item veto has a proven track record in \nbringing about financial responsibility at the State and local level. \nAs a Governor, the distinguished Presiding Officer knows that you \ncannot print money like we do up here in Washington. And if you do all \nof this borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending, before long \nyou lose your credit rating.\n  The line-item veto is used at the present time in some 43 States. The \nseparate enrollment mechanism that this legislation is based upon has \nbeen shown to meet constitutional muster by Prof. Laurence Tribe of \nHarvard in a letter to former Senator Bill Bradley back in January \n1993. I spoke with Professor Tribe yesterday morning on the telephone \nat which time he reaffirmed that legal opinion.\n  Mr. President, this effort is not meant to fix the blame, but to fix \nthe problem. We are not enhancing or diminishing Presidential powers. \nWe are simply changing congressional procedures. We are using the \ncongressional power under article I, section 5 of the Constitution \nwhich vests Congress with broad authority to set the rules for its own \nprocedure. And that authority is exercised through changes in the rules \nwhich would require separate enrollment. That was found to be the one \nway that a statutory line-item veto could pass constitutional scrutiny.\n  We are very, very hopeful that this bill can assist us in fixing \nresponsibility on the one hand and reducing deficits on the other hand. \nWe all know that we are not here, as lawyer Sullivan said, as ``potted \nplants.'' But we are sometimes embarrassed when we see things like \nappropriations for Lawrence Welk's home.\n  In 1992, the Government Accounting Office, [GAO] did a study and \nfound that over a 5-year period the line-item veto would save some $70 \nbillion.\n  So we are very hopeful that we can get expedited procedure. It has \nbeen debated for the past 15 years. It has been used by all the \nGovernors now in some 43 States. And there is no rhyme nor reason for \nus to play around and wait for the delay in the courts.\n  We are in a very serious circumstance. Our debt has so risen that the \ninterest costs to the Government now are $1 billion a day--$1 billion a \nday--increased spending for interest costs on the national debt.\n  It is the largest spending item in the budget. And so I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida for yielding, but I wanted to make \nsure we introduced this legislation this morning before we got on to \nthe unanimous consent with the particular measure at hand.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 593. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nflat tax only on individual taxable earned income and business taxable \nincome, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          FLAT TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Flat Tax Act of 1997. This is legislation modeled after \nthe legislation which I introduced in the 104th Congress, in March \n1995, which was the first Senate introduction of flat tax legislation.\n  This bill is modeled after proposals by two distinguished professors \nof law from Stanford University, Professor Hall and Professor Rabushka. \nThis bill would eliminate all deductions, like the Hall-Rabushka plan, \nwith the modification in my legislation to allow deductions for \ninterest on home interest mortgages up to borrowings of $100,000 and \ncontributions to charity up to $2,500.\n  The Hall-Rabushka plan would provide for a flat tax rate of 19 \npercent to be revenue neutral. My proposal raises that rate by 1 \npercent to 20 percent to allow for the deductions for home interest \nmortgages, which would cost $35 billion a year, and the charitable \ndeduction, which would cost $13 billion a year.\n  Mr. President, the advantages of the flat tax are very, very \nsubstantial.\n  First, in the interest of simplicity, a tax return could be filled \nout on a simple postcard. And this is a tax return which I hold in my \nhand which could take 15 minutes to fill out. It requires simply that \nthe taxpayer list the gross revenue, list his taxable income, carry \nforward the deductions for his family, any deductions on interest, any \ndeduction on a home mortgage, the balance of the taxable items, \nmultiplied by 20 percent.\n  Taxpayers in the United States today, Mr. President, spend some \n5,400,000 hours at a cost of some $600 billion a year. The flat tax \ntaxes income only once and thereby eliminates the tax on capital gains. \nIt eliminates the tax on estates, eliminates the tax on dividends, all \nof which have already been taxed once.\n  The flat tax is frequently challenged as being regressive, but the \nfact of the matter is that a taxpayer of a family of four would pay no \ntaxes on the first $27,500 in income; and as it graduates up the scale, \na taxpayer earning $35,000 would pay $1,219 less in tax than is paid \nunder the current plan.\n  It is frequently thought that the flat tax would be regressive and \nplace a higher tax burden on lower income families, but that simply is \nnot true. And the reason that we can have a win-win situation is \nbecause the flat tax provides for savings on compliance in the range of \nsome $600 billion a year.\n  This is a very progrowth proposition. And the economists have \nprojected that over a 7-year period the gross national product could be \nincreased by some $2 trillion. That is over $7,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America.\n  The great advantages of simplicity would especially be appreciated, \nMr. President, on this particular day, April 16, because yesterday was \nthe final day for filing the tax returns without any extension. And I \nhave chosen the first day of the new tax period for symbolic reasons--\nApril 16--as a day to reintroduce the flat tax to try to give us some \nmomentum because it is my firm view that if Americans really understood \nthe import of the flat tax, its simplicity, its growth, and its \nsavings, that it would be widely heralded.\n  Mr. President as I stated, in the 104th Congress, I was the first \nSenator to introduce flat tax legislation and the first Member of \nCongress to set forth a deficit-neutral plan for dramatically reforming \nour Nation's Tax Code and replacing it with a flatter, fairer plan \ndesigned to stimulate economic growth. My flat tax legislation was also \nthe first plan to retain limited deductions for home mortgage interest \nand charitable contributions.\n  I testified with House Majority Leader Richard Armey before the \nSenate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, as well as the \nJoint Economic Committee and the House Small Business Committee on the \ntremendous\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nbenefits of flat tax reform. As I traveled around the country and held \nopen-house town meetings across Pennsylvania and other States, the \npublic support for fundamental tax reform was overwhelming. I would \npoint out in those speeches that I never leave home without two key \ndocuments: My copy of the Constitution and my copy of my 10-line-flat-\ntax postcard. I soon realized that I needed more than just one copy of \nmy flat-tax postcard--many people wanted their own postcard so that \nthey could see what life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax \nreturns only take 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are \nno longer burdened with double taxation on their dividends, interest \ncapital gains and estates.\n  Support for the flat tax is growing as more and more Americans \nembrace the simplicity, fairness, and growth potential of flat tax \nreform. An April 17, 1995, edition of Newsweek cited a poll showing \nthat 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax over the current Tax \nCode. Significantly, a majority of the respondents who favor the flat \ntax preferred my plan for a flat tax with limited deductions for home \nmortgage interest and charitable contributions. Well before he entered \nthe Republican Presidential primary, publisher Steve Forbes opined in a \nMarch 27, 1995, Forbes editorial about the tremendous appeal and \npotency of my flat tax plan.\n  Congress was not immune to public demand for reform. Jack Kemp was \nappointed to head up the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax \nReform and the commission soon came out with its report recognizing the \nvalue of a fairer, flatter Tax Code. Mr. Forbes soon introduced a flat \ntax plan of his own, and my fellow candidates in the Republican \nPresidential primary began to embrace similar versions of either a flat \ntax or a consumption-based tax system.\n  Unfortunately, the politics of the Presidential campaign denied the \nflat tax a fair hearing and momentum stalled. On October 27, 1995, I \nintroduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on my colleagues to \nexpedite congressional adoption of a flat tax. The resolution, which \nwas introduced as an amendment to pending legislation, was not adopted.\n  In this new period of opportunity as we commence the 105th session of \nCongress, I am optimistic that public support for flat tax reform will \nenable us to move forward and adopt this critically important and \nnecessary legislation. That is why I am again introducing my Flat Tax \nAct of 1997, with some slight modifications to reflect inflation-\nadjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent allowances.\n  My flat tax legislation will fundamentally revise the present Tax \nCode, with its myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. Instead, \nthis legislation would institute a simple, flat 20 percent tax rate for \nall individuals and businesses. It will allow all taxpayers to file \ntheir April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-line postcard. This proposal \nis not cast in stone, but is intended to move the debate forward by \nfocusing attention on three key principles which are critical to an \neffective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, fairness, and \neconomic growth.\n  Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat \ntax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing \nour Nation's Tax Code and the policies which underlie it. I began this \nstudy of the complexities of the Tax Code 40 years ago as a law student \nat Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my practice in \nmy early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1962, I \npublished a law review article in the Villanova Law Review, ``Pension \nand Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for Closely Held \nCorporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova L. Rev. 335, \nwhich in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt retirement \nbenefits available to some kinds of businesses but not others. It was \napparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities of the Internal \nRevenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to some; and made \nthe already unpleasant obligation of paying taxes a real nightmare for \nmany Americans.\n  Well before I introduced my flat tax bill early in the 104th \nCongress, I had discussions with Congressman Richard Armey, now the \nHouse majority leader, about his flat tax proposal. Since then, and \nboth before and after introducing my original flat tax bill, my staff \nand I have studied the flat tax at some length, and have engaged in a \nhost of discussions with economists and tax experts, including the \nstaff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, to evaluate the economic \nimpact and viability of a flat tax.\n  Based on those discussions, and on the revenue estimates supplied to \nus, I have concluded that a simple flat tax at a rate of 20 percent on \nall business and personal income can be enacted without reducing \nFederal revenues.\n  The flat tax will help reduce the size of government and allow \nordinary citizens to have more influence over how their money is spent \nbecause they will spend it--not the government. With a simple 20 \npercent flat tax rate in effect, the average person can easily see the \nimpact of any additional Federal spending proposal on his or her own \npaycheck. By creating strong incentives for savings and investment, the \nflat tax will have the beneficial result of making available larger \npools of capital for expansion of the private sector of the economy--\nrather than more tax money for big government. This will mean more jobs \nand, just as important, more higher paying jobs.\n  As a matter of Federal tax policy, there has been considerable \ncontroversy over whether tax breaks should be used to stimulate \nparticular kinds of economic activity, or whether tax policy should be \nneutral, leaving people to do what they consider best from a purely \neconomic point of view. Our current Tax Code attempts to use tax policy \nto direct economic activity, but experience under that Code has \ndemonstrated that so-called tax breaks are inevitably used as the basis \nfor tax shelters which have no real relation to solid economic \npurposes, or to the activities which the tax laws were meant to \npromote. Even when the Government responds to particular tax shelters \nwith new and often complex revisions of the regulations, clever tax \nexperts are able to stay one or two steps ahead of the IRS bureaucrats \nby changing the structure of their business transactions and then \nclaiming some legal distinctions between the taxpayer's new approach \nand the revised IRS regulations and precedents.\n\n  Under the massive complexity of the current IRS Code, the battle \nbetween $500-an-hour tax lawyers and IRS bureaucrats to open and close \nloopholes is a battle the Government can never win. Under the flat tax \nbill I offer today, there are no loopholes, and tax avoidance through \nclever manipulations will become a thing of the past.\n  The basic model for this legislation comes from a plan created by \nProfs. Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute at \nStanford University. Their plan envisioned a flat tax with no \ndeductions whatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to \ninclude limited deductions for home mortgage interest on up to $100,000 \nin borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500 in the \nlegislation. While these modifications undercut the pure principle of \nthe flat tax, by continuing the use of tax policy to promote home \nbuying and charitable contributions, I believe that those two \ndeductions are so deeply ingrained in the financial planning of \nAmerican families that they should be retained as a matter of fairness \nand public policy--and also political practicality. With those two \ndeductions maintained, passage of a modified flat tax will be \ndifficult; but without them, probably impossible.\n  In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a \nmodified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that \nthe revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19-\npercent rate, is based on a well documented model founded on reliable \ngovernmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19- to \n20-percent to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and \ncharitable deductions. A preliminary estimate last Congress by the \nCommittee on Joint Taxation places the annual cost of the home interest \ndeduction at $35 billion, and the cost of the charitable deduction at \n$13 billion. While the revenue calculation is complicated because the \nHall-Rabushka proposal encompasses significant revisions to business \ntaxes as well as personal income taxes, there is a sound basis for \nconcluding that the 1-\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\npercent increase in rate would pay for the two deductions. Revenue \nestimates for Tax Code revisions are difficult to obtain and are, at \nbest, judgment calls based on projections from fact situations with \nmyriad assumed variables. It is possible that some modification may be \nneeded at a later date to guarantee revenue neutrality.\n  This legislation offered today is quite similar to the bill \nintroduced in the House by Congressman Armey and in the Senate late in \n1995 by Senator Richard Shelby, which were both in turn modeled after \nthe Hall-Rabushka proposal. The flat tax offers great potential for \nenormous economic growth, in keeping with principles articulated so \nwell by Jack Kemp. This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their \nsource, so that there is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, \ncapital gains, gifts, or estates. Restructured in this way, the Tax \nCode can become a powerful incentive for savings and investment--which \ntranslates into economic growth and expansion, more and better jobs, \nand a rising standard of living for all Americans.\n  In the 104th Congress, we took some important steps toward reducing \nthe size and cost of Government, and this work is ongoing and vitally \nimportant. But the work of downsizing Government is only one side of \nthe coin; what we must do at the same time, and with as much energy and \ncare, is to grow the private sector. As we reform the welfare programs \nand Government bureaucracies of past administrations, we must replace \nthose programs with a prosperity that extends to all segments of \nAmerican society through private investment and job creation--which can \nhave the additional benefit of producing even lower taxes for Americans \nas economic expansion adds to Federal revenues. Just as Americans need \na Tax Code that is fair and simple, they also are entitled to tax laws \ndesigned to foster rather than retard economic growth. The bill I offer \ntoday embodies those principles.\n\n  My plan, like the Armey-Shelby proposal, is based on the Hall-\nRabushka analysis. But my flat tax differs from the Armey-Shelby plan \nin four key respects: First, my bill contains a 20-percent flat tax \nrate. Second, this bill would retain modified deductions for mortgage \ninterest and charitable contributions--which will require a 1-percent \nhigher tax rate than otherwise. Third, my bill would maintain the \nautomatic withholding of taxes from an individual's paycheck. Last, my \nbill is designed to be revenue neutral, and thus will not undermine our \nvital efforts to balance the Nation's budget. The estimate of revenue \nneutrality is based on the Hall-Rabushka analysis together with \npreliminary projections supplied by the Joint Committee on Taxation on \nthe modifications proposed in this bill.\n  The key advantages of this flat tax plan are threefold: First, it \nwill dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove \nmuch of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and \ncorporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their \nenergies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which \nrewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth \nin all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and \nsavings accounts, and as interest rates drop. By contrast, there will \nbe a contraction of the IRS if this proposal is enacted.\n  Under this tax plan, individuals would be taxed at a flat rate of 20 \npercent on all income they earn from wages, pensions, and salaries. \nIndividuals would not be taxed on any capital gains, interest on \nsavings, or dividends--since those items will have already been taxed \nas part of the flat tax on business revenue. The flat tax will also \neliminate all but two of the deductions and exemptions currently \ncontained within the Tax Code. Instead, taxpayers will be entitled to \npersonal allowances for themselves and their children. These personal \nallowances have been adjusted upward to reflect inflation increases for \n1995 and 1996. Thus, the new personal allowances are: $10,000 for a \nsingle taxpayer; $15,000 for a single head of household; $17,500 for a \nmarried couple filing jointly; and $5,000 per child or dependent. These \npersonal allowances would be adjusted annually for inflation commencing \nin 1997.\n  In order to ensure that this flat tax does not unfairly impact low-\nincome families, the personal allowances contained in my proposal are \nmuch higher than the standard deduction and personal exemptions allowed \nunder the current Tax Code. For example, in 1996, the standard \ndeduction is $4,000 for a single taxpayer, $5,900 for a head of \nhousehold, and $6,700 for a married couple filing jointly, while the \npersonal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,550. Thus, \nunder the current Tax Code, a family of four which does not itemize \ndeductions would pay tax on all income over $16,900--personal \nexemptions of $10,400 and a standard deduction of $6,700. By contrast, \nunder my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal \nexemption of $27,500, and would pay tax only on income over that \namount.\n  My legislation retains the provisions for the deductibility of \ncharitable contributions up to a limit of $2,500 and home mortgage \ninterest on up to $100,000 of borrowing. Retention of these key \ndeductions will, I believe, enhance the political salability of this \nlegislation and allow the debate on the flat tax to move forward. If a \ndecision is made to eliminate these deductions, the revenue saved could \nbe used to reduce the overall flat tax rate below 20 percent.\n  With respect to businesses, the flat tax would also be a flat rate of \n20 percent. My legislation would eliminate the intricate scheme of \ncomplicated depreciation schedules, deductions, credits, and other \ncomplexities that go into business taxation in favor of a much-\nsimplified system that taxes all business revenue less only wages, \ndirect expenses, and purchases--a system with much less potential for \nfraud, ``creative accounting,'' and tax avoidance.\n  Businesses would be allowed to expense 100 percent of the cost of \ncapital formation, including purchases of capital equipment, \nstructures, and land, and to do so in the year in which the investments \nare made. The business tax would apply to all money not reinvested in \nthe company in the form of employment or capital formation--thus fully \ntaxing revenue at the business level and making it inappropriate to \nretax the same moneys when passed on to investors as dividends or \ncapital gains.\n  Let me now turn to a more specific discussion of the advantages of \nthe flat tax legislation I am reintroducing today.\n\n\n                               Simplicity\n\n  The first major advantage to this flat tax is simplicity. According \nto the Tax Foundation, Americans spend approximately 5.3 billion hours \neach year filling out tax forms. Much of this time is spent burrowing \nthrough IRS laws and regulations which fill 12,000 pages and which, \naccording to the Tax Foundation, have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 \nto 5.6 million words in 1994. The Internal Revenue Code annotations \nalone fill 21 volumes of mind-numbing detail and minutiae.\n  Whenever the Government gets involved in any aspect of our lives, it \ncan convert the most simple goal or task into a tangled array of \ncomplexity, frustration, and inefficiency. By way of example, most \nAmericans have become familiar with the absurdities of the Government's \nmilitary procurement programs. If these programs have taught us \nanything, it is how a simple purchase order for a hammer or a toilet \nseat can mushroom into thousands of words of regulations and \nrestrictions when the Government gets involved. The Internal Revenue \nService is certainly no exception. Indeed, it has become a \ndistressingly common experience for taxpayers to receive computerized \nprintouts claiming that additional taxes are due, which require \nrepeated exchanges of correspondence or personal visits before it is \ndetermined, as it so often is, that the taxpayer was right in the first \nplace.\n  The plan offered today would eliminate these kinds of frustrations \nfor millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us to scrap the \ngreat majority of the IRS rules, regulations, instructions, and delete \nliterally millions of words from the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of \ntens of millions of hours of nonproductive time spent in compliance \nwith--or avoidance of--the Tax Code, taxpayers would spend only the \nsmall amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-sized form. Both \nbusiness and individual taxpayers would thus find valuable hours freed \nup\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nto engage in productive business activity, or for more time with their \nfamilies, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules, and \nregulations.\n  The flat tax I have proposed can be calculated just by filling out a \nsmall postcard which would require a taxpayer only to answer a few easy \nquestions. The postcard would look like this:\n\n\n              form 1       Individual Wage Tax       1997\n\n       Your first name and initial (if joint return, also give \n     spouse's name and initial).\n       Your social security number.\n       Home address (number and street including apartment number \n     or rural route).\n       Spouse's social security number.\n       City, town, or post office, state, and ZIP code.\n       1. Wages, salary, pension and retirement benefits.\n       2. Personal allowance (enter only one):\n         --$17,500 for married filing jointly;\n         --$10,000 for single;\n         --$15,000 for single head of household.\n       3. Number of dependents, not including spouse, multiplied \n     by $5,000.\n       4. Mortgage interest on debt up to $100,000 for owner-\n     occupied home.\n       5. Cash or equivalent charitable contributions (up to \n     $2,500).\n       6. Total allowances and deductions (lines 2, 3, 4 and 5).\n       7. Taxable compensation (line 1 less line 6, if positive; \n     otherwise zero).\n       8. Tax (20% of line 7).\n       9. Tax withheld by employer.\n       10. Tax or refund due (difference between lines 8 and 9).\n\n  Filing a tax return would become a manageable chore, not a seemingly \nendless nightmare, for most taxpayers.\n\n\n                        Cutting Back Government\n\n  Along with the advantage of simplicity, enactment of this flat tax \nbill will help to remove the burden of costly and unnecessary \nGovernment regulation, bureaucracy and redtape from our everyday lives. \nThe heavy hand of Government bureaucracy is particularly onerous in the \ncase of the Internal Revenue Service, which has been able to extend its \ninfluence into so many aspects of our lives.\n  In 1995, the IRS employed 117,000 people, spread out over countless \noffices across the United States. Its budget was in excess of $7 \nbillion, with over $4 billion spent merely on enforcement. By \nsimplifying the tax code and eliminating most of the IRS' vast array of \nrules and regulations, the flat tax would enable us to cut a \nsignificant portion of the IRS budget, including the bulk of the \nfunding now needed for enforcement and administration.\n  In addition, a flat tax would allow taxpayers to redirect their time, \nenergies and money away from the yearly morass of tax compliance. \nAccording to the Tax Foundation, in 1996, businesses will spend over \n$150 billion complying with the Federal tax laws, and individuals will \nspend an additional $74 billion, for a total of nearly $225 billion. \nFortune magazine estimates a much higher cost of compliance--nearly \n$600 billion per year. According to a Tax Foundation study, adoption of \nflat tax reform would cut pre-filing compliance costs by over 90 \npercent.\n  Monies spent by businesses and investors in creating tax shelters and \nfinding loopholes could be instead directed to productive and job-\ncreating economic activity. With the adoption of a flat tax, the \nopportunities for fraud and cheating would also be vastly reduced, \nallowing the government to collect, according to some estimates, over \n$120 billion annually.\n\n\n                            Economic Growth\n\n  The third major advantage to a flat tax is that it will be a \ntremendous spur to economic growth. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson \nestimates adoption of a flat tax like the one offered today would \nincrease future national wealth by over $2 trillion, in present value \nterms, over a 7-year period. This translates into over $7,500 in \nincreased wealth for every man, woman and child in America. This growth \nalso means that there will be more jobs--it is estimated that the $2 \ntrillion increase in wealth would lead to the creation of 6 million new \njobs.\n\n  The economic principles are fairly straightforward. Our current tax \nsystem is inefficient; it is biased toward too little savings and too \nmuch consumption. The flat tax creates substantial incentives for \nsavings and investment by eliminating taxation on interest, dividends \nand capital gains--and tax policies which promote capital formation and \ninvestment are the best vehicle for creation of new and high paying \njobs, and for a greater prosperity for all Americans.\n  It is well recognized that to promote future economic growth, we need \nnot only to eliminate the Federal Government's reliance on deficits and \nborrowed money, but to restore and expand the base of private savings \nand investment that has been the real engine driving American \nprosperity throughout our history. These concepts are interrelated, for \nthe Federal budget deficit soaks up much of what we have saved, leaving \nless for businesses to borrow for investments.\n  It is the sum total of savings by all aspects of the U.S. economy \nthat represents the pool of all capital available for investment--in \ntraining, education, research, machinery, physical plant, et cetera--\nand that constitutes the real seed of future prosperity. The statistics \nhere are daunting. In the 1960's, the net U.S. national savings rate \nwas 8.2 percent, but it has fallen to a dismal 1.5 percent. In recent \ninternational comparisons, the United States has the lowest savings \nrate of any of the G-7 countries. We save at only one-tenth the rate of \nthe Japanese, and only one-fifth the rate of the Germans. This is \nunacceptable and we must do something to reverse the trend.\n  An analysis of the components of U.S. savings patterns shows that \nalthough the Federal budget deficit is the largest cause of dissavings, \nboth personal and business savings rates have declined significantly \nover the past three decades. Thus, to recreate the pool of capital \nstock that is critical to future U.S. growth and prosperity, we have to \ndo more than just get rid of the deficit. We have to very materially \nraise our levels of private savings and investment. And we have to do \nso in a way that will not cause additional deficits.\n  The less money people save, the less money is available for business \ninvestment and growth. The current tax system discourages savings and \ninvestment, because it taxes the interest we earn from our savings \naccounts, the dividends we make from investing in the stock market, and \nthe capital gains we make from successful investments in our homes and \nthe financial markets. Indeed, under the current law these rewards for \nsaving and investment are not only taxed, they are overtaxed--since \ngains due solely to inflation, which represent no real increase in \nvalue, are taxed as if they were profits to the taxpayer.\n  With the limited exceptions of retirement plans and tax-free \nmunicipal bonds, our current tax code does virtually nothing to \nencourage personal savings and investment, or to reward it over \nconsumption. This bill will change this system, and address this \nproblem. The proposed legislation reverses the current skewed \nincentives by promoting savings and investment by individuals and by \nbusinesses. Individuals would be able to invest and save their money \ntax free and reap the benefits of the accumulated value of those \ninvestments without paying a capital gains tax upon the sale of these \ninvestments. Businesses would also invest more as the flat tax allowed \nthem to expense fully all sums invested in new equipment and technology \nin the year the expense was incurred, rather than dragging out the tax \nbenefits for these investments through complicated depreciation \nschedules. With greater investment and a larger pool of \nsavings available, interest rates and the costs of investment would \nalso drop, spurring even greater economic growth.\n\n  Critics of the flat tax have argued that we cannot afford the revenue \nlosses associated with the tremendous savings and investment incentives \nthe bill affords to businesses and individuals. Those critics are \nwrong. Not only is this bill carefully crafted to be revenue neutral, \nbut historically we have seen that when taxes are cut, revenues \nactually increase, as more taxpayers work harder for a larger share of \ntheir take-home pay, and investors are more willing to take risks in \npursuit of rewards that will not get eaten up in taxes.\n  As one example, under President Kennedy when individual tax rates \nwere lowered, investment incentives including the investment tax credit \nwere created and then expanded and depreciation rates were accelerated. \nYet, between 1962 and 1967, gross annual Federal tax receipts grew from \n$99.7 billion to $148 billion--an increase of nearly 50 percent. More \nrecently after President Reagan's tax cuts in the\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\nearly 1980's, Government tax revenues rose from just under $600 billion \nin 1981 to nearly $1 trillion in 1989. In fact, the Reagan tax cut \nprogram helped to bring about one of the longest peacetime expansions \nof the U.S. economy in history. There is every reason to believe that \nthe flat tax proposed here can do the same--and by maintaining revenue \nneutrality in this flat tax proposal, as we have, we can avoid any \nincreases in annual deficits and the national debt.\n  In addition to increasing Federal revenues by fostering economic \ngrowth, the flat tax can also add to Federal revenues without \nincreasing taxes by closing tax loopholes. The Congressional Research \nService estimates that for fiscal year 1995, individuals sheltered more \nthan $393 billion in tax revenue in legal loopholes, and corporations \nsheltered an additional $60 billion. There may well be additional money \nhidden in quasi-legal or even illegal tax shelters. Under a flat tax \nsystem, all tax shelters will disappear and all income will be subject \nto taxation.\n  The larger pool of savings created by a flat tax will also help to \nreduce our dependence on foreign investors to finance both our Federal \nbudget deficits and our private sector economic activity. Currently, of \nthe publicly held Federal debt--that is, the portion not held by \nvarious Federal trust funds like Social Security--nearly 20 percent is \nheld by foreigners--the highest level in our history. By contrast, in \n1965 less than 5 percent of publicly held national debt was foreign \nowned. We are paying over $40 billion in annual interest to foreign \ngovernments and individuals, and this by itself accounts for roughly \none-third of our whole international balance of payments deficit. These \nmassive interest payments are one of the principal sources of American \ncapital flowing abroad, a factor which then enables foreign investors \nto buy up American businesses. During the period 1980-91, the gross \nvalue of U.S. assets owned by foreign businesses and individuals rose \n427 percent, from $543 billion to $2.3 trillion.\n  The substantial level of foreign ownership of our national debt \ncreates both political and economic problems. On the political level, \nthere is at least the potential that some foreign nation may assume a \nposition where its level of investment in U.S. debt gives it \ndisproportionate leverage over American policy. Economically, \nincreasing foreign investment in Treasury debt furthers our national \nshift from a creditor to a debtor nation, weakening the dollar and \nundercutting our international trade position. A recent Congressional \nResearch Service report put it succinctly: ``To pay for today's capital \ninflows, tomorrow's economy will have to ship more abroad in exchange \nfor fewer foreign products. These payments will be a consequence in \npart of heavy Federal borrowing since 1982.'' With a flat tax in place, \nAmerica's own supply of capital can be replenished, and we can return \nto our historic position as an international creditor nation rather \nthan a debtor.\n\n  The growth case for a flat tax is compelling. It is even more \ncompelling in the case of a tax revision that is simple and \ndemonstrably fair.\n\n\n                                Fairness\n\n  By substantially increasing the personal allowances for taxpayers and \ntheir dependents, this flat tax proposal ensures that poorer taxpayers \nwill pay no tax and that taxes will not be regressive for lower and \nmiddle income taxpayers. At the same time, by closing the hundreds of \ntax loopholes which are currently used by wealthier taxpayers to \nshelter their income and avoid taxes, this flat tax bill will also \nensure that all Americans pay their fair share.\n  A variety of specific cases illustrate the fairness and simplicity of \nthis flat tax:\n\n\nCase No. 1--Married couple with two children, rents home, yearly income

Con. Res. 21\n\n       Whereas for 3,000 years Jerusalem has been Judaism's \n     holiest city and the focal point of Jewish religious \n     devotion;\n       Whereas Jerusalem is also considered a holy city by members \n     of other religious faiths;\n       Whereas there has been a continuous Jewish presence in \n     Jerusalem for three millennia and a Jewish majority in the \n     city since the 1840s;\n       Whereas the once thriving Jewish majority of the historic \n     Old City of Jerusalem was driven out by force during the 1948 \n     Arab-Israeli War;\n       Whereas from 1948 to 1967 Jerusalem was a divided city and \n     Israeli citizens of all faiths as well as Jewish citizens of \n     all states were denied access to holy sites in the area \n     controlled by Jordan;\n       Whereas in 1967 Jerusalem was reunited by Israel during the \n     conflict known as the Six Day War;\n       Whereas since 1967 Jerusalem has been a united city, and \n     persons of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full \n     access to holy sites within the city;\n       Whereas this year marks the thirtieth year that Jerusalem \n     has been administered as a unified city in which the rights \n     of all faiths have been respected and protected;\n       Whereas in 1990 the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives overwhelmingly adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 106 and House Concurrent Resolution 290 declaring \n     that Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, ``must remain an \n     undivided city'' and calling on Israel and the Palestinians \n     to undertake negotiations to resolve their differences;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel later cited \n     Senate Concurrent Resolution 106 as having ``helped our \n     neighbors reach the negotiating table'' to produce the \n     historic Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government \n     Arrangements, signed in Washington on September 13, 1993; and\n       Whereas the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-\n     45) which became law on November 8, 1995, states as a matter \n     of United States policy that Jerusalem should remain the \n     undivided capital of Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) congratulates the residents of Jerusalem and the people \n     of Israel on the thirtieth anniversary of the reunification \n     of that historic city;\n       (2) strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an \n     undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and \n     religious group are protected as they have been by Israel \n     during the past 30 years;\n       (3) calls upon the President and Secretary of State to \n     publicly affirm as a matter of United States policy that \n     Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of the state of \n     Israel; and\n       (4) urges United States officials to refrain from any \n     actions that contradict United States law on this subject.\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I submit a concurrent resolution \ncongratulating the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on \nthe 30th anniversary of the reunification of their historic capital. I \nam joined in this effort by my distinguished colleague from Florida \n[Mr. Mack] as well as by 68 other Senators.\n  Next week, Jews around the world will conclude their Passover Seders \nwith one of mankind's shortest and oldest prayers: ``Next year in \nJerusalem.'' Throughout the centuries Jews kept this pledge, often \nsacrificing their very lives to travel to, and live in, their holiest \ncity. The Jewish people's attachment to Jerusalem is as ancient as it \nis fervent.\n  That Jerusalem is, and should remain, Israel's undivided capital \nwould seem an unremarkable statement, but for the insidious campaign--\nbegun in the 1970's--to delegitimize Israel by denying her ties to \nJerusalem. For too long, the United States acquiesced in this shameful \nlie by refusing to locate our Embassy in Israel's capital city. As long \nas Israel's most important friend in the world refused to acknowledge \nthat Israel's capital city is its own, we lent credibility and \ndangerous strength to the lie that Israel is somehow a misbegotten, an \nillegitimate, or transient state.\n  On November 8, 1995, the Jerusalem Embassy Act became the law of the \nUnited States. The law states, as a matter of United States Government \npolicy, that Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State \nof Israel, and should remain an undivided city in which the rights of \nevery ethnic and religious group are protected.\n  The concurrent resolution I submit today continues in this spirit, \nand in the spirit of the many previous resolutions I have authored on \nthis subject. In 1990, I introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, \nwhich stated simply: ``Jerusalem is and should remain the capital of \nthe State of Israel.'' In 1993, in a message to the American-Israel \nFriendship League, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote:\n\n       In 1990, Senator Moynihan sponsored Senate Resolution 106, \n     which recognized Jerusalem as Israel's united Capital, never \n     to be divided again, and called upon Israel and the \n     Palestinians to undertake negotiations to resolve their \n     differences. The resolution, which passed both Houses of \n     Congress, expressed the sentiments of the United States \n     toward Israel, and, I believe, helped our neighbors reach the \n     negotiating table.\n\n  The Israeli-Palestinian peace process faces difficult challenges at \nthis time. It is my hope that this clear reiteration of U.S. policy on \nJerusalem will help insure that Jerusalem will remain a city at peace \nand bring closer the day when it will once again become a symbol of \npeace for all humanity.\n Mr. MACK. Madam President, I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution today to congratulate the people of Israel and commemorate \nthe 30-year unity of Jerusalem. Jerusalem must remain an undivided \ncity. As a unified city of Israel for the past 30 years, Jerusalem has \nprotected the rights of every ethnic and religious group. This must \ncontinue.\n  In spite of all that the Congress has done, recent news continues to \nmake reference to Israeli settlements in Jerusalem.

Mr. President, I want to share an important \nday in Texas history--another important day in Texas history--with my \ncolleagues.\n  Fifty years ago today the worst industrial accident in the history of \nAmerica occurred in Texas City, TX. This morning I was in Texas City \nfor a ``rebirth'' celebration the city is hosting. Today, I would like \nto honor those who lost their lives in that terrible tragedy.\n  It was a clear and cool spring morning, one described by author \nElizabeth Lee Wheaton as ``a day when just to be alive felt good.''\n  As firefighters worked feverishly to extinguish the flames, this ship \nloaded down with ammonium nitrate exploded. It was 9:22 a.m. within \nmoments the ferocious blast had killed 26 firefighters, scores of \nschoolchildren, ruined all the city's fire fighting equipment, and \ndemolished the dock area.\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nThe explosion incinerated ships and businesses. The ship's cargo and \ndock equipment became missiles and were hurled into businesses, houses, \nand public buildings.\n  The explosion was so powerful that it registered on a seismograph as \nfar away as Denver. One thousand homes and buildings throughout the \ncity endured partial or total destruction. An eyewitness described the \nscene as follows: ``For 1,200 feet around the location of the ship, \nmetal shards weighing from one pound to five tons crashed down, \ncreating geysers of water in the ship channel and landing on nearby \nbuildings, killing or injuring the employees inside. Nearly all of the \npeople who were on the wharf, including port officials, volunteer \nfirefighters, and many ship's crew, disappeared, many never to be \nfound.''\n  It was not over yet. The S.S. High Flyer was in dock for repairs \nand carried the volatile ammonium nitrate. The first explosion ignited \nthe chemicals on the High Flyer and although emergency workers could \nmove the ship away from the docks, it exploded just hours later. This \nexplosion took the lives of many rescue workers who were pulling bodies \nfrom the wreckage.\n\n  In all, nearly 600 people were lost. We will never know who many of \nthese individuals were, and thousands more were injured, many severely. \nThere were many heroes there as well. Many of them. These were the \n4,000 individuals including those from the Red Cross, other volunteer \norganizations, and citizens who put out the fires, comforted the \ncasualties while operating temporary hospitals, morgues, and shelters. \nHelp came in from all over Texas and from many areas throughout the \ncountry.\n  I was almost 4 years old, riding my tricycle down Larcum Lane in La \nMarque when the S.S. Grandcamp blew in Texas City, just a couple of \nmiles from my home. I still remember my fear as if it happened \nyesterday.\n  Little did I know then that one of the most horrific tragedies in \nAmerican peacetime history had just occurred; all I knew was that the \nground shook, my heart beat double-time, and I had to get home.\n  Approaching my front yard, I found my mom outside screaming my name. \nShe was terrified upon hearing the explosion, feeling the house shake \nand the windows rattle, and not knowing where I was.\n  The happy ending is that we found each other. No one in the Bailey \nfamily of La Marque, TX, was injured in the blast. Such was not so for \nmany others, however. Many of my friends grew up without fathers, \nfathers who had been victims of that blast.\n  A newspaper headline published 1 year after the tragic explosions \nannounced that ``Texas City * * * Rises Phoenix-like From the Abyss of \nDisaster.'' The mass tragedy that killed one in 50 citizens and injured \n1 in 8, tested the unconquerable spirit of the surviving citizens. \nRemember the legend of the Phoenix, which consumed with its own fire, \nraised itself from the ashes after 500 years.\n\n  These resilient people of Texas City would not wait to rise from the \nashes that surrounded them. Through the anguish and heartbreak of such \nloss, they struggled and shared each others sorrow, refusing to let the \ndreams die. Immediately city leaders tried to restore life to normal--\nfollowing the disaster, Sunday church services continued uninterrupted \nand within the following week the civic clubs met as usual.\n  As I look at this great city 50 years later, I see the qualities that \nhave earned it honors as an all American city. The survivors and their \nchildren possess the spirit that has rebuilt one of our Nation's great \nindustrial complexes. The rich history of Texas City includes being a \nhome to the Indians, a prolific 20th century oil boom, and the first \naerial squadron of the United States. I say to my good friend here, \nMayor Frank Doyle, I was so proud to see that Readers Digest just \nincluded you in their list of 1997's top 50 places in America to raise \na family. Keep up the great work.\n  Truly that perfect spring day that became so dark, brought us \ntogether as never before. The beauty and strength of the human spirit \nendured here and I can feel is just as evident today. That spiritual \nstrength in retrospect has changed us all for the better.\n  As that new sculpture of the Phoenix is slowly unveiled today in the \nwarm Texas sun, the spirit of those heroes will again be felt and \nremembered by all of us. Only now, this wonderful symbol will help us \nexpress it more eloquently.\n  I ask that my colleagues help me in remembering this disaster and \npraying that the victims' families, and those who survived the blast, \nhave found peace in the years since.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3296-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 YANTIC FIRE ENGINE COMPANY CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nYantic Fire Engine Company, located in my home State of Connecticut. It \nserves the largest territorial district in Norwich. This year, the \nYantic Fire Engine Company celebrates its 150th anniversary. Perhaps \nthe oldest volunteer fire company in Connecticut, and possibly the \nUnited States, this company has been providing an invaluable service to \nYantic and the city of Norwich for 150 years.\n  The Yantic Fire Company was created on June 17, 1847, when the \nConnecticut General Assembly approved its application for charter. The \nofficial name of the fire company was Yantic Fire Company No. 1. Rich \nin tradition and history, this company is unique for many reasons. It \nstill houses some of its original equipment, including an 1847 Waterman \nhand tub, an 1891 Silsby steamer, and a Silsby hose carriage. These \npieces, well maintained and restored, are national treasures.\n  In July, the Village of Yantic will host a parade in honor of the \nYantic Fire Engine Company's 150 years of service. This sure-to-be \nimpressive celebration will include over 100 fire companies and \nnumerous marching groups.\n  I applaud the efforts of the Yantic Fire Engine Company to \ncommemorate their distinguished history. This fire company has worked \nhard, with pride and distinction to ensure the health and safety of the \nmembers of its community. I join with them in paying tribute to those \nwho have given their lives to protecting others, while serving the \nYantic Fire Engine Company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3297-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE RECIPIENTS OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY POLICE ATHLETIC \n                              LEAGUE AWARD\n\n   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Police Athletic League of \nPhiladelphia (PAL) is celebrating fifty years of serving the youth of \nPhiladelphia. I rise today to congratulate the dedicated men and women \nwho have made this great success possible.\n  For five decades, PAL has offered an attractive alternative to street \nlife by cultivating friendships between police officers and children. \nPAL currently sponsors constructive activities such as sports, \nsubstance abuse education, and tutoring programs for more than 24,000 \nboys and girls of Philadelphia. By providing friends, mentors, and role \nmodels for these young people, PAL has helped improve the quality of \nlife for countless children. PAL teaches children to learn, to aspire, \nand to achieve. The positive impact of this program extends beyond \nthose who are directly involved; this program benefits the entire \nPhiladelphia community.\n  As we salute this program, we must also celebrate the dedication of \nthose who have worked tirelessly to make it effective. I would also \nlike to take this opportunity to commend the seven outstanding \nrecipients of the 50th Anniversary PAL Award. Congratulations to Sally \nBerlin, John K. Binswanger, Steven Head, Lewis Klein, Ronald A. \nKrancer, James F. McCabe, and James E. Schleif. The efforts of these \nindividuals to promote the safety of our children deserve the highest \nhonor. Their service to those in need is truly inspirational.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate these men and women who have worked to \nmake a difference in the lives of so many children, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing them. On behalf of the Senate, I \noffer the recipients of the 50th Anniversary PAL Award best wishes for \ncontinued success.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3297-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL LIBRARY WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week from April 13 to 19 we \nare celebrating the 39th anniversary of National Library Week. As a \nstrong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and \nprotect libraries, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few \nmoments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our Nation.\n  When the free public library came into its own in this country in the \n19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because \nof its commitment to the same principle of free and open exchange of \nideas as the Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an \nintegral part of all that our country embodies: Freedom of information, \nan educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are \nthe only public agencies in which the services rendered are intended \nfor, and available to, every segment of our society.\n  It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable \nrole in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th \ncentury, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and \nwide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further \nsupplemented by travelling libraries serving outlying districts. \nLibraries promote the reading of books among adults, adolescents, and \nchildren and provide the access and resources to allow citizens to \nobtain reliable information on a vast array of topics.\n  Libraries gain even further significance in this age of rapid \ntechnological advancement where they are called upon to provide not \nonly books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. \nIn today's society, libraries provide audio-visual materials, computer \nservices, facilities for community lectures and performances, tapes, \nrecords, videocassettes, and works of art for exhibit and loan to the \npublic. In addition, special facilities libraries provide services for \nolder Americans, people with disabilities, and hospitalized citizens.\n  Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of \nmaterials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is \noften struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have \nnot had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the \ngreatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library \ncommunity and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities \ncontinue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library \nsystem.\n  My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a \nfull range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long \ntradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy \nhas been enhanced by the State Library Network which provides \ninterlibrary loans to the State's public, academic, special libraries, \nand school library media centers. The network receives strong support \nfrom the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, \nthe Regional Library Resource Centers in western, southern, and Eastern \nShore counties, and a statewide data base of holdings of over 140 \nlibraries.\n  The result of this unique joint State-county resource sharing is an \nextraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of \nMaryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service by \nborrowing more public library materials per person than citizens of \nalmost any other State, with 67 percent of the State's population \nregistered as library patrons.\n  I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland \nLibrary Association and others involved in the library community \nthroughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and \ncitizens throughout the Nation in this week's celebration of National \nLibrary Week. I look forward to a continued close association with \nthose who enable libraries to provide the unique and vital services \navailable to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3298-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PALESTINIAN TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to condemn the resurgence \nof terrorism against Israel. We have all watched with concern as a \nseemingly strong peace process has been assaulted with senseless acts \nof violence. Most troubling to me is the role Palestinian leadership \nhas played in facilitating that terrorism. Yasser Arafat's failure to \ncombat consistently terrorist activity in territory administered by the \nPalestinian Authority is the greatest single threat to achieving a \nlasting peace settlement in the Middle East.\n  In the last few years, the Palestinian Authority has allowed \nterrorist attacks to reach atrocious levels of violence before finally \nresponding to suppress these criminals. In 1996, four suicide bombings \nin Israel killed 59 people before Mr. Arafat got serious about \ncombating terrorist networks in Palestinian territory. The Palestinian \nAuthority arrested Islamic extremists, censored mosque sermons, and \nfinally jailed almost all known operatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. \nThe crackdown was successful and resulted in almost a year of silence \nfrom Hamas.\n  Last week's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv broke that silence, however, \nand revived longstanding concerns about Arafat's willingness to use \nterrorism as a tool of leverage in the peace process. Beginning last \nAugust, Arafat gradually released 120 of 200 Islamic activists that \nIsrael identified as security threats. Of those 120 activists, 16 were \nallegedly involved in terrorist acts that killed Israelis. To make \nmatters worse, Arafat permitted five of the known terrorists to enter \nhis security forces in Gaza and appointed a Hamas spokesman, Emad \nFalouji, to his Cabinet. Arafat also hired Adnan Ghol, one of Israel's \nmost wanted Hamas terrorists for building the bomb used in a bus attack \nlast year, to serve in his intelligence service in Gaza.\n  In his visit to the United States in early March, Arafat was warned \nby the United States of the danger of releasing known terrorists. Such \nwarnings went unheeded as Arafat returned to Palestine and promptly \nreleased the most senior remaining terrorist leader, Ibrahim Maqadmeh. \nMaqadmeh could very well have been involved in the March 21 Tel Aviv \nsuicide bombing. Arafat claims his release of terrorist operatives is \nmeant to bring all elements of Palestinian society into the peace \nprocess, but it is clear that such actions merely give a green light to \nterrorist attacks.\n  Mr. President, I am troubled by the deterioration of the Middle East \npeace process and alarmed by the release of known terrorists from \nPalestinian jails. Terrorists are not welcome at the table of peace, \nand I call upon the Clinton administration to address this issue more \nforcefully in future discussions with Palestinian officials. The April \n10 joint raid by Israeli and Palestinian security forces on a Hamas \nterrorist cell in the West Bank is a constructive step to rebuild \nsecurity cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. It \nis my sincerest hope that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority \nwill suppress terrorism at every turn and consistently adopt policies \nthat preserve the security of both Israel and the occupied territories. \nWhen Palestinian terrorism ends, sincere negotiations for a lasting \npeace can truly begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3298-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3298-S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO JANET CUMMINGS AND PETER GOOD\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two Connecticut \ncitizens whose art, talent, and marriage are truly inspirational--Janet \nCummings and Peter Good.\n  On April 16, Janet and Peter will receive the University of \nConnecticut's highest honor--the University Medal. The University Medal \nrecognizes outstanding professional achievement, leadership, and \ndistinguished public service on a community, State, national, or \ninternational level. As a resident of East Haddam, which is just across \nthe Connecticut River from their home in Chester, I have long been \nfamiliar with their impressive contributions to Connecticut's artistic \ncommunity, and I am very pleased that the University of Connecticut has \nchosen to honor their careers.\n  Janet and Peter first met while attending UConn's Fine Arts College \nin the mid-1960's, and for more than 20 years they have worked together \nat their own graphic design studio in the river-valley town of Chester. \nThe philosophy of their design studio,\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nCummings & Good, has been to extend their own nurturing and \ncollaborative relationship to their clients. This philosophy has proven \nto be immensely successful, as they have done work for many respected \ncorporate clients.\n  This commercial success has allowed Cummings & Good to sustain the \ncost of providing quality design, but, perhaps more important, it has \nallowed the studio to do an inordinate amount of work for non profit \norganizations. Cummings & Good has provided designs for the \nInternational Year of the Child, the National Theatre of the Deaf in \nChester, Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, and the Special Olympics, \nwhich were held in New Haven in 1995.\n  On a personal level, Peter's design of the symbol for the University \nof Connecticut's year-long symposium ``Fifty Years After Nuremberg: \nHuman Rights and the Rule of Law,'' holds special significance for me. \nThis symposium began with the opening and dedication of the Thomas J. \nDodd Research Center, which was named for my father who served as a \nprosecutor at the Nuremberg tribunal. The dedication of this center was \none of the proudest moments of my life, and Peter's design truly \ncaptured the spirit and essence of the event.\n  I am also particularly fond of Peter's designs for the U.S. Postal \nService's official 1993 holiday stamps. In fact, I reproduced the image \nof these stamps for the front of my 1993 Christmas card, and I greatly \nappreciate Peter's kind permission to use his designs for this purpose.\n  It's hard to imagine two more deserving recipients of this award than \nJanet and Peter, and I congratulate the University of Connecticut for \nits decision to bestow its highest honor on two members of the artistic \ncommunity. The arts are at the root of our Nation's cultural heritage, \nand if we fail to promote the arts and recognize the achievements of \ncreative individuals like Janet Cummings and Peter Good, we run the \nrisk of becoming a society that is devoid of passion and imagination.\n  Again, I congratulate Janet Cummings and Peter Good on receiving \nUniversity Medals, and I hope that they will enjoy at least 30 more \nyears of collaborating in art and marriage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3298-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LOAN INTEREST FORGIVENESS FOR EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know \nthat I have introduced legislation to make it easier for all Americans \nto bear the cost of a higher education. My legislation, which I offer \nwith my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, would restore the deduction \non the interest paid on student loans, which was eliminated in the 1986 \nTax Reform Act.\n  This bill is a simple, direct proposal. Under this legislation, those \nwho are paying off student loans will be able to claim a deduction for \nthat amount and they would be able to claim this deduction for the time \nit takes to repay the loan.\n  When we think of investing money, we often think of investing in \nthings--machines, natural resources, or businesses. This measure is an \ninvestment in human capabilities and talents. This bill will send the \nmessage to college students across America that their intellectual \ntalents are valued and are worth the investment of tax dollars. \nStudents need to know the Federal Government and the Nation value their \ncontributions of the mind.\n  Then, I believe they will have a greater appreciation of the effort \nnecessary to successfully complete a higher education.\n  And, increasingly, a higher education is the starting point on a \nsuccessful career path. According to the Department of Labor, by the \nyear 2000, more than half of all new jobs created will require an \neducation beyond high school.\n  However, at the same time as a higher education has become \nincreasingly necessary, it has also become increasingly expensive. In \nthe last 10 years, total costs at public college has increased by 23 \npercent and at private colleges by 36 percent.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, this means that over the \nlast 15 years, tuition at a public 4-year college or university has \nnearly doubled as a percentage of median household income. Accordingly \nto the Congressional Research Service, the best data available \nindicates that students graduating from a 4-year program leave that \ninstitution with an average loan debt of about $10,000. This, of \ncourse, represents a significant burden in itself. However, at the \ncurrent capped rate of 8.25 percent for the basic Federal student loan \nprogram, students also bear nearly $1,000 in interest debt. For \nindividuals just starting out, this extra burden adds insult to injury. \nWe, in the Congress, can send the signal that we value higher education \nand recognize the financial responsibility students have by restoring \nthe deduction on the interest on student loans.\n  Furthermore, this proposal is more affordable than what the President \nhas proposed. His tuition deduction which received cost estimates \nranging from $36 to $42 billion. What I and my college from Illinois \nare proposing addresses interest cost, which, of course, is a \npercentage of tuition cost. I believe our proposal provides college \nstudents with the help they really need, while at the same time being \nfiscally manageable. That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to join Senator Moseley-Braun and I in supporting the Loan \nInterest Forgiveness for Education Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3299-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3299-S3300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LARRY DOBY'S JOINING THE AMERICAN LEAGUE\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another season of baseball is \nunderway, and all of us are enjoying the crack of a bat on a hard hit \nball and the thrill of a stolen base. But while this season has brought \nus the familiar sights and sounds, it also recalls a very special \nanniversary. Nineteen ninety-seven marks the 50th anniverary of the \nbreaking of major league baseball's color barrier.\n  In April 1947, Jackie Robinson played his first game with the \nNational League's Brooklyn Dodgers and ended segregation in our \nnational pastime; simultaneously, he entered America's pantheon of \nheroes.\n  Mr. President, while we rightfully honor Mr. Robinson, we cannot \nforget that heroes rarely fight their battles alone. Unfortunately, we \nhave largely ignored those other African-American baseball players who \nbroke that barrier with Robinson.\n  Only 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson first graced a major league \nbaseball diamond, Larry Doby, of Paterson, N.J., took the field with \nthe Cleveland Indians, becoming the first African-American player in \nthe American League. Once on the team, he brought an ability and a \nconsistency to the game which few could match. He was the first \nAfrican-American player to hit a home run in a World Series, and he was \nnamed to six straight American League All-Star teams. During his 13-\nyear career, he attained a .283 lifetime batting average and hit 253 \nhome runs.\n  But Larry Doby was not only an exciting player, he was also a \ncourageous individual. He ignored the vile epithets hurled at him by \nboth fans in the stands and opposing players on the field. After a road \ngame, his teammates would go back to their hotel and make plans for the \nevening. Thanks to specter of Jim Crow, Mr. Doby would have to go, \nalone, to his own dingy hotel room in the black part of town.\n  Because of the manner in which he handled such adversity, many other \nAfrican-American players followed him to the major leagues, and we all \nlearned that, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, we must judge a \nperson on the content of his character and not the color of his skin. \nIn a recent New York Times article, Mr. Doby himself observed, ``If \nJack and I had a legacy, it is to show that teamwork, the ability to \nassociate and communicate, makes all of us stronger.'' And by their \nexample, Mr. President, we definitely are a stronger nation.\n  Mr. President, Larry Doby is rightfully called a legend for his \nconsistency on the field and a hero for his character off the field. \nBut I have the privilege of also calling him a friend. We grew up \ntogether on the working class streets of Paterson, N.J. As working \nclass kids, we shared a simple philosophy--if you do what you love, and \nyou do it well, that's its own reward. And that reminds me of one of my \nfavorite anecdotes about Larry.\n  After his first game in July 1947, the owner of the Cleveland \nIndians, the renowned Bill Veeck, told Larry, ``You\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nare going to make history.'' Doby recalls that he thought to himself, \n``History? I just want to play baseball.''\n  In 1975, Larry became the manager of the Chicago White Sox. Today, at \nthe age of 72, he is still involved with the game, working for major \nleague baseball in its Manhattan offices. But at one time, he was an \nAmerican who just wanted to play baseball. And, given the opportunity, \nhe played with skill and grace--and he made history.\n  When it comes to Larry, others may have filled his uniform, but no \none will ever be able to fill his shoes. Larry Doby proves that good \nand great can exist in the same individual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3299-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ELLEN WARREN JOINS CHICAGO JOURNALISM HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the \nattention of my colleagues a creative and talented journalist from my \nState--Ellen Warren. I am pleased to announce that Ellen will be \ninducted into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame on April 18.\n  Chicago, as many of my colleagues know, has a reputation earned over \nmany years as a place where the news business is taken seriously, by \npractitioners and consumers alike. By elected officials too, I might \nadd.\n  From the perceptive observations of Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley \nthrough the ``Front Page'' days of Ben Hecht to the latter day insights \nof Mike Royko, Chicago journalism has been of the highest quality--\naggressive, competitive, and literary all at the same time.\n  This year, the name of Ellen Warren of the Chicago Tribune will be \namong those added to the honor roll of journalists who have, over the \ncourse of a career, produced the highest quality work in one of the \ntoughest news markets in the country.\n  Ellen began her career in 1969 at the City News Bureau of Chicago, a \nlegendary training ground for reporters. At the Chicago Daily News, she \nwas a foreign correspondent as well as the first woman ever permanently \nassigned to the City Hall beat. At the Chicago Sun-Times, she covered, \nat various times, Congress, the Supreme Court, and the Carter White \nHouse. For Knight-Ridder newspapers, she covered the Bush White House. \nSince 1993, she has been based in Chicago and has carried out numerous \nassignments for the Tribune, including that of columnist and political \nwriter.\n  Ellen Warren has gone about her job with flair, honesty, and \ndedication. I happen to know that she also is a hall of fame-level wife \nand mother. For all of her accomplishments, I wish to add my \ncongratulations to Ellen Warren on this occasion of her induction into \nthe Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3300-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL GOLDBLATT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMichael Goldblatt, who was recently honored as Citizen of the Year by \nthe Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce.\n  A longtime civic leader and lifelong resident of Norwich, CT, Michael \nhas utilized his passion for antique cars and ice skating to help \nbetter the local community.\n  In 1986 he founded the Eastern Connecticut Antique Auto Show. \nCurrently in its 12th year, the show serves as one of the largest and \nmost successful fund-raising events for the chamber of commerce. Today, \nhe is still on the show's executive board and is its chief technical \njudge.\n  What's more, he was the catalyst for efforts to build the Norwich \nMunicipal Ice Rink, which today is home for the New England Sharks \nDouble A youth hockey program.\n  Starting with virtually no financial resources, Michael mobilized \nlocal officials and helped raise millions of dollars to make his dream \nof a year-round, fully enclosed ice rink a reality.\n  Michael Goldblatt also serves as treasurer of the Norwich Community \nDevelopment Corp. and has been a member of the board of directors for \nthe Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, the Norwich Recreation \nAdvisory Board, and the Connecticut Society of CPA's.\n  In all his endeavors, Michael has been a tremendous asset to both the \ncity of Norwich and to the entire State of Connecticut. His \nhumanitarian and altruistic efforts are an example that all Americans \nshould emulate.\n  I commend the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce on their fine \nchoice and I once again congratulate Michael on his selection as \nCitizen of the Year.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about one of the \nprovisions contained in H.R. 914 which is necessary for the 315,000 \npublic school children of New Mexico. The specific provision involves \nthe New Mexico Department of Education's intent to take credit for $30 \nmillion of Federal impact aid funds.\n  New Mexico is one of three States in the country which uses an \nequalization formula to distribute educational moneys among its school \ndistricts. Presently, 40 out of New Mexico's 89 school districts \nqualify for 30 million dollars' worth of impact aid. The New Mexico \nDepartment of Education relies on impact aid in calculating the amount \nof State funds which will be used to equalize educational funding among \nall 89 school districts.\n  Without this legislation, the New Mexico Department of Education \nwould not be permitted to consider $30 million of impact aid in its \nformula for distributing State education moneys among its school \ndistricts. The inability to consider Federal funds would create an \nimbalance in the distribution of educational funds between non-impact \naid school districts and impact aid school districts.\n  This legislation allows the U.S. Department of Education to recognize \nas timely New Mexico's written notice of intent to consider impact aid \npayments in providing State aid to school districts for the 1997-98 \nschool year.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 46\n\n (Purpose: To make amendments relating to a date extension and to make \nchanges in the program under title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary \n                         Education Act of 1965)\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

That bill, \nwhich will be discharged from the Judiciary Committee, is regarding the \nunlawful use or transfer of chemical weapons. It is hoped that we will \nbe able to reach an agreement on that bill which would allow the Senate \nto complete action of S. 495 following a couple of hours of debate. All \nSenators can therefore expect rollcall votes on Thursday, possibly mid \nto late afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/16/senate-section/article/S3301-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
