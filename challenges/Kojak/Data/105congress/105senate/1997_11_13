Mr. President, today, the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 11 a.m. It is hoped that during today's session \nthe Senate will be able to complete its business for the 1st session of \nthe 105th Congress. I just talked to the Democratic leader and we \nagreed to push to accomplish that today. In fact, I read over the \nweekend a quote from General Eisenhower. When he was President he said, \n``There are many problems in Washington, but one of the main reasons is \nwe have too long been away from home.'' So I'm hoping that we will \nhonor his admonition and go home at the close of business today for the \nbalance of the year to be with our constituents.\n\n                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   N O T I C E                                                  \n                                                                                                                \n     Under the Rules for Publication of the Congressional Record, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \n  the first session of the 105th Congress will be published on the 31st day after adjournment in order to permit\n                                   Members to revise and extend their remarks.                                  \n    All materials for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices responsible\n  for the Record in the House or Senate between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday (until the\n 10th day after adjournment).

None of the material printed in the final issue of the Congressional Record may contain subject \n                    matter, or relate to any event, that occurred after the adjournment date.                   \n     Along with signed statements, House Members are requested, whenever possible, to submit revised statements \n   or extensions of remarks and other materials related to House Floor debate on diskette in electronic form in \n  ASCII, WordPerfect or MicroSoft Word format. Disks must be labeled with Members' names and the filename on the\n                       disk.

It is hoped that the Senate can voice vote those bills during \ntoday's session as we await House action on the Commerce, State, \nJustice appropriations conference report, and I expect them to \naccomplish that before late in the afternoon. In fact, I expect it to \nbe in the early afternoon.\n  If a voice vote is not possible, then Members will be notified as to \nwhen we might have a rollcall vote or votes. Again, I think it would be \nin the best interests of the Senate at this time if we could do this \nwith a voice vote. The so-called controversial positions in the \nDistrict of Columbia bill and the foreign operations conference reports \nhave been removed, and I believe an agreement has been reached with the \nadministration on Commerce, State, and Justice with regard to items in \nthat bill, as well as the provisions with regard to census.\n  If there are rollcall votes, I emphasize we will try to notify \nMembers with at least a 4-hour advance notice and the time span that \nthat vote might occur in. If we can't complete today with just voice \nvotes then there is a possibility that we would have to go over until \ntomorrow if there is going to be a rollcall vote because I do think \nMembers are entitled to significant advance notice so they can be sure \nto be here. Or, if we can't get it done in a reasonable way today or \ntomorrow, there is always next week, which would really begin to \nstretch what President Eisenhower had warned us against. In order to \navoid that, we are going to need a very good attitude and a lot of \ncooperation. I think that is possible.\n  We are still working on the few remaining Executive Calendar items. \nThere are only 15 or so nominations left on the calendar. We are hoping \nto clear some of those today, and then those that would require some \ndebate or recorded votes would be scheduled early in the session when \nwe come back next year.\n  Again, we need cooperation of the Senators that are here today, and \nbetween the leadership on both sides of the aisle so we can complete \naction. We accomplished a great deal over the weekend by voice vote and \nin our wrap-up. We passed a lot of really good bills. We still have a \nchance to get a conference report from the House on Amtrak, with only \none major change, as I understand it--one I think the Senate could live \nwith. That is the makeup of the board of Amtrak.\n  I remind our colleagues that we did pass and send to the President a \nfix with regard to the ISTEA transportation bill, that we did pass and \nsend to the President the FDA reform package, as well as the foster \ncare and adoption bill, and earlier had sent the Labor-HHS and \neducation appropriations bill. So we are down, really, to these three \nfinal bills. There could be a fourth bill sent separately that would \ninclude the State Department reorganization, U.N. arrearage, IMF funds, \nas well as some language with regard to the Mexico City population \ncontrol issue. If that bill could not be brought up or was objected to \nor filibustered, of course, we would not be able to get to a final vote \non that. But the three key bills we need to bring up today are the \nthree appropriations conference reports and we will notify Members when \nwe will act on those and if any recorded votes are necessary.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12513-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2977, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2977) to amend the Federal Advisory Committee \n     Act to clarify public disclosure requirements that are \n     applicable to the National Academy of Sciences and the \n     National Academy of Public Administration.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2977, the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997.\n  H.R. 2977 properly excludes the National Academy of Science [NAS] and \nthe National Academy of Public Administration [NAPA] from the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act [FACA], while at the same time ensuring that \ncertain public sunshine and accountability measures apply to NAS and \nNAPA committees. Since the legislation did not have the benefit of a \ncommittee report in either the House of Senate, as ranking member of \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs, the committee of jurisdiction \nover FACA, I would like to make the following clarifications regarding \nthe bill's provisions.\n  Section 15 of the bill establishes procedures with which NAS and NAPA \nmust comply as part of agreements with Federal agencies on work to be \nperformed. I want to be clear that both NAS and NAPA should apply these \nprocedures to standing committees in their future work for Federal \nagencies in addition to future committees that may be created, either \ntemporarily or on a standing basis, to complete a specific project or \nprojects under an agreement with an agency. In particular, it\n\n[[Page S12516]]\n\nshould be noted that any replacement or new member added to a standing \ncommittee should be done so in accordance with the provisions of \nsection 15(b)(1).\n  Even though the requirements of section 15(b) of the bill are \neffective on the date of enactment, NAS has indicated in a letter that \nthey would make reasonable and practicable efforts, to the fullest \nextent, to apply those requirements to committees that began work as \npart of an agency agreement prior to the date of enactment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the NAS letter be made part of the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Section 15(b) provides that public notice be given for a number of \ncommittee activities. Traditionally, under FACA, public notice \nconstitutes notice in the Federal Register. However, FACA was written \nover 20 years ago prior to advent of the information technology \nrevolution. Therefore, I believe that public notice under this bill \ncould include the use of the Internet, including notice and information \ntimely posted on their home pages, by the NAS and NAPA as a means to \nsatisfy the bill's public notice procedures.\n  Regarding the NAS, I understand that they will establish a reading \nroom, free and open to the general public, to make available \ninformation required to be made public under section 15(b). I concur \nwith this approach. Furthermore, the legislation provides that a \nreasonable charge may be imposed by the NAS for distribution of written \nmaterials. I believe that this charge should be as minimal as possible \nand should not exceed the costs of copying, paper, printing, and \nmailing--if needed. My preference would be that future agreements \nbetween the Federal agencies and NAS include sufficient funds for \ncopying and distribution of relevant materials so that there would be \nno charge to the public, particularly if the request for written \nmaterials is a narrow or limited one. I would also encourage both \nacademies to use the Internet here as well.\n  I also want to clarify that the provisions of this bill do not apply \nto NAS or NAPA committees that are self-funded or funded through a non-\nFederal source. However, if Federal funds are added to such a committee \npursuant to an agreement with an agency and the respective academy, \nthen the committee must comply with the provisions of this bill.\n  Finally, Federal agencies should take note that we have vested \ndiscretion to the NAS and NAPA regarding implementation of the \nrequirements of section 15(b). Agencies should not seek to manage or \ncontrol the specific procedures each academy will adopt in order to \ncomply with the requirements of the bill. A certification from the \nacademies at the time the final report is to be submitted shall \nsuffice. Agencies should not interpret section 15(b)(1) as implying \nthat the conflict of interest provisions under the Ethics in Government \nAct are the de facto standard to be employed. That act requires \nextensive financial disclosure and other requirements that are not \nappropriate in this instance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a letter from the National \nAcademy of Sciences be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     National Academy of Sciences,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1997.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Glenn: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Academy of Sciences to explain how the Academy intends to \n     apply the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n     of 1997 to Academy committees that are currently working on \n     contracts or agreements with federal agencies.\n       Under the Act, the Academy is not required to apply the \n     procedures of section 15 to committees that are currently \n     underway. This makes sense, because the appointment \n     provisions of section 15 could not be applied retroactively \n     to committees whose members have already been appointed. \n     There are, however, some provisions of section 15 that \n     depending upon the stage of a committee's work could be \n     reasonably applied to ongoing committees. For example, if a \n     committee has not yet concluded its data gathering process, \n     the requirement that data gathering meetings be open to the \n     public could be followed by the committee.\n       On behalf of the Academy, you have my assurance that the \n     Academy will apply the procedures set forth in section 15 to \n     committees that are currently underway to the fullest extent \n     that is reasonable and practicable.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Alberts,\n                          President, National Academy of Sciences.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table and any statements related to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2977) was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12515-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12516-S12519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH REVITALIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Senator Snowe has an amendment at the desk, and I ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1636.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am offering a manager's amendment with \nSenator Hollings and Senator Chafee to S. 1213, the Oceans Act of 1997. \nThe year 1998 has been declared the International Year of the Ocean by \nthe United Nations, and around the world scientists, governments, \nnongovernmental organizations, and private citizens are preparing \nactivities that recognize the importance of the oceans to all of \nhumanity as well as the planet. Passage of the Oceans Act today would \nserve as a very fitting contribution to the Year of the Ocean, \nsignifying that the United States is at the forefront of ocean policy, \nand that we as a nation are continuing to strive for the conservation \nand sustainable use of our ocean resources.\n  S. 1213, which I cosponsored with Senators Hollings, McCain, Kerry, \nStevens, and others is intended to address current and future problems \nrelated to the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes, and to ensure that we \nhave a national oceans policy capable of meeting these challenges.\n  The bill would create a commission to analyze the full range of ocean \npolicy issues facing the Nation, and the way in which the Federal \nGovernment is currently responding to them through its agencies and \nprograms. After completing its analysis, the commission would provide \nrecommendations to the President and the Congress on the development of \na comprehensive, cost-effective policy to address these issues.\n  It also requires the President to create an interagency council to \nhelp improve coordination and cooperation, and eliminate duplication of \neffort among Federal agencies.\n  This legislation is based on a law enacted in 1966 which created a \nsimilar commission known as the Stratton Commission. That commission \nled to the creation of NOAA in 1970, and it helped to shape our public \npolicies on these issues in the succeeding years. But the times have \nchanged over the past 30 years, and the problems that we face in the \nmarine environment have changed as well.\n  The manager's amendment which I am proposing today embodies virtually \nall of S. 1213 are reported by the Commerce Committee, but it also \naddresses the concerns of some Senators about the establishment of the \ninteragency National Oceans Council. Over the last few days, I have \nworked closely with Senators Chafee, Hollings, and McCain on \nmodifications to help ensure that the Council has an appropriate role \nwithin the administration. It is intended to assist the commission\n\n[[Page S12517]]\n\nwith its work, providing information from the appropriate Federal \nagencies as necessary, and to help the President implement the national \nocean policy that he is charged with developing under the bill. The \nchanges that we have agreed to and that are contained in the manager's \namendment clarify the role of the Council, and establish a sunset \nprovision requiring the Council to disband 1 year after the commission \nissues its report. The amendment also makes clear that the Council \ncannot supersede any other existing administration coordination \nmechanisms, or interfere with ongoing Federal activities under existing \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, this is a very good bipartisan bill that is supported \nby the leaders of both the Commerce and Environment and Public Works \nCommittees. It will give the United States very important guidance on \nhow to prepare for the ocean-related challenges that will face the \nNation in the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment and the bill as amended.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 927, a bill to \nreauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program. First, I offer my \nthanks to Senator Snowe, the primary sponsor of the bill.\n  Sea Grant is a results-oriented program that builds bridges among \nGovernment, academia, and industry, putting information and technology \nfrom research laboratories into the hands of the people who can really \nuse it. The National Sea Grant Program serves as a successful model for \nmultidisciplinary research directed at scientific advancement and \neconomic development. Sea Grant has improved the competitiveness of the \nNation's coastal and marine economy by increasing the pool of skilled \nmanpower, fostering scientific achievement, facilitating technology \ntransfer, and educating the public on critical resource and \nenvironmental issues.\n  Mr. President, the 1966 Stratton Commission outlined a seminal vision \nfor the benefits this Nation could derive from the oceans and coasts. \nThe Sea Grant Program has played a vital part in realizing that vision. \nToday, Sea Grant researchers are examining important problems affecting \nour marine resources. This research is not just being put on a shelf. \nIt is being used to improve aquaculture, market new technologies, \ndevelop pharmaceuticals, educate our young people, manage fisheries, \nand much more. This legislation, S. 927, will carry Sea Grant into its \nnext 30 years by strengthening the Sea Grant Program, improving the \nprocedures by which it operates, clarifying the respective roles of the \nFederal Government and the universities that participate in the \nprogram, and reducing administrative costs. I urge all of my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this important program and the passage of the \nbill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 927, the \nOcean and Coastal Research Revitalization Act of 1997. Last year, \nCongress passed the National Invasive Species Act. S. 927 will enable \ncolleges and universities across the country to address the goals of \nthe National Invasive Species Act and will foster research on our \nmarine and coastal resources. My amendment to include Lake Champlain as \none of the Great lakes will allow Vermont colleges and universities to \njoin the Sea Grant College Program and increase research on the many \nenvironmental threats to Lake Champlain.\n  A recent study shows that the zebra mussels have spread from 4 States \nin 1988 to 20 States this year. The zebra mussel is a prime example of \nwhat can happen when an exotic species is introduced into an \nenvironment where it has no natural predators. The zebra mussel, having \nhitchhiked over from Europe, is invading the far reaches of Lake \nChamplain at an alarming rate.\n  We Vermonters have come to think of it as great for many reasons \nthough: Lake Champlain is vital both environmentally and economically \nto Vermont. Lake Champlain supports a watershed of over 8,200 square \nmiles and an economy of over $9 billion in the region. In addition, the \nimportance of Lake Champlain spreads throughout the Northeast, since \nresidents of New England and the mid-Atlantic States cherish the lake \nand its resources for its recreational, ecological, and scenic values. \nAlthough Vermonters have always considered Lake Champlain the sixth \nGreat Lake, this legislation will now officially recognize Lake \nChamplain as the sixth Great Lake under the Sea Grant Program.\n  This designation will allow colleges and universities in the Lake \nChamplain basin to become a Sea Grant college, enabling them to conduct \nvital research on the many invasive species threatening Lake Champlain, \nincluding zebra mussels, sea lampreys, Eurasian watermilfoil, and water \nchestnut. Inclusion in the National Sea Grant College Program would \nallow Vermont schools to focus greater attention on invasive species, \nbut also would help Vermont and New York implement a number of the \npriorities identified in the Lake Champlain Basin Plan signed by our \nGovernors this winter.\n  As the economic importance of the lake and the population of the \nChamplain Valley has grown, so have the environmental problems of Lake \nChamplain. One of the main environmental issues facing the lake is \ncontrolling pollution that flows into the lake. In particular, \nincreases in the levels of phosphorus have turned parts of Lake \nChamplain green with algae. Runoff from farms and urban streets and \ntreated water from sewage plants have caused this increase.\n  Historically, scientific efforts on Lake Champlain have lagged behind \nother regions with coastal waters of national significance. Although \nthe University of Vermont was one of the original land grant colleges, \nit did not receive Sea Grant college status during the initial \nselections because the Sea Grant Program has been focused on areas with \nmarine research needs. Since that time, several new Sea Grant \ndesignations were made to address critical issues facing the Great \nLakes.\n  Lake Champlain plays an important role in the Great Lakes system, \nconnected by hydrologic, geologic, and biological origins. The issues \nfacing Lake Champlain represent the emerging issues facing the Great \nLakes, such as nutrient enrichment, toxic contamination, habitat \ndestruction, and fisheries issues. Allowing Vermont to participate in \nthe Sea Grant Program would provide an opportunity for the State's \nscientists to compete for badly needed Federal dollars to support lake \nresearch.\n  The University of Vermont and other Vermont colleges are ideally \nsituated to attain Sea Grant college status to work on Lake Champlain \nresearch. These researchers have been participating in lake research \nprojects over the past several years, pulling together limited funding \nfrom numerous sources. Designation as a Sea Grant college will remedy \nthis situation. Vermont will be able to improve the long-term water \nquality and biological monitoring on Lake Champlain. This monitoring is \ncritical to determine the success of management actions outlined in the \nLake Champlain Basin Plan. The Sea Grant Program would enable Vermont \nto track toxic substances in the water, sediment, air and biota and \ninvasive species.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and her staff \nfor their assistance in increasing attention to the environmental \nissues in Lake Champlain.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this legislation reflects an effort to \nreach a compromise within the international ocean shipping industry. It \nreflects a middle ground among the somewhat dissimilar interests of the \nocean carriers and shippers and shipping intermediaries, as well as the \ninterests of U.S. ports and post-related labor interests such as \nlongshoremen and truckers. I have worked with Senators Hutchison, Lott, \nand Gorton to craft a compromise allowing us to move forward with \nlegislation. I had hoped to be able to move forward with floor \nconsideration before we adjourn, but it appears now that we ran out of \ntime on this bill. I look forward to taking this bill up early in the \nnext session of Congress. It has been very difficult to balance the \ncompeting considerations affected by this bill. In fact, I would liken \nit to squeezing Jell-O, you push in one direction and objections would \nooze out in the other direction. However, I feel certain that we are \nclose to achieving a workable agreement that all parties can support.\n  It is safe to say that our ocean shipping industry affects all of us \nin the United States since 96 percent of our international trade is \ncarried by ships,\n\n[[Page S12518]]\n\nbut very few of us fully understand the ocean shipping industry. \nInternational ocean shipping is a half-a-trillion-dollar annual \nindustry that is inextricably linked to our fortunes in international \ntrade. It is a unique industry, in that international maritime trade is \nregulated by more than just the policies of the United States. In fact, \nit is regulated by every nation capable of accepting vessels that are \nnavigated on the seven seas. It is a complex industry to understand \nbecause of the multinational nature of trade, and its regulation is \ndifferent from any of our domestic transportation industries such as \ntrucking, rail, or aviation.\n  The ocean shipping industry provides the most open and pure form of \ntrade in international transportation. For instance, trucks and \nrailroads are only allowed to operate on a domestic basis, and foreign \ntrucks and railroads are required to stop at border locations, with \ncargo for points further inland transported by U.S. firms. \nInternational aviation is subject to restrictions imposed and a result \nof bilateral trade agreements, that is, foreign airlines can only come \ninto the United States if bilateral trade agreements provide access \ninto the United States. However, international maritime trade is not \nrestricted at all, and treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation \nguarantee the right of vessels from anywhere in the world to deliver \ncargo to any point in the United States that is capable of \naccommodating the navigation of foreign vessels.\n  The Federal Maritime Commission [FMC] is charged with regulating the \ninternational ocean shipping liner industry. The ocean shipping liner \nindustry consists of those vessels that provide regularly scheduled \nservices to U.S. ports from points abroad. In large part, the trade \nconsists of containerized cargo that is capable of international \nmovement. The FMC does not regulate the practices of ocean shipping \nvessels that are not on regularly scheduled services, such as vessels \nchartered to carry oil, chemicals, bulk grain, or coal carriers. One \nmight ask why regulate the ocean liner industry, and not the bulk \nshipping industry? The answer is that the ocean liner industry enjoys a \nworldwide exemption from the application of U.S. antitrust laws and \nforeign competition policies. Also, the ocean liner industry is \nrequired to provide a system of common carriage, that is, our law \nrequires carriers to provide service to any importer or exporter on a \nfair, and nondiscriminatory basis.\n  The international ocean shipping liner industry is not a healthy \nindustry. In general, it is riddled with trade-distorting practices, \nchronic overcapacity, and fiercely competitive carriers. In fact, rates \nhave plunged in the transpacific trade to the degree that importers and \nexporters are expressing concerns about the overall health of the \nshipping industry. The primary cause of liner shipping overcapacity is \nthe presence of policies designed to promote national-flag carriers and \nalso to ensure strong shipbuilding capacity in the interest of national \nsecurity. These policies which are not necessarily economically \neffective include subsidies to purchase ships and to operate ships, tax \nadvantages to lower costs, cargo reservation schemes, and national \ncontrol of shipyards and shipping companies. A prime example of \npolicies that promote and subsidize a national-flag carrier is one of \nthe largest shipping companies in the world, the China Overseas \nShipping Company [COSCO]. It is operated by the Government of China, \nmuch in the way the United States Government controls the Navy and is \nnot constrained by considerations that plague private sector companies.\n  Historically, ocean shipping liner companies attempted to combat rate \nwars resulting from overcapacity by establishing shipping conferences \nto coordinate the practices and pricing policies of liner shipping \ncompanies. The first shipping conference was established in 1875, but \nit was not until 1916 that the U.S. Government reviewed the conference \nsystem. The Alexander Committee--named after the then-chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries--recommended \ncontinuing the conference system in order to avoid ruinous rate wars \nand trade instability, but also determined that conference practices \nshould be regulated to ensure that their practices did not adversely \nimpact shippers. All other maritime nations allow shipping conferences \nto exist without the constraints of antitrust or competition laws, and \npresently no nation is considering changes to their shipping regulatory \npolicies.\n  In the past, U.S. efforts to apply antitrust principles to the ocean \nshipping liner industry were met with great difficulty. Understandably, \nforeign governments objected to applying U.S. antitrust laws instead of \ntheir own laws on competition policy to their shipping companies. Many \nnations have enacted blocking statutes to expressly prevent the \napplication of U.S. antitrust laws to the practices of their shipping \ncompanies. As a result of these blocking statutes, U.S. antitrust laws \nwould only be able to reach U.S. companies and would destroy their \nability to compete with foreign companies. With the difficulties in \napplying our antitrust laws, U.S. ocean shipping policy has endeavored \nto regulate ocean shipping practices to ensure that the grant of \nantitrust immunity is not abused and that our regulatory structure does \nnot contradict the regulatory practices of foreign nations.\n  The current regulatory statute that governs the practices of the \nocean liner shipping industry is the Shipping Act of 1984. The Shipping \nAct of 1984 was enacted in response to changing trends in the ocean \nshipping industry. The advent of intermodalism and containerization of \ncargo drastically changed the face of ocean shipping, and nearly all \nliner operations are now containerized. Prior to the Shipping Act of \n1984, uncertainty existed as to whether intermodal agreements were \nwithin the scope of antitrust immunity granted to carriers. In \naddition, carrier agreements were subject to lengthy regulatory \nscrutiny under a public interest-type of standard. Dissatisfaction with \nthe regulatory structure led to hearings and legislative review in the \nlate 1970's and early 1980's. In the wake of passage of legislation \nderegulating the trucking and railroad industry, deregulation of the \nocean shipping industry was accomplished with the enactment of the \nShipping Act of 1984.\n\n  The Shipping Act of 1984 continues antitrust immunity for agreements \nunless the FMC seeks an injunction against any agreement it finds ``is \nlikely, by a reduction of competition, to produce an unreasonable \nreduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in \ntransportation cost.'' The act also clarifies that agreements can be \nfiled covering intermodal movements, thus allowing ocean carriers to \nmore fully coordinate ocean shipping services with shore-side services \nand surface transportation.\n  The Shipping Act of 1984 attempts to harmonize the twin objectives of \nfacilitating an efficient ocean transportation system while controlling \nthe potential abuses and disadvantages inherent in the conference \nsystem. The Act maintains the requirement that all carriers publish \ntariffs and provide rates and services to all shippers without unjust \ndiscrimination, thus continuing the obligations of common carriage. In \norder to provide shippers with a means of limiting conference power, \nthe Shipping Act of 1984 made three major changes: First, it allowed \nshippers to utilize service contracts, but required the essential terms \nof the contract to be filed and allowed similarly situated shippers the \nright to enter similar contracts; second, it allowed shippers the right \nto set up shippers associations, in order to allow collective cargo \ninterests to negotiate service contracts; and third, it mandated that \nall conference carriers had the right to act independently of the \nconference in pricing or service options upon 10 days' notice to the \nconference.\n  Amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, and the passage of the \nForeign Shipping Practices Act of 1988, strengthened the FMC's \noversight of foreign shipping practices and the practices of foreign \ngovernments that adversely impact conditions facing U.S. carriers and \nshippers in foreign trade. The FMC effectively utilized its trade \nauthorities to challenge restrictive port practices in Japan, and after \na tense showdown convinced the Japanese to alter their practices that \nrestrict the opportunity of carriers to operate their own marine \nterminals. The changes that will be required to be implemented under \nthis agreement will\n\n[[Page S12519]]\n\nsave consumers of imports and exporters trading to Japan, millions of \ndollars, and the FMC deserves praise for hanging tough in what was \nundeniably a tense situation.\n  While we were not able to address all concerns about our new ocean \nshipping deregulation proposal I would like to elaborate on the \nprogress that has been made toward ultimate Senate passage of \nlegislation. I would also like to thank Senators Hutchison, Lott and \nGorton for their efforts on this bill. Additionally, the following \nstaffers spent many hours meeting with the affected members of the \nshipping public and listening to their concerns about our proposal and \nI would like to personally thank Jim Sartucci and Carl Bentzel of the \nCommerce Committee staff, Carl Biersack of Senator Lott's staff, Jeanne \nBumpus of Senator Gorton's staff, Amy Henderson of Senator Hutchison's \nstaff as well as my own staffers, Mark Ashby and Paul DeVeau.\n  S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, and the proposed amendment to \nthe committee reported bill, attempt to balance the competing interests \nof those affected by international ocean shipping practices. One of the \nmajor obstacles to change in this area was the need to provide \nadditional service contract flexibility and confidentiality, while \nbalancing the need to continue oversight of contract practices to \nensure against anti-competitive practices immunized from our antitrust \nlaws. I think the contracting proposal embodied in S. 414 adequately \nbalances these competing considerations. The bill transfers the \nrequirements of providing service and price information to the private \nsector, and will allow the private sector to perform functions that had \nheretofore been provided by the Government. The bill broadens the \nauthority of the FMC to provide statutory exemptions, and reforms the \nlicensing and bonding requirements for ocean shipping intermediaries.\n  Importantly, the bill does not change the structure of the Federal \nMaritime Commission. The FMC is a small agency with a annual budget of \nabout $14 million. When you subtract penalties and fines collected over \nthe past 7 years, the annual cost of agency operations is less than $7 \nmillion. All told, the agency is a bargain to the U.S. taxpayer as it \noversees the shipping practices of over $500 billion in maritime trade. \nThe U.S. public accrues an added benefit when the FMC is able to break \ndown trade barriers that cost importers and exporters millions in \nadditional costs, as recently occurred when the FMC challenged \nrestrictive Japanese port practices.\n  The FMC is an independent regulatory agency that is not accountable \nto the direction of the administration. Independence allows the FMC to \nmaintain a more aggressive and objective posture when it comes to the \nconsideration of eliminating foreign trade barriers.\n  S. 414 also provides some additional protection to longshoremen who \nwork at U.S. ports. The concerns expressed by U.S. ports and port-\nrelated labor interests revolved around reductions in the transparency \nafforded to shipping contracts, and the potential abuse that could \noccur as a result of carrier antitrust immune contract actions. In \norder to address the concerns of longshoremen who have contracts for \nlongshore and stevedoring services, S. 414 sets up a mechanism to allow \nthe longshoremen to request information relevant to the enforcement of \ncollective bargaining agreements.\n  It is my feeling that we have before us a package of needed shipping \nreforms that will allow us to move ahead, and I look forward to passing \nthis bill in the next session of Congress.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise to express my profound \ndisappointment in the action the President took on November 1 of this \nyear when he used his veto pen to line-item veto $900,000 from the VA-\nHUD appropriations bill. This money was set aside for the final \nplanning and design of a new national veterans cemetery to be built at \nFort Sill in Lawton, OK. While I am disappointed, I know my \ndisappointment pales in comparison to the shock and frustration that \nthe veterans of Oklahoma and their families have expressed to me and my \nstaff regarding the President's action.\n  The shock and frustration expressed by veterans living in Oklahoma \nwho have selflessly served our country and their families comes because \nthe President's veto will further delay a national cemetery that has \nbeen in one stage of planning or another since 1987 when the Department \nof Veteran Affairs stated its intention to build a new national \ncemetery in Oklahoma.\n  I hope my colleagues will bear with me as I review what the veterans \nof Oklahoma and their families have gone through over the past 10 \nyears.\n  Efforts to establish a national veterans cemetery in central Oklahoma \ndate back to 1987. That year the Department of Veterans Affairs, in a \nreport to Congress, identified central Oklahoma as an area in need of a \nnational veterans cemetery because of Oklahoma's large veterans \npopulation and an official acknowledgment that the Fort Gibson cemetery \nin eastern Oklahoma would soon be full. The Oklahoma congressional \ndelegation did not make this determination, Oklahoma's large veteran\n\n[[Page S12520]]\n\npopulation did not make this determination the VA made this \ndetermination.\n  The VA then embarked on a 4-year selection process and narrowed the \npotential cemetery sites to three: Fort Reno, Edmond, and Guthrie. The \nCongress, in accordance with the 1987 report, appropriated $250,000 in \nfiscal year 1991 for the purpose of conducting an environmental impact \nstatement on these three sites to determine which site best met the \nneeds of our veterans and was suitable for construction of a cemetery.\n  In late 1993, the VA officially announced Fort Reno as its preferred \nsite, and Congress, in 1994, appropriated another $250,000 for the \ninitial planning and design stages of the cemetery. Unfortunately, in \nthat same year a land dispute arose over the Fort Reno site. After a \nyear of trying to work out an agreement on the property at Fort Reno no \nresolution could be found.\n  On January 23, 1995, the VA issued a press release announcing that it \nwas no longer committed to the Fort Reno site because the land dispute \ncould not be resolved. In that same press release Jesse Brown, the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, made the following statement:\n\n       I am reiterating VA's commitment to provide a new national \n     cemetery for the veterans of this region. We will look for \n     other potential sites and expedite the selection decision.\n\n  Thankfully, another piece of property was soon found at Fort Sill \nthat could be used for a cemetery, and true to Secretary Brown's \nstatement the process was expedited.\n  The VA, using money left over from the initial environmental impact \nstatement, conducted another study of the piece of property identified \nas a potential cemetery site at Fort Sill. The second environmental \nimpact statement was completed on the property at Fort Sill and it was \ndeemed suitable for a cemetery.\n  Again, acting on the VA's commitment of 1987 to build a national \nveterans cemetery which was reiterated in January 1995, by Secretary \nBrown, the Congress adopted an amendment that I offered to the fiscal \nyear 1997 Defense authorization bill that called for the transfer of \nthat property at Fort Sill for the establishment of a new national \nveterans cemetery.\n  I recently spoke to the Army and was informed that this land transfer \nis progressing very well and ought to be complete by mid-January of \n1998--that's about two months away.\n  This year I worked with my good friend, Senator Bond, chairman of the \nVA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, to include $900,000 for the final \nplanning and design of the cemetery. It was included in the bill that \nwas passed by the Senate and included in the conference report.\n  As I stated earlier, about a week ago, the President used his veto \npen to line-item veto this project. This project was the only VA \nproject that was line-tem vetoed this year.\n  Besides being disappointed at the President's action, I don't \nunderstand it. The cemetery project is completely within the budget \nagreement that was hammered out this year. The cemetery project was \nidentified by the VA as a project it wanted.\n  I do want to let the administration and the veterans of Oklahoma know \nthat I am committed to this project and I intend to work with the \nadministration and the VA to see that the veterans of Oklahoma get a \nnew national veterans cemetery in a timely fashion. Ten years has \nalready been a long time to wait. The veterans of Oklahoma and their \nfamilies have endured much as they served our country, I intend to see \nto it that the establishment of a new national veterans cemetery does \nnot become yet another test of that endurance.\n  Mr. President, I believe the President made a mistake. He made a \nmistake in several items that were vetoed in the MilCon bill and he \nmade a mistake in this case. The VA had made a commitment to build this \ncemetery. The veterans who served our country so well are entitled to \nbe buried in a national veterans' cemetery. The Veterans' Department \nsaid maybe the new cemetery in Oklahoma should be a State cemetery. \nHowever, the veterans of Oklahoma have stated they want to be buried in \na national veterans' cemetery, and I am committed to that. I know the \nveterans of Oklahoma are committed to that. We have had a commitment \nfrom this administration and this administration should not renege on \nit. They should not go back on their word to the veterans of Oklahoma, \nas evidenced by the President's veto. I think it was a mistake.\n  It just so happens the President does not have a Secretary of \nVeterans' Affairs. I will be meeting with the Acting Secretary and the \nPresident's nominee to be Secretary and hopefully we will come to an \nunderstanding very quickly that this is a commitment that will be \ncompleted. We need to uphold the commitment we made to the veterans of \nOklahoma that we will have a national cemetery built.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12519-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2159\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, because the proposal for fast-track trade \nauthority was not adopted, there have been a good many columns and \ncommentators evaluating why fast track failed. I wanted to comment \nabout that just a bit today. It is interesting. Even though the \npolitical pathologists for this legislation--the journalists, and the \nbeltway insiders--have picked the fast track carcass clean, they still \nmissed the cause of death.\n  The eulogies I read have no relationship to the deceased. Fast track \ndidn't die because of unions and union opposition to fast track. Fast \ntrack didn't die because the President didn't have the strength to get \nit through the Congress. Fast track didn't die because our country \ndoesn't want to engage in international trade. Fast track died because \nthis country is deeply divided on trade issues. There is not a \nconsensus in this country at this point on the issue of international \ntrade. Instead of a national dialogue on trade we have at least a half \ndozen or more monologues on trade.\n  What people miss when they evaluate what happened to fast track is \nthe deep concern that this country has not done well in international \ntrade, especially in our trade agreements. This did not matter very \nmuch during the first 25 years after the Second World War. We could \nmake virtually any agreement with anybody and provide significant \nconcessions under the guise of foreign policy and we could still win \nthe trade competition with one hand tied behind our backs. We could do \nthat because we were bigger, better, stronger, better prepared, and \nbetter able. Thus, trade policy was largely foreign policy.\n  During the first 25 years after the Second World War, our incomes \ncontinued to rise in this country despite the fact that our trade \npolicy was largely foreign policy. However, the second 25 years have \ntold a different story, and we now face tougher and shrewder \ncompetition from countries that are very able to compete with us. And \nour trade policy must be more realistic and must be a trade policy that \nrecognizes more the needs of this country.\n\n  Will Rogers said something, probably 70 years ago, that speaks to our \ntrade policy concerns. I gave an approximate quote of that here on the \nfloor the other day. He describes the concern people have about trade, \nyes, even\n\n[[Page S12521]]\n\ntoday. Let me tell you what he said. Speaking of the United States, he \nsaid,\n\n       We have never lost a war and we have never won a \n     conference. I believe that we could, without any degree of \n     egotism, single-handedly lick any nation in the world. But we \n     can't even confer with Costa Rica and come home with our \n     shirts on.\n\n  A lot of people still feel this way about our country. We could lick \nany nation in the world but we can't confer with Costa Rica and come \nhome with our shirts on. ``We have never lost a war and never won a \nconference,'' Will Rogers said.\n  What are the various interests here that cause all of this angst and \nanxiety? There is the interest of the corporations, particularly the \nvery large corporations. They have an interest of profit. Their \ninterest is to go somewhere else in the world and produce a product as \ncheaply as they can produce it and send it back to sell in America. \nThat provides a profit. That is in their interest. It is a legitimate \ninterest on behalf of their stockholders, but it is their interest. Is \nit parallel to the national interest?\n  Economists: their interest is seeing this in theory in terms of the \ndoctrine of comparative advantage. Now this was first preached at a \ntime when there weren't corporations, only nations. This is the notion \nthat each nation should do what it is best prepared and equipped to do \nand then trade with others for that which it is least able to do.\n  Consumers: consumers have an interest, in some cases, of trying to \nbuy the cheapest or least expensive product available.\n  Workers: workers want to keep their jobs and want to have good jobs \nand want to have a future and an opportunity for a job that pays well, \nwith decent benefits.\n  Then there are the big thinkers. Those are the people who think they \nknow more than all the rest of us. They understand that trade policy is \nsimply called trade policy. Actually, they still want it to be foreign \npolicy. Incidentally, some of those big thinkers were around last week. \nWhen the real debate about fast track got going, who rushed to Capitol \nHill? The Secretary of State, and U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations, came here because we still have some of those big thinkers who \nbelieve trade policy must inevitably be foreign policy in our country.\n  Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, ``The question is not where you \nstand but in what direction are you moving?'' You must always move, you \nmust not drift or lie at anchor.\n  The question is, now that fast track has failed, what direction are \nwe moving? What is our interest in trade? What can spark a national \nconsensus on trade issues? What are the new goals?\n  First of all, I think most Americans would understand that we want \nour country to be a leader in trade. Our country should lead in the \narea of expanding world trade. Yet the real question is, how do we lead \nand where do we lead?\n  I think the starting point is this. We have the largest trade \ndeficits in this country's history. Most Americans viscerally \nunderstand that. We have the largest trade deficits in our country's \nhistory, and they are getting worse, not better. We must do something \nabout it.\n  We have specific and vexing trade problems that go unresolved. I have \nmentioned many times on the floor of the Senate the trade problem with \nCanada, which is not the largest problem we have. Yet, it is a huge \nproblem for the people that it affects. I am talking about the flood of \nunfairly traded Canadian grain that is undercutting our farmers' \ninterests.\n  I just got off the phone with a farmer an hour ago. He was calling \nfrom North Dakota. He said the price of grain is down, way down. He's \ntrying to compete with terribly unfair imports coming in through his \nback door from a state trading enterprise which would be illegal in \nthis country and are sold at secret prices.\n  Trade problems which go unresolved fester and infect, and that is \nwhat causes many in this country to have a sour feeling about this \ncountry's trade policy. Because of a range of these problems, this \ncountry does not have a consensus on trade policy, at least not a \nconsensus that Congress should pass fast track.\n  Last weekend and early this week when fast track failed to get the \nneeded votes to pass the Congress, there were people who almost had \napoplectic seizures here in Washington, DC. They were falling over \nthemselves, saying, ``Woe is America. What on Earth is going happen?''\n  Then we had countries in South America get into the act. I read in \nthe paper that one of the countries in South America said, ``You know, \nif the United States can't have fast-track trade authority then we are \ngoing to have to negotiate with somebody else.''\n  Oh, really? Who are you going to negotiate with? Have you found a \nsubstitute for the American marketplace anywhere on the globe? Is there \nanywhere on Earth that a substitute for the American marketplace \nexists? Maybe you want to negotiate with Nigeria? How about Zambia? \nZambia has a lower gross national product than the partners of Goldman \nSachs have income. So go negotiate with Zambia.\n  Would our trading partners do us a favor, and not think the world is \ncoming apart because we have not passed fast track? They need to \nunderstand that we want expanded trade. In the debate about trade we \nwant to have embedded some notion about responsibilities. These are the \nresponsibilities that we have as a country to decide that our trade \npolicy must also reflect our values. These values are about the \nenvironment, about safe workplaces, about children working, about food \nsafety and, yes, about human rights.\n  Does that mean we want to impose our values, imprint them, stamp them \nin every circumstance around the globe for a condition of trade? No. It \ndoes mean there is a bar at some point that we establish that says this \nminimum represents the set of values that we care about with respect to \nour trade relations.\n  Do we care if another country allows firms to hire 12-year-old kids, \nwork them 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour and then ships \nthese products to Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Fargo? Yes, the consumer \ngets a cheaper product, but do we want 12-year-old kids working \nsomewhere to produce it? Do we care that they compete with a company in \nthis country that is unable to hire kids because this country is \nunwilling to let companies hire kids? We also say to these companies \nthat they cannot dump chemicals into the air and into the water. We \nrequire a safe workplace. We require that a living wage be paid. At \nleast we have minimum wage conditions.\n  We need to answer those questions. What really is fair trade? In \nwhose interests do we fight for the set of values that we want for our \nfuture in our trade policies?\n  As we seek a new consensus on trade in this country, I hope that \nconsensus will include the following goals:\n  First, it would be in this country's interest to end its chronic \ntrade deficits. For 21 years in a row we have had chronic, nagging, \ngrowing trade deficits. I hope that as a goal we will decide that it is \nin this country's interest to end these trade deficits. Hopefully we \nwould do it by increasing net exports from this country.\n  Second, we want more and better jobs in this country. That means our \ntrade agreements ought to be designed to foster and improve job \nconditions in this country and living standards. As a part of that we \nneed to require that our values are reflected in our trade policies, \nincluding our concerns about others who do not respect the rights of \nchildren and the environment.\n  Third, we need mandatory enforcement of trade agreements. Let us \nfinally enforce the trade agreements we have made in the past. There \nare too many agreements that our trading partners are not abiding by. \nLet us not consign American producers and American workers to some \nwilderness out there facing vexing trade problems that cannot and will \nnot be solved. Let's decide as a country, if an agreement is worth \nmaking, it is worth enforcing. Let us stand up to Canada, Mexico, \nChina, and Japan and others and say, ``If you are going to have trade \nagreements with us, this country insists on its behalf and on behalf of \nits farmers, workers and employers that we are going to enforce trade \nagreements.''\n  Fourth, let us end the currency trap doors in trade agreements. When \nwe make a trade agreement with some country and they devalue their \ncurrency, all the benefits of that trade\n\n[[Page S12522]]\n\nagreement, and much, much more, are swept away in an instant.\n  Fifth, all trade agreements should relate to the question of whether \nthey contribute to this country's national security.\n  These are the values that I think make sense for this country to \ndiscuss and consider as it tries to seek a new consensus on trade \npolicy.\n\n  Once again, those who do the autopsies on failed public policies, \nincluding fast track during this last week, should not miss the cause \nof death. The reason fast track failed was because, as President Wilson \nonce said, the murmur of public policy in this country comes not from \nthis Chamber and not from the seats of learning in this town, but it \ncomes from the factories and the farms and from the hills and the \nvalleys of this country and from the homes of people who care about \nwhat happens to the economy of this country, and the economy of their \nState and their community.\n  They are the ones who evaluate whether public policy is in their \ninterest or in this country's interest. They are the ones, after all, \nwho decide what happens in this Chamber, because they are the ones who \nsent us here and the ones who asked us to provide the kind of \nleadership toward a system of trade and economic policy that will \nresult in a better country.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I hope that as we discuss trade in the days \nahead, it will be in a thoughtful, and not thoughtless, way. We do not \nneed a discussion by those who say, ``Well, fast track is dead, the \nprotectionists win.'' That is not what the vote was about. It is not \nwhat the issue was about, and it is not the way I think we will \nconfront trade policies in the future.\n  I will conclude with one additional point. There is an op-ed piece in \nthe New York Times today which I found most interesting. I ask \nunanimous consent to have this op-ed piece printed in the Record at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an op-ed piece by Thomas Friedman. \nI commend it to my colleagues. He talks about the new American politics \nand especially about fast-track trade authority. He said we have a \ntrade debate among people divided into four categories:\n  The Integrationists: ``These are people who believe freer trade and \nintegration are either inevitable or good, and they want to promote \nmore trade agreements and Internet connections from one end of the \nworld to the other, 24 hours a day.''\n  There are the Social Safety-Netters. ``These are people who believe \nthat we need to package global integration with programs that will \nassist the `know-nots' and `have-nots.' ''\n  Then there are the Let-Them-Eat-Cakers. ``These are people who \nbelieve that globalization is winner-take-all, loser-take-care-of-\nyourself.\n  He provides an interesting statement of where he thinks all of the \ncurrent key players in the debate find themselves.\n\n       Now everyone in the fast-track debate is in my matrix: Bill \n     Clinton is an Integrationist-Social-Safety-Netter. Newt \n     Gingrich is an Integrationist-Let-Them-Eat-Caker. Dick \n     Gephardt is a Separatist-Social-Safety-Netter and Ross Perot \n     is a Separatist-Let-Them-Eat-Caker.\n\n  If that piques your interest, I encourage you to look at this \nparticular piece by Thomas Friedman in which he describes his \ninteresting matrix of trade policy and the need to build a new \nconsensus.\n  Finally, I want to say that what this country needs most at this \npoint is to understand there is not now a consensus on trade policy. I \nsay to the President and I say to the corporations and labor unions and \nthe people in this country that it is time to develop a new consensus. \nI am interested, for one, in finding a way to bridge the gaps among all \nof the competing interests in trade to see if we might be able to weave \na quilt of public policy that represents this country's best interest \nin advancing our economy and our American values.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 13, 1997]\n\n                       The New American Politics\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       Well, I guess it's official now: America has a four-party \n     system.\n       That's the most important lesson to come out of Monday's \n     decision by Congressional Democrats to reject President \n     Clinton's request for ``fast track'' authority to sign more \n     international free-trade agreements. I see a silver lining in \n     what Congress did, even though it was harebrained. Maybe now \n     at least the American public, and the business community, \n     will fully understand what politics is increasingly about in \n     this country, and will focus on which of America's four \n     parties they want to join.\n       Me, I'm an Integrationist-Social-Safety-Netter. How about \n     you?\n       To figure out which party you're in let me again offer the \n     Friedman matrix of globalization politics. Take a piece of \n     paper and draw a line across the middle from east to west. \n     This is the globalization line, where you locate how you feel \n     about the way in which technology and open markets are \n     combining to integrate more and more of the world. At the far \n     right end of this line are the Integrationists. These are \n     people who believe that freer trade and integration are \n     either inevitable or good; they want to promote more trade \n     agreements and Internet connections from one end of the world \n     to the other, 24 hours a day.\n       Next go to the far left end of this line. These are the \n     Separatists. These are people who believe free trade and \n     technological integration are neither good nor inevitable; \n     they want to stop them in their tracks. So first locate \n     yourself somewhere on this line between Separatists and \n     Integrationists.\n       Now draw another line from north to south through the \n     middle of the globalization line. This is the distribution \n     line. It defines what you believe should go along with \n     globalization to cushion its worst social, economic and \n     environmental impacts. At the southern end of this line are \n     the Social-Safety-Netters. These are people who believe that \n     we need to package global integration with programs that will \n     assist the ``know-nots'' and ``have-nots,'' who lack the \n     skills to take advantage of the new economy or who get caught \n     up in the job-churning that goes with globalization and are \n     unemployed or driven into poorer-paying jobs. The Safety-\n     Netters also want programs to improve labor and environmental \n     standards in developing countries rushing headlong into the \n     global economy.\n       At the northern tip of this distribution line are the Let-\n     Them-Eat-Cakers. These are people who believe that \n     globalization is winner-take-all, loser-take-care-of-\n     yourself.\n       Now everyone in the fast-track debate is my matrix: Bill \n     Clinton is an Integrationist-Social-Safety-Netter. Newt \n     Gingrich is an Integrationist-Let-Them-Eat-Caker. Dick \n     Gephardt is a Separatist-Social-Safety-Netter and Ross Perot \n     is a Separatist-Let-Them-Eat-Caker. That's why Mr. Clinton \n     and Mr. Gingrich are allies on free trade but opponents on \n     social welfare, and why Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Perot are allies \n     against more free trade, but opponents on social welfare.\n       As I said, I'm an Integrationist-Social-Safety-Netter. I \n     believe that the technologies weaving the world more tightly \n     together cannot be stopped and the integration of markets can \n     only be reversed at a very, very high cost. Bill Clinton is \n     right about that and Dick Gephardt and the unions are wrong.\n       But Mr. Gephardt and the unions are right that \n     globalization is as creatively destructive as the earlier \n     versions of capitalism, which destroyed feudalism and \n     Communism. With all its positives, globalization does churn \n     new jobs and destroy old ones, it does widen gaps between \n     those with knowledge skills and those without them, it does \n     weaken bonds of community. And the Clinton team, the business \n     community and all the workers already benefiting from the \n     information economy never took these dark sides seriously \n     enough.\n       One hopes they now realize that this is one of the most \n     fundamental issues--maybe the most fundamental issue--in \n     American politics. You can't just give a speech about it one \n     month before they vote, you can't just have your company buy \n     an ad supporting it the day before you vote, you can't just \n     summon a constituency for it on the eve of the vote. You have \n     to build a real politics of Integrationist-Social-Safety-\n     Nettism--a politics that can show people the power and \n     potential of global integration, while taking seriously their \n     needs for safety nets to protect them along the way. Build it \n     and they will come.\n\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this week, we celebrated a national \nholiday, Veterans Day. We were not in session on that day, November 11, \nso I want to make a few comments about that day and what it means to \nour country.\n  Veterans Day comes from the Armistice Day that ended World War I in \n1918. The armistice was signed that day at 11 o'clock in the morning \nwith the hope that that would be the war to end all wars. As we look \nback on what has happened since that time, we know\n\n[[Page S12523]]\n\nthat that is not what happened, however, that is the way World War I \nwas billed at that time.\n  Later, Armistice Day was changed to Veterans Day to better represent \nall the conflicts that this country has ever participated in. I think \nit is good that we have a day where we can reflect on, and commemorate \nthose who took part in those wars.\n  However, sometimes on that day, we are reminded that appreciation for \nthe military, and for their sacrifices, does not get its proper \nattention. I am reminded of the old Kipling poem where he talks about \nhow the lack of appreciation for our military occurs, or seems to \noccur, in those time periods when they are most needed.\n  Kipling was British, and in Britain, GI's were called tommies. In his \nfamous poem Kipling wrote:\n\n       It's Tommy this, an' Tommy that,\n       an' ``Chuck him out, the brute!''\n       But it's ``Savior of 'is country''\n       when the guns begin to shoot.\n\n  We tend to forget about the sacrifices our military personnel when \npeace breaks out. History shows us that over the last 100 years or so, \nwe have had approximately 17-year cycles of war and peace. It is \namazing, almost uncanny, how our military buildups and downgrades fit \ninto that 17-year cycle. In fact, the only conflict that occurred \noutside of that pattern was World War II, which was only about 4 years \noff the 17-year cycle. I can only hope that our current period of peace \nwill break that 17-year cycle.\n  On Veterans Day, we recognize those who have gone through these \ncycles before us. It is a time to point out some of the sacrifices they \nmade, the devotion to duty that they were required to perform, and the \ncourage that they exhibited. It is a time to say, ``The professionalism \nof our military saved lives.''\n  Veterans themselves, do not need a special day, because they remember \ntheir own experiences in the military. They do not need a special day \nbecause those times are forever etched in their memories. They remember \nthe people that they were associated with, their friends, people of all \nwalks of life. They remember the rich, the poor, the advantaged, the \ndisadvantaged; all tossed together, rubbing elbows, in what is the \nfinest military in the world. They remember the places where they were \nstationed, their training, and they certainly remember their days in \ncombat, which is forever etched on their memory, like nothing else out \nof their past.\n  Some survived and some did not. Veterans Day is a time to go back and \nremember those people. It is time, not just for veterans, but for all \nAmericans, to remember that this country was built on the sacrifices of \nthe brave men and women who served in the military, and protected our \ncountry. It is a day to remember and appreciate what made this country, \nthe greatest nation in the world.\n  Mr. President, another important day occurred early this week and I \nwould like to make a few remarks about it also.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12522-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12523-S12524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MARINE CORPS' 222D BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, Monday, November 10, was the 222d birthday \nof the U.S. Marine Corps. That day is celebrated by marines, and former \nmarines, wherever they are, wherever they may go.\n  Last year, on the Marine Corps birthday, I was on a plane with our \nminority leader and several other Senators, on a trip to the Far East. \nWe were on our way to visit Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. We \nhad just left Japan, and I was sitting there with my wife, Annie, when \nI remembered that it was the Marine Corps birthday. Because it is a \nritual for marines to celebrate their birthday, no matter where they \nare, I told Annie that I was going back to the galley to get something \nto be our Marine Corps birthday cake. I know this may sound silly to \nsome people, but to marines, it does not sound silly at all.\n  So, right as I was getting ready to head back to the galley, other \npeople on the flight started gathering around where we were sitting. It \nturned out that they also had remembered how important this day was to \nme, and my fellow marines. Not only did they know what the 10th of \nNovember was, they had brought a cake along with them. It was a \nbeautiful cake and was decorated with the Marine Corps emblem. So \nprobably like a lot of other isolated marines in the world, we had our \nown party. It was a very memorable celebration.\n\n  This year I had the chance to participate in the Marine Corps \nbirthday ball here in Washington, at the Marine Barracks. Once again, \nwe had a wonderful celebration.\n  The corps remains proud of the role it has played in the history of \nour country--as the 911 force, the emergency force that is always \navailable when requirements dictate that the most best is needed now.\n  The Marine Corps remains unique to the other services, in the respect \nthat it has all elements of supporting arms in one unit. It has \nsupplies for 60 days of combat. It has infantry, air, armor, and \nartillery. It has all the elements wrapped up in one unit, necessary to \ngo in and be a very tough, hard-hitting organization for a short period \nof time.\n  This was vividly illustrated in the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm. \nThe Marine Corps came in with two divisions, completely equipped, and \nset up a blocking position, to give our other forces time to build up--\na build up that over a several-month period came to number over 520,000 \nAmericans.\n  This was typical of the role that the U.S. Marine Corps has played as \nthe ready force. And there isn't a Marine unit in existence that does \nnot have some of its expeditionary gear, some of its combat equipment \nboxed and ready to go now and move within hours. If the Marine Corps \never loses that kind of readiness, I believe it will have lost its \nreason for being.\n  So in their 222d year of existence, the marines continue to celebrate \nthe traditions of the Marine Corps. They honor and remember the \nsacrifices of marines who fought in places like Belleau Wood, \nGuadalcanal, Tarawa, Bougainville, Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill and the \nChosen Reservoir, and Khe Sanh.\n  One thing that has remained the same though out the Marines history, \nand something that I am proud of, is in the way in that the Marine \nCorps recruits people. The Marine Corps recruits people to serve. They \ndo not recruit on a promise of ``Here's what is good for you, or here's \nwhat you'll get out of it yourself'', they recruit by asking the \nquestion, ``Are you good enough to serve your country?'' And it is \nhere, and later where they are trained, that the attitudes required to \nprepare them for battle, are instilled. It calls for each person to \ndevote themselves to a purpose bigger than themselves, a purpose to \neach other, a purpose to the unit, a purpose to the corps, and a \npurpose to this country of ours.\n  This was well spelled out in a Parade magazine article last Sunday, \nNovember 9. This article said so much about the training that is going \non in the Marine Corps today, training that continues to be updated \nfrom one war to the next.\n  This article was not written by some Marine Corps public relations \nperson, it was written by Thomas E. Ricks, a writer for the Wall Street \nJournal. Mr Ricks starts out in the first part of this article by \nsaying, ``What is it about the Marine Corps that makes it so successful \nin transforming teenage boys and girls into responsible, confident men \nand women? He goes on to show how ordinary ``Beavises and Butt-heads'' \ncan be molded into effective leaders. And he says of himself, ``I \nmajored in English literature at Yale, and, like everybody with whom I \ngrew up and went to school with, I have no military experience. Yet I \nlearned things at Parris Island that fascinated me.''\n  He talks about ``Lessons From Parris Island'' that are instilled into \nthese young people coming into the Marine Corps which are--first, \n``Tell the truth;'' second, ``Do your best, no matter how trivial the \ntask;'' third, ``Choose the difficult right over the easy wrong;'' \nfourth, ``Look out for the group before you look out for yourself;'' \nfifth, ``Don't whine or make excuses;'' and, sixth, ``Judge others by \ntheir actions and not their race.''\n  By my way of thinking, those are some pretty good objectives for \nanybody in our society to follow. And they are the building blocks that \nare instilled in all U.S. Marines as they go through boot camp.\n  Mr. President, I will not read this whole article this morning. I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12524]]\n\n                           A Few Good Truths\n\n                          (By Thomas E. Ricks)\n\n\n                      what we can learn from them\n\n       On a hot night in 1992, on my first deployment as a \n     Pentagon reporter, I went on patrol in Mogadishu, Somalia, \n     with a squad of Marines led by a 22-year-old corporal. Red \n     and green tracer bullets cut arcs across the dark sky. It was \n     a confusing and difficult time. Yet the corporal led the \n     patrol with a confidence that was contagious.\n       Ever since that night, I had wanted to see how the Marine \n     Corps turns teenage Americans into self-confident leaders. At \n     a time when the nation seems distrustful of its teenage \n     males--when young black men especially, and wrongly, are \n     figures of fear for many--the military is different. It isn't \n     just that it has done a better job than the larger society in \n     dealing with drug abuse and racial tension--even though that \n     is true. It also seems to be doing a better job of teaching \n     teenagers the right away to live than does, say, the average \n     American high school. And it thrives while drawing most of \n     its personnel from the bottom half of our society, the half \n     that isn't surfing the information superhighway.\n       I wanted to see how the Marines could turn an \n     undereducated, cynical teenager into that young soldier, who, \n     on his second night in Africa, could lead a file of men \n     through the dark and dangerous city. How could a kid we would \n     not trust to run the copier by himself back in my office in \n     Washington become the squad leader addressing questions that \n     could alter national policy: Do I shoot at this threatening \n     mob in a Third World city? Do I fire when a local police \n     officer points his weapon in my direction? If I am performing \n     a limited peacekeeping mission, do I stop a rape when it \n     occurs 50 yards in front of my position?\n       To find out how the Marines give young Americans the values \n     and self-confidence to make those decisions, I decided to go \n     to Marine boot camp. I went not as a recruit but as an \n     observer. I come from the post-draft generation. I majored in \n     English literature at Yale, and, like everybody with whom I \n     grew up and went to school, I have no military experience. \n     Yet I learned things at Parris Island that fascinated me--and \n     should interest anyone who cares about where our youth are \n     going. In a society that seems to have trouble transmitting \n     healthy values, the Marines stand out as a successful \n     institution that unabashedly teaches those values to the \n     Beavises and Butt-heads of America.\n       I met Platoon 3086 on a foggy late winter night in 1995 \n     when its bus arrived on Parris Island, S.C. I followed the \n     recruits intermittently for their 11 weeks on the island, \n     then during their first two years in the Marine Corps.\n       The recruits arrived steeped in the popular American \n     culture of consumerism and individualism. To a surprising \n     degree, before joining the Corps, they had been living part-\n     time lives--working part-time, going to community college \n     part-time (and getting lousy grades) and staying dazed on \n     drugs and alcohol part-time. When they arrived on Parris \n     Island, all that was taken away from them. They were stripped \n     of the usual distractions, from television and music to cars \n     and candy. They even lost the right to refer to themselves as \n     ``I'' or ``me.'' When one confused recruit did so during the \n     first week of boot camp, Sgt. Darren Carey, the platoon's \n     ``heavy hat'' disciplinarian, stomped his foot on the cement \n     floor and shouted, ``You got on the wrong bus, cause there \n     ain't no I, me, my's or I's here!''\n       On Parris Island, for every waking moment during the next \n     11 weeks, they were immersed in a new, very different world. \n     For the first time in their lives, many encountered absolute \n     standards: Tell the truth. Don't give up. Don't whine. Look \n     out for the group before you look out for yourself. Always do \n     your best--even if you are just mopping the floor, you owe it \n     to yourself and your comrades to strive to be the best mopper \n     at this moment in the Corps. Judge others by their actions, \n     not their words or their race.\n       The drill instructors weren't interested in excuses. Every \n     day, they transmitted the lesson taught centuries ago by the \n     ancient Greek, philosophers: Don't pursue happiness; pursue \n     excellence. Make a habit of that, and you can have a \n     fulfilling life.\n       These aren't complex ideas, but to persuade a cynical \n     teenager to follow them, they must be painstakingly pursued \n     every day--lived as well as preached. I have seen few people \n     work as hard as did Platoon 3086's drill instructors in the \n     first few weeks they led the platoon. Sergeant Carey, an \n     intense young reconnaissance specialist from Long Island, \n     routinely put in 17 hours a day, six and half days a week. \n     His ability to drive himself at full speed all day long awed \n     and inspired his charges. Recruit Paul Bourassa said of his \n     drill instructor. ``When you're gone 16 hours, and you're \n     wiped out, and you see him motoring, you say to yourself, \n     `I've go to tap into whatever he has.' ''\n       Sergeant Carey clearly wasn't doing it for the money. He \n     was paid $1775 a month--a figure that worked out to about the \n     minimum wage. Of course, the wages were nearly irrelevant. \n     The recruits learned that money isn't the measure of a man, \n     that a person's real wealth is in his character. One of the \n     funniest moments I saw in boot camp came when Sergeant Carey \n     was lecturing the platoon on the importance of knowledge.\n       ``Knowledge is what?'' he bellowed.\n       ``Power, sir,'' responded the platoon.\n       ``Power is what?'' he then asked.\n       That puzzled the platoon. Faces scrunched up in thought. \n     Eventually one recruit hazarded a guess: ``Money?''\n       Sergenat Carey was dumbfounded to find such a civilian \n     attitude persisting is his platoon. ``No!'' he shouted. \n     ``Power is VICTORY!'' (Then, in a whispered aside, he added, \n     ``I swear, I'm dealing with aliens.'')\n       The drill instructors didn't try to make their recruits \n     happy. They tried to push the members of the platoon harder \n     than they'd ever been pushed, to make them go beyond their \n     own self-imposed limits. Nearly all the members of the \n     platoon cried at one time or another. Yet by the end of 11 \n     weeks almost all had been transformed by the experience--and \n     were more fulfilled than they had ever been. They had \n     subordinated their needs to those of the group, yet almost \n     all emerged with a stronger sense of self. They \n     unembarrassedly used words like ``integrity.''\n       I learned more than I expected. One of my favorite moments \n     came when Sergeant Carey ordered a white supremacist from \n     Alabama to share a tent in the woods with a black gang member \n     from Washington, D.C. The drill instructor's message to the \n     recruits was clear: If you two are going to be in the Marine \n     Corps, you are going to have to learn to live with each \n     other. Recruits Jonathan Prish and Earnest Winston Jr. became \n     friends during that bivouac. ``We stuck up for each other \n     after that,'' Prish said.\n       The recruits generally seemed to find race relations less \n     of an issue at boot camp than in the neighborhoods they'd \n     left behind. If America were more like the Marines, argued \n     Luis Polanco-Medina, a recruit from New Jersey, ``there would \n     be less crime, less racial tension among people, because \n     Marine Corps discipline is also about brotherhood.''\n       Two other things surprised me. I didn't hear a lot of \n     profanity. Once notoriously foul-mouthed, today's drill \n     instructors generally are forbidden to use obscenities. Also, \n     I saw very little brutality. ``I expected it to be tougher,'' \n     said recruit Edward Linsky, in a typical comment as he sat on \n     his footlocker.\n       Platoon 3086 graduated into the Marine Corps in May 1995 \n     and became part of a family that includes 174,000 active-duty \n     members and 2.1 million veterans (there really is no such \n     thing as an ``ex-Marine''). Over the last two years, members \n     of the platoon have experienced some disappointments. But as \n     Paul Bourassa concluded a year after graduating from boot \n     camp, ``It pretty much is a band of brothers.''\n       What I think the Marine Corps represents is counterculture, \n     but the Marines are rebels with a cause. With their emphasis \n     on honor, courage and commitment, they offer a powerful \n     alternative to the loneliness and distrust that seem so \n     widespread, especially among our youth.\n       Any American--young or old, pro- or anti-military--can \n     learn something from today's Corps. That goes for the \n     corporation as well as the individual. Just listen to Maj. \n     Stephen Davis describe his approach to leadership: \n     ``Concentrate on doing a single task as simply as you can, \n     execute it flawlessly, take care of your people and go \n     home.'' Those steps offer an efficient way to run any \n     organization.\n       I took away a lot from boot camp myself. I don't talk to my \n     own kids like a drill instructor (and neither do thoughtful \n     drill instructors). But I was struck by the importance of the \n     example the DIs provided: Kids want values, but they are \n     rightly suspicious of talk without action. So while you need \n     to talk to kids about values, your words will be meaningless \n     unless you live them as well. Also, of all the things that \n     can motivate people, the pursuit of excellence is one of the \n     most effective--and one of the least used in our society.\n       None of this is a revelation. Lots of families live by \n     these standards. But few of our public institutions seem to. \n     ``You'd see the drill instructors teach kids who barely made \n     it through high school that they weren't stupid that they \n     could do things if they had the right can-do attitude,'' \n     summarized Charles Lees of Platoon 3086. ``It was all the \n     things you should learn growing up but, for some reason, \n     society de-emphasizes.''\n       The white supremacist and the black gang member who were \n     thrown together in boot camp both went on to happy careers in \n     the Corps. Earnest Winston Jr., the D.C. gangbanger, became a \n     specialist in the recovery of aircraft making emergency \n     landings and was posted to Japan. ``It's beautiful,'' he told \n     me. ``Not a lot of people on my block get to go places like \n     these.'' His friend Jonathan Prish, the Alabaman, became a \n     guard near the American Embassy in London, Prish had his \n     racist tattoos covered. ``I've left all that behind,'' he \n     said. ``You go out and see the world, and you see there are \n     cool people in all colors.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Lessons From Parris Island\n\n       Tell the truth.\n       Do your best, no matter how trivial the task.\n       Choose the difficult right over the easy wrong.\n       Look out for the group before you look out for yourself.\n       Don't whine or make excuses.\n       Judge others by their actions not their race.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12523-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12525-S12526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12525]]\n                          TRIBUTE TO FRED PANG\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, a man who worked with me very closely on \nthe Armed Services Committee, Fred Pang, a man who rose to become the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy, will retire \nfrom almost 40 years of service to our Government, on November 16.\n  During these 40 years he has always kept one principle paramount in \nhis service--that principle has been the welfare of the troops. Over \nhis entire period of service, and especially during the past 3 years, \nhe has constantly worked to improve the quality of life for our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families.\n  Mr. Pang's long and productive association with the military of the \nUnited States dates back to his earliest days. Growing up in Hawaii, \nhis father was a shipyard worker at Pearl Harbor and a survivor of the \nJapanese attack on December 7, 1941. Perhaps growing up in Hawaii \nduring World War II helped shape Mr. Pang's propensity for public \nservice, his fervent patriotism, and his penchant to participate in the \ndefense of our Nation. In high school, Mr. Pang was a member of the \nArmy Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program at McKinley High \nSchool. Next, he joined the Naval Reserves, and following boot camp in \nSan Diego, he served aboard two destroyers. While pursuing his \nbachelor's degree at the University of Hawaii, he enrolled in the Air \nForce Reserve Officer Training Corps program, and upon graduation, he \nwas commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. Thus, began \nhis long and illustrious active affiliation with the Department of \nDefense.\n  His 27-year Air Force career included a variety of manpower and \npersonnel assignments, including a tour in Vietnam in 1968-69. Before \nretiring as a colonel in 1986, he was the Director Of Officer and \nEnlisted Personnel Management and the Director of Compensation in the \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and \nPersonnel--two of the most important and demanding personnel jobs in \nthe entire Department of Defense for an active duty officer. During his \nstint in these jobs, he worked on many critically important projects \nwith long-term implications for the professional personnel management \nof uniformed personnel. Most noteworthy was the research and analysis \nhe did in support of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act \n[DOPMA] of 1981. While this act was obviously the result of much hard \nwork by many people and was, in the final analysis, a work of the \nCongress, the work done by Mr. Pang in the Department of Defense \ncontributed immeasurably to its success. The fact that DOPMA has \nremained in tact for over 16 years as the governing law for all \nDepartment of Defense officer personnel stands in tribute to the work \ndone by then-Colonel Pang and all others who contributed to its \ndevelopment.\n  Upon his retirement from the Air Force, and after a very short, 6 \nmonths, time in the private sector, Mr. Pang again answered the call of \nhis country and went to work as a professional staff member on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee [SASC]. As the majority staffer on the \nPersonnel Subcommittee of the SASC, Mr. Pang was recognized as one of \nthe leading experts and most influential people in the entire \nGovernment when it came to matters relating to the management of U.S. \nmilitary personnel. Although his accomplishments on the SASC are far \ntoo numerous to list here, there is one facet of his service with the \ncommittee, which deserves mention. Following the end of the cold war, \nthe Department of Defense was faced with the unprecedented task of \ndrawing down an All-Volunteer military. Having lived through the post-\nVietnam war drawdown, which was something less than successful, Mr. \nPang was determined that we would not return to hollow military of the \nmid- to late-1970's. Working tirelessly, he developed a package of \ndownsizing incentives including the voluntary separation incentive \n[VSI], special separation benefit [SSB], and temporary early retirement \nauthority [TERA]. These programs have proven themselves to be \nextraordinarily effective in helping reshape our military as it was \nreduced by some 33 percent. The results speak for themselves. Today, we \nhave a military that is of higher quality in terms of education and \naptitude scores than ever before in history. The force was drawndown in \na well-balanced manner so that today our service men and women are more \nexperienced and capable than ever before. Additionally, when the \ndrawdown began, many feared that minorities and women would be \ndisproportionately affected. So good were the tools provided by \nCongress, developed mostly by Mr. Pang and so skillful was the \nexecution of the drawdown that the military force of today is more \nrichly diverse than ever before.\n  Working with his committee chairman, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Mr. \nPang recognized that the true peace dividend coming out of the cold war \nwas the incredible number of high quality men and women coming out of \nthe military and returning to civilian life. He conceived and developed \nan innovative and effective package of transition benefit programs that \nhave proved to be successful beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Literally \nmillions of service men and women have separated from the military \nsince the drawdown began. Transition counseling packages written \ninto law along with brilliant and innovative programs such as Troops to \nTeachers and Troops to Cops have ensured that not only have our recent \nveterans found meaningful and rewarding employment, but that their \nskills, developed in the military, are now being utilized to the \nfullest in the civilian sector. A great deal of anecdotal evidence \nexists that these transition programs have worked exceedingly well. \nHowever, as overall evidence of the effectiveness of the transition \nprograms developed by Mr. Pang, notwithstanding the huge number of \npeople separating from the military during the downsizing, the amount \nof money, as a percent of the budget, that the Department of Defense \nhas paid out in unemployment compensation has not increased at all. \nPeople are finding jobs in the private sector, and they are finding \ngood jobs. Through job fairs and transition bulletin boards, private \nsector employers have acquired new employees who have a great work \nethic, who understand the concept of mission, and who are drug free. \nAnd society has acquired former service members who are outstanding \nrole models for the youth of America. Much of the credit for this truly \nAmerican success story has got to go to Mr. Fred Pang.\n\n  During his tenure as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and \nReserve Affairs and as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Force Management \nPolicy, Mr. Pang has continued and focused his leadership in the area \nof military and civilian personnel management and equal opportunity. \nHard to put into words, but clearly evident from the accomplishments of \nthe organizations that he has so skillfully led over the past 4 years, \nis the ``can do'', positive attitude that he inspires as a leader. \nDuring his tenure as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and \nReserve Affairs, he dealt with some of the thorniest issues facing the \nNavy in many years such as the Tailhook scandal and the U.S. Naval \nAcademy cheating scandal. Mr. Pang's integrity and commonsense approach \nto problemsolving did much to put the Navy on the correct course in \ndealing with these very difficult issues. As the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense, Force Management Policy, he completely revised and made right \nthe Department of Defense Directive on officer promotion and nomination \nprocedures. In the aftermath of Tailhook and other highly publicized \nofficer promotion and nomination problems, the new directive, written \nunder Mr. Pang's leadership, has not only put the processing of these \ncritical actions back on an efficient and timely track, but has \nrestored the faith and confidence of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and of the American public in the officer promotion and \nnomination process. One of the major efforts of former Secretary of \nDefense William Perry was improving the quality of life of service and \nfamily members. He placed Mr. Pang in charge of this effort and \nappointed him as the chairman of the Department of Defense Executive \nCommittee on Quality of Life. Under Dr. Perry's guidance and Mr. Pang's \nleadership, the Quality of Life Executive Committee has made major \naccomplishments in improving the quality of life of our service and \nfamily members, and, for the first time, we have established a series \nof measurements and\n\n[[Page S12526]]\n\nstandards for all quality of life services. Because of these efforts, \nthe lives of service and family members worldwide have been improved \nand enriched.\n  Mr. Pang has led the Force Management Policy organization to new \nheights of efficiency and accomplishment across the spectrum of \ncivilian and military personnel management; personnel support, families \nand education; equal opportunity; morale welfare and recreation and \nresale activities; and women in the military. He is leaving a legacy of \nservice to the Department of Defense and our Nation, and most \nimportantly, to our men and women serving in uniform, of dedicated \nservice and lasting contributions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor legislation that will be considered by the Senate and has been \nconsidered by the House this morning. This legislation is the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997. This bill, which is a compromise version \nof legislation that I introduced originally now has as supporters and \nsponsors: Senator Rockefeller, Senator Craig, Senator Bond, Senator \nDeWine, Senator Coats, Senator Jeffords, Senator Landrieu, Senator \nLevin, Senator Kerrey, Senator Dorgan, Senator Moynihan, Senator \nMoseley-Braun, and Senator Johnson. Mr. President, this legislation \nwill make some critical changes to the child welfare system--changes \nthat will vastly improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of children \ncurrently in foster care and waiting for adoptive homes. I am very \nhopeful that the President, who has indicated his support for this \nlegislation, will sign this measure promptly.\n  Mr. President, just yesterday, there was yet another story in the \nnewspapers about a young girl, 9 years old, who was found dead from \nsevere abuse in her sister's Bronx apartment. The tragic story of young \nSabrina Green's short life is harrowing, and it is all too reminiscent \nof the cases we read and hear about, unfortunately, every single day. \nEach time I read about a case like Sabrina Green's, I feel outrage and \nfrustration with a system that cannot take care of the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society. Now, Mr. President, we cannot bring Sabrina \nGreen back to life, nor can we bring back any of the hundreds of \nchildren who have died under similar circumstances; but we can take \naction to prevent such deaths in the future, and that is what we are \ndoing today.\n  The bill that will come over to us shortly, Mr. President, will put \nthe safety and health of the child first. That is a significant change \nin the law. Under this legislation, the safety and health of the child \nwill come first. We will not continue the current system of always \nputting the needs and rights of the biological parents first. While we \nstill believe that family reunification is a worthy goal, it's time we \nrecognize that some families simply cannot and should not be kept \ntogether. Children who have suffered severe abuse or whose parents have \ncommitted violent crimes should be moved out of those homes rapidly and \ninto adoptive homes. Our bill does that. Children who are in foster \ncare for over 15 months deserve to have a decision made about their \nfuture. Our legislation does both of those things.\n  It is also time we put a stop to children lingering in foster care \nfor years. There are currently half a million children in this \ncountry--500,000 children in the United States of America--who have \nbeen removed from their abusive or neglectful parents and are living in \nfoster care. In my State, there are 1,500 of these children in foster \ncare. Nationally, each of these children in foster care will remain so \nfor an average of 3 years before a decision is made about their future, \nand many of them will wait much longer. The average is 3 years. Some \nhave stayed for years and years in foster care. Today, we are sending \nthose half a million children a message of hope. Under this \nlegislation, their time in foster care will be shortened. States will \nbe required to make a permanent plan for these children after a year, \nand if a child has been in foster care for more than 15 months--1 year \nand 3 months--the State will be required to take the first steps toward \nterminating parental rights and finding an adoptive home.\n  Terminating parental rights is the critical first step in moving \nchildren into permanent placements, but it is not enough. We also must \npromote adoption of these children, and our bill does that. Our bill \nremoves geographic barriers to adoption. There are no limitations under \nthis bill about children in one State having to be adopted in that \nState. We remove these geographic barriers to adoption and require \nStates to document efforts to move children into safe adoptive homes. \nWe also provide financial bonuses to States that increase their \nadoption rights. There is money here for States that increase the rate \nof adoption in their States.\n  There are legal and procedural barriers to adoption, and there are \nalso financial barriers. Lack of medical coverage is one such barrier \nto families who want to adopt special needs children. What is a special \nneeds child? It is a child who has medical problems or physical \nproblems, or a child of such an age, maybe 15 or 16, in a foster home. \nAdoptive parents are very reluctant to take on a child of that age. \nMany of these children have significant physical and mental health \nproblems due to years of abuse and neglect and foster care. Many of \nthese children have been shuttled from foster parent to foster parent. \nSo the adoptive parents are taking a huge financial risk in adopting \nthese children if the parents are not guaranteed that there will be \nhealth insurance for these special needs children. Our bill ensures \nthat special needs children who are going to be adopted will have \nmedical coverage. We also ensure that children whose adoptive parents \ndie or whose adoptions disrupt or terminate for some reason, they will \ncontinue to receive Federal subsidies when they are adopted by new \nparents.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of this legislation. The Senate and \nHouse sponsors have worked tirelessly for many months to come to an \nagreement. Our shared commitment to improving the lives of these \nchildren brought us together. In closing, I want to especially thank my \ngood friend, Senator Jay Rockefeller, who has spent years devoting his \ntime and attention to these children. I also thank Senator Craig, who \nbrought his own personal experiences and dedication to this effort, and \nSenator DeWine, who brought so much expertise and professional \nexperience to this initiative. I also want to thank the other members \nof the coalition, those Senators that I mentioned earlier, and I will \nrepeat their names--Senator Bond, Senator Coats, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Levin, Senator Kerrey, Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Moynihan, Senator Moseley-Braun, and Senator Johnson.\n  I also want to congratulate the House sponsors who worked so hard on \nthis--Congressman Camp and Congresswoman Kennelly.\n  I thank our staffs for the extraordinary efforts they devoted to \nachieving passage of this legislation. Particularly, I salute Laurie \nRubiner, of my staff, and Barbara Pryor, of Senator Rockefeller's \nstaff. All of these individuals that are mentioned, and others, have \nbeen so helpful in achieving passage of this legislation, which I think \nhas just now passed the House and will be coming here. We look for \nrapid action here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S12527]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

There is now 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is taking up \nthis afternoon H.R. 2159, the foreign operations, export financing and \nrelated programs for fiscal year 1998. As is the case every year, it \nwas not easy getting to this point partly because this bill is very \ndifferent than the bills we passed in the last several years.\n  First and foremost, we have increased our commitment to America's \nglobal leadership by nearly $1 billion. We have provided $12.8 billion \nfor the 1998 foreign assistance programs and an additional $359 million \nin arrears we have owed to multilateral institutions, bringing the \ngrand total to $13.1 billion, a shade under the administration's \nrequest.\n  Let me review the important contributions this bill will make to \nstability and security around the world.\n  First, Mr. President, we have substantially increased our commitment \nto the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union over last \nyear's levels; $770 million for the region has been provided, including \nearmarks of $225 million for Ukraine, $92.5 million for Georgia, and \n$87.5 million for Armenia. Funds for Georgia and Armenia, along with \nresources to assist the victims of the Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhaz \nconflicts are included within a new $250 million regional Caucasus \nfund. Congressman Callahan, my counterpart in the House, deserves \ncredit for the idea to create this fund, believing it would provide \nincentive to achieve a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n  In an effort to assure balance to our regional approach and promote \nAmerican energy security interests, we have ended the confusion over \nthe impact of section 907 and clearly authorized OPIC, Ex-Im, TDA, and \nthe Foreign Commercial Service support for American businesses \noperating in Azerbaijan and the Caspian.\n  I believe we have served our clear interest in securing stability and \neconomic growth in the New Independent States with these earmarks and \nthe overall level of funding for that area. I also think we have served \nboth our principles and security interests with two Senate provisions \nwhich were included in the conference report.\n  The first addresses the issue of Russian cooperation with Iran on its \nnuclear and ballistic missile program. I have repeatedly expressed my \ndisappointment with the administration's reluctance to leverage U.S. \nassistance to secure an end to this lethal cooperation. Let me remind \nmy colleagues that we have provided more than $4 billion in aid to \nRussia--more than any we have provided to any combination of other \ncountries.\n  For the past several years, the Senate has carried a provision \nsuspending aid unless the Russians stopped their training, technology \ntransfer and support for the Iranian nuclear program. Each year a \nwaiver has been added in conference because of a threat of veto and the \nPresident has in fact exercised the waiver. Each time he has done so \nthe Iranians have moved closer to acquiring and testing a ballistic \nmissile. This year, instead of a blanket waiver, the President will \nhave to prove the Russians have taken specific steps to curtail the \nnuclear cooperation. While it is not as tough as I would have liked, it \nis a vast improvement over the broad waiver we have given him in the \npast.\n  I also want to draw attention to the efforts of Senator Bennett and \nSenator Gordon Smith who worked hard to assure inclusion of a provision \nconditioning assistance on Russia's protection of religious freedom. \nThere is no freedom more fundamental than the right to worship in a \nchurch of one's choice. The legislation President Yeltsin signed into \nlaw appears to have a chilling effect on religious freedom, a problem \nwe have addressed by requiring the President to certify that the \ngovernment has not enforced or implemented laws which would \ndiscriminate against religious groups or religious communities.\n  Now, Mr. President, beyond the NIS, I think the bill clearly serves \nour national security interests in the Middle East by sustaining our \npast earmarks for Israel and Egypt and expanding and earmarking support \nto Jordan. At a time when the foreign aid request increased by nearly \n$1 billion, I was disappointed the administration only asked for $70 \nmillion for Jordan.\n  An increase was a very high priority for me, and I am pleased to \nreport the conference agreement provides $225 million in economic and \nsecurity assistance as recognition for King Hussein's contribution and \ndetermination to achieve a durable peace and regional stability.\n  Let me once again note my concern about Egypt's role in the peace \nprocess. For more than a decade, the bill has consistently stated that \nresources are provided as a measure of the recipient's commitment and \nsupport for peace. For the past 18 months, there is no question that \nCairo has not faithfully served that key interest. Just this week, Mr. \nPresident, Egyptian officials announced they would not send \nrepresentatives to an economic summit designed to restore relations and \nrebuild confidence. This is not an isolated example of problems in our \nrelations with Egypt. In particular, Cairo's international campaign to \nremove sanctions against Libya is inexcusable. I expect that the bill's \nprovision to withhold 5 percent of the aid to any country failing to \nenforce the sanctions may affect Egypt's assistance, notwithstanding \nthe earmark. Let me put everyone on notice that if this persists, once \nagain, next year as I did this year, I will not be including an earmark \nfor Egypt in the chairman's mark as we begin the process of developing \nthe appropriations bill for foreign operations for next year.\n  Turning to other areas, the bill also reflects the Senate's \ncommitment to strengthen our economic interests by increasing over the \nPresident's request our support for the Export-Import Bank. The Bank \nprovides crucial support to U.S. exporters, creating jobs and income. I \ndid not think the President's request was adequate to meet America's \ncommercial interests. Consistent with the Senate's decision, we provide \n$51 million more than the request for a total of $683 million.\n  This support comes with a word of caution for the board. I share my \ncolleagues' concerns about the substantial funding that has been made \navailable to Gazprom by the Bank, given Gazprom's announced plans to \ndevelop Iranian gas fields. The Bank must suspend support for Gazprom \nuntil the problem can be resolved. Complementing support for the Bank, \nwe have provided the full request and authorization language for OPIC \nand $41.5 million for the Trade Development Agency. Both are consistent \nwith Senate positions.\n  Mr. President, in Asia, important priorities were sustained in the \nconference report. The Senate's position increasing aid to supporters \nof democracy in Burma, restricting assistance to the Hun Sen Government \nin Cambodia, and funding for the Korean Energy Development Organization \nwas included. With regard to KEDO--that is the Korean Energy \nDevelopment Organization--the conference agreed to our effort to reduce \nthe costs of purchasing oil on the spot market by fully funding the \n1998 costs and providing $10 million in back debt if other donors \ncontribute sufficient funds to clear the balance.\n\n  After much negotiation and some modifications, we also preserved the\n\n[[Page S12528]]\n\nSenate's interests in conditioning aid to governments in the Balkans \nwhich refuse to cooperate in the extradition of war criminals. It is \nabsolutely clear that inclusion of tough provisions in the original \nchairman's mark produced immediate results in U.S. efforts to secure \ncooperation. I intend to closely watch the situation to assure the \nadministration continues to press for the transfer and prosecution of \nwar criminals. There will be no long-term peace or stability in Bosnia \nor, for that matter, in the region if we fail in this effort to bring \nabout a moral reconciliation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me mention the multilateral financial \ninstitutions. We have fully funded the International Development \nAssociation and met our commitments at the other regional banks and \nmade a substantial downpayment on clearing all outstanding arrears. \nSenator Domenici deserves recognition for establishing the guidelines \nallowing us to solve this vexing problem without compromising current \nprograms.\n  Unfortunately, in trying to resolve the matter of funding for family \nplanning, the administration chose to pay a very high price and agreed \nto abandon efforts to fund the IMF's New Arrangements for Borrowing. \nEvents in the Asian markets make clear the need for the NAB, a facility \nwhich would assure a multilateral effort to ease currency in economic \ncrises. I support this burdensharing institution and will continue to \nwork with the administration to find a vehicle to provide this vital \nline of credit.\n  I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Leahy, for his good advice \nand exceptional cooperation in achieving passage of this bill. He \nplayed a key role in assuring full funding for the multilateral \ninstitutions and the development assistance programs. In particular, he \ndeserves recognition for looking ahead to a major threat facing this \ncountry and successfully fighting to expand U.S. efforts to combat \ninfectious diseases. Senator Leahy is ably assisted in this effort by \nTim Reiser, who has been a patient and persistent staff director for \nthe minority.\n  I also wish to thank Chairman Stevens and his staff director, Steve \nCortese, for their active engagement and support at key points as we \nworked to secure passage. Senator Stevens is the model of a good \nchairman. He is always there with good ideas when you need him. Let me \nalso thank Jay Kimmitt for his invaluable assistance in putting \ntogether the bill and the report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Members be permitted to submit \nstatements prior to passage and that staff be able to make technical \ncorrections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further, Mr. President, let me thank my long-time \nforeign policy adviser, Robin Cleveland, who sits here to my right, for \nher invaluable assistance in developing this package and for her \ntenacity in sticking with it all the way to the end, which has been a \ntortuous path and difficult to predict from moment to moment over the \nlast month. Robin's done that with intelligence and good humor when \nthat was required and toughness when that was required. It is always a \npleasure to work with her. I have immensely enjoyed doing that over the \nlast 13 years. And to her right, Billy Piper, who also makes an \nimportant contribution to this debate every year. Billy has been a \npleasure to work with over the course of this legislation . And also \nRobin's assistant on the committee, Will Smith. I appreciate the \nimportant contribution that he has made.\n  Mr. President, with that, I see my friend and colleague is here, and \nI will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that we have finally \ncompleted action on the fiscal year 1998 foreign operations conference \nreport. I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their \nsupport throughout this process, and the chairman of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, for his leadership and \nbipartisanship. The Appropriations Committee is an extraordinary group \nof people who work together, Republicans and Democrats, like no other \ncommittee, and it is a privilege to be part of it.\n  The conference report that we are adopting as part of this package \ntoday is the product of a year's work and many sleepless nights. \nAlthough we finished our conference on all but two issues several weeks \nago, it would be an understatement to say that resolving those open \nissues, especially funding for international family planning, has not \nbeen easy.\n  There were times when I did not think we would get here. As I have \nsaid before, I long for the time when we set aside a day or two each \nyear to debate and vote on abortion--once, twice, 50 times if \nnecessary. It would consume that day or two, but it would be worth it. \nThen we would not have to revisit the issue time and time again, as we \ndo now for no apparent purpose, only to repeat what has already been \nsaid or voted on innumerable times before. It would save a great deal \nof time, it would give everyone ample opportunity to be counted, and we \ncould spend the rest of the year on other pressing business. I offer \nthat as a suggestion, for what it is worth.\n  The agreement we have reached on family planning is not everything \nthat I would like, but that is to be expected. An issue as divisive as \nthis is not going to be resolved in a way that anyone is happy about. \nThe agreement would freeze funding for these programs at last year's \nlevel, and limit disbursement to a rate of 8.34 percent per month over \nthe 1998 fiscal year. I would have far preferred the Senate funding \nlevel of $435 million, but the cut was part of the price of keeping \nMexico City language out of the bill and avoiding a veto.\n  The American people should also be aware that the pro-Mexico City \nfaction in the House exacted a heavy price on the administration for \nits refusal to accept the Mexico City language. The price was that the \nU.S. contribution to the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow, the \npreviously agreed upon down payment on U.S. arrears to the United \nNations, and the authorization for the State Department reorganization, \nare no longer included. Although these last two are not foreign \noperations matters, it is outrageous that they were linked to the \nfamily planning issue in the first place. There are sound foreign \npolicy reasons for paying our U.N. arrears especially when just \nyesterday we were petitioning the United Nations for support for \nsanctions against Iraq. This is the American people's loss, as much as \nit is the State Department's loss, and I find it incredible that the \nHouse leadership would permit this result. It is shortsighted, it is \nvindictive, and it severely undercuts U.S. leadership around the world. \nThere should be no mistake about who bears responsibility. We have a \nSecretary of State who is deeply respected and admired around the \nworld. She needs our support. It is tragic and inexplicable that \nbecause a few dozen House Members did not get their way on an unrelated \nissue, they have denied her the tools to do her job. I intend to do \nwhatever I can to see that this is corrected at the earliest possible \ndate next year.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope we can avoid repeating again next year the \ntortuous process that got us here. As long as President Clinton is in \nthe White House, the Mexico City policy is not going to become law. It \nis time that people in the House accepted that and saved us all the \nheadache of refighting this pointless battle.\n  Now that the conference report has been completed I want to take this \nopportunity to speak on a number of other provisions in it.\n  I am very pleased that we have fully funded our commitments, \nincluding arrearages, to the World Bank. I will have a separate \nstatement on that because I believe it so important that the World \nBank's management and the Treasury Department understand the importance \nwe give to U.S. leadership in the international financial institutions, \nand our intention that our influence be exerted to achieve significant \nreforms in a number of critical areas.\n  One of the provisions I am especially proud of in the conference \nreport is entitled ``Limitation on Assistance to Security Forces,'' \nwhich has also become known as the Leahy law. This provision expands on \ncurrent law, which seeks to ensure that U.S. assistance does not go to \nindividuals who abuse\n\n[[Page S12529]]\n\nhuman rights. I want to thank Congressman Gilman for his support for \nthis provision. Despite an initial misunderstanding about how the \ncurrent provision was being applied, I am convinced that he too wants \nto do everything possible to ensure that in our efforts to support \nforeign security forces that respect human rights, we also prevent \nthose who abuse human rights from receiving our assistance.\n  In order to implement this provision, the State Department has \nrequired recipients of our assistance to enter into end-use monitoring \nagreements, and to ensure that if there is credible evidence that a \nsecurity force unit that has received our assistance has abused human \nrights, effective measures are being taken to bring the responsible \nindividuals to justice. These agreements should be routine whether or \nnot the Leahy law were in effect. The kind of measures we expect a \nforeign government to take to bring those responsible to justice are \ndiscussed in the joint statement of the managers accompanying the \nconference report. We also make clear that we expect our own Government \nto do everything it can to assist in that effort.\n  Mr. President, before I leave this subject I want to mention that \nwhile we have seen a decrease in abuses by the Colombian Army, there \nhas been an alarming increase in atrocities attributed to paramilitary \nforces in that country. We have seen this pattern in other Latin \nAmerican countries where the armed forces, either actively or \npassively, supported the clandestine activities of paramilitary forces. \nI want it to be known that as the author of the Leahy law, I believe it \nis incumbent on the Colombian Army to demonstrate that it is not acting \nin collusion with the paramilitary groups, or standing by idly as they \ndo their dirty deeds.\n\n  Mr. President, to turn to another subject, the international \ncommunity rapidly responded with sanctions in the aftermath of the July \n1997 coup in Cambodia. According to reports, the suspension of foreign \nassistance, which constitutes nearly two-thirds of Cambodia's annual \nrevenue, sent a strong message to Hun Sen and his supporters.\n  The conference report prohibits most bilateral aid to the Cambodian \nGovernment and instructs United States executive directors of the \ninternational financial institutions to vote in opposition to loans to \nCambodia. The joint statement of the managers also expresses the hope \nthat Hun Sen's political opponents will be allowed to return to \nCambodia and safely participate in free and fair elections.\n  These measures and others like them have been instituted around the \nworld against the perpetrators of the coup. They are a necessary and \nimportant response to those who stand in the way of democracy. \nNevertheless, the sanctions directed against Hun Sen and his supporters \nhave also fallen heavily on the shoulders of the Cambodian people. \nTherefore, the conference report permits humanitarian, demining, and \nelectoral assistance to go forward. One item Congressman Callahan and I \nhad agreed upon but because of an oversight neglected to include in the \njoint statement of the managers, was a statement that the prohibition \non assistance to Cambodia is not intended to preclude basic education \nprograms as long as they are conducted at the local level and not \nthrough the central government. During the Khmer Rouge regime most of \nthe country's teachers were killed or forced into exile. A large \npercentage of the population is illiterate, and we want to continue \nbasic education activities as part of our effort to help the Cambodian \npeople overcome that tragic period.\n  Finally, I want to make clear that while we do permit electoral \nassistance, I would not support significant expenditures in this area \nunless Hun Sen is demonstrating his commitment to free and fair \nelections, to the prosecution of individuals implicated in the U.N. \nhuman rights investigation of the July 1997 coup, and then only if Hun \nSen has made an unequivocal statement that if defeated in a free and \nfair election he would relinquish power.\n  Mr. President, another initiative I am very proud of seeks to enhance \nU.S. leadership in the global effort to combat the spread of infectious \ndiseases, which also poses a direct threat to the health and welfare of \nAmericans. We include in the conference report sufficient funds to \nprovide an additional $50,000,000 for these activities. The Senate and \nHouse foreign operations reports, as well as the joint statement of the \nmanagers, describe the rationale for this initiative and the purposes \nfor which we are making these additional funds available. I also intend \nto solicit the recommendations of AID, the World Health Organization, \nthe Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health, and \nother agencies, organizations and distinguished individuals, regarding \nhow we can most effectively use these funds to buttress existing \nefforts in surveillance and control of infectious diseases.\n  The Leahy war victims fund has been assisting war victims in over a \ndozen countries since 1989. I am pleased that the joint statement of \nthe managers recommends up to $7,500,000 for these programs in fiscal \nyear 1998, a $2,500,000 increase over the current level. The fund has \nbeen primarily used to assist victims of landmine explosions, a problem \nthat has attracted increasing world attention, but it is also available \nto support other types of assistance to disabled war victims. This is \nconsistent with the President's September 17 announcement that the \nadministration intends to devote considerably more resources to \ndemining and to assist landmine victims.\n  Over the years, the Congress has passed numerous resolutions on the \nsituation in East Timor. Despite international pressure, the Indonesian \nGovernment has refused to withdraw its thousands of troops from the \nisland. The situation has remained tense since the 1990 Dili massacre, \nthe anniversary of which coincidentally was yesterday, and arbitrary \narrests and disappearances of East Timorese are common.\n  Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country and enjoys \nclose economic and security relations with the United States. I would \nlike to see that relationship flourish. But we cannot ignore what \nhappened this past June when supporters of democracy were arrested and \nkilled by Indonesian soldiers, and the main political opponent of the \nSuharto regime was forced to withdraw from the election, \nnotwithstanding that the election was rigged from the start. Nor can we \nignore the abuses in East Timor. I had the honor of meeting East \nTimorese Bishop Bello earlier this year, and I believe that while we \nshould encourage close relations with Indonesia, we should also do what \nwe can to ensure that we are not contributing to the problems in East \nTimor. For that reason, a provision I authored was included in the \nconference report which is designed to prevent United States lethal \nequipment or helicopters from being used in East Timor. This provision \nis intended to expand on the administration's current policy of not \nproviding small arms, crowd control items, or armored personnel \ncarriers to Indonesia. It is also consistent with actions taken \nrecently by the British Government.\n  There is a provision in the conference report which makes funds \navailable for reconstruction and remedial activities relating to the \nconsequences of conflicts within the Caucasus region. These funds, \nwhich will be made available through nongovernmental and international \norganizations, are very important. Contrary to what some have \nsuggested, we are not providing direct assistance to the authorities in \nthe conflict areas because we do not want to become embroiled in the \nissues of sovereignty and control that remain unresolved there. \nHowever, there are needy people in Nagorno Karabakh and Abkhazia who we \nwant to help recover from the ravages of war.\n  Mr. President, I want to mention a couple of other items. The Senate \nreport encourages AID to establish a program of physicians exchanges \nwith the countries of the former Soviet Union, with a focus on the \ndiseases that are major contributors to excess morbidity and mortality \nand where effective medical intervention is possible. I strongly \nsupport this idea and look forward to hearing AID's reactions.\n  Also in the Senate report we discuss the alarming incidence of \nviolence against women in Russia. The administration has taken some \nsteps in this area in response to congressional concerns, but I am \nconvinced that far\n\n[[Page S12530]]\n\nmore could be done to tap the experience and knowledge of U.S. police \nofficers and prosecutors who have developed procedures for dealing with \ndomestic violence here. We have requested the State Department, in \nconsultation with the Justice Department, to submit a report on future \nplans in this area and I strongly encourage them to pursue training \nprograms that bring U.S. and Russian police officers together, \npreferably in Russia, to address these issues.\n  Finally, the conference report requires the Department of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Department of State, to submit a report to the \nAppropriations Committees describing potential alternative technologies \nand tactics, and a plan for the development of such alternatives, to \nprotect antitank landmines from tampering in a manner consistent with \nthe Ottawa Treaty, which bans antipersonnel mines. This is very \nimportant because if we are ever going to join that treaty, as I \nbelieve we must, we need to solve this problem. I am convinced it can \nbe solved. Informed people in the Pentagon say it boils down to \npreventing tampering with antitank mines that are aerially delivered at \nremote distances, and then only for a period of 30 minutes which is the \ndifference in time it takes an enemy soldier to disarm or remove an \nanti-tank mine alone, and one that is protected with antipersonnel \nmines. Unfortunately, there is an institutional inertia at the Pentagon \nthat stands in the way of solving it. There is little inclination to do \nso absent an order from above. This report, which we expect to be \nobjective and thorough, is intended to set the stage for such an \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is among the better foreign operations \nbills to have passed the Congress in several years. I am disappointed \nthat the U.S. contribution to the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow fell \nvictim to the Mexico City issue, but I am confident that it will be \npassed on a supplemental appropriations bill next year. It does not \nscore against the budget, and in fact would reduce the burden on the \nU.S. Treasury in the event the U.S. is needed to help prevent harm to \nthe U.S. economy from an international financial crisis. Why the House \ndid not want that is beyond me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12527-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12530-S12533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE WORLD BANK\n\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 foreign operations conference \nreport contains full funding for the International Development \nAssociation [IDA], the concessional lending window of the World Bank. \nIt also fully funds our past commitments to IDA. With this \nappropriation we will be current, for the first time in several years, \nin our payments to IDA. This is an important milestone, and I \nappreciate the support of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, \nSenator McConnell, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomencici, and others, who also supported this funding, because it \nreaffirms U.S. leadership at the World Bank and our intention to exert \nthat leadership to promote significant reforms in the institution. As \none who played a role in obtaining this funding, I can say with \nconfidence that the Congress is sending two important messages by \napproving the conference report.\n  First, we recognize that in order to exert leadership in the \nmultilateral development banks we need to meet our financial \ncommitments. We have been in the ludicrous position of having an \nAmerican, Jim Wolfensohn, at the helm of the World Bank, but our \nrepresentative on the Board of Directors has been at the sidelines, \nunable to even vote on some loans. Why? The U.S. sank so far into \narrears to IDA--nearly $1 billion at one point--that some of our voting \nprivileges were revoked. Now, with the passage of this legislation we \nare paying off the last bit of arrearages, $235 million, plus our \ncurrent obligations.\n  Second, we are sending the message that we expect this investment to \nyield results. We are fortunate that World Bank President Wolfensohn is \na dynamic and reform-minded leader who is taking steps to shake up the \nbureaucracy, get rid of dead wood and demand high standards of \nperformance. His reform plan, the strategic compact, promises \ndevelopment results in 2 years. Frankly, I am concerned that despite \nhis best intentions, the Bank bureaucracy continues to put up fierce \nresistance and may in the end succeed in thwarting many of his reforms. \nThat is why this reaffirmation of U.S. leadership is so important.\n  Reform at the World Bank is moving forward, but there is a long way \nto go. Not all member countries have the same vision for change that we \nhave. I want to take this opportunity to briefly discuss what I believe \nthe Congress needs to see, at a minimum, from the Bank's reform efforts \nin order to continue to support the institution. We expect the Treasury \nDepartment and the U.S. Executive Director to work closely with the \nCongress to achieve these reforms.\n  One of the issues that has received increased attention in recent \nyears is the Bank's role in fostering good governance. I think this is \ncritical. While the Bank needs to avoid becoming embroiled in the \ndomestic politics of borrowing countries, when systems are corrupt and \non the take the Bank cannot look the other way. When governments are \nundemocratic, when they abuse human rights, the World Bank as a public \ninstitution must not collude. The Bank has made strides in attacking \ncorruption, but stronger action is needed. In addition, the Bank needs \nto ensure that it is not the handmaiden of borrowing governments that \ntrample on the needs and rights of people in the pursuit of economic \nprosperity.\n\n  A related issue, because of its importance to the quality of Bank \nlending and borrowing governments' responsibility to their people, is \nconsultation with local people. The Foreign Operations Conference \nReport calls on the Bank to systematically consult with local \ncommunities on the potential impact of loans as part of the normal \nlending process, and to expand the participation of affected peoples \nand nongovernmental organizations in decisions on the selection, design \nand implementation of projects and economic reform programs. This is \ncommon sense. It is also vitally important. Private corporations do not \nlaunch products or services without market surveys and the knowledge \nthat there is a demand for what they have to offer. Public \ninstitutions, like the World Bank, also need to know about the people \nthey are serving. This does not mean just interacting more with \naffected communities, it means letting them wield influence and \nresponding to their concerns.\n  The Bank has taken steps in this direction. It is decentralizing and \nhiring staff for its Resident Missions that are concerned with the \nwell-being of affected communities. We want to know whether the \nintended beneficiaries of Bank-financed projects want these projects \nand whether they have a say in designing them. Too often, local people \nare not involved in a project until the implementation stage, when it \nis too late to have a real influence. Efforts at headquarters and in \nthe regions need considerably more resources to work with borrowers to \nreach out to affected communities.\n  The Bank's loan portfolio has a low level of sustainable projects. \nStudies show that in recent years, only two-thirds have succeeded \nduring implementation. Only 44 percent have been sustained after \ncompletion. Social assessments are now performed on less than ten \npercent of projects, despite the fact that every project has a social \nimpact. We want the Bank to deliver on the promise of its strategic \ncompact to substantially increase this percentage in 2 years. Over and \nover again, the Bank's own studies show that projects with good social \nassessment seldom fail. And we do not want social assessments limited \nto projects in the social sectors. They are just as essential for \nlending for structural adjustment, financial sector reform, energy, and \nindustry as they are for education and health loans. In addition, we \nwant these assessments to address the needs of the most vulnerable \npeople. As we all know, powerful interest groups can represent \nthemselves.\n  It is not enough to do environmental impact assessments [EIA's] and \nsocial assessments. They need to be acted on. EIA's are often shelved \nand do not influence project design. That is a waste of money, it does \nenvironmental damage and betrays the people involved.\n\n[[Page S12531]]\n\n We would not want the Army Corps of Engineers to ignore these kinds of \nassessments, and the World Bank should not either.\n  The World Bank is a bank as well as a development institution. We \nunderstand the pressure to keep loan volumes at certain levels. We also \nunderstand that to be competitive, the Bank needs to serve its client \ngovernments in a timely and efficient way. However, some of the reform \nefforts are going overboard in this direction. Careful project \npreparation with quality checks should not be sacrificed on the altar \nof speed and efficiency. I know Mr. Wolfensohn shares our concerns \nabout this. The Bank needs to provide management with much stronger \nincentives to maintain quality in the face of pressures for volume and \nspeed.\n\n  For participation in Bank-supported lending operations to be \nmeaningful, people need information. In 1992, the Bank adopted an \ninformation disclosure policy, largely in response to pressure from \nCongress. It has made gradual progress in implementing that policy. \nMuch more needs to be done in terms of making the information available \nin borrowing countries in local languages, and providing information in \na timely way at early stages of lending operations. The Project \nInformation Document, which describes plans for operations, is often \nprovided late, incomplete, and only in English.\n  We want to see progress in providing the full text of Project Concept \nDocuments as well as draft copies of technical papers that assess \nfeasibility, and information from Country Assistance Strategies.\n  A Country Assistance Strategy is the Bank's master plan for lending \nto each borrower country, and it describes the Bank's framework for all \noperations and priority investments. More needs to be done to include \nsocial development analyses in the these documents. In addition, the \nbulk of their contents should be available to the public. Parliaments \nand citizens have a right to information about the Bank's lending \nplans. I recognize that some of the Country Assistance Strategy \ncontents are confidential, but the essentials certainly should not be. \nNonetheless, Bank management has opposed proposals to release these and \nother documents containing their projected lending plans. That is \nunacceptable.\n  We also need to see greater openness between the World Bank \nmanagement and the Board of Directors. During late 1996 and 1997, the \nBank conducted a substantial review of its portfolio. It reviewed 150 \nprojects in 14 sectors at a cost of $800,000. For reasons that I find \ninexplicable, some Board members have been unable to obtain these \nstudies.\n  We do not want our dollars contributing to bloated state \nbureaucracies and systems in which the private sector is crowded out by \nstate controls. On the other hand, there is obviously a role for \ngovernments, as the Bank's most recent World Development Report \ndescribes, and for public-private partnerships. The Bank is doing more \ntoday to promote such partnerships than it ever has. I welcome that.\n  But promoting the private sector must not come at the expense of \nnormal precautions about financial, technical, social and environmental \nrisks. Public inducements to investment, such as guarantees against \npolitical risks, must not distort the feasibility analyses of project \nviability. To insure that this does not happen, Mr. Wolfensohn has said \nhe wants to harmonize the World Bank Group's activities under one set \nof social and environmental policies. At the present time, there are \ndifferent standards in the World Bank Group. For instance, the \nInternational Finance Corp., the Bank's affiliate that deals with the \nprivate sector, has lower standards with respect to information \ndisclosure, protection of the environment and of the rights of \nindigenous peoples.\n\n  The answer is not to abolish or weaken sound policies and standards. \nIt is essential that harmonization not result in a retreat from current \npolicies to a lowest common denominator. I am concerned that Bank \nmanagement is under pressure to do that. Congress helped to create some \nof these global standards. They need to be respected and built upon by \nthe Bank Group, including the IFC and Multilateral Investment Guarantee \nAgency. There is language on the IFC in the Foreign Operations \nConference Report which aims to make progress in this area.\n  Currently, the World Bank stresses lending to countries which adopt \nsound macroeconomic policies. That makes sense, but the Bank should \nalso give priority in lending to governments which listen to their \npeople, involve them in development activities, and demonstrate a \ncommitment to reducing poverty.\n  The World Bank says its primary purpose is to reduce poverty, but it \nis falling short in building the political will among member \ngovernments to achieve this goal. The rift between rhetoric and reality \nremains wide. IDA resources must do more than reach poor countries. \nThey must reach and benefit poor and marginalized people in those \ncountries. In 1995, an evaluation showed that just 10 percent of World \nBank projects launched in the mid-1980's contained poverty reduction \ncomponents, and many of those fell short of thier goals.\n  Surveys of borrower country officials reveal a high level of \ndissatisfaction with the Bank's lack of focus on poverty and equity \nissues. Some are even unaware that the Bank's purpose is poverty \nreduction. The World Bank needs a far more systematic approach to these \nissues.\n  Each IDA loan or transaction should describe how it will reduce \npoverty. As I have consistently urged for years, World Bank investments \nin nutrition, health, education, and family planning should increase, \nas should programs which increase poor people's access to productive \nassets, such as land, water and credit. But according to information I \nhave received, World Bank figures for fiscal year 1997 show that \nlending for education and health, including nutrition, and AIDS \nprevention has fallen from roughly $4 billion in 1996 to $2.25 billion \nin 1997.\n  The Inspection Panel, which was established in part in response to \npressure from Congress, must be maintained and supported. The Panel \ninvestigates whether the Bank has violated its own policies. Its \ninvestigations have helped the Bank restructure or halt projects, such \nas dam construction, when they were poorly conceived or implemented. It \nis one of the few mechanisms that allows local people affected by Bank-\nsupported projects to identify problems and seek redress. I am \nconcerned that there are people among the Bank's management and its \nborrower governments who resent the Panel looking over their shoulders. \nThose individuals need to recognize that they are entrusted with public \nfunds, and are responsible for adhering to their own policies and \nguidelines. The World Bank needs to be a broker of many interests. Some \nborrower governments lack the mechanisms to insure that the interests \nof indigenous people affected by the construction of infrastructure, \nsuch as large dams, are represented.\n\n  Mr. President, there is one other issue I want to mention. It is the \nmistreatment of women employees at the Bank. Women have been subjected \nto gender discrimination, retaliation, abuse of power, and sexual \nharassment. It is a systemic problem. It has been virtually ignored. In \nfact, complaints brought by women who allege mistreatment by their \nmanagers have been aggressively fought by the Bank's lawyers. That is \nbad enough. Even worse is that the Bank, because it is an international \norganization, is immune from lawsuit in U.S. courts. The only recourse \nfor a person who alleges abuse is the Bank's internal grievance \nprocess, which, to put it bluntly, is a sham. The deck is stacked \nagainst the claimant. Investigations are cursory, at best. Requests to \ncall witnesses are denied. Rulings are based on hearsay, double \nhearsay, and innuendo. Even if a claimant who has left her job because \nof the abuse files a grievance and prevails, the remedy is limited to \nmonetary compensation. The process is patently unfair and the people \nwho investigate and adjudicate these cases have failed in their \nresponsibility. There is a culture at the Bank that discourages \nwitnesses to come forward for fear of retribution. It is nothing \nunusual. We have seen the same thing in the Armed Forces, in private \nindustry, in any bureaucracy, but that is no excuse.\n  I have tried to get Bank management to deal aggressively with this \nproblem. I get assurances that they are aware of the inadequacies in \nthe grievance process and are taking steps to remedy the\n\n[[Page S12532]]\n\nsituation. So far, I am not impressed. They are not treating this \nsituation with the seriousness it demands. They are too quick to shift \nthe blame to the victim for being ``too aggressive,'' ``not a good \nlistener,'' or ``in over her head,'' even when their own performarnce \nreview process is badly flawed. I intend to monitor this closely \nbecause radical change is urgently needed.\n  Mr. President, I have faith in Jim Wolfensohn to promote these \nreforms. I know he agrees that they are fundamental to the Bank's \nfuture, and of great importance to the Congress. They are especially \nimportant because the Bank is a pace setter for other international \ninstitutions. Ultimately, the success or failure of this effort will \ndetermine whether or not these institutions play the key role we need \nthem to play in advancing political, economic and social stability \naround the world. Real stability depends on development that gives \neveryone a chance for prosperity. That is the central purpose of these \nreforms, and I hope the Bank's management understands how serious this \nis to the Congress, especially to those in Congress who have fought the \nhardest to support these institutions.\n  Mr. President, I often say Senators are merely constitutional \nimpediments to their staffs. But we wouldn't be here if it were not for \nthe staff who worked so very hard. We are privileged by the quality of \nthe men and women who work with and for the U.S. Senate, on both sides \nof the aisle, and in so many of the other support positions that \nreflect neither party. So many times we debate these issues until late \nin the evening, agree on something, Members go home--staff stay until \n3, 4, 5 o'clock, or all night long, to get it done.\n  Robin Cleveland, Senator McConnell's chief of staff for foreign \npolicy, has done a superb job. I am delighted to see her on the floor \ntoday. I appreciate the way she has worked so cooperatively with my own \nstaff on this committee, and Will Smith and Billy Piper who have so \nably assisted her.\n  On this side, I have Tim Rieser, who is my chief of staff for foreign \npolicy matters. He has done an extraordinary job on the subcommittee \nand in working with Members on both sides of the aisle to try to \nachieve the compromises necessary. He has been ably assisted by Cara \nThanassi, who is also a Vermonter, as is Tim. She, too, even though new \nto the subcommittee, has already shown an excellent grasp of the issues \nhere and has proven very valuable. I also want to recognize Dick \nD'Amato, of the committee staff, and Jay Kimmitt, whom the chairman has \nalready mentioned. Both gave invaluable advice and support.\n\n\nfiscal year 1998 department of defense appropriations--federally funded \n                    research and development centers\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens concerning \nFederally Funded Research and Development Centers.\n  Is it the chairman's understanding that it was the intent of Congress \nto exempt Federally Funded Research and Development Centers [FFRDC's] \nfrom the provisions of section 8041 of the fiscal year 1998 Department \nof Defense Appropriations Act which reduce funding for advisory and \nassistant services by $300,000,000? This exemption is necessary because \nFFRDC funding is specifically reduced by $71,800,000 in section 8035 of \nthe same act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. While the \nDepartment of Defense chooses to group selected FFRDC's in the category \nof advisory and assistance services, the Congress has for several years \ndealt with these issues separately. FFRDC's should be exempt from the \nreduction in contractor advisory and assistance services.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I compliment the Senior Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell for \nthe excellent job they have done in shepherding the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill along it's difficult journey. While I would have \nwritten some sections differently, I believe that on balance this is a \nreasonable product of compromise that advances the primary goals of \nU.S. foreign policy.\n  I am, however, very disturbed to see that the compromise on U.N. \nfunding that was contained in the State Department authorization bill \nhas now been dropped. While I was not pleased with some aspects of the \nHelms-Biden compromise, at least it provided a way to start meeting our \nobligations to the United Nations.\n  I am disturbed, Mr. President, that greater thought has not been \ngiven by those who oppose this provision to the timing of this move. We \nare teetering on the brink of hostilities with Iraq over Saddam \nHussein's refusal to allow entry to American members of the U.N. \nweapons inspection team. The United Nations has insisted that the \nintegrity of its teams be respected and Saddam Hussein must not be \nallowed to pick and choose who he lets in. Last week, Secretary General \nKofi Annan sent a three-member delegation to Iraq to impress upon \nSaddam Hussein the necessity of complying with United Nations \nrequirements on access for inspectors. Unfortunately, they came away \nempty handed. But the United Nations Security Council continues to meet \ndaily in an effort to counteract Iraq's intransigence.\n  I think most of my colleagues realize that this would be a very \ninappropriate time to suddenly be forced to go it on our own. We may \ndecide at some point that unilateral action against Iraq is the most \nappropriate, but that should only come after careful consideration of \nall policy options available to us. And quite frankly, Mr. President, I \nbelieve that some of our best options involve working closely with our \nallies and our friends in the Arab world to present a united front to \nSaddam Hussein. With all its warts, the United Nations is still the \nbest mechanism for consulting quickly with all the parties involved and \nnegotiating possible courses of action. This is always a difficult \ntask, but it would be made many times more difficult if we were not \nable to work through the United Nations. While nothing in the \nlegislation before us today says we must pull out of the United \nNations, the refusal of a small number of members to let a broadly \nagreed-upon package of reforms and arrearage payments move forward is a \nde-facto renunciation of the United Nations just as we are again \nturning to that body for assistance in keeping one of the world's worst \nscofflaws in line.\n  Getting other nations to join us in these efforts takes carrots and \nnot just sticks. Our diplomats need to bring more to the table than the \nthreat of military retaliation. That should be our last resort, and not \nbefore. If we are not willing to put our money where our mouth is at \nthe United Nations, how can we expect Saddam to take our threats \nseriously?\n  I know that efforts are underway at this very moment to reverse this \nunfortunate decision by the House of Representatives. And I hope they \nsucceed. Not just today, but increasingly in the future, we are going \nto need more tools of diplomacy at our disposal, not fewer. I urge my \ncolleagues in the House to take this into account before it is too \nlate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make a couple final \nobservations. Seeing the occupant of the chair, the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming, I thought I would mention his imprint on this \nbill. Senator Enzi had an important provision requiring a report from \nthe administration on funding by all Federal agencies on the climate \nchange program. He required its submission by October 31, which is \nobviously past. The conference included the provision requiring a \nreport by November 15. I would say, for cold State Members, this is \nvery important so we can begin to understand how extensive these \nprograms are and what they are costing the taxpayers.\n  My thanks to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, the occupant of \nthe Chair, Senator Enzi, for his support and contribution to this bill \nas well.\n  Finally, let me say I understand Christian, the son of our staff \ndirector, Robin Cleveland, may be watching because he is sick today. \nChristian, I hope you get to feeling better. We are all sorry that you \nwere inconvenienced by your mother's long hours during the course of \nthe last few weeks.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are at a point now where this bill should \nmove forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the managers yield back the remaining time \non the conference report?\n\n[[Page S12533]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is the Senator from Vermont correct in \nunderstanding when all time is yielded back it is, indeed, passed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back time on this side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield whatever remaining time I may \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In light of yielding back the remaining time, \nunder the previous order the conference report is agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider that vote is laid upon the table.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12530-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my grave \ndisappointment in the statement that Sara Lister, the Army's Assistant \nSecretary for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, made in reference to the \nU.S. Marine Corps. We just finished Veterans Day, and November 10 is \ntraditionally the Marine Corps' birthday. So I guess her sense of \ntiming is unbelievable. But, basically, this is what the Assistant \nSecretary said: ``The Marines are extremists'' and ``wherever you have \nextremists, you've got some risks of total disconnection with \nsociety.''\n  For whatever I have done with my life personally, I attribute some of \nwhat I learned in the U.S. Marine Corps. I think the statement that she \nmade is grossly unjust, and is an affront to every person who has ever \nworn the uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps, or to any person who has \nworn any uniform of the Armed Forces of this country, and those who \nhave died for the very freedoms that we Americans, even Ms. Lister, \nenjoy today and every day.\n  Mr. President, back in 1955, we were taught that the code of the \ncorps is honor, courage, and commitment--honor in the defense of \nfreedom, courage in the face of adversity and commitment to the members \nof your unit but, more important, to those folks at home.\n  I am very proud to say that these principles have guided my life, and \nI hope that these would be the principles that our society could \nemulate, not values that should be considered ``disconnected'' with the \nnorm. I am wondering who is really disconnected here.\n  The corps has always presented to its new members a challenge for \nhigher standards and higher achievements. In its 222-year history, they \nare incomparable and, yes, they are the guiding light of all services \nand something of which every American can be proud.\n  I understand Ms. Lister has sent an apology to the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, General Krulak. That might be enough for him, but it is \nnot enough for me. She claims that she was quoted out of context. I \ndon't accept that either. No one service should be placed over another. \nNobody has a corner on bravery or valor or commitment to this country. \nBut you must remember that it was these men and women who fought and \ndied for the blessings of liberty for our Nation, and no one should \nforget that their words still reflect today.\n  So I am saying Secretary Lister should resign her post, because I \npersonally think that she is unfit to serve in a leadership position in \nthe military of this Nation. I am very sad about this day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12533-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GALLATIN EXCHANGE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we just introduced a placeholder in a bill \non the Gallatin exchange to preserve that option. It expires December \n31. It is a land exchange in the Gallatin National Forest. I support \nthat land exchange. I did not want to get into an adjournment situation \nand let the time run out and not have a placeholder, because I am \nconcerned about one area in particular, as is everybody. I heard the \nconcerns of my constituents in the Bridger Bang Tail area of the \nGallatin National Forest and in the Taylor Creek area. This area has to \nbe kept in the condition that it is now because it is probably the most \nimportant migration area for wildlife we have from Yellowstone Park \ninto Montana and out of Montana. This is a migration corridor that must \nbe protected.\n  We have an obligation to complete this land exchange. It is a good \nland exchange. It is the right thing to do for that particular part of \nour country, and I will support it. Of course, the delegation from \nMontana will get together and work out the details. But I wanted to put \nthat in there to make sure that our options are left open when Congress \ncomes back into session, because I feel very strongly about this area, \nabout the preservation of this area in the management of forests, \nespecially in very fragile areas and in areas that are very, very \nimportant to the migration of wildlife, in particular elk and deer.

Mr. President, as we prepare to complete this first \nsession of the 105th Congress, I want to take a moment to look back at \none of the great bipartisan accomplishments that we have made this \nyear, and also to look forward to some important work that still lies \nahead.\n  I am referring specifically to the work we have been able to do in \nputting advanced technology to work to improve education in the \ncountry.\n  Technology and better use of technology is critical in my home State \nof New Mexico. It is a big State. We have only a few concentrations of \npopulation and economic activity, and technology offers us a way to \nbring communities closer together and offers us a way to eliminate the \ngaps that separate the ``haves'' and the ``have-nots'' in our State and \nthroughout the country.\n  In more than half of American households with incomes of over \n$50,000, the children have access to a computer at home. But in my \nState the average family earns about $26,000, and in that income range \nthe estimate is that one in four children in those homes will have \naccess to a computer.\n  We need to do better in the public sector, Mr. President, in \nproviding technology in our schools so that we can use technology to \nnarrow the gap between the haves and have-nots, rather than to allow \nthat gap to increase.\n  In the past year, several magazines have published articles that have \nchallenged the idea that technology in schools can really improve \neducation. The Atlantic Monthly had a cover story called ``The Computer \nDelusion.'' There have been articles that consider computers in schools \nto be ``snake oil'' or ``the filmstrip of the 1990's,'' just to cite \nsome of the phrases used.\n  Those articles are one reason I was interested in several recent \nreports that have reviewed the hundreds of research studies on the \neffects of educational technology on student achievement. The \nEducational Testing Service [ETS] did a report. Also, there has been a \nstudy commissioned by the Software Publishers Association [SPA]. The \nresearch results are uneven, but there are solid peer-reviewed studies \nthat show significant improvement in\n\n[[Page S12534]]\n\nstudent performance and attitude in all age groups and all subject \nareas through better use of technology. Overall, technology-based \ninstruction is 30 percent more effective in improving student \nachievement than instruction that does not include the use of \ntechnology. This is the equivalent of about 3 months of additional \nlearning each year for our students.\n  The findings of these studies validate the Federal investment in \neducation technology that we have made. I introduced the Technology for \nEducation Act in 1994, and it became law later that year. But when it \ndid become law, I don't believe any of us could have predicted the \nprogress that could have been made in these 3 short years. Let me show \nyou some charts, Mr. President, to indicate the progress that has been \nmade.\n  This first chart, I think, makes the case very dramatically. It is a \nchart that demonstrates computer availability, that is, the students \nper computer, from the period 1983-84 through this just-completed \nschool year, 1996-97. You can see the dramatic improvement that has \noccurred. In 1983-84, there were 92 students per computer in our public \nschools in this country. In this last school year, there were seven \nstudents per computer. That is significant progress. Computers have \nbecome much more available to students than they ever were before.\n  Let me show another chart that is an indicator of the progress that \nhas been made. This is a chart that shows connections to the Internet. \nIt shows how those connections have continued to increase rapidly: 65 \npercent of schools are now connected to the Internet. That is this \ngreen line on the chart. It indicates 65 percent are now connected. \nOnly 14 percent of our classrooms are connected, but that number is \nalso increasing rapidly. Real progress is being made there as well.\n  This past summer, the Federal Communications Commission approved \nplans to implement the universal services fund that will provide \nschools and libraries with $2.25 billion in communications discounts \nnext year. Thanks to the leadership of Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, \nExon, and Kerrey, schools will have affordable access to the Internet \nover the coming years.\n  So looking at these very positive trends, one would think that \nstudents are using computers a lot more, but that is not really the \ncase, Mr. President. Let me show you one more chart that indicates the \nconcern I have.\n  This is a chart from a recent report by Education Week, a publication \nentitled ``Technology Counts.'' It shows that more than half of the \neighth grade math students never or hardly ever use computers in their \nclassrooms. Only 12 percent use computers almost every day. In my \nState, the numbers are even more startling. Two-thirds of the eighth \ngrade math students indicate that they hardly ever use computers; 11 \npercent in my State indicate that they use computers almost every day. \nThis chart is a graphic depiction of those statistics.\n  Another recent report by the CEO Forum, the Chief Executive Officers \nForum, supports this same finding. Only 3 percent of schools have fully \nintegrated technology into teaching.\n  This means that we're making progress in some places, but that some \nimportant barriers are stopping our progress in other schools.\n  This past weekend, the Congress passed the spending bill for the \nDepartment of Education, and I was privileged to be at the White House \nthis morning when President Clinton signed that bill. It contains \nsignificant increases for programs authorized by the bill that I \nintroduced back in 1994.\n  Let me show on this final chart that I have here this afternoon some \nof the increases that we have been able to accomplish in a bipartisan \nway this year.\n  In the technology literacy challenge fund--that is grant money that \ngoes to States and school districts to support better use of \ntechnology--in fiscal year 1997, we appropriated $200 million. In the \nbill signed by the President today that number goes to $425 million. So \nit is more than twice the amount of funding.\n  In the technology innovation challenge grants the figure for 1997 was \n$57 million. The figure for 1998 is $76 million.\n  This year, for the very first time, we have funds earmarked to go \nspecifically to train teachers to use technology more effectively. That \nis $30 million that was added in by the appropriators, and I think very \nwisely added. I think we have all begun to recognize that that is an \nitem that needs additional attention.\n  This last item is crucially important. We need a balanced investment \nin technology. Balanced investment in educational technology means more \nthan just buying the right hardware and software, it means investing in \nthe training of the teachers and the administrators to use the software \nand the hardware.\n  Experts say that we should invest 30 percent of our technology budget \nin training. Nationally, we are investing less than 10 percent in \ntraining today. In my State, the estimate is that we are investing less \nthan 5 percent of the funds that go into educational technology in the \ntraining of teachers to use that technology. Lack of teacher training \nwill be the biggest barrier that we have to progress in this area.\n  This problem is described in a report entitled ``Technology and the \nNew Professional Teacher: Preparing for the 21st Century Classroom.''\n  That is a report from the National Council for Accreditation of \nTeacher Education [NCATE]. They indicate that 2 million new teachers \nwill be hired in the next decade.\n  Here is a quote from that report. It says:\n\n       If teachers don't understand how to use technology \n     effectively to promote student learning, the billions of \n     dollars being invested in educational technology initiatives \n     will be wasted.\n\n  Colleges of education clearly need to change the way they train new \nteachers. And if today's teacher candidates are taught with technology, \nthen they will teach using technology themselves.\n  So that is why I introduced earlier in this Congress the Technology \nfor Teachers Act and worked for the $30 million appropriation that I \njust referred to. Clearly, Senators Harkin and Murray here in the \nSenate deserve great credit for their support and their advocacy on \nthese issues as well.\n  The appropriation will provide competitive grants to States and will \nsupport growth and dissemination of the most effective programs for \nteacher training in the use of technology.\n  This $30 million, as I see it, is a downpayment on what will need to \nbe a very long-term investment in tomorrow's teachers. And I intend to \nwork for, at least, a doubling of that in next year's budget. I think \nthat is clearly the direction we need to move in.\n  The Federal Government plays an important role in promoting the use \nof technology in education. But there are obviously other extremely \nimportant participants. The States and the school districts are \ndeveloping challenging new standards. University researchers are \ndiscovering diverse ways that people learn.\n  The role of the teacher is changing. The teacher is no longer going \nto be just a lecturer but rather a learning coach to the students. The \nsoftware industry is developing powerful new learning tools.\n  All of these efforts are pieces of a large and complex puzzle. \nWithout a national strategy for coordination of these efforts, and \nwithout reliable data on what works, we will never get all of the \npuzzle's pieces to fit together.\n  I am interested in what I read in a recent report from the \nPresident's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology [PCAST]. \nThat report stressed the need for more research as we introduce more \ntechnology into our schools. We need to study which approaches in this \narea are most effective, and we need to determine the best investment \nmixture among hardware, software, training, and other categories.\n  As we come to the end of this Congress, I ask my colleagues to join \nme next year as we build on the progress that has been made here, the \nvery substantial bipartisan progress. We need to take some new steps in \npromoting education technology. We need to continue our investment, of \ncourse, both in computers and in Internet connections. We need to \nincrease substantially the investment in teacher training. And we need \nto promote new investments in research on the effective use of \neducational technology.\n  The Federal Government can play a crucial role by promoting greater \ncoordination and collaboration among\n\n[[Page S12535]]\n\nthe private sector and university researchers and educators and State \nand local governments.\n  There are several ways to accomplish this. We can do so through a \nfederally funded research and development center, or a consortium of \nprivate firms, or a network of universities and schools and companies \nand agencies. The participants will have to make the final decision as \nto what mechanism works best.\n  The cost of this initiative, like the decisionmaking process, should \nnot be the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. The costs \nshould be shared by all the participants.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of the progress that we have made on \nproviding educational technology so it can be used to upgrade education \nin our schools. And I am very encouraged by the data that shows the \nfirst beneficial impacts in our schools, but we have a great deal left \nto do. The President and many here in Congress deserve credit for the \nprogress that has been made, but obviously their continued effort will \nbe needed in the future.\n  The private sector, universities, and educational agencies need to \nwork together to create a new culture of collaboration that will give \nteachers and their students the full benefit of these new technologies \nthat are being developed.\n  Mr. President, on a personal note, I also want to particularly \nacknowledge the excellent work that David Schindel has done as a fellow \nin my office throughout the year on this issue of educational \ntechnology, as well as several other issues. His accomplishments have \nbeen extremely useful to me and I think to the Senate. I appreciate his \ngood work.\n  Mr. President, with that I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12533-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12535-S12536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I come to the floor--in the waning hours of \nthis session--to express my continuing frustration with the way that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency is handling Wyoming's environmental \naudit law. The troubles began last September, when the EPA delayed \ngranting final approval of Wyoming's clean air permitting plan.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with the other Members of Wyoming's \ncongressional delegation in sending a letter to Administrator Carol \nBrowner at the EPA. We suggested that it was inappropriate to withhold \ndelegation of Clean Air Act permitting authority because of the State's \nenvironmental audit law. Administrator Browner responded with an \nassurance that,\n\n       EPA has not taken steps to withhold further delegations of \n     Federal programs in Wyoming as a result of the State \n     environmental audit law.\n\n  In September, the EPA announced that it had completed its review of \nWyoming's audit law. It found that,\n\n       The State won't need to make statutory changes to the self-\n     audit law to retain primacy over Federal laws like the Clean \n     Air Act.\n\n  The EPA went on to say that,\n\n       The law shouldn't interfere with the Wyoming Department of \n     Environmental Quality's efforts to gain primacy over several \n     other Federal programs.\n\n  Mr. President, in spite of Ms. Browner's assurances, there has been a \nvery real and ongoing manipulation of States that attempt to craft \nsensible audit laws. I trust that my colleagues from Colorado, Utah, \nMichigan, and Texas would be able to verify that activity. Their States \nhave all been coerced by the EPA into changing their audit laws.\n  On October 29, I introduced the State Environmental Audit Protection \nAct, which is S. 1332. This bill would provide a safe harbor from EPA's \ncoercive actions for States that adopt reasonable audit laws. The next \nday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held a very good \nhearing on the issue. We listened to an excellent panel of witnesses on \nboth sides of the issue. Both myself, and Senator Hutchison of Texas--\nwho has also introduced legislation to resolve this problem--testified \non the need for Federal legislation.\n  I was interested to read in the paper on October 30, the day after \nthe hearing, that the EPA is now requiring Wyoming to change its law. \nThe EPA has submitted legislation to a special session of the Wyoming \nlegislature. On Monday, a joint committee in Cheyenne heard preliminary \ntestimony on the revisions. The proposal would strike at least 50 \npercent of Wyoming's law regarding discovery of evidence in criminal \nproceedings.\n  A State environmental audit law is designed to help clean up the \nenvironment. In Wyoming, we created our State law to provide incentives \nfor good faith efforts. We thoroughly debated this issue in the Wyoming \nState legislature. We consulted with the State Department of \nEnvironmental Quality and different stakeholder groups. We wanted to \nprovide a mechanism that would encourage people to make an extra \neffort--an extra effort--to clean up the environment in their \ncommunities. We debated it in a Democratic forum and we passed a \nconsensus bill. And we passed it by more than a two-thirds vote in each \nbody.\n  Our State law allows an entity to hire an auditor to review their \noperations. The entity might be a town that is trying to examine its \nstorm drainage system. It might be a hospital that wants to review its \nair emissions. It might be a college or school district whose \nvocational education department uses solvents. It might be a company \nthat maintains a construction yard, or a garage. These are all entities \nthat may be affecting their environment without even knowing the \nconsequences of their operations.\n  Some of them are on regular inspection schedules, but the majority of \nthem will never be inspected.\n  How many of those entities would know, with 100 percent certainty, \nthat they are in full compliance with all applicable State and Federal \nlaws? How many of them think they are in compliance? How many of them \ndon't know? How many inspectors are out there randomly checking these \nfacilities?\n  These are questions I cannot answer. In fact, I asked a similar \nquestion to the Environmental Protection Agency in Senator Chafee's \ncommittee hearing. There was a general notion of how many EPA \ninspectors were employed, but they did not know how many total \ninspectors are out there. Furthermore, they could not say what \npercentage of regulated entities were on an actual inspection schedule.\n  There is one simple question here that I can answer. That is, how \nmany of those regulated entities would ask an EPA inspector to come \naround and take a look? How many of them would trust the EPA to offer \nfriendly advice.\n  The answer to these questions, my friends, is zero. People don't \ntrust the EPA any more than they trust the IRS.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, most of these entities are afraid of the \nEPA. Most of them are unaware that their operations could land them in \nFederal court. They are unfamiliar with the regulations and they are \nafraid to find out if they are in compliance. They are afraid because \nif they search for problems and find them, they may be fined and even \nsued. And if they are sued, their own review has given regulators a \nroadmap for prosecution.\n  No small business is going to spend money to hire an auditor to \ncollect evidence for regulators to use against the small business. And \nI do not believe more heavy handed enforcement is the answer. We, as \nlegislators, should be able to encourage entities to look for problems. \nWe can designlegislation that protects good faith efforts, without \nsacrificing traditional enforcement. We can design legislation that \npromotes cooperation toward a cleaner environment.\n  The EPA and the Department of Justice rely heavily on enforcement as \na deterrent. But in spite of Vice President Gore's reinventing \nGovernment proposals--and in spite of President Clinton's commitment to \nrevinventing regulations--neither the EPA nor the\n\n[[Page S12536]]\n\nDepartment of Justice have supported any statutory compliance \nassistance programs. Their command and control methods remain firmly \nensconced--not just in rhetoric, but in practice.\n  I agree that strong enforcement is necessary as a deterrent against \nenvironmental violations. I have never suggested that we should \nhamstring our regulators. We can, however, look at audit laws as a \npositive and reasonable way to supplement strong enforcement. When the \ngoal is a cleaner, healthier environment, we should not be afraid to be \ninnovative. We can do it in a reasonable and thoughtful way. We can \nagree not to penalize good behavior.\n  The EPA and the Department of Justice have shown a complete \nunwillingness, however, to cooperate. They have repeatedly argued \nagainst State and Federal audit laws. They maintain that such laws are \nunnecessary and dangerous. They describe numerous imaginative scenarios \nwhere laws could be abused. When asked for constructive suggestions, \nhowever, they choose instead to mischaracterize audit laws, implying \nthat there is no middle ground. In the rhetorical attacks on audit \nlaws, the EPA and Department of Justice always start by constructing \ntheir own premises--not those of the actual law--so the most frightful \nconclusions can be drawn to support their position.\n  I point this out because the term ``secrecy'' has been the most \nrecurrent fallacy dragged across this debate. It was used to excess in \nthe recent Environment and Public Works Committee hearing. The EPA \nmaintains the danger of secrecy by suggesting that audit laws will \nshield evidence of wrongdoing and impede public access to information.\n  Nobody in this body has been talking about creating an audit law to \nallow secrecy or fraud. These are things the EPA argues against. They \nare things I have argued against. Under a well-crafted audit law, this \nkind of abuse can be easily avoided.\n  First, the EPA claims companies will conduct audits to hide evidence. \nI want to expose the holes in that argument. An audit report can only \ninclude information gathered during a specific time period and \naccording to a defined audit procedure. Because privilege is not \nextended to cover fraud or criminal activity, it cannot reach back to \ncover prior malfeasance.\n  For example, in Wyoming, before a company conducts an audit pursuant \nto our State law, they must tell the regulators they plan to conduct an \naudit. Only information that is gathered after that date, and as a part \nof the audit, can fall under the audit protections. An audit report \ncannot include information that is otherwise required to be disclosed, \nsuch as emissions monitoring. It can only include information that is \nvoluntarily disclosed.\n  How does the privilege work in practice? First, if nothing is \ndiscovered and nothing is disclosed, the report may not be privileged. \nIf the company does find a deficiency during the audit, then it must \nreport the problem and clean it up with due diligence. If these \nconditions are not met, then it cannot assert privilege to the \ninformation related to the deficiency. The privileged information is \nnever secret because the deficiency must be disclosed.\n  Remember, the company must report the deficiency and clean it up to \nassert privilege. The public can view the disclosure form. They can \nknow about the problem and they can make sure it is cleaned up. As long \nas these conditions for privilege are met, the report may not be \nadmitted as evidence in a civil or administrative action. The end \nresult of this is a cleaner environment--not secrecy--as the EPA \nsuggests.\n  One only has to think logically to expose the flaws in EPA's \narguments about secrecy. If a company says they are going to conduct an \naudit, then they must find violations, disclose them, and clean them up \nto get any benefit from the law. If they don't disclose anything, they \ngain no protections from an audit law. A company would not spend money \nto conduct an audit and then keep the violations secret. If they did \nso, they would face criminal liability for knowingly violating the law.\n  I ask my colleagues, if a company conducts an audit, discloses its \nviolations, and cleans them up, what have we lost? Haven't we improved \nenvironmental quality? That is the goal of our environmental laws. That \nis the point of compliance assistance.\n  The EPA and Department of Justice maintain that audit laws run \ncounter to our common interest in encouraging the kind of openness that \nbuilds trust between regulating agencies, the regulated community, and \nthe public.\n  Mr. President, litigation does not build trust. Using voluntarily \ngathered information to prosecute good actors does not build trust. \nEnforcement depends on intimidation to act as a powerful deterrent. But \nit does not build trust.\n  Reasonable audit laws will promote cooperation between regulated \nentities and their regulators. We should ensure that people who act in \ngood faith and who go the extra mile don't face stricter enforcement \nthan those companies that do nothing. Audit laws do build trust.\n  Most importantly, they will result in a cleaner and healthier \nenvironment.\n  I look forward to working on this issue when the Senate reconvenes \nnext year. It has been a broad bipartisan issue in the States and I \nknow it can be a broad bipartisan solution here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask if it is appropriate that I be \nallowed to address the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is more than appropriate. The Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized to speak in morning business for up to 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12535-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12536-S12538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BOSNIA AND IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, a short while ago, the Senate adopted \nthe foreign operations bill. Last week, the Senate adopted the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. Previous to that, we adopted \nthe Defense appropriations bill for the coming year--all of those aimed \nat keeping America both strong and involved in the world.\n  There is no small measure of common sense and reason for us to do \nthat. Mr. President, all we have to do is follow the news of the day to \nsee how much our own leadership in the world is depended upon by other \npeople and how critical that leadership is to the peace and stability \nof the world. This is, apparently, the last day in which the people's \nforum, the Senate Chamber, will be open for public discussion, \nparticularly in morning business, which is such an extraordinary and, I \nthink, constructive forum for public debate.\n  I want to address my colleagues on two matters that may well be acted \nupon, or decided partially at least, in the time after we leave this \nfirst session of the 105th Congress and before we come back in January. \nThose are events abroad relating to, first, Bosnia and then to Iraq.\n  Mr. President, if I may speak briefly about the situation in Bosnia. \nAs the record is clear here, acts of aggression were occurring, acts of \ngenocide, slaughter, unseen in Europe since the end of the Second World \nWar which, in this case, was being portrayed on our television screens \nevery night, bringing understandable agitation and demands for action. \nUltimately, particularly after the fall of Srebrenica and the slaughter \nthat occurred there, the President led the NATO forces to decisive \nairstrikes, which led to the Dayton conference, which led to the Dayton \npeace accords and to the cessation of hostilities on the ground in \nBosnia and the beginning of a civilian reconstruction of that war-torn \ncountry, based on the Dayton agreements, based on a goal of trying, \nover a period of time, to reconstruct a multiethnic country there in \nBosnia, on the premise that partition into ethnic conclaves was \ninherently unstable because one group would inevitably strike another \ngroup. If one looks at this glass, there is still plenty of empty room \nin it. It is also a glass that, thanks to the\n\n[[Page S12537]]\n\nallied effort, an effort that encompasses in this case Russia as well, \nnot only has the slaughtering stopped and have troops been disengaged, \nbut there is substantial progress being made on the road to civilian \nreconstruction.\n  I have felt all along, Mr. President, that we made a mistake in \nsetting deadlines for the presence of American personnel as part of, \nfirst, the IFOR and then the SFOR--Implementation Force and then the \nStabilization Force--in Bosnia. I understand that the deadline was \nprobably attached as a way to garner sufficient support for the \nAmerican involvement. But, in my opinion, respectfully, it was a \nmistake. Better to have set out goals for our participation in Bosnia \nand when those goals were reached to withdraw, than to establish the \nexpectation, both in this Chamber and more broadly among the public, \nthat we were going to pull out by a date certain, only to have to come \nback and say, no, no, no, that is not what we meant, and then imposing \nanother deadline.\n  It is clear from statements that are coming from the President, the \nSecretary of State, others in the administration of our country, and \nour allies in Europe, that there is a strong inclination to keep \nAmerican troops on the ground in Bosnia as part of a follow-on force \nafter the previously, and I think mistakenly, set deadline of June 30, \n1998. I support that inclination. I hope it is a fact, because I think \nif we pull out now--we Americans--the Europeans will follow suit, and \nwhat is likely to take place at this stage is a slide back downward \ninto the pit of separation and of conflict.\n  I do hope that, in extending our presence there, we are mindful of \ntwo factors. One is to not repeat the mistake of again setting an \nartificially explicit deadline. If we are going to stay there, let's \ntry to define the goals most comfortably related to the Dayton process, \nthe Dayton agreement, and see if we can express more generally what \nthose goals are, and when we achieve them, be ready to pull out.\n  Some have said--and it may be a good beginning point--that we can and \nshould leave, we should not be there for a long time, we certainly \nshould not be there forever. We can and should leave when the Dayton \npeace process appears to be self-sustaining. That is not a bad goal. So \nI hope, one, we don't repeat the mistake of setting an artificial and \nmisleading deadline.\n  Second, if we decide to keep American troops as part of the follow-on \npeacekeeping force in Bosnia as a way of guaranteeing that the conflict \ndoes not erupt there again, that we don't threaten stability in Europe, \nthat we don't run the risk of a wider war throughout the Balkans and \nbeyond. If we decide to keep American troops there, I hope we will \nleave it to the professional soldiers, to the Pentagon, to the \nSecretary of Defense, advised by our military on the ground in Bosnia, \nby the chiefs of the services involved here in the Pentagon, as to how \nmany American troops we want to leave there. There has been some \nindication, some comment, that it would be a good idea to reduce the \nnumber of American personnel there as a way of showing that we continue \nto be on the way out. The fact is that we started out with almost \n30,000; we are down to about 8,500 American personnel.\n\n  The point I want to make is this: The administration should not feel \npressured, as a way to build more support here or among the American \npeople for our continued presence in Bosnia, to reduce the number of \nAmerican soldiers that are there, unless that is what the generals in \ncharge and the Secretary of Defense advise and request. We are getting \ndown to a relatively small number of Americans there. We have an \nobligation to each and every one of them to make sure that we keep a \ncritical mass present on the ground so that, in case of trouble, in \ncase of conflict, in case of the eruption of hostilities, we have \nenough people and resources there so that we can minimize the risk of \nany damage to our personnel.\n  This is an occasion like the next one I want to speak of, where, \nthough there is disagreement here among Members of the Senate and the \nother body and the American people about whether or not and under what \ncircumstances or not American personnel should remain in Bosnia, this \nSenator is convinced that if the President as Commander in Chief states \nthe case, and particularly one which is strongly backed up, as to the \nnumber of American personnel there by our military, the majority of the \nCongress across party lines will support the President in that \nleadership.\n  Second, Mr. President, is the question of Iraq--once again, very much \non our minds and, once again, threatening stability under Saddam \nHussein in the Middle East, an area of vital interest to the United \nStates, morally, militarily and economically. This is a crisis that is \ntotally the work of one man--Saddam Hussein. An agreement made to end \nthe gulf war, in which we were the dominant power, with our allies \ninvolved an agreement by Iraq to have international inspection teams \nconstantly there to make sure that Saddam Hussein and his government \nwere not concealing or constructing weapons of mass destruction--\nballistic missiles--done not in a punitive way, but because the record \nmakes clear who Saddam Hussein is and what he is prepared to do. In the \ntime he has been the leader of Iraq--I believe I have this number \nright--he has carried out five invasions of neighboring countries. When \nhe has had capacity to wage warfare with gas, a relatively rudimentary \nform of chemical warfare, he has done so. He has used gas against his \nown people in Iraq to suppress an uprising. He used it against the \nIranians in the Iraq-Iran war during the 1980's. There is some evidence \nto believe that he would have armed his personnel in the gulf war with \nchemical weapons that might have been used against American personnel \nwere it not for his fear that we might retaliate with nuclear weapons.\n  So we know the ambitions of this leader, we know his willingness, \nbeyond the formal considerations of devastation to humans, to use every \nweapon in his control to achieve a wider hegemony over the Middle East \nand particularly over the oil resources there that we continue to \ndepend on.\n  As I said before, this crisis is one that is totally of his making--\nby forbidding Americans from being part of this international \ninspection team, by threatening now to evict, to eject, to push out of \nIraq that small number of Americans that are part of that inspection \nteam. And while the threat posed at the current moment is not as \nvisually frightening and destabilizing as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait \nin 1990, its consequences, the consequences of U.N. inspections \nstopping and the Iraqis developing and broadening their capacity at \nspecial warfare, at warfare with weapons of mass destruction and the \nballistic missile capacity to deliver them to distant targets, is every \nbit as consequential and profoundly disruptive of stability in the \nMiddle East and profoundly threatening to the vital interests of the \nUnited States, and we have little choice but to respond.\n  The threat may be at least as fundamental and destabilizing as the \nIraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But the challenge to leadership \ninternationally will be to marshal the same kind of international \ncoalition against the possibility of Iraqi aggression that was \nmarshaled in 1990 and 1991.\n  Part of the problem is that time has passed and people's taste for \nconflict is reduced. People in some sense have to be reminded of what \nis on the line. Part of the problem is that some of those nations that \nstood by our side and fought with us in the Gulf war may have short \nmemories and be drawn more by economic interests in doing business with \nIraq than a realistic appreciation of the consequences of allowing \nSaddam Hussein to develop chemical weapons of mass destruction and \nballistic missiles to deliver them. It won't be easy for those in the \nalliance--the international alliance--who understand the seriousness of \nthis threat from Iraq under Saddam Hussein to marshal as broad an \ninternational coalition to respond. But it is most certainly a worthy \neffort and in our national interest.\n  If we cannot by inspection guarantee that Saddam Hussein is not \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile \ncapacity to deliver them against our troops on land and sea in the \nregion to our allies in the Arab world and in Israel, then we must \nconsider doing so by intervention--if not by inspection, then by \nintervention. Because history tells us--and it is fresh history--that \nwhatever capacity\n\n[[Page S12538]]\n\nfor war making Saddam Hussein develops and possesses, he will use. And \nthat is why it is so critical to deny him that capacity.\n  The specific course that President Clinton and some of those of our \nallies who seem more likely to stand with us--such as the British, \nprobably the Turkish, others, hopefully in the moderate nations of the \nArab world--the specific course that President Clinton as Commander in \nChief chooses to take is, of course, respectfully his judgment. But I \nhope in the fateful days that are ahead when this Congress is out of \nsession and these decisions will probably have to be made that the \nPresident appreciates what I sense as I talk to colleagues here in the \nSenate, that there is a broad bipartisan understanding of the \nseriousness of the challenge that Saddam Hussein has cleverly and \ndiabolically set before us; and that there will be broad bipartisan \nsupport for an effective response as determined by the President of the \nUnited States, hopefully in joint action with a large number of our \nallies.\n  So, Mr. President, this has been a long session--a session of \nextraordinary accomplishments, certainly on the balanced budget, and \nsome disappointment, of course, as always is the case in other areas.\n  But, as we depart, we leave some immense decisions to be made by the \nPresident and the administration. And I hope that they will be made in \nthe spirit that this Congress across party lines will support the \nCommander in Chief when he chooses to lead, and that across party lines \nwe understand that partisanship, though it may occasionally rear its \nhead too often perhaps here in Congress, certainly does end at the \nNation's coasts when our security and our values are threatened \nthroughout the world.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, almost 10 years ago I had an \nopportunity in visiting Baghdad to meet with Saddam Hussein and members \nof his cabinet.\n  I went to Iraq because of a brutal and seemingly endless conflict \nbetween the armies of Iran and Iraq that were consuming hundreds of \nthousands of lives. Like many people in our Government, I was concerned \nabout how this would impact the region, and whether, indeed, it \nthreatened world peace. I left Baghdad with unmistakable impressions of \nSaddam Hussein who continued to influence my own judgment, and which I \nrevisit now--that we are on the verge of yet another conflict with the \narmy of Iraq.\n  President Hussein knew little of the Western World, and profoundly \nmisunderstood the United States. Because we are a good and a decent \npeople willing to engage in dialog, it was interpreted as a lack of \nresolve; a failure of will.\n  It was for these reasons when President Bush sent American forces to \nthe Persian Gulf that I was proud as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives to be the Democratic sponsor of the war resolution.\n  In the years since American men and women triumphed in the Persian \nGulf war to uphold the will of the United Nations and serve the best \ntraditions of our country, the Saddam Hussein that I met on that day \nhas not only not changed; he remarkably seems to have learned very \nlittle.\n  His rape and pillage of Kuwait is now known to have included not \nsimply combatants but thousands of innocent Kuwaiti citizens. Six years \nafter his retreat from Kuwait he continues to hold 620 unaccounted for \nKuwaiti civilians. Upon his retreat he torched the land with oil fires \nand sullied the water, creating the largest oilspill and oil fires in \nhistory.\n  In 1988, he employed mustard gas against his own people killing more \nthan 5,000 Kurds.\n  The Saddam Hussein that America met in the Persian Gulf war was not \nan isolated departure from good judgment. It was part of a long record \nof brutality against his own people and his neighbors.\n  Today we are on the verge of yet another conflict with Saddam \nHussein, because not only is there a long tradition of such \nirresponsible international behavior but because nothing seemingly has \nchanged.\n  In 1992, he violated the terms of the gulf war cease-fire by moving \nantiaircraft missiles into northern and southern Iraq. The world \nresponded. The coalition held. And more than 100 United States, \nBritish, and French planes fired on missile stations.\n  A year later--in 1993--still not having learned the price of his \nmisjudgements, Saddam Hussein ordered an attempt on the life of former \nPresident George Bush. President Bush was visiting Kuwait. Not only was \nSaddam Hussein not humbled in the face of the victor; he planned an \nassassination leading to an American military response against his \nintelligence headquarters.\n  In 1994, he sent battalions of Iraqis 20 miles north of the Kuwaiti \nborder. Again, the United States needed to respond and 40,000 troops \nwere again sent to the Persian Gulf.\n  And, last year, despite a willingness by the United Nations to begin \neasing sanctions in order to ease the pain on the Iraqi people in a \nfood for oil program that was instituted, Saddam Hussein responded by \nmilitary attack against the Kurds in the town of Erbil needing a \nresponse with the oil for food program.\n  There are few comparisons in contemporary history of any leader in \nany government that has so routinely miscalculated at the disadvantage \nof his government and himself.\n  The Saddam Hussein that I met a decade ago may not have understood \nmuch about the world, or his place in it, the relative power of his \ncountry as opposed to potential adversaries, the use of technology, his \nmeasure of international will--his misunderstanding of the United \nStates may have been legendary--but it is almost unbelievable that with \nthese annual confrontations, this extraordinary record of \nmiscalculations, that virtually nothing seems to have been learned.\n  What more is necessary to be understood about the resolve of the \nUnited States? This Government is clearly prepared to pay the price to \nmaintain the peace in the Middle East. This country has a deep \ndetermination to deny Saddam Hussein every and all classes of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  The United States will provide leadership for international response \nwhen necessary, but clearly is both capable and willing to act \nunilaterally if required.\n  What is it, Saddam Hussein, that you do not understand about the \nworld resolve? And what is it about us that could still be unclear?\n  Last month, this long and extraordinary record of miscalculation \nadded yet another chapter. Saddam Hussein barred access to U.N. weapons \ninspectors under the pretext that they included American citizens. He \nchallenged the right of the United States to be a part of the \ninspection teams of the United Nations, and asked rhetorically by what \nright we would be present.\n  Saddam Hussein, it comes to mind that the United States has about \n500,000 reasons why we have a right to participate and will demand full \ncompliance--a reason for every man and woman that left family, friends \nand home to put their lives on the line in the Persian Gulf war to end \nyour occupation of Kuwait. And those 500,000 reasons have not yet run \ntheir course. They will stand for a long time.\n  The record since the United Nations began the inspections to ensure \ncompliance with its resolutions has not been without success.\n  Since 1991, U.N. inspectors have found and destroyed more illegal \nweapons in Iraq than were destroyed during\n\n[[Page S12539]]\n\nthe entire Persian Gulf war. Surveillance cameras to monitor weapons \nactivities were installed. This is a regime imposed by the United \nNations of weapons inspection that has and can yield real results. But, \nas we now stand on the verge of yet another military confrontation, it \nis necessary to face the unmistakable and painful truth that there is \nno reason to believe that anything has changed in Baghdad.\n  This week, the Washington Times revealed that Saddam Hussein has been \nintending to buy five electronic warfare systems that would allow him \nto detect and destroy radar-evading aircraft.\n  The weapons markets of the world have routinely been contacted by \nIraqi agents and representatives still seeking military technology.\n  This is important lest we fail to understand that the strategy of \nfrustrating U.N. inspectors and noncompliance is not happening in a \nvacuum. It is part of an ongoing strategy to restore military \ncapability.\n  The lessons of the Persian Gulf war and our experience through our \nsacrifices have yielded more than simply the destruction of these \nweapons. There is another great lesson that the Persian Gulf war has \nleft the United States, the United Nations and the international \ncommunity. It is, first, that the international community is capable of \nacting in concert for common purpose, but it is also that there is by \ndefinition a class of nations with leaders who are easily identifiable \nwho are so irresponsible by their actions, who act in such contempt of \ninternational normal standards of conduct and international law that \nthe international community will take it upon itself to deny them \naspects of their own sovereignty.\n  Of all the things that Saddam Hussein failed to learn about us and \nour resolve and our capability or the international community's ability \nto act in concert it is the single lesson that is the foundation of the \ncurrent crisis. Saddam Hussein will not be allowed to have weapons of \nmass destruction or wage war on his own people or regain great military \ncapability because as a consequence of the Persian Gulf war and the \ninvasion of Kuwait, the international community has decided to deny him \nthat sovereign right of other nations to possess certain weapons and \nconduct their own affairs today, tomorrow and potentially forever.\n  It is not only a lesson of the Persian Gulf war; it is a gift of this \ngeneration to succeeding generations that something has been learned by \nthe history of the 20th century. And the primary pupil of this lesson \nwill be Saddam Hussein, in life or in death, today or tomorrow, one way \nor another.\n  I know every Member of this Senate, indeed, the entire U.S. \nGovernment, is in prayerful hope that military confrontation is \navoided. In an age when military weapons hold such power and the \ndestructive capability is so great, conflict must always be avoided \nwhen possible. That is our nature. It speaks well of our people that \nthis is our resolve.\n  Saddam Hussein, with so many miscalculations, so many mistakes that \ncaused so much harm for your people, do not miscalculate again.\n  There is in this Senate, I know, nothing but affection for the people \nof Iraq, an abiding hope that there will be a day when not only we can \nmeet them again in friendship but the Members of this Senate may vote \nto send an ambassador of good intention and good will to Baghdad to \nnormalize relations. Between this day and that is either the learning \nof a fundamental lesson by Saddam Hussein against all odds and all \nexperience or that the people of Iraq take their future in their hands \nagainst extraordinary odds and regain responsible leadership.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, how this crisis will be resolved. \nIndeed, no one could predict. Only that somehow we be understood and \nthat somehow the United Nations obtain the strength and resolve to see \nits judgments fulfilled. All the frustration of these years and all the \nsacrifice from the international community can still have real meaning \nif this lesson will be learned not simply by Saddam Hussein but by all \nthe dictators, all the despots to come who would abuse their people and \nwage war. If we can stand together here, finally have the lesson \nlearned, all this will have had real meaning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, on Tuesday of this week, our Nation \ncelebrated Veterans Day. I had the pleasure of returning to Indiana and \ntalking to some of our veterans and speaking to an important group \nabout the meaning of Veterans Day and the contributions veterans have \nmade to our country and their sacrifices. We honor Americans on that \nday, both men and women, who served in both peace and war, as watchmen \nand women on the wall of freedom. We honor them by remembering their \nheroism, passing stories of their character and courage from generation \nto generation.\n  It is disappointing and extremely unfortunate that in this very same \nweek the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Ms. Sara Lister, made some \nremarks to a group to whom she was speaking at Harvard, referring to \nmembers of the U.S. Marine Corps as ``extremists.'' I quote her. She \nsays the Marines are ``extremists. Wherever you have extremists, you've \ngot some risks of total disconnection with society. And that's a little \ndangerous.''\n  Now, subsequently, Ms. Lister has penned a letter of apology to the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, General Krulak, in which she says it's \nunfortunate that my remarks were taken out of context. It's unfortunate \nthat they were misinterpreted.\n  Now, all of us in the business of politics have had occasion to pick \nup the paper in the morning and seen our remarks taken out of context \nand be misinterpreted. So I appreciate that this sort of thing often \ntakes place. I truly hope that in this case these remarks were taken \nout of context and that they were misinterpreted. I am concerned that \nthey were not. I have asked for a tape or transcript of the \npresentation by Ms. Lister at the Harvard group so that I can \nunderstand the context. It is not really understandable or discernible \nat this particular point.\n  I am disturbed that one of our top civilian appointees at the \nPentagon could make such a statement. It is hard for me to construct \nany context in which the use of the word ``extremism,'' and the phrase \na ``total disconnection between our society'' and the U.S. Marine Corps \nis appropriate. I don't understand in what context that could be \npresented that would explain the use of those remarks and the statement \nthat this is a ``dangerous'' situation.\n  And so I rise today to raise serious questions about the continued \nleadership of Ms. Lister as Assistant Secretary of the Army. By her \nremarks, she has offended not only the 174,000 active duty members of \nthe Marine Corps but the 2.1 million Marine Corps veterans and, \nfrankly, all Americans.\n  The Marine Corps teaches truths and convictions which are becoming \nmore rare in today's society, and it is the continuity of these values \nin the Marine Corps which has produced men and women of character and \nhonor who are ready and willing to sacrifice their lives in defense of \ntheir country.\n  I would commend to Ms. Lister a piece which appeared in the Sunday \nParade magazine, probably in most Sunday papers across our country. It \nfeatured a very insightful story of recruits in the Marine Corps and \nwhat we can learn from the Marine Corps. The article correctly shows \nthat the Marine Corps teaches and trains young people important values.\n  If these values are extremism, then I suggest that is what we need \nmore of in this country. Let me just quote a few things from the \narticle.\n\n       In a society that seems to have trouble transmitting \n     healthy values, the Marines stand out as a successful \n     institution that unabashedly teaches those values . . .\n\n[[Page S12540]]\n\n       For the first time in their lives, many encountered \n     absolute standards; tell the truth. Don't give up. Don't \n     whine. Look out for the group before you look out for \n     yourself. Always do your best . . . Judge others by their \n     actions, not their words or their race. . . Don't pursue \n     happiness; pursue excellence. Make a habit of that, and \n     you can have a fulfilling life.\n\n       The recruits learned that money isn't the measure of a man; \n     that a person's real wealth is in his character.\n       The recruits generally seemed to find race relations less \n     of an issue at boot camp than in the neighborhoods they'd \n     left behind.\n\n  The author of the article goes on to say:\n       If America were more like the Marines, argued a recruit \n     from New Jersey, there would be less crime, less racial \n     tension among people, because Marine Corps discipline is all \n     about brotherhood.\n       With their emphasis on honor, courage and commitment, they \n     offer a powerful alternative to the loneliness and distrust \n     that seem so widespread, especially among our youth.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, if those values are a disconnect from American \nsociety, then it is not the Marine Corps that is in deep trouble. It is \nAmerican society that is in deep trouble. These are the values to which \nwe should be aspiring. I think under the leadership of General Krulak--\nand the tradition and the history of the Marines--the Marine Corps has \ndemonstrated a continuing commitment to values to which we should all \naspire.\n  General Krulak responded to Ms. Lister's remarks--I will just briefly \nquote that--by saying that ``honor, courage and commitment are not \nextreme.''\n  Mr. President, as I said, I hope that these comments were taken out \nof context. I hope that they were misinterpreted. Again, I cannot \nconceive of a context in which they would be considered as appropriate. \nThe use of the term ``extremists'', the statement that the Marine Corps \nis disconnected from American society reflects, unfortunately, an \nattitude and a belief about the Marine Corps and perhaps about others \nin uniform that is inappropriate for an Assistant Secretary of Defense.\n  I note that Ms. Lister earlier had announced that at some point she \nwas going to retire from her position. Perhaps it wouldn't be too early \nfor her to think about accelerating that retirement so that the \nposition could be turned over to someone who is able to present his \nthoughts in a better context, in a way that will not be misinterpreted. \nPerhaps then we will not have this difficult explanation of why one of \nour most honorable branches of military service has been labeled in \nsuch a way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the day before Thanksgiving the \nUniversity of Alaska's Athletic Department marks a milestone--the 20th \nanniversary of the Great Alaska Shootout.\n  The shootout is a basketball tournament that began as an impossible \ndream of Bob Rachal, a coach who wanted to put his fledgling University \nof Alaska Anchorage basketball team on the map.\n  Now, the shootout continues under Charlie Bruns and Tim Dillon, \nathletic director and has become an annual Thanksgiving tradition for \nAlaskans and basketball fans across our Nation.\n  In the 20 years since the shootout began, our Nation's greatest \ncollege teams have traveled to Alaska over the Thanksgiving break to \nvie for the tournament trophy.\n  Twenty former NCAA champions have taken part in the shootout over the \ntwo decades; last year marked the fifth time the defending national \nchampion has participated in the shootout.\n  The first game, 20 years ago, was played in a drafty field house on \nFort Richardson, a military post in Anchorage, to about 2,500 fans.\n  Now, the shootout fills our state-of-the-art Sullivan Sports Arena in \nAnchorage, and is televised live nationwide via ESPN. Sportswriters \nfrom the wire services, newspapers and magazines regularly travel to \nAnchorage to cover the shootout.\n  Because the teams that participate are the best, the games are \ninvariably closely contested; 60 of the previous 228 games have been \nwon by margins of five points or less. Six have been settled in \novertime; four in double overtime, and one in triple overtime.\n  It isn't only the games that are important in the shootout, it is the \nopportunity players, coaches, and the families of the players and \ncoaches, have to experience the greatness of Alaska and Alaskans, and \nthe opportunity Alaskans have to meet these young athletes, their \ncoaches, and their families from across our Nation.\n  Volunteers open their homes to shootout participants and support the \nplayers and the guests in countless other ways, including \ntransportation, entertainment and other special events. Our largest \nAlaska grocery chain, Carr's, provides important corporate support.\n  The National Collegiate Athletic Association recognizes the special \nplace this tournament holds by its votes over the years to allow the \ntournament a special place in American collegiate sports.\n  The teams represent the finest programs in NCAA basketball history, \nand the University of Alaska Anchorage has gained a reputation for \nhosting one of the best tournaments in college basketball.\n  The players and coaches and all who work to make the shootout a \nsuccess bring credit to the University of Alaska, to Anchorage and to \nAlaska. Mr. President, I commend Chancellor Lea Gorsuch and the \nUniversity of Alaska as it observes the 20th anniversary of a very \nspecial sports event. I know Dr. Lee Piccard, the former vice \nchancellor, who has seen every shootout game during all 20 years will \nenjoy it again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12540-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12540-S12541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  A. MICHAEL ARNOLD, M.A. CANTAB., M.A. OXON, F. INST. D., F. INST. P.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to recognize the assistance I have \nreceived over the years from a longtime friend, A. Michael Arnold, \nwhose intellectual capacity and international insights have proven to \nbe of significant value to me and others. I have often passed on Mick \nArnold's comments to many Members of Congress including our leaders. \nSince the early eighties, Mick and I have corresponded regularly, and \noccasionally have had the opportunity to meet either here or in \nBritain. He is a resident of Great Britain. We are both blessed with \nwonderful wives. Mick's wife Wendy is a respected author in her own \nright. My wife, Catherine, and Wendy share in our friendship.\n  These insights in Mr. Arnold's correspondence have run the gamut from \nthe 1980's arms buildup in South America, to the current conflict in \nBosnia with its implications for world peace, the internal convulsions \nin Russia, the tensions between Israel and the Arab world, the threats \nfrom Iran and Iraq, and to the reason d'etre of the United Nations. \nMick's observations have been provocative, accurate, and full of sage \nadvice. He has not sought recognition for his efforts. He told me that \nknowing that his observations may help to bring clarity to a confused \nworld scene was sufficient to him.\n  I recall several specific instances of Mick's perceptiveness in \ninternational affairs. Mick's assessments in 1983 and 1984 of the \npolitical scene in the Soviet Union: He anticipated that Chernenko \nwould stabilize his power base and advance Gorbachev as one of his key \ndeputies. By early 1984 Chernenko had made Gorbachev his No. 2. Noting \nChernenko's precarious health, Mick then anticipated that Gorbachev \nwould succeed Chernenko. History records the accuracy of that \nassessment. That advice was very helpful to those of us who were \nworking on Soviet affairs in the 1980's.\n  In 1991 Mick expressed anguish over the potential for a conflagration \nin Yugoslavia * * * one that could envelope Bosnia-Herzegovina. Once \nagain Mick's international instincts proved accurate. Many times that \nhe shared his worries in papers I then passed on to others, those fears \nwere realized in what did take place in Bosnia.\n  In April of this year, Mick commented on the upcoming Presidential \nelections in Iran and observed that Mohammed Khatemi would, if elected, \nbe\n\n[[Page S12541]]\n\nmore open to foreign relations. History has yet to validate the \naccuracy of Mick's assessment of Khatemi's but many are hopeful he is \ncorrect.\n  He continues to be one who observes the world scene from his \nbackground being a Don at Oxford.\n  The world would be a far better place if there were more people with \nthe intellectual capacity, compassion, and common sense of Mick Arnold, \nones who would pass on their opinions without any publicity, without \nseeking any remuneration for their work--just to be a friend. It's from \nthe point of view of friendship.\n  I look forward to continuing this friendship and value Mick's \ninformed observations on the international scene. I come today because \nmy friend has told me he is going to reduce the frequency of his \ncomments. He is not totally retiring, but he's going to limit the scope \nof his activities. But I wanted the Senate to know that, whether many \nare aware of it, the U.S. Senate has benefited from his counsel and his \ninsights. I have benefited greatly from his friendship.\n  My wife and I wish Wendy and Mick many more years of success, and I \ncontinue to value his advice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I rise to say a few words in honor of one \nof our Nation's most legendary Senators and one of Maine's most beloved \npublic figures: Senator Margaret Chase Smith.\n  December 14 marks the 100th anniversary of Senator Smith's birth. \nSince we will not be in session on the 14th, I would like to take the \nopportunity to speak in honor of her centennial today.\n  Margaret Chase Smith has the distinction of being the first woman \nelected in her own right to both the House of Representatives and the \nU.S. Senate. She served in the Senate from 1949 to 1972--the entire \ntime that I was growing up in Maine. Throughout her tenure in Congress, \nshe served as a great source of pride and inspiration for countless \npeople throughout Maine and the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I am one of those fortunate people whose life was \ntouched personally by Senator Margaret Chase Smith. So it is with a \ngreat deal of gratitude and admiration that I speak about her legacy \ntoday in celebration of her centennial.\n  Mr. President, when I was just 18 years old, a high school senior \nfrom Caribou, ME, Senator Margaret Chase Smith encouraged me to pursue \na career in public service. Now I serve in the U.S. Senate, holding her \nvery seat. Her example of moderation, independence and integrity \ncontinues to guide me every day as I seek to represent the people of \nMaine.\n  Walking through the Halls of the Senate, I am frequently reminded of \nmy first significant encounter with Senator Smith.\n  In January 1971, I left my hometown of Caribou, ME, to spend a week \nhere in Washington, DC. I was one of 100 high school students from \naround the Nation participating in the U.S. Senate Youth Program. The \nprogram consisted of VIP tours of Washington, formal dinners, and \nnumerous high-profile speakers ranging from Supreme Court Justices to \ntop White House officials. The highlight of my week, however, was the \nafternoon that we visited our respective Senators.\n  When I arrived at Senator Smith's office, I was immediately ushered \ninto her personal suite. Her office was bustling with activity, and yet \nit had a stately and serene quality. Senator Smith looked perfectly at \nhome in the setting as the only woman in the Senate. Her green office \nsuited her well and, of course, reminded me of the State of Maine. She \nshook my hand and invited me to sit down, and seemed genuinely \ninterested in what I had to say.\n  Much to my amazement, Mr. President, instead of just quickly posing \nwith me for a picture, Senator Smith spent nearly 2 hours talking to me \nabout her years in Congress. She stressed the importance of public \nservice and the difference that one person could make. We talked about \nher opposition to McCarthyism and the necessity of standing tall for \none's principles no matter what the cost.\n  As I was leaving, she handed me a copy of her famous ``Declaration of \nConscience'' speech to take with me. I was struck by her presence and I \nknew that she was a woman of enormous strength and integrity. I was so \nproud that she was my Senator.\n  As I bid her farewell, I could not keep the smile from stretching \nacross my face nor the dreams from racing through my mind. To me, \nSenator Smith was living proof that women, even those of us from small \nrural towns in Maine, could accomplish anything upon which we set our \nsights.\n\n  I have since learned that my early impressions of Senator Smith are \nshared by thousands of others throughout our State and throughout the \nNation whose lives she touched. But we in Maine are particularly \nfortunate to have had her as a role model and as our Senator.\n  As one Congresswoman recently said to me, ``You know, it was much \nharder for women to get elected in my State because we didn't have \nMargaret Chase Smith.''\n  Senator Smith's 32 years of leadership epitomized the type of \nthoughtful, independent representation that sets a standard for public \nservice.\n  As I campaigned throughout Maine for the Senate last year, it was \napparent to me that the name ``Margaret Chase Smith'' strikes a \nresounding chord with the citizens of my State. From Kittery to Calais \nto Fort Kent, people recognize and honor her name and her legacy as \nsynonymous with thoughtful, independent, and honest representation. \nThis above all else, Mr. President, is the legacy of Senator Smith and \nthe tradition which those of us who are honored to follow in her \nfootsteps strive to uphold.\n  While Senator Smith served as an inspiration to me as a young girl \nand as a beacon of strength during my two statewide campaigns, it was \nnot until I began my service in the Senate that I fully understood her \nlegacy and the extraordinary courage she exhibited throughout her years \nin Congress.\n  Margaret Chase Smith is perhaps best remembered for her principled \nand unabashed stance against Senator Joe McCarthy. Because the \ncourageous stand that she took against McCarthyism is so familiar to \nall of us today--it seems to be so obviously the right thing to do--we \nsometimes forget and underestimate the risks that she took and the \nhardships she endured in this fight. From my new perspective as a U.S. \nSenator, I must say that the courage that Senator Smith showed during \nthe McCarthy era is truly remarkable.\n  Over the course of the past several months, I have had many occasions \nto reflect upon another of Senator Smith's principled positions.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have been \ninvolved in investigating the fundraising abuses of the 1996 \nPresidential election campaigns. These hearings have examined some of \nthe most deplorable and certainly most excessive fundraising practices \nin our Nation's history, such as operating the Lincoln Bedroom like a \nhotel, phony issue ads, fundraising coffees in the Oval Office and soft \nmoney contributions of staggering sums and questionable origins.\n  In the 24 years since Senator Smith left office, fundraising has \nbecome an all-consuming and self-propelling institution. It is \ndifficult for those of us who are in office today to remember that \nSenator Smith waged so many successful political campaigns without \nsoliciting a single contribution. How we envy her. She believed that \nbig money had the potential to be a corrupting influence in the system, \nand she has certainly been proven right.\n  Throughout this past year--my first in the Senate--I have been \nreminded of one of Senator Margaret Chase Smith's most famous \nstatements time and again. She once said that there is a ``difference \nbetween the principle of\n\n[[Page S12542]]\n\ncompromise and the compromise of principle.'' This sentiment has guided \nme through many tough negotiations and heated debates where it is \nsometimes difficult to know when it is best to be stalwart for the sake \nof principle and when it is time to seek common ground in the name of \naction.\n  Compromising one's principles is wrong; but the principle of \ncompromise, on the other hand, is the essence of a healthy democracy. \nSenator Smith's wisdom has helped me many times in reaching decisions \non thorny issues.\n  Mr. President, 25 years after my first encounter with Senator Smith, \nI fulfilled the dream that she fostered in me back in 1971, and was \nelected to her seat in the U.S. Senate. Just as Senator Smith was the \nfirst woman elected in her own right to both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, upon my election, Maine became the \nfirst State in the Nation to be represented and to elect two Republican \nwomen Senators.\n  This distinction is a fitting tribute and testament to the legacy of \nMargaret Chase Smith. If not for her 32 years of congressional service, \nmany doors to and within the Capitol might still be closed to women \ntoday.\n  In all of history, Mr. President, there have only been 15 women \nelected to the U.S. Senate in their own right, and 3 of us have been \nfrom the great State of Maine.\n  Thanks to Senator Smith's decades of selfless service, principled \nleadership and pioneering efforts, the people of Maine know that \nleadership is not about gender; it is about decency and tenacity and \nservice and integrity. Margaret Chase Smith embodied all of these \ntraits, and so much more.\n  Today, I honor her for paving the way for me, and countless others, \nand for establishing the thoughtful and independent approach to public \nservice that Mainers have come to expect from their elected officials.\n  I thank the Chair. And I also thank the Chair for presiding for me so \nthat I could pay tribute on the 100th anniversary of the great Senator \nfrom Maine, Margaret Chase Smith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer in his capacity as a \nSenator from the State of Wyoming suggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I compliment the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nSenator Collins, for those very erudite and profound remarks. The U.S. \nSenate is graced by two women Senators, Senator Olympia Snowe and \nSenator Susan Collins. I know that Senator Margaret Chase Smith is a \nrole model for them as she is a role model for so many in America--men \nas well as women.\n  It is with some frequency I quote her famous dictum, to distinguish \nbetween the principle of compromise and the compromise of principle.\n  I think with the qualities of Senator Collins and Senator Snowe, they \nwould be in the U.S. Senate even without Senator Margaret Chase Smith \nblazing the trail for them in Maine, but it didn't do them any harm.\n  That was an extraordinary statement. I have had the good fortune to \nwork with both Senator Collins and Senator Snowe on a little Wednesday \nlunch group and on the Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Collins \nhas done outstanding work on the Governmental Affairs Committee and I \nthink there is more coming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12541-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF JUDGE MASSIAH-JACKSON\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition today to comment about the \npending judicial nomination of Judge Frederica A. Massiah-Jackson who \nhas been nominated for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania. Judge Massiah-Jackson currently serves on the court of \ncommon pleas of Philadelphia County where she has been a State court \njudge for the past 14 years. I believe Judge Massiah-Jackson should be \nconfirmed, and regrettably that will not happen today, which is the \nlast day of the session, because two of our colleagues have insisted on \nrollcall votes, and one colleague insisted on an opportunity to debate \nthe nomination beyond a rollcall vote.\n  It appears virtually certain, if not certain, that there will be no \nrollcall votes today, our last day in session, because our \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, had announced that he \nwould not have rollcall votes unless he gave Senators who are widely \ndispersed at this time an opportunity to come back, and therefore the \nbusiness of the Senate is going to be completed by voice votes.\n  I do not question the judgment of my colleagues to ask for rollcall \nvotes, although customarily we do not have rollcall votes on district \ncourt nominees. Perhaps it would be sufficient for individual Senators \nto note their objection for the record. These two Senators have already \nnoted their opposition to Judge Massiah-Jackson on the rollcall vote in \nthe Judiciary Committee where she was recommended for nomination by a \n12 to 6 vote.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson had substantial Republican support in the \ncommittee and she has the support of my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Santorum, as well as myself, the two home State senators. It is \nthe practice for the caucus to rely upon home State senators on matters \ninvolving U.S. district court judges.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson has been questioned on two intemperate remarks \nwhich she made, one which she thought was under her breath, and has \nacknowledged her error, and I think it fair to say that if two \nintemperate remarks were disqualifiers or a disqualifier from being a \nFederal judge or a U.S. Senator, for most positions, perhaps all \npositions of responsibility, nobody would hold any job of \nresponsibility because intemperate remarks escape all of us from time \nto time. She has apologized. The Senator who presided at her hearing \nnoted with some acknowledgment the sufficiency of that particular \napology.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson has been questioned about sentencing. She has \ntried more than 4,000 criminal cases. There were 95 appeals taken and \nshe was reversed in some 14 cases, which is a pretty good record. Her \nrating on the standard for judges on compliance with the sentencing \nguidelines is well within the norm of her contemporaries. She had a \nrating in the 72- to 82-percent compliance at a time when the \ncompliance of other common pleas judges was in the 70- to 86-percent \nrange.\n  She had questioned, from time to time, certain police officers. I was \ndistrict attorney of Philadelphia for 8 years following being an \nassistant D.A. for some 4 years, and while I was district attorney I \nran tough investigating grand juries where there was evidence of \nnarcotics violations, narcotics corruption within the police \ndepartment. There have recently been a spate of many reversals and \nFederal investigations by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. So it is not unusual to have questions about police \nconduct following on the old statement that there are some bad apples \nin the barrel.\n  I think in totality, Judge Massiah-Jackson's record is a very good \none. I am disappointed she will not be confirmed because we have just \nhad the swearing in of circuit Judge Midge Rendell, and we are now \nplanning the swearing in of Judge A. Richard Caputo in Wilkes-Barre and \nformer State court Judge Bruce Kaufman in the Eastern District.\n  I am sorry Judge Massiah-Jackson will not be sworn in before the end \nof the year to take on the very substantial duties of helping the \nbacklog in the Eastern District. I do thank my distinguished and \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, for agreeing to list Judge Massiah-\nJackson on the second day when we return. We are due to come in on \nJanuary the 27. That is expected to be the night of the State of the \nUnion speech, and Senator Lott has told me that he will schedule Judge \nMassiah-Jackson for floor debate and a vote on the day we return. It \nmay be that there will be two other judges in a similar position, so I \nthank Senator Lott for his assistance there, and I thank him, also, for \naiding me in the determination of Senators on our side of the aisle who \nhave so-called holds.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12542-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12543]]\n                          ABOLISH SECRET HOLDS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

I respect that difference \nof opinion.

Madam President, today I rise to oppose a nomination. I \nwant to tell you, I have a hold on a nomination. It is not a secret \nhold. Those that are interested in the nomination know I have the hold \non it. I would not do that in secret. The purpose is not for secrecy. \nThe purpose is to get an action that will show on the record, that will \nbe reflected by this body for years to come. That is what we were sent \nhere for.\n  Judge Ann Aiken has been nominated by the President of the United \nStates to be a District Court Judge for the District of Oregon. I have \nasked for a rollcall vote because I want to be on record as opposing \nthis nominee. I don't question Judge Aiken's experience or academic \nqualifications to sit on the Federal bench. I do have serious concerns \nabout her judicial philosophy as she has applied it in State court in \nOregon. One particularly tragic case perhaps best illustrates concern. \nIt is the case of State versus Ronny Lee Dye, a 26-year-old man who was \nconvicted of first-degree rape of a 5-year-old girl. Instead of \nsentencing this convicted rapist to State prison, Judge Aiken sentenced \nhim to only 90 days in jail and 5 years' probation, plus a $2,000 fine. \nAccording to local papers, Judge Aiken did not want to sentence Dye to \nstate prison because the prison did not have a sex offender \nrehabilitation program.\n  How do you think the parents of that girl felt? Moreover, she \nbelieved that the probation following the jail term provided a stricter \nsupervision than the parole that would have followed the prison \nsentence.\n  Less than a year after the conviction for rape, Dye violated his \nparole by driving under the influence of alcohol and having contact \nwith minor children without permission of his probation officer. I \nbelieve that Judge Aiken's handling of this case and others illustrates \nan inclination toward an unjustified leniency for convicted criminals.\n  I do not pretend to be able to predict with any degree of accuracy \nhow the nominee or any other will rule while on the Federal bench in \nexercising our solemn constitutional duty to advise and consent on the \nPresident's nominations for Federal courts, what this body stands for, \nwe have only the past action, statements and writings to guide our \ndeliberations. Moreover, since Federal judges have life tenure--life \ntenure--and salary protection while in office we have but one \nopportunity to voice our concerns in disapproval of a judge's record.\n  I, for one, cannot vote to confirm a nominee to the Federal court who \nI believe is inclined to substitute his or her personal policy \npreferences for those of the U.S. Congress and the various State \nlegislatures. I have strong concerns about this judge. If confirmed, \nwould she be inclined to this type of judicial activism? For this \nreason, I will cast my vote against the confirmation of Judge Aiken and \ninsist on a rollcall vote so that it will be recorded.\n  That may result in a delay in that court, but I think it is an \nimportant delay. I don't think I'm the only one opposing this, and I \nwill insist on the rollcall vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I wish to congratulate my colleague, Senator \nEnzi, from Wyoming, for that statement. I wish more Senators would \nspend more time doing their homework on Federal judges. I think it is \nobvious in this case he has done a lot of homework on the judge. We \nshould all do more, and he is certainly entitled to express that \nsentiment on the floor and he is entitled to a rollcall vote. I will \ncertainly support him in that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12543-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12543-S12546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ROAD AHEAD ON GLOBAL TOBACCO DEAL\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, as we move toward adjournment in the \nfirst session of the 105th Congress, I want to take a couple of minutes \nto look ahead at one of the real big challenges that we have next year. \nThat issue is tobacco and the so-called global tobacco deal that was \nagreed to earlier this year between the tobacco industry, States \nattorneys general, and health advocates.\n  Madam President, we have seen a significant sea change in our \nculture's attitudes toward smoking in the last 30 years. The proportion \nof adult smokers peaked at 43 percent in 1966 and has dropped \ndramatically since then to about 25 percent today. According to the \nFederal Trade Commission, demand for cigarettes is forecast to continue \nto decline about 0.6 percent a year for the foreseeable future.\n  However, as adult use has declined, concern has grown about the \nnumber of underage smokers who every day try their first cigarette. \nMadam President, 4.5 million kids ages 12 to17 are current smokers, \naccording to the Department of Health and Human Services; 29 percent of \nmales age 12 to 21, and 26 percent of females in the same age group \ncurrently smoke, according to reports of the National Center for Health \nStatistics. In 1994, the Surgeon General's report found that 9 out of \n10 Americans who currently smoke say they began smoking as teenagers. \nMany Americans share a common goal to reduce teen smoking dramatically \nto break the cycle of smoking as we enter into the 21st century. \nMembers of Congress, Republican and Democrat, too, would like to see \nour children smoke free and families free from fear of smoke-related \ncancers and disease.\n  The agreement between the tobacco industry and States attorneys \ngeneral was motivated by good intentions, but it resulted in a deal \nthat is very complicated. In the Senate, several committees have held \nnumerous hearings\n\n[[Page S12544]]\n\ntrying to elicit more information and understanding of the agreement.\n  Since the Clinton administration was intimately involved in crafting \nthe June 20 deal, we were hopeful that the President would come forward \nwith specific recommendations and legislation to describe how the deal \nwould work.\n  Unfortunately, the President ducked a historic opportunity for \nleadership. Rather than following the regular order of submitting \nlegislation, he sent us five vague principles. His inaction set back \nthe work of the Congress considerably.\n  I remain hopeful that the President and his administration will tell \nus specifically what he wants in legislation. For now, though, the \nCongress has to do the heavy lifting. We have to make our own decisions \nabout how the various elements of the deal should be put together.\n  Through the summer and fall, I met several times with Senate \ncommittee chairmen who have jurisdiction over the major elements of the \ndeal. They include the Committees of Agriculture, Commerce, Finance, \nLabor, Judiciary, Environment and Public Works, as well as Indian \nAffairs.\n  I have requested that, when we reconvene next year, they begin work \nand try to find out what the majority in their committees, Republicans \nand Democrats, believe are important elements of a comprehensive plan \ntargeted on reducing teenage smoking. I have asked them to conclude \ntheir work by March 16, 1998, and they have agreed to meet that \ntimetable.\n  As they do their work, I am asking them to answer, to their \nsatisfaction and to the satisfaction of the public, 10 important \nquestions, which I will have printed in the Record at the end of my \nremarks. These questions deal with the whole parameter of the proposed \nresolution. For example: What works best to reduce teen smoking? We \nhave Government programs and we have private programs. What really \nworks? What is the best method of reducing teen smoking?\n  Should we increase the price of tobacco? President Clinton mentioned \nhe thought we should increase the price a dollar and a half. Should \nthat be done in the form of taxes or in the form of price increases? If \nit is done in the form of price increases, do we need to give \nexemptions for that to happen? Do we need to make sure tobacco \ncompanies would not make more money than that would allow? Are they \ngoing to be able to make excess profits from the price increase? Do we \nincrease the price by increasing tobacco taxes? Should the States have \nthe allowance to be able to increase tobacco taxes, in addition to \nwhatever the Federal Government would do?\n  Another big question is, Who gets the money? This is a big dispute. A \nfew weeks ago, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala wrote \na letter to the States and said that the Federal Government is entitled \nto its pro rata share of the Medicaid money, assuming States were \ngetting most of their money to reimburse them. The States attorneys \ngeneral said no. They went to court and they filed suits. The Federal \nGovernment didn't join in those lawsuits. The States are saying, give \nus the money. They took the legal action; the Federal Government \ndidn't. So who should get the money? We need to make those decisions.\n  How much money are we talking about? The States attorneys general and \nthe industry came up with an agreement that said $368 billion over 25 \nyears. The administration said, ``We want a lot more.'' They didn't say \nhow much more. Should there be additional fines and penalties? These \ndecisions have to be made. Should the money go to the States and have \nit be off budget? They have not made those decisions.\n  As you can see, these are not easy decisions to make, and there are \nmore questions. What would be an appropriate antitrust exemption for \ntobacco companies? What kind of limitations should they have on \nimmunity from lawsuits? Should there be a total exemption from class \naction lawsuits for the tobacco industry? Should that apply to \nindividuals as well?\n\n  How much power should the FDA have? Should they be able to ban or \nregulate nicotine or cigarettes, or control advertising and sales? Is \nthat something that would require legislative action?\n  How do we take care of those people who are directly affected by \nthis, such as the tobacco farmers, the processors, the distributors, \nthe people that have the vending machines, and so on? They were not \nincluded in the original package. Should they be included in whatever \ncomprehensive legislation we would pass?\n  What did the proposed resolution leave out? There are a lot of things \nwe should consider that weren't included. Should we have a limitation \non compensation for the attorneys in this process? And so on. I could \ngo on and on about the unanswered questions.\n  My point is that there is a lot of work to do. If the Congress is \ngoing to move this piece of legislation next year in a comprehensive \nbill, then we are going to have to go to work early. So I have asked \nthe committee chairs to consult with the ranking members and the other \nmembers of the committee to try and come up with what they believe in \ntheir committee of jurisdiction they have strong support for and what \nthey think should be included in a total package. Then we have, as I \nmentioned, six committees that are involved in this legislation \ndirectly--maybe more are indirectly involved--and certainly more. I \ndidn't include Budget, which is involved. So I'm asking all committees \nto make their recommendations, and we will try to put a package \ntogether to see if we can't really have a concerted, aggressive, \nenergetic effort to reduce teenage consumption of smoking, teenage \naddiction to smoking.\n  I might mention, Madam President, that in addition to smoking, I \nthink Congress should be tackling teenage addiction to drugs, because \nteen drug use, unfortunately, has doubled in the last 5 years. We have \nseen enormous increases. As a matter of fact, 11 percent of kids in \njunior high now use dangerous, illegal, illicit drugs. Today, 1 out of \n10 kids in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade are using illegal drugs on \na monthly basis. The number of kids using marijuana has more than \ndoubled in the last many years. We have to have a concerted effort, I \nthink, to reduce teenage addiction to tobacco, but also other drugs as \nwell.\n  Madam President, this will not be easy. If you try to see all of the \ndifferent pieces of this package and try and put it together, it will \nnot be easy. But I think that we have what I would say is a bipartisan \nagreement that we should reduce consumption and addiction of drugs and \nsmoking among teenagers. I am very committed to trying to pass a \ncomprehensive package that will reduce teenage smoking and teenage \naddiction to drugs.\n  I just say to all my colleagues, let's work together and see if we \ncan't come up with a package we can all be proud of--not just something \nthat's good for politics, but let's do something that is going to good \npolicy. It will be good policy if we can get teenagers off drugs and \naway from a tobacco addiction. Let's work together to make that happen, \nnot just try to score points and say who is the most antitobacco, or \nthe most this or that. Let's work on good policy, something that will \nhelp curb the growth of teenage addiction to tobacco and drugs. I \nwelcome the contributions of Senator McCain, Senator Hatch, Senator \nLugar, Senator Mack, and others over the past few weeks on this issue. \nI think we can work together for the betterment of our children, and \nour country.\n  Madam President, in conclusion, I want to insert a couple of other \nthings in the Record. One is a summary of a study that was done by the \nFederal Government. There was a $25 million Federal study published on \nSeptember 10 in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nentitled the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The \nstudy concluded that feeling loved, understood, and paid attention to \nby parents helps teenagers avoid high-risk activities, such as using \ndrugs and smoking cigarettes. The study further concluded that \nteenagers who have strong emotional attachments to parents and teachers \nare much less likely to use drugs and alcohol, attempt suicide, and \nsmoke cigarettes.\n  Madam President, I mention this study because it had a lot of common \nsense. The study found that the presence of parents at home at key \ntimes--in the morning, after school, at dinner,\n\n[[Page S12545]]\n\nand bedtime--made teenagers less likely to use alcohol, tobacco, and \nmarijuana.\n  Ironically, the Government spends millions of dollars on programs to \nreduce teen smoking and, frankly, many of them haven't worked. I think \nthis study shows that loving parents may be the best program that we \ncan have.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article summarizing \nthat study, published in the Washington Post on September 11, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 10, 1997]\n\n               Love Conquers What Ails Teens, Study Finds\n\n                          (By Barbara Vobejda)\n\n       Teenagers who have strong emotional attachments to their \n     parents and teachers are much less likely to use drugs and \n     alcohol, attempt suicide, engage in violence or become \n     sexually active at an early age, according to the largest \n     ever study of American adolescents.\n       The study, published in today's Journal of the American \n     Medical Association, concludes that feeling loved, understood \n     and paid attention to by parents helps teenagers avoid high-\n     risk activities regardless of whether a child comes from a \n     one- or two-parent household. It is also more important than \n     the amount of time parents spend at home, the study found.\n       At school, positive relationships with teachers were found \n     to be more important in protecting teenagers than any other \n     factors, including classroom size or the amount of training a \n     teacher has.\n       Researchers also found that young people who have jobs \n     requiring them to work 20 or more hours a week, regardless of \n     their families' economic status, are more likely to use \n     alcohol and drugs, smoke cigarettes, engage in early sex and \n     report emotional distress.\n       The findings are the first wave of data from a $25 million \n     federal study known as the National Longitudinal Study of \n     Adolescent Health, which surveyed 90,000 students in grades 7 \n     through 12 across the country. Researchers also conducted \n     interviews with more than 20,000 teenagers in their homes and \n     with 18,000 parents. The results will continue to be analyzed \n     in increasing detail over the next decade, researchers said.\n       The first analysis of the massive data not only confirms \n     what other studies have shown--that family relationships are \n     critical in raising healthy children--but teases apart more \n     precisely what elements of family life are most important.\n       While the amount of time spent with parents had a positive \n     effect on reducing emotional distress, for example, feeling \n     ``connected'' to parents was five times more powerful. And \n     this emotional bound was about six times more important than \n     was the amount of various activities that teenagers did with \n     their parents.\n       Though less important than the emotional connection, the \n     presence of parents at home at ``key times''--in the morning, \n     after school, at dinner and at bedtime--made teenagers less \n     likely to use alcohol, tobacco and marijuana. The data did \n     not cite any one period of the day as most important.\n       ``This study shows there is no magical time,'' said Robert \n     W. Blum, head of adolescent health at the University of \n     Minnesota and one of the principal researchers.\n       The study also found: Individual factors in a teenager's \n     life are most important in predicting problems. Most likely \n     to have trouble are those who have repeated a grade in \n     school, are attracted to persons of the same sex, or believe \n     they may face an early death because of health, violence or \n     other reasons. Teenagers living in rural areas were more \n     likely to report emotional stress, attempt suicide and become \n     sexually active early. Adolescents who believe they look \n     either older or younger than their peers are more likely to \n     suffer emotional problems, and those who think they look \n     older are more likely to have sex at a younger age and use \n     cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana. The presence of a gun at \n     home, even if not easily accessible, increases the likelihood \n     that teenagers will think about or attempt suicide or get \n     involved in violent behavior.\n       The researchers, most of whom are associated with the \n     University of Minnesota or the University of North Carolina-\n     Chapel Hill, said the study underscores the importance of \n     parents remaining intensely involved in their children's \n     lives through the teenage years, even when they may feel \n     their role is diminishing.\n       ``Many people think of adolescence as a stage where there \n     is so much peer influence that parents become both irrelevant \n     and powerless,'' said J. Richard Udry, professor of maternal \n     and child health at UNC-Chapel Hill and principal \n     investigator of the study. ``It's not so that parents aren't \n     important. Parents are just as important to adolescents as \n     they are to smaller children.''\n       The study did not compare the influence of peers to that of \n     family. But the authors did suggest steps parents can take: \n     Set high academic expectations for children; be as accessible \n     as possible; send clear messages to avoid alcohol, drugs and \n     sex; lock up alcohol and get rid of guns in the home.\n       Udry led a team of a dozen researchers, whose work was \n     funded by Congress in 1993 to learn more about what can \n     protect young people from health risks. The study was \n     sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development, which is part of the National Institutes of \n     Health.\n       The researchers went to great lengths to assure teenagers \n     that their answers would remain confidential. On sensitive \n     topics involving sex and drug use, for example, teenagers \n     listened to tape recorded questions and answered on a lap-top \n     computer.\n       Overall, the study found, most American teenagers make good \n     choices that keep them from harm. But a significant minority \n     report a range of problems.\n       About 20 percent of girls and 15 percent of boys, for \n     example, said over the past year they had felt significantly \n     depressed, lonely, sad, fearful, moody or had a poor appetite \n     because of emotional distress.\n       Researchers said they were not sure why adolescents who \n     work 20 hours or more a week are more likely to have \n     problems. But Udry speculated that it may be because they are \n     surrounded by an older group and ``have more money to spend \n     to get into trouble.''\n       In its examination of schools, the study looked at \n     attendance rates, parent involvement, dropout rates, teacher \n     training, whether schools were public or private and whether \n     teenagers feel close to their teachers and if they perceive \n     other students as prejudiced.\n       But only one of those--whether students felt close to their \n     teachers--made a difference in helping teenagers avoid \n     unhealthy behavior.\n       ``Overriding classroom size, rules, all those structural \n     things, the human element of the teacher making a human \n     connection with kids is the bottom line,'' Blum said.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nRepublican policy paper entitled ``President Clinton's Failing War on \nDrugs'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                President Clinton's Failing War on Drugs\n\n       Throughout the Clinton presidency, America has been \n     witnessing increases in illegal drug use among our nation's \n     younger generation. This sharp reversal from the steady \n     progress made against illegal drug use throughout the 1980s \n     and early 1990s is the inescapable result of the Clinton \n     Administration's retreat in the war against drugs. The \n     Clinton Administration has de-emphasized law enforcement and \n     interdiction while relying heavily on drug treatment programs \n     for hard-core drug abusers in the hopes of curbing drug \n     usage. Result: backward momentum.\n\n\n        Backward Momentum From Day One: Drug Abuse Under Clinton\n\n       Two national annual surveys show that drug abuse by our \n     nation's youth has continued to increase since President \n     Clinton came to office. The most recently released Parents \n     Resource Institute for Drug Education--the so called \n     ``PRIDE'' survey--and the University of Michigan's \n     ``Monitoring the Future'' both offer cause for alarm.\n       The Monitoring the Future Study reveals that illicit drug \n     use among America's schoolchildren has consistently increased \n     throughout the Clinton Administration:\n       For 8th graders, the proportion using any illicit drug in \n     the prior 12 months has increased 56 percent since President \n     Clinton's first year in office, and since 1993 it has \n     increased 52 percent among 10th graders and 30 percent among \n     12th graders.\n       Marijuana use accounted for much of the overall increase in \n     illicit drug use, continuing its strong resurgence. All \n     measures of marijuana use showed an increase at all three \n     grade levels monitored in 1996. Among 8th graders, use in the \n     prior 12 months has increased 99 percent since 1993, \n     President Clinton's first year in office. Among 10th graders, \n     annual prevalence has increased 75 percent--and a full 121 \n     percent increase from the record low in President Bush's last \n     term in 1992. Among 12th graders it increased 38 percent \n     since 1993.\n       Of particular concern, according to the survey, is the \n     continuing rise in daily marijuana use. Nearly one in every \n     twenty of today's high school seniors is a current daily \n     marijuana user, and one in every thirty 10th graders uses \n     daily. While only 1.5 percent of 8th graders use marijuana \n     daily, that still represents a near doubling of the rate in \n     1996 alone.\n       The annual prevalence of LSD rose in all three grade levels \n     in 1996. In short, since President Clinton assumed office, \n     annual LSD use has increased 52 percent, 64 percent, and 29 \n     percent among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders respectively. \n     Hallucinogens other than LSD, taken as a class, continued \n     gradual increases in 1996 at all three grade levels.\n       The use of cocaine in any form continued a gradual upward \n     climb. Crack cocaine also continued a gradual upward climb \n     among 8th and 10th graders. In short, since President Clinton \n     assumed office, annual cocaine use is up 77 percent, 100 \n     percent, and 49 percent among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders \n     respectively.\n       The longer-term gradual rise in the of amphetamine \n     stimulants also continued at the 8th and 10th grade levels.\n       Since 1993, annual heroin usage has increased by 129 \n     percent, 71 percent, and 100 percent for 8th, 10th, and 12th \n     graders respectively. That is, for 8th and 12th graders, use\n\n[[Page S12546]]\n\n     of heroin has at least doubled since Clinton first took \n     office.\n\n\n                now is not the time to take a back seat\n\n       According to some experts, the age of first use is a \n     critical indicator of the seriousness of the drug problem \n     because early risk-taking behavior statistically correlates \n     to riskier behavior later. For example, the Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University \n     estimates that a young person who uses marijuana is 79 times \n     more likely to go on to try cocaine than one who hasn't used \n     marijuana.\n       The most current survey on drug use--the so called PRIDE \n     survey--shows a continuing and alarming increase in drug \n     abuse by young kids. While the increase in drug use among \n     older students has remained flat this year, illegal drug use \n     among 11 to 14 year-olds has continued on a dangerous upward \n     path. According to the President of PRIDE, ``Senior high drug \n     use may have stalled, but it is stalled at the highest levels \n     PRIDE has measured in ten years. Until we see sharp declines \n     in use at all grade levevls, there will be no reason to \n     rejoice.'' With respect to younger students, the survey found \n     that:\n       A full 11 percent of junior high students (grades 6-8) are \n     monthly illicit drug users.\n       Junior high students reported significant increases in \n     monthly use of marijuana, cocaine, uppers, downers, \n     hallucinogens and heroin, specifically: Annual marijuana use \n     increased 153 percent since Mr. Clinton's first year in \n     office; cocaine use increased 88 percent since Mr. Clinton's \n     first year in office; and hallucinogen use increased by 67 \n     percent since Mr. Clinton's first year in office.\n\n\n  president clinton's mistaken priorities: failed enforcement of drug \n                                  laws\n\n       A recent analysis by Robert E. Peterson, former drug czar \n     for the state of Michigan, revealed:\n       In 1994, a person was more likely to receive a prison \n     sentence for federal gambling, regulatory, motor carrier, \n     immigration or perjury offense than for possessing crack, \n     heroin, or other dangerous drugs under the federal system.\n       The time served for drug possession in less than half that \n     of federal regulatory and tax offenses, less than a third \n     that of mailing obscence materials, and equivalent to \n     migratory bird offense sentences.\n       In 1995, a federal trafficker could expect seven months \n     less on average drug sentences than in 1992.\n       Possession of 128 pounds of cocaine, 128 pounds of \n     marijugana, 3 pounds of heroin and/or 1.5 pounds of crack \n     earned only eight months in prison. Six in ten of these \n     federal criminals served no time at all in 1992.\n       The average federal setence imposed for drug offenders \n     increased by 37 percent from 1986-1991, but has declined 7 \n     percent from 1991-1995.\n\n\n                    returning to a serious strategy\n\n       In 1993 the Clinton Administration promised to ``reinvent \n     our drug control programs'' and ``move beyond ideological \n     debates.'' What that amounted to was de-emphasizing law \n     enforcement and interdiction and expecting dividends from \n     ``treatment on demand.'' Two years later, a congressional \n     leadership task force developed the principles for a \n     coherent, national counter-drug policy and a five-point \n     strategy for future action. The task force called for: Sound \n     interdiction strategy; serious international commitment to \n     the full range of counter-narcotic activities; effective \n     enforcement of the nation's drug laws; united full-front \n     commitment towards prevention and education; and accountable \n     and effective treatment with a commitment to learn from our \n     nation's religious institutions.\n       Illegal drug use endangers our children and our economy and \n     disproportionately harms the poor, yet President Clinton has \n     accumulated a record of callous apathy. America cannot afford \n     a ``sound bite'' war on drugs. Only a serious commitment to \n     enforcement and interdiction efforts will produce results.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the list \nof questions that I have alluded to in my comments, the 10 questions \nfocusing in on reviewing the tobacco settlement, be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                        Assistant Majority Leader,\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1997.\n     To: Committee chairmen.\n     From: Senator Nickles.\n     Re Ten questions to focus on in reviewing tobacco settlement.\n       (1) What works best to reduce teen smoking? What sort of \n     government-run programs, if any, work to reduce teen smoking? \n     If there are some that work, is it best they be designed and \n     run at the Federal level, or the state level? In addition, \n     are there other things we can do to help parents and families \n     create the conditions that support a child in his or her \n     vulnerable years, that encourage a child not to start smoking \n     or experiment with drugs?\n       (2) Should we increase the per-pack price; by how much; and \n     how should we do it? Should the funding mechanism be an \n     increase in taxes, or an industry-coordinated price increase? \n     Does Federal action bar States from moving on their own to \n     increase their tobacco taxes, if they so choose?\n       (3) Who gets the money? Should the payments contemplated \n     under the global agreement go directly to the states, go \n     directly to caregivers who treat patients, or be collected \n     and disbursed by the Federal government in existing programs \n     such as Medicaid or Medicare--or should we create a whole new \n     set of programs? Is it appropriate to give billions of \n     dollars to advocacy and interest groups?\n       (4) How are we to treat this in the Federal budget? Should \n     the deal be on or off budget? Should any new spending be \n     subject to the existing discretionary spending caps and pay-\n     as-you-go rules? Should tobacco industry payments and/or \n     penalties be deductible as ordinary business expenses, \n     subject to capitalization as assets, or simply nondeductible?\n       (5) What are the implications for States? Should anything \n     agreed to by Congress and the President, or entered into by \n     the tobacco companies voluntarily, pre-empt State laws or \n     regulations that may be more stringent? Should Federal action \n     rewrite state laws on liability and immunity, or remove \n     pending tobacco cases from state courts to Federal courts? \n     How are states supposed to reconfigure their budget and \n     health programs, and how much money, if any, are they \n     supposed to give to Washington? Does the agreement treat \n     States equitably?\n       (6) What's an appropriate anti-trust exemption for tobacco \n     companies? How large an anti-trust exemption should be \n     granted to the tobacco companies to operate in concert to \n     execute some of the requirements of the agreement?\n       (7) How far should we go on liability and immunity? Is it \n     constitutional, or fair, to eliminate individuals' rights to \n     class-action lawsuits and punitive damages? Are the level of \n     payments, fines and penalties an appropriate trade-off for \n     the industry receiving legal protection in the future? What \n     precedent does this set for other liability issues facing \n     Congress?\n       (8) What new powers should be given to the FDA? How much \n     authority, if any, should Congress grant to the FDA to \n     regulate, or ban, nicotine, or control advertising and sales?\n       (9) How should we take care of those directly hurt by the \n     deal? Under the agreement, farmers will see demand for their \n     product decline. Machine vendors are put out of business. \n     Retailers are required to remodel their stores to put \n     cigarettes out of sight. If a global deal is to be \n     implemented, what is the fairest way to take care of these \n     people?\n       (10) What did the deal leave out that needs to be included? \n     Negotiators left out dealing with drugs, tobacco farmers, \n     immense fees paid to a few lawyers--but what else wasn't \n     thought of that the majority on our committees believe is \n     important? And what, if any, unintended consequences will \n     occur? For example, if tobacco usage does decline, as \n     advocates of the agreement insist, then possibly money paid \n     under the agreement might decline too. Who, then, would pay \n     for all these new initiatives?\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12543-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12546-S12547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FOREIGN OPERATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise to talk a little bit today about \nhow I am extremely disappointed that the House passed the foreign \noperations conference report without the provisions of the State \nDepartment authorization bill attached to it.\n  While the foreign operations bill does many positive things, its \nfailure to include language to reorganize our foreign relations \nbureaucracy and establish benchmarks for the payment of U.N. arrears \nseriously flaws this bill.\n  The proposals to reorganize our foreign policy apparatus and to \nattach the payment of U.S. arrears to U.N. reforms had been carefully \nworked out over many months.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues in the House of Representatives are \nholding these provisions hostage to the Mexico City policy. While I am \na strong supporter of the Mexico City policy, I believe that debate on \nthis issue should not hold up the important United States and U.N. \nforeign policy reforms.\n  Now, if the State Department authorization bill dies in the House, \nthe House has lost the Mexico City policy debate, and the only victory \nthey can claim is that they have given the United Nations new money for \nthe United States assessments, but with no reform strings attached, and \nthey block a reorganization of our foreign policy apparatus that we \nhave pursued for more than four years.\n  That isn't a record they should regard with pride.\n  As chairman of the International Organization Subcommittee, I worked \nhard to help forge a solid, bipartisan United Nations reform package. \nThe Senate's message in crafting this legislation is simple and \nstraightforward:\n  The United States can help make the United Nations a more effective, \nmore\n\n[[Page S12547]]\n\nefficient, and financially sounder organization, but only if the United \nNations and other member states, in return, are willing to finally \nbecome accountable to the American taxpayers.\n  The reforms proposed by the United States are critical to ensure the \nUnited Nations is effective and relevant. We must reform the United \nNations now and the United States has the responsibility to play a \nmajor role in this effort.\n  If we do nothing, and the United Nations collapses under its own \nweight, then we will have only ourselves to blame. So I urge my \ncolleagues to act now, or this window of opportunity may be lost for \nachieving true reform at the United Nations.\n  But passing this U.N. package is not just about a series of reforms \nfor the future. It impacts directly on the credibility of the U.S. \nmission at the United Nations right now.\n  Ambassador Richardson has been pushing other member states to accept \nthe reforms in this package in return for the payment of arrears. Now \nthat package will not arrive.\n  At this critical juncture, when the United Nations is facing down \nSaddam Hussein, and the United States is trying to keep the gulf war \ncoalition unified, it is reckless for the House of Representatives to \ndo anything that would undercut the negotiating position of Ambassador \nRichardson and Secretary of State Albright at the United Nations. And \nbelieve me, the failure to pass this legislation will have a negative \nimpact on the conduct of our foreign policy.\n  Madam President, the United States does not owe most of these arrears \nto the United Nations. It owes them to our allies, like France, for \nreimbursement for peacekeeping expenses.\n  Under normal circumstances, I am the last one who could be expected \nto make a pitch for funding for France. But considering that France is \none of the members on the Security Council that is going soft on Iraq--\nsoft on Saddam Hussein--depriving the United States Government the \nability to use these funds as leverage is irresponsible. After all, our \ndiplomats need carrots as well as sticks to achieve our foreign policy \ngoals.\n  Madam President, I am hopeful that my colleagues in the House will \nsee the wisdom of adopting measures that will enhance America's ability \nto exert leadership in the international arena through the \nconsolidation of our foreign relations apparatus and the revitalization \nof the United Nations.\n  The State Department authorization bill should be allowed to pass or \nfail on its own merit--not on the merits of the Mexico City policy. \nThis agreement is in America's best interest, and the best interest of \nthe entire international community.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I see no other Senators wishing to speak, so I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about what \na joyous day of wrap-up of the Senate in the first year of the 2-year \nCongress could be if, as a matter of fact, we left here after \ncompleting the appropriations bills and went about our business to go \nhome to our home States, had a good Christmas season, worked with all \nof our constituents, and then came back next year, the second year of a \nCongress, and the appropriations were already done and the budget was \nalready done. But that is not going to happen.\n  We just finished appropriations, I assume we will hear shortly. And \nwhat has taken up the entire year? I don't have the statistics. But \nearly next year I will put them in the Record. But I am just going to \nask the Senators who have a little recollection of the year to just \nthink about what we did.\n  First of all, we worked diligently on a balanced budget. That didn't \noccur until late May and early June. I am trying mightily to think what \nwas accomplished before that, thankfully. I wish I had a better memory. \nBut I don't think we did a lot. A few bills here and there, but I am \nsure we didn't have any superb oversight.\n  People are all waiting for what? For the budget. And then for what? \nAll the appropriations bills that have to come after it. Oh, by the \nway, in between, we had to implement the budget with those two big \nreconciliation bills.\n  So essentially we stand on the threshold of wrapping up the Congress \nfor a year, and we start next year. We are going to anxiously await the \nPresident's budget--another 1-year budget. Would it have been better \nfor America, for the U.S. Congress, for all the agencies that are \nfunded, from NIH to some grant to a university, to our Armed Forces, \nand all the money that they have to spend if they could have a 2-year \nappropriation? Wouldn't we be better off, in a 2-year Congress--that is \nwhat we are, by the Constitution--if in 1 year we did all of the \nbudgeting and all of the appropriations?\n  I have been working on budgets and appropriations bills long enough \nto know that there are all kinds of reasons for not doing 2-year \nbudgets. I am an appropriator who thinks we should have a 2-year \nbudget. Maybe many of the appropriators think we are better off sending \nour little measures to the President every year, and maybe we get more \nthat way.\n  Just look at the 2-year appropriations. You get 2 years in there \nbecause we do 2-year appropriations bills. If you are worried about \ngetting enough things in it, you can do it twice, even as we \nappropriate only one time for 2 years. But I don't think there is a \ngreat majority who are worried about that. I think we just are fearful \nto break with tradition. Somehow or another we have been appropriating \nevery year.\n  Then when we wrote the Budget Act not too long ago, we said, ``Well, \nwe have to have a budget every year.''\n  So what do we do? We do that. It is almost like we get started next \nyear, and we are right back at the budget, which many people think we \njust finished. Sure enough, in the middle of the year, some \nappropriators will start looking at their bills, and sure enough, we \nwill be back here, predictably--if not at this time a little later--and \nwe will still have two or three appropriations bills that we can't get \ncompleted. Why? Because they are being held up by authorization riders \nthat are very, very much in contention.\n  I ask, wouldn't we be better off if we had that kind of argument, be \nit on the money that we now refer to as the ``Mexican issue'' with \nreference to birth control and the kinds of family planning that we put \nmoney into foreign countries for, wouldn't we be better off if we voted \non that only once every 2 years? It would have exactly the same effect. \nIn fact, we could fight just one time out of 2 years. We could send \nthese little bills back and forth between the President and the \nCongress with these little 1-day extensions of Government. We could do \nthat only 1 year out of 2, and everybody could make the same vote. \nEverybody could make their case in the same way. But who would gain?\n  I believe the institution known as the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House \nof Representatives would gain immensely. In fact, might I suggest that \nwhat it means to be a U.S. Senator would be dramatically changed if we \nhad 2-year appropriations, a 2-year budgeting, because, if we did these \nevery 2 years, we would be able to have oversight and see what is \nhappening to the programs that we fund and the programs that we put in \nmotion through the process called authorization.\n  Then, Madam President and fellow Senators and anybody interested in \ngood government, we have not yet been able to encapsulate into our \nthinking what the executive branch of Government wastes by having to \nproduce a budget every single year with budget hearings at the OMB, \nwith people who\n\n[[Page S12548]]\n\nare planning over at the National Institutes of Health to get a program \ngoing that is going to be 10 years in duration and come and present \nthis 1-year part of that every single year. As a matter of fact, there \nwould be twice as much time to do the things we are neglecting--to \ndebate foreign policy in a real way, to have a 2- or 3-month debate on \ntax reform where people would really spend time. And day after day we \ncould be on the floor instead of in some little room under the threat \nof a bill reconciliation measure from the budget process telling you to \nget it done in 25 days. We could have people looking at education, at \nthe myriad and scores of bills that are already out there that are \nfunding programs. Instead of finding new ones every year and new \nproblems, we would go back and look to see what the whole entourage of \neducation money looks like. Are there programs there that aren't \nworking? But you need a lot of time to do that. You can't be getting up \nand running to the floor to vote every single year on 50 to 60 budget \namendments, all of the appropriations bills with their attendant \namendments, and then have to have your staff focus on what is in each \none of those bills only to find you are back again in 6 months doing \nthe same thing over again.\n  As a matter of fact, the more I think about that and the more I talk \nabout it, the more I think I am prepared to say for us to appropriate \nand budget annually when the Constitution says Congress lasts for 2 \nyears, that it is absurd from the standpoint of modern planning with \nthe modern tools we have to do the estimating that we are doing every \nyear instead of doing it for 2 years.\n  Some are going to say you are going to have to have a lot of \nsupplemental appropriations. I am sure the occupant of the chair is \nalready hearing that when she speaks about 2-year appropriations and 2-\nyear budgets. Let me tell you, even with 1-year appropriations, we have \nto have supplementals because some few things break in the Government, \nand we are not quite right on, and we have to go fix them. But there is \na way to limit the supplementals even in a 2-year process to no more \nthan we are doing now.\n  Once I asked four different departments of Government, as they \nreported to the Appropriations Committee, to give us information on the \nappropriations before us on that particular year and asked how much of \nit is similar if not exactly the same as last year's. You would be \nsurprised. As much as 90 percent of appropriations bills are the same \nyear after year. Isn't it interesting? We debate them all over again. \nWe mark them up all over again, and we add these amendments that cause \nus to debate ad infinitum, which could just as well be 2-year \namendments as 1-year. But we do it to ourselves by making sure we go \nthrough this kind of difficult confrontational atmosphere every single \nyear.\n  Put yourself in the position of those in America that we have said \nshould get some Government money for something. I have spoken to large \ngroups of scientists from our universities, from our hospital research \ncenters, from our laboratories, and they all want more certainty of \nfunding. Of course, they would all like more funding. But they shout to \nthe rooftops when you say, wouldn't you prefer to have 2 years instead \nof 1 year as your appropriation? Could you manage it better? Could you \nbe more efficient? The answer to all of those questions is \n``absolutely.'' Yet, we remain stuck in the mud of tradition saying we \nhave to do it every single year.\n  There is a bill pending. It has cleared the Governmental Operations \nCommittee 13 to 1--S. 261. It is here. It is at the desk. I am thankful \nthat since we have a 2-year Congress, it is still at the desk. Congress \nisn't finished until next year come January.\n  I am going to work very hard with others in this Senate to urge that \nour leader schedule early a lengthy time on the floor in the early days \nof the Congress to debate this issue. Thirty-three Senators from both \nsides of the aisle cosponsored the measure before it cleared \nGovernmental Operations. I believe, if I had enough time to circulate \nit even more among Senators, that I would have had more than 50 \nSenators supporting it. It might be because of the processes around \nhere that there will be a Senator who will object, and we might have to \nget 60 votes, because obviously changing the budget to 2 years and the \nappropriations for 2 years could be a controversial issue.\n  So I am prepared for the 60-vote requirement. But even at that, I \nwant to say to those who oppose it, who oppose this modernization, this \nbringing into modern times of our processes around here, that I believe \nthere are more than 60 Senators if they hear the debate and if we \nconfigure that debate so as to make the Senators feel just like we are \nfinished here today instead of next February or March, we could be \nsaying if this 2-year budget, 2-year appropriations bill, had passed, \nwe would be finished for a full year. We could do other things, and the \ndepartments of our Government could go about their business without \npreparing yet another budget and going through all of the rigor, time, \neffort, and lack of efficiency that comes with that.\n  So, Madam President and fellow Senators, I just want to make two \nwrap-up points. I believe anybody watching this year, if presented with \na real opportunity to go through this only once every 2 years instead \nof twice and have time for other things, we would probably have a huge, \nhuge plurality voting with us.\n  The American people can't get excited about process issues, but if \nthey understood what we go through and what we have assigned to \nourselves, to the executive branch and to all those that we fund by way \nof making it difficult and tough and inefficient by doing the same \nthing over each year, then I think the American people would be excited \nby this reform. If the people knew we could do it for 2 years at a \ntime, if we could just get that out there, get that debated in a very \nopen manner that everybody understands, then we might have kind of a \nbirth of modernization, kind of a ray of light shining on these \nprocesses, and I believe the American people would gain.\n  I believe we would do our jobs better. I believe we could do \noversight; we could have more hearings; we could actually, every couple \nof years, take a month or two and go out in the hinterland and hold \nhearings in our country which wouldn't be all that bad. How are we \ngoing to do it under the current annual process? Somebody think of that \naround here and the first thing you know there will be five \nappropriations bills ready for the normal 50 votes, or a budget \nresolution taking 2, 3 weeks, taking vote after vote after vote, half \nof them being sense-of-the-Senate issues which shouldn't be even \nallowed on a budget resolution, but that is the current process.\n  So that is one point. We would be doing the American people a better \njob if we could do that.\n  And second, the Senate and House would be better places within which \nto do business for the American people if there wasn't so much \nredundancy and waste of time and effort. So we are going to try to see \nif we can accomplish both of those goals which I think are rather \nadmirable.\n  I do not want to leave the wrong impression for those who seek to \ndefeat this measure that it violates the Budget Act. The bill is not \nsubject to a 60-vote point of order. It just takes a simple majority. \nIt has been in both committees. That is why we went through that. It's \ngone to the Governmental Affairs Committee. Then it went to the Budget \nCommittee, which was discharged, and so it is here as any other normal \nbill. So if we get that magic 51 votes, we can change this process.\n  I just want to put in the Record the major legislation that passed \nthis year and even some of our authorizing processes were very late for \none reason or another. While a great deal of legislation has passed, we \nonly will clear about three major authorization bills for the \nPresident's signature: DOD authorization, FDA reform, SBA reform. The \ncompelling amount of time and the overwhelming majority of effort was \nspent on the budget resolution, two reconciliation bills, and 13 \nappropriations bills. And we haven't quite done that; six continuing \nresolutions before we're done tonight. I do not blame anyone for that. \nThe chairman of the Appropriations Committee this year has been a \nstalwart in trying to get the appropriations bills done on time. He has \nnot benefited from the two Houses being able to agree on four or five \nissues and a majority in the House being on the opposite side of the \nPresident on two or three issues.\n\n[[Page S12549]]\n\n  Besides appropriations, we spent a great deal of effort on the budget \nresolution and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 1997--the two reconciliation bills called for by the balanced \nbudget agreement and the budget resolution. And frankly, hardly any \ntime was left for other major bills to be debated for any length of \ntime, and I think we can do our job a lot better than that.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, a little over a week ago, I stood to \nintroduce the Finance Committee's fast track bill. On that occasion, I \nmade it clear that fast track authority is important to America's \nfuture. I advocated the need for American leadership if we are to make \nprogress in expanding economic opportunities for individuals and \nfamilies here at home.\n  I emphasized that America has always been a trading nation. From \ncolonial times to the creation of the post-World War II international \neconomic order, the United States has pressed for open commerce, free \nof discriminatory preferences and trade-distorting barriers.\n  From battles with Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli to the \narduous negotiations that led to the signing of the Uruguay round \nagreements in Marrakesh, Morocco, we have promoted and defended open, \nfair, and unfettered trade.\n  The United States has been a driving force for expanding world trade \nand the prosperity it yields, particularly over the last six decades. \nFrom the creation of the GATT, to the initiation of each successive \nround of multilateral trade negotiations, to the political will to \nconclude the Uruguay round, America has taken the lead.\n  We have pursued this course in our own economic and political self-\ninterest. In purely economic terms, the United States is the world's \nlargest trading state and the largest beneficiary of the international \ntrading system. We lead the world in both exports and imports.\n  Thirty percent of our current annual economic growth depends on \nexports. Eleven million jobs are directly tied to those export sales.\n  According to the Federal Reserve, our two-way trade, both exports and \nimports, have played a major role in the 7 years of sustained, \nnoninflationary economic growth we enjoy today. And no other nation in \nthe world is so well positioned to bless its citizens through open \ntrade than America. Our Nation, better than any other, is situated to \nsucceed in a global economy.\n  We have the diversity of cultures, the most advanced technology, the \nmost efficient capital markets, and a corporate sector that is \nconstantly innovating and has already gone through substantial \nrestructuring that is necessary for global competition. We have a \nsingle currency, a common language, and the important blessing of \ngeography: we are a nation--a continent--that looks both to Europe and \nto Asia.\n  No other nation is so well positioned to reap the blessings of a \nglobal economy. As Thomas L. Friedman suggested in the New York Times, \nAmerica, as a nation, almost appears to have been designed to compete \nin such a world.\n  Having said this, let me be clear that we have not pursued the goal \nof liberalizing trade solely because it is in our own economic interest \nto do so. We have pursued that goal because it is in our political and \nsecurity interests as well.\n  It is worth noting, in the shadow of the Veterans Day remembrance, \nthat conflicts over trade in the 1930's deepened the Great Depression \nprofoundly and fostered the political movements that gave us the Second \nWorld War. Our own revolution was fought in large part because of the \nconstraints Great Britain imposed on the colonies' trade. Indeed, it is \ndifficult to recall any great conflict in which trade did not play a \npart.\n  In my view, prosperity is the surest means to secure peace, both \nbecause it strengthens our capacity to maintain our defense and because \nit reduces the causes of conflicts that lead to war.\n  In this Chamber, we have had a spirited debate that has raised a \nnumber of significant issues--from alleged flaws in our trade \nagreements, to the causes and consequences of the trade deficit, to the \nissues of labor standards and the environment. We have benefited from \nthis exchange of views on both sides. And, I was heartened by the vote \nin the Senate to move to proceed to debate the Finance Committee's bill \nextending fast track negotiating authority--a vote that commanded a \nmajority of Members from both sides of the aisle.\n  As heartened as I was by our vote, I was as disappointed in the \nPresident's decision to ask that the measure not be put to a vote in \nthe House. It is clear, from all reports, that the President was unable \nto move a sufficient number of Members of his own party to join in the \neffort to promote American economic and political interests abroad.\n  My first thought on hearing of the President's decision, however, was \nnot about the past. My first thought was for the future.\n  I say this because I happen to believe that we are on the edge of an \nera of unparalleled prosperity, not just in the United States, but \nthroughout the world. But the realization of such prosperity will \ndepend on conditions. It will depend on our making the right kinds of \nchoices.\n  It will depend on our ability to advance the cause of open markets \nand the freedom to compete fairly throughout the world.\n  Walter Lippman coined the term the ``American Century'' to apply to \nthe decades from the turn of the century during which the United States \ngrew to a position of unrivaled economic, political, and cultural \nstrength. I happen to believe that we are now entering a second \n``American Century,'' if we have the courage to embrace the challenges \nand opportunities of international leadership that our greater destiny \noffers us.\n  We will not advance our own cause if we shirk that responsibility. \nNor will we serve the generations of Americans that follow us if we \nshrink from an expansive vision of what we can accomplish together if \nwe, as Americans, remain united in a common purpose.\n  In the abstract and arcane world of international trade, there is \nlittle that is not subject to debate and differing points of view. One \nexception, however, is that for the world to make progress, the United \nStates must lead.\n  This is the essence of the fast track debate--whether we would offer \nthe President the means by which he can exercise American leadership on \nthe trade front. Absent fast track, he will not have a seat at the \ntable. The rules of the road will be written without our full \nparticipation. History tells us that, when that happens, the world does \nnot move in the direction of open, unfettered commerce, but in the \ndirection of preferential trading systems often designed to exclude the \nUnited States.\n  There are a series of negotiations on the horizon within the WTO and \nother forums. They will redefine the rules in areas like agriculture, \nfinancial services, and basic customs rules applicable to every product \nimported into, or exported from, the United States.\n  They will proceed without us and in a direction we will not like if \nthe President lacks the authority to engage and lead. And if that is \nthe case, we are certain to lose a great deal. For example, Charlene \nBarshefsky reminds us that in the area of negotiating market access to \ngovernment procurement, there is over a trillion dollars at stake in \nAsia alone. In services, there is over a $1.2 trillion global market, \nand in agriculture over $600 billion.\n  I doubt whether the farmers of America will believe that it will be a \nsufficient response to say that we failed to act on fast track because \nwe did not understand the true cause of our trade deficit and therefore \nleft it to others to define the rules that will govern our agricultural \ntrade into the 21st century.\n  For that reason--for what is at stake for Americans, for our \nfamilies, for\n\n[[Page S12550]]\n\njobs--high paying jobs--I want to see us return to the issue of trade \nnegotiating authority in the coming session of Congress. I want to see \nboth Houses of Congress move on as broad a front as possible to secure \nour economic future.\n  Because of what is at stake, we must make progress where we can, \nregardless of how broad a consensus we can ultimately achieve. We need \nto address the reality of these impending items on the international \nagenda and define the strategy the United States will promote in each. \nThat does not give us the luxury of waiting until a final consensus has \nbeen reached on every issue raised in our recent debates. We need to be \nable to make an impact now and I will be working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to ensure that we do.\n  As for building a stronger bipartisan consensus for the long run on \ntrade, my sense from our debates is that there are a number of \nimportant issues that need to be examined. They need to be examined in \na way that would excise the politics and help us all understand the \ndynamics at work in an increasingly global economy. We need to develop \na mechanism for addressing these issues, helping us resolve our \ncollective concerns, and allowing us to move forward in a way that will \nbenefit all working Americans. I intend to work closely with my \ncolleagues toward this end in the coming months.\n  Let me conclude with words of praise for each and every Member of \nthis body. I believe that we have shown incredible leadership ourselves \non an issue of the utmost importance to America.\n  I know we share a common goal of a stronger American economy that \nbenefits all working men and women. In the months ahead, let us unite \nin an effort to resolve the differences between ourselves in order to \nremove the roadblocks that stand between us and that common goal. Let \nus pull together in this coming session of Congress to redefine the \ndebate in terms of the progress we can make together toward our \nultimate objective.\n  Based on the Senate's record in the past, I have great confidence \nthat we can and will take that step forward to embrace a brighter \nAmerican future. I thank my colleagues for their efforts over the \nrecent weeks, and look forward to the opportunity to rejoin them in \npursuit of the greater good for all Americans in this coming session.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to recognize \nthe work of a man who has been a real asset to this institution. He has \nmany fans in this room, both here on the floor of the Senate and up \nthere in the press gallery. His name is Maurice Johnson, Superintendent \nof the Senate Press Photographers Gallery. He is retiring this year \nafter nearly 30 years.\n  What a perspective--30 years of life in the Senate through a \nphotographer's eye. Maurice has seen the entire range of congressional \nmilestones, celebrations, inaugurations, investigations, and, of \ncourse, occasional legislation. He has taken part in sharing those \nevents with the world, helping in many ways to ensure that the media \ncoverage has run smoothly. No one has yet found a corner of the Capitol \nfor which Maurice doesn't know the best angle and lighting.\n  Maurice is a voice for all photographers who cover the Senate day to \nday. As liaison between the Senators and the photographers, he has been \nan effective adviser, advocate, and coordinator.\n  He has been most helpful to my staff and to me over the past year and \na half as we have adjusted to our leadership role. I thank him for his \ngraciousness always under all circumstances.\n  We should not forget that Maurice is an accomplished photographer \nhimself. He captured history as he covered the administrations of \nPresidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. Many of the \nimages that we have from national political campaigns and conventions \nare Maurice's work. Some assignments must have been less like work than \nothers, though. Photography for him has included the Redskins games or \nthe U.S. Open golf tournament. Sometimes it has been the Miss America \npageant. It certainly seems to me he hasn't exactly always had a tough \nday at the office. It sounds like it has been fun.\n  His talents have been rewarded by a steady stream of awards that have \nnames like ``Best Picture of the Year'' and ``First Prize.'' He has \nbeen honored nationally for single photos, for his work in the Senate \nPhotographers Gallery, and for the entire span of his career.\n  At a recent reception in Maurice's honor, the room overflowed with \ncolleagues, friends, and family members who conveyed their affection \nand high regard for him. Now, as the session draws to a close, I want \nto take the opportunity to let Maurice know how much we in the Senate \nappreciate him and his work. I am sure my colleagues join me in \nthanking him for his many years of dedication. We wish him, his wife \nLanny, and their children, Keith and Maureen, well.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I noted on Monday of this week that the \nadministration had taken an important step on drug policy. I think, \nhowever, it was very much a misstep, and I do not think the \nadministration played fair in doing it. Each year, the Congress \nrequires the administration to submit a list of countries to be \nconsidered for certification on drug cooperation. This is called the \nMajors List.\n  The list serves as a basis for considering whether the countries \nlisted have fully cooperated with the United States to control drug \nproduction and trafficking. It is this list that the President then \nconsiders for certification on March 1 of each year.\n  This year, and in keeping with what seems to be a tradition with this \nadministration, the list came up to the Hill very, very late. Because \nof this and because of the history of tardiness, I decided to send a \nmessage to the administration, one that seemed necessary to get their \nattention. So I put a hold on several ambassadorial nominations to send \nthe signal that Congress takes compliance with this certification law \non the Majors List very seriously. After more than a week's delay, we \nfinally received the list. As a result, I removed my holds, but the \nlist as a document contains an omission that deserves careful notice.\n  Left off the list were the countries of Syria and Lebanon. Not just \nleft off, but what does that mean, ``left off''? In this backhanded \nway, the administration decided in one big step to certify these two \ncountries as somehow fully cooperating with the rest of the world, in \nthis case the United States, on drug policy.\n  Let's think about this for a moment. Syria has been decertified for \nover 10 years. Syria was not certified even during Desert Storm or \nDesert Shield when it was one of our allies in that war. Lebanon has \njust received a national-interest waiver--a decertification with \nsomehow a get-out-of-jail-free card. Now, without debate or without \nsubstantive explanation, the administration has simply left these two \ncountries off the list. This is a momentous change in policy. It \nreverses years of consideration, and it appears to ignore considerable \nevidence.\n  In the letter forwarding the list to Congress, the President makes \ntwo arguments for doing this. Neither argument stands up well.\n  The first argument seems to advance the idea that because Syrian and \nLebanese cultivation of opium has dropped below 1,000 hectares, that \nthis act alone justifies a reconsideration of their being on the list.\n  It may justify a reconsideration, possibly, but it hardly justifies \nbackdoor certification, and this is backdoor certification. Even the \nState Department's own annual drug report makes\n\n[[Page S12551]]\n\nit clear that both Syria and Lebanon remain major transiting countries \nfor drugs. This criterion alone is enough to qualify for inclusion on \nthe Majors List, but the administration then advances the argument that \nthis is somehow OK, because the drugs do not come into the United \nStates. There seems to be some belief in the administration that this \nis a justification for not keeping these two countries on the Majors \nList. However, it is apparent the administration does not read the law \nor doesn't even read its own reports.\n  But even if the facts supported removing Syria from the list, which \nthey do not, the Congress deserves to be briefed on this momentous \nchange beforehand. Israel and other European allies deserve notice of \nthis dramatic change of our policy. The American public deserves a \nchance to understand the change. This did not happen. Instead, what we \nhave is indirect certification. As a result, Syria will now escape \nserious consideration next March, despite evidence of significant \ntrafficking and production of these illegal drugs.\n  When my staff first learned of the prospect of the change in policy, \nI told them to indicate to the State Department that this would be a \nvery, very big mistake. I hoped that the Department would not take the \nstep that they took.\n  I was of the opinion, however, mistake though it was, that if the \nadministration wanted to proceed well, then it was their call. I did \nnot extend my hold on the ambassadorial nominations to cover the issue \nof Syria, and I withdrew my hold on these nominations as soon as the \nlist was delivered, late though it was. But this list raises yet \nanother concern.\n  What we are left with, days before Congress adjourns, is a roundabout \ncertification of Syria. I believe, as I said before, that such a \ndecision is a big blunder. The way it was done does not do justice to \nthe issue or the process of certification.\n  If it had not been done this way, imagine for a moment how the issue \nwould have been handled. Next year, in February, the administration \nwould have to make a decision to certify Syria or not based on the \nmerits. It would have to make a case to Congress at that point and even \nto the public at that point for such a move. There may be some who \nbelieve that in that more straightforward environment, the same \ndecision would have been made, but I doubt it.\n  With time to reflect and to consider, to publicly debate the issues \nand the facts, I seriously doubt that this administration would have \ncertified Syria as fully cooperating in drug control. So not wanting to \nface the music, the administration did this behind-the-scene two-step \ninstead. I hope the administration will reconsider, and I hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in signing a letter to the President asking him \nto relook the issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter by myself from \nthis body and Congressman J.C. Watts, who is leading the effort in the \nHouse of Representatives, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 13, 1997.\n     The President of the United States,\n     Executive Office of the President, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We note with concern that you have not \n     included Syria and Lebanon on the annual Majors List sent to \n     the Congress. By this act, you have, in effect, certified \n     Syria as fully cooperating on drug control issues. The \n     arguments advanced in your transmittal letter to Congress, \n     however, seems to be based on assumptions supported neither \n     in the relevant law or by the facts. Even should the facts \n     justify the decision to ultimately certify Syria and Lebanon, \n     however, we are also concerned about the method by which this \n     momentous decision was reached. This change in policy and \n     approach was not discussed with Congress nor was there an \n     effort made to establish the justifications for this action. \n     Instead, the decision was made in a most indirect way at the \n     end of the Congressional year, thus precluding debate or \n     public discussion of the issues.\n       For these reasons, we hope that you will reconsider the \n     decision to place Syria and Lebanon on the Majors List. That \n     change will then provide the Administration, Congress, and \n     the public the opportunity to discuss the merits of this \n     decision publicly, with ample time to reflect on the \n     justifications for such a decision.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     J.C.

Mr. President, I spoke a week ago about the necessity \nof the inspector general of the Treasury Department to resign. I want \nto continue that discussion, because she has not done that yet.\n  Next year is going to mark the 20th anniversary of the Inspector \nGeneral Act of 1978. In my experience, inspectors general are an \nimportant function of our system of checks and balances. Whereas \ncommittees of Congress may not have the time or inclination to perform \nrigorous oversight, which happens to be our constitutional \nresponsibility, the inspectors general offices are there full time with \nnothing else to do.\n  I have worked very closely with many IG's. For the most part, they \nare good at what they do. The IG Act has been a tremendous success. \nHundreds of billions of dollars have been saved by inspectors general.\n  At the same time, rarely has the IG's integrity been called into \nquestion. That is, at least until now, Mr. President. The integrity of \nthe inspector general of the Treasury Department, Valerie Lau, has been \ncalled into question.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator \nSusan Collins, held 2 days of hearings just last month. The \nsubcommittee found that the IG broke the law twice and violated the \nstandards of ethical conduct. These violations involved the letting of \ntwo sole-source contracts, one to a long-time associate of hers. In \naddition, her office improperly opened a criminal investigation on two \nSecret Service agents. In that matter, at least one key document was \ndestroyed--just plain destroyed. And that indicated a coverup.\n\n  Furthermore, the inspector general provided false information to \nCongress. And that is a no-no for anybody, but particularly for \nsomebody charged with looking out to see that laws are faithfully \nenforced and that money is properly spent. Of all people in the \nbureaucracy, the inspector general should be most careful.\n  The irony in all of this is, the IG is supposed to stop this kind of \nactivity, not commit it. Yet that is what Valerie Lau did.\n  Mr. President, the charge that IG Lau violated these legal and \nethical standards is not conjecture. It is not someone's opinion or \njudgment. They are simple facts--concrete facts. They are findings. \nThey are findings of a subcommittee of the Congress of the United \nStates. They are found in conjunction with the independent and \nnonpartisan General Accounting Office.\n  Bad enough that these violations occurred by a watchdog, a watchdog \nwhose job it is to deter such actions, but this IG's reaction is even \nmore troubling. She agreed that they were technical violations of law, \nbut she thinks that her actions were justified.\n  The Treasury IG is one of the most important of all inspector general \npositions. Perhaps it is the most important. The Treasury IG oversees \n300 employees, many of whom are law enforcement officers.\n  How in the world can we allow an IG who violated the law twice and \nwho is in denial about committing the violations to continue to perform \nthe important functions of inspector general? How can the public, how \ncan the Congress, how can even her own employees have confidence that \nshe knows the difference between what is and what is not the law?\n  Her responsibility is to catch those who break the law. That is what \nan inspector general is supposed to be doing. How can she do that given \nher own actions and her responses to the findings of the General \nAccounting Office?\n  Ten days ago, Mr. President, immediately after Senator Collins' \nhearings, I called, as I said previously today, for Inspector General \nLau's resignation, citing all these aforementioned violations. I cited \nthe need for the IGs to be beyond reproach, to have the highest \nstandards of integrity and credibility and conduct. The public's trust \nand confidence in this inspector general has without a doubt been \nundermined.\n  Today, I renew my call for her resignation. If the Treasury IG does \nnot\n\n[[Page S12552]]\n\nget it, does not get that she should step down, the Treasury Secretary \nshould. The President should as well. The Treasury Secretary has a \nresponsibility, under this law, to generally supervise the IG. However, \nonly Presidents can fire inspectors general. In my view, that means \nthat Secretary Rubin is obliged to review the record and to make a \nrecommendation to the President. The President would be obliged to take \naction and notify Congress of his action and why he took it. It should \nbe done swiftly. As long as this IG remains in office, her troops \nremain demoralized and the IG's important work will be neutered.\n  There has been a lot of talk around Washington that recent IG hires \nhave lacked experience and background. That is certainly the case with \nthe Treasury inspector general.\n  I went back and reviewed the record of her confirmation. Her hearing \nlasted nearly 5 minutes. She was asked just one question--whether her \nmother was present in the audience. To follow up, questions were then \nasked of her mother. That ended the confirmation process.\n  For the record, I want to make it clear that I am a member of the \ncommittee, the Finance Committee, that conducted the confirmation \nhearing. I did not attend the hearing, but I submitted an extensive \nlist of questions for the record. And I received responses. They are \npart of the permanent record.\n  As a result, I feel some obligation that I did not do more to \nquestion Inspector General Lau's credentials and experience at the \ntime. I guess that is because you like to give the President's nominee \nthe benefit of the doubt. I guess I learned the hard way that for the \nposition of inspector general, questioning one's experience and \nqualifications obviously is paramount.\n  I intend to be more aggressive on that score in the future. The \nInspector Generals Act requires that the IG have ``demonstrated \nability.'' That is in the law, the words ``demonstrated ability.'' And \nit is in the law not once, not twice, but seven different areas of the \nlaw.\n  Here is what the IG Act of 1978 says:\n\n       There shall be at the head of each office an inspector \n     general who shall be appointed by the President, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate, without regard to \n     political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity \n     and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial \n     analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or \n     investigations.\n  Ms. Lau would attempt to claim a demonstrated ability in accounting \nand auditing. She is a CPA and has been a Government auditor and \nevaluator. But in this area of auditing, she had reached only a GS-13 \nlevel. She managed only three employees, according to her deposition. \nAnd there was a 5-year gap between this experience and when she was \nfinally confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n  How does that translate into becoming the head of a 300-employee \noperation that conducts huge, complex audits and even criminal \ninvestigations?\n  What is clear is that Ms. Lau began the process of getting placed \nwithin this administration through the Democratic National Committee. \nWere the political connections enough to get the job? I hope that is \nnot the case. We should have higher standards than that for the job of \ninspector general, which is a very important job.\n  Reflecting back on the statute, the inspector general was not \nqualified in the first place. Once in office, she undermines her own \nintegrity and credibility. She no longer has the moral authority needed \nto lead that office. To me, it is an open and shut case. Verdict: Time \nfor new leadership.\n  That brings me to my final point. This body would do well in the \nfuture to watchdog the watchdogs. And the inspectors general are \nwatchdogs within each department, both before confirmation and during \ntheir tenure, I might say. I, for one, intend to increase my own \nvigilance of the IG community, as well as the experience and background \nof nominees.\n  For starters, there is the IG's peers--called the President's \nCommission on Integrity and Efficiency.\n  The PCIE, as I will call it for short, was established to conduct \npeer review and investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the IG. It is \ncomprised of other IG's and is overseen by the Office of Management and \nBudget. It is also known as a do-nothing organization. IG's have \nrarely, if ever, been disciplined for wrongdoing by this organization.\n  Last April, I forwarded the allegations against Inspector General Lau \nto the PCIE. The issues involving the illegal contracts that she let \nwere sent to the PCIE, by the PCIE to the Public Integrity Section of \nthe Justice Department. The allegations involving her improper opening \nof a criminal case against two Secret Service agents was sent to the \nindependent counsel.\n  Because of the long process PCIE has, which takes up to 6 months, \nSenator Collins and her staff decided to act swiftly and dig out all \nthe facts without the usual bureaucratic delay. Meanwhile, by July, the \nPCIE shut down its entire involvement in this matter of Inspector \nGeneral Lau.\n  Now that Senator Collins' investigation is over, and the findings are \non the table, now is the time for decisive action. Instead, and in very \ntypical fashion, here is what is going on.\n  Even though only the President can fire the IG, the White House is \nsaying it is up to the Treasury Department to act. The Treasury \nDepartment, which must, according to law, generally supervise the IG, \nsays it is up to the PCIE to act. The problem is, the PCIE does not \nact. Besides, they washed their hands of this matter way back in July. \nThe only possible PCIE involvement at this point would be to drag out \nany decision. That is because the PCIE process takes 6 bureaucratically \nlong months.\n  What is going on here, Mr. President? Where is the decisionmaking? \nWhere is the leadership? Where is the sense of outrage from an \nadministration that says it will tolerate nothing but the highest \nstandards? This issue demands action, not finger pointing. The longer \nit takes, the more we undermine the public's trust and confidence in \nthis administration and in our Government generally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12551-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12552-S12554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on another matter, I want to speak for a \nminute on the failure of fast-track trade negotiating authority for the \nPresident of the United States and the action of the House of \nRepresentatives this past weekend.\n  Last week, the Senate voted by a margin of 68 to 31 to proceed to \ndebate on the fast-track bill. I believe without a doubt it would have \npassed here and would have been passed by a very huge bipartisan \nmargin. But the leadership in the House decided not to bring the bill \nto a vote and risk a defeat on such an important issue for our Nation. \nThe leadership of the House decided that on the advice of the President \nof the United States because he could not deliver even 20 percent of \nthe Democrat vote, the vote of his own party, in the other body.\n  Unfortunately, the result is the same. The President of the United \nStates still does not have the negotiating authority that every other \nPresident since Gerald Ford has had. How ironic that the Democratic-\ncontrolled Congresses in the past granted fast-track authority to a \nRepublican President--such as Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George \nBush--and yet Democrats in this Congress refuse to give the President, \na President from their own party, the same authority. Who would have \nthought that the President could not convince one-fifth of his own \nparty to vote with him on such an important issue? This was a big win \nfor leaders of labor unions in Washington. They proved that they have \nmore influence with Democrats in the House of Representatives than the \nPresident of the United States does. But it was not a win for the rank \nand file union members, the workers who manufacture the products or \nperform the services that would be exported throughout the world.\n  It was not a win for the farmers of America either who increasingly \ndepend on foreign markets for a big share of their income. It was a big \nloss for working men and women of this country.\n  I know some may question my qualifications for drawing these \nconclusions. You might say, how can a Republican Senator substitute his \njudgment for that of labor leaders? So I would like to read a few \nquotes from a Washington Post editorial of November 11.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Washington Post has often taken the\n\n[[Page S12553]]\n\nside of labor against Republican policies. So I believe they might have \nsome credibility on this issue, as well.\n  Labor opposed fast track because they believe that liberalized trade \nleads to American companies relocating to other countries and American \nworkers losing their jobs to imports. They also argued that fast track \nwas flawed because it didn't give the President authority to force \nother countries to adopt our labor and environmental standards.\n  The Washington Post, for one, believes that the lack of fast-track \nauthority actually makes it more likely that Americans will lose their \njobs. The Washington Post says that the President, not having \nnegotiating authority, makes it more likely that American workers will \nlose their jobs.\n\n       . . . while fast track's defeat may be good news for a few \n     unions . . . it certainly doesn't help the vast majority of \n     American workers. With the President less able to knock down \n     trade barriers overseas, U.S. manufacturing firms will have \n     more, not less, incentive to relocate, to get footholds, \n     inside closed markets.\n\n  That bears repeating, Mr. President. Without fast track, companies \nhave more incentive to relocate. That's because high trade barriers may \nprohibit U.S. companies from exporting to a foreign market. In order to \nsell in that area the company would actually relocate there.\n  Why would we want a trade policy in this country that would make an \nAmerican company go to some other country to make a product to sell in \nthat country, when if you reduce the barriers in that other country \nthrough these negotiations, that company could stay in America and \nexport to that country and become competitive?\n  Just within the last 2 weeks, I had a CEO of a major corporation in \nDes Moines, IA, our capital city, who said if the President doesn't get \nthis authority and the barrier to Chile reduced through trade or \nthrough trade negotiations, then he was going to have to move there to \nbuild to do the business in South America that he wants to do.\n  The United States has one of the most open economies in the world. \nOur average tariff is just 2.8 percent. Many other countries have \nvirtually closed markets. According to the World Bank, for instance, \nChina's average tariff is 23 percent; Thailand, 26 percent; the \nPhilippines, 19 percent; Peru, 15 percent; Chile, a flat 11 percent \ntariff.\n  It can be difficult for American companies to export to a country \nlike China that places a 23-percent tariff on our goods. The tariff \nprices our goods out of the market. One alternative for these companies \nis to actually move their plants to China and avoid paying that tariff.\n  The preferred alternative, Mr. President, and the one that is going \nto benefit American workers and, hence, benefit the entire economy, \nbecause American workers are very productive, is obviously to negotiate \nwith China to lower tariffs, bring their tariffs down to our level. \nThen the companies can stay here, employ American workers and export \ntheir goods to China.\n  But we can't negotiate these tariffs down without the President fast-\ntrack authority. That is why fast track is so important. It leads to \nlower tariffs in foreign countries. Most importantly, it leads to the \npreservation of American jobs.\n  Fast track also leads to the creation of new jobs. Exports already \nsupport 11 million jobs in this country. Each additional $1 billion of \nsales of services or manufactured products creates between 15,000 and \n20,000 new jobs. These jobs pay 15 percent to 20 percent higher than \nnon-export-related jobs. In Iowa, companies that export provide their \nemployees 32 percent greater benefits than nonexporting companies.\n  All of this is in jeopardy without our passing a bill giving the \nPresident the authority to negotiate. As the Washington Post puts it, \n``[w]ith exports growing more slowly, or not at all, fewer new jobs \nwill be created.'' So the failure of fast track hurts the workers of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, the editorial has one final comment on labor's \nconcerns with worker standards in other countries. ``Less trade \ncertainly won't improve the standards of overseas workers, for whose \nwelfare many Democrats claimed concern. And with the United States \nGovernment hamstrung, Japan, the European Union and developing \ncountries will have a greater influence in shaping world trade \npolicies. How hard do you think they'll push for improved labor and \nenvironmental standards?''\n  Mr. President, I don't often say that the Washington Post is right. \nEconomic stability and prosperity are the only proven means of \nincreasing labor and environmental standards. The United States, due to \nour affluence, has the luxury of imposing high labor and environmental \nstandards. Other countries don't yet have this ability. But increased \ntrade will bring this economic stability, and it will lead to higher \nlabor and environmental standards in other countries as well.\n  Cutting off trade, or failing to pass this legislation, reduces our \ninfluence in these other countries and it increases the influence of \ncountries such as Japan and the European Union. Can we trust Japan and \nthe European Union to advance America's interests in world trading \nnegotiations? The Washington Post correctly assumed that we cannot. \nOnly the President of the United States, and the Congress working in \nconjunction with him, because that is what this legislation can do, can \nadvance our interests and protect our interests. Only we can influence \nother countries to improve their environment and labor standards, to \nimprove human rights, and to embrace democracy through the process of \ninternational trade that brings people together rather than keeping \npeople apart.\n  That is what I am most concerned about. The failure of fast track \nleaves a vacuum of leadership in international issues. Up until now, \nthis vacuum had been filled by the United States. Ever since World War \nII, to some extent going back to the Reciprocity Act of the 1930's, \nsince 1934, the United States has led the world in reducing barriers to \ntrade, and we have benefited greatly from this leadership.\n  American workers are the most productive, highest paid workers in the \nworld. American companies produce the highest quality products. And \nAmerican consumers have more choices of goods and pay less of their \nincome on necessities such as food than consumers in any other country. \nThese are the benefits that we have enjoyed because we have been \nwilling to lead on trade.\n  I'm afraid that our leadership may now be questioned by our trading \npartners after last weekend's events. These countries are going to move \non without us. They are going to continue to form regional and \nbilateral trading arrangements that won't include the United States. \nThe United States won't be at the table to protect our interests. And \nthe losers in all of this will be the American workers, the loss of \njobs, and the consumers won't have the benefit that they now have.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can return next year and we can have a \nrational debate about what trade means to this country--because somehow \nthat has been lost in the process--and how important it is for the \nPresident of the United States to have fast track authority, to be the \nliving representation of America's moral leadership, to lead in free \nand fair trade, which we have done for 40 or 50 years.\n  We have already lost 3 full years without this legislation and the \nopportunity to lead; 20 agreements we have missed out on. We cannot \nafford to wait any longer.\n  I ask that the Washington Post editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 11, 1997]\n\n                          The Fast-Track Loss\n\n       Trade liberalization benefits most people, but it also \n     invariably hurts a few. Those who are helped--as goods become \n     cheaper, as standards of living rise, as exports grow--often \n     don't attribute their good fortune to rising trade, which is \n     after all only one component of a complex economy. Those who \n     have lost their jobs or believe they have lost their jobs to \n     overseas competition, on the other hand, don't hesitate to \n     affix blame. In the political process, the losers and \n     potential losers naturally lobby vociferously; the winners, a \n     larger but more diffuse group, don't. To rise above the \n     special interests of the losers (while taking into \n     consideration their legitimate needs) and vote in the overall \n     interest of society is what we should expect of our \n     politicians--it has something to do with statesmanship. And \n     until now, every Congress since President Ford's time has \n     managed to do just that. But this Congress, in failing early \n     Monday morning to approve\n\n[[Page S12554]]\n\n     trade-negotiating authority for President Clinton, did the \n     opposite--it caved in to the special pleaders. Washington \n     insiders will measure the defeat in its impact on Mr. \n     Clinton--whether it spells the beginning of his lame-\n     duckhood, and all the rest. But the more serious damage is to \n     U.S. economic leadership--America's ability to help shape the \n     global rule book--and, potentially, to global economic \n     prosperity.\n       The post mortems will find no shortage of culprits. Mr. \n     Clinton overpromised on NAFTA and underdelivered on the \n     promises he made to Congress to win NAI approval. He waited \n     too long to push for renewed negotiating authority--known as \n     ``fast track,'' because it allows him to negotiate treaties \n     that Congress can reject but not amend--and then don't even \n     have legislation ready when he finally, this fall, began the \n     campaign for what he called his most important legislative \n     priority. More broadly, his inconstancy over the years left \n     many members of Congress unwilling to put faith in his \n     promises and assurances. Businesses, which generally support \n     free trade, jumped into the fight too late and too half-\n     heartedly. And 25 Republicans congressmen who could have \n     provided the margin of victory but who withheld their backing \n     in a failed effort to extort support from Mr. Clinton for an \n     unrelated (and unjustified) proposal to gut America's family-\n     planning assistance overseas, also bear responsibility.\n       But of course the lion's share of blame--or credit, as they \n     would have it--goes to Mr. Clinton's fellow Democrats and \n     their backers in organized labor. In the end, fewer than 45 \n     of 205 House Democrats were ready to stand by their \n     president. In part, this reflects the growing importance of \n     union contributions to political campaigns. Since the \n     Democrats lost control of the House, businesses have shifted \n     their giving heavily to Republicans; total Democratic \n     receipts from political action committees have gone down, and \n     the union share has gone up--to 46 percent in 1996.\n       Of course, most Democrats said they were voting on the \n     merits, not the dollars. But while fast track's defeat may be \n     good news for a few unions, such as in the textile trades--\n     though even that is arguable--it certainly doesn't help the \n     majority of American workers. With the president less able to \n     knock down trade barriers overseas, U.S. manufacturing firms \n     will have more, no less, incentive to relocate, to get \n     footholds inside closed markets. With exports growing more \n     slowly, or not at all, fewer new jobs will be created. Less \n     trade certainly won't help improve the standards of overseas \n     workers, for whose welfare many Democrats claimed concern. \n     And with U.S. government hamstrung Japan, the European Union \n     and developing countries will have a greater influence in \n     shaping world trade policies. How hard do you think they'll \n     push for improved labor and environments standards?\n       Mr. Clinton yesterday withdrew his proposal before it could \n     go down to defeat, and he said he intends to try again in \n     this Congress. The signs are not auspicious, but you never \n     know. Maybe next time the greater good will prevail.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I want to discuss the report pending \nthat should come over from the House of Representatives in the next \nwhile on the appropriations bill that relates to the Commerce, State, \nJustice Departments. And part of what is in this report that we expect \nto see relates to the importation of surplus military weapons that were \nmanufactured in the United States and, many years ago, were sent abroad \nas part of our military assistance program.\n  Now, although there was initially no bill or report language on the \nissue in either the House or the Senate bills before conference, the \nissue has nevertheless consumed an enormous amount of time over the \npast few weeks, and it has generated some significant controversy. I \nhave had a deep interest in this subject because I believe that when we \nload this society of ours up with more guns, we ought to know why we \nare doing it.\n  It has been the policy of three administrations--Reagan, Bush, and \nnow the current Clinton administration--to ban foreign governments from \nexporting to our shores and selling these American-made military \nweapons that we gave or sold them at sharp discounts to help us fight \ncommon enemies, and sell these weapons to the U.S. commercial markets.\n  Nonetheless, the National Rifle Association and the gun importers \nsupported an attempt--in the dark of night, I point out--to slip a \nprovision into the conference agreement on this bill to overturn this \nlongstanding policy and allow military weapons made for military use to \nflood America's streets.\n  The administration strongly opposed this attempt. In fact, the \nPresident's senior advisers, at one point, said they would recommend \nthat the President veto the bill--this important bill--to finance our \nJustice Department, our State Department, and our Commerce Department--\nif it included an amendment to allow foreign governments to export \nlarge quantities of military weapons for commercial sale in America's \ncities and towns. They don't restrict whose hands these fall into.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from the OMB \ndirector, Franklin Raines, on this issue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Administration strongly \n     objects to the inclusion of any provision in the FY 1998 \n     Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Conference Report \n     to allow for the importation of surplus military weapons. We \n     have repeatedly opposed such provisions, and the President's \n     senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill if it \n     includes language that would allow large quantities of \n     surplus military weapons to be imported.\n       The Administration finds it unacceptable that--in the same \n     appropriations bill that funds the nation's law enforcement \n     priorities, such as putting more police on our streets--the \n     Committee is considering language that could flood our \n     streets with millions of military surplus weapons. These \n     weapons, including M-1 Garands and M-1911 .45 caliber \n     pistols, were designed for military purposes and provided to \n     foreign governments as a form of military aid. Moreover, \n     hundreds of these guns have already been recovered by law \n     enforcement officers throughout the United States. Opening \n     the door to more of these weapons would only serve to further \n     undermine public safety.\n       We strongly urge the Committee to reject this provision.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Washington Post and the New York Times also \neditorialized against this dark-of-night assault just this past week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of these and previous \neditorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 12, 1997]\n\n                     Hill Alert: A Bad Old Gun Bill\n\n       We're down to the dangerous mad-dash time in Congress when \n     truly bad ideas can sneak into law--and today the gun \n     lobbyists are poised with a flood-the-market firearms scheme \n     disguised as an innocent ``curios and relics'' proposal. Once \n     again, certain members of Congress who are semiautomatic \n     hawkers of the National Rifle Association's line, linked with \n     lobbyists for gun importers, are seeking to slip language \n     into an appropriations bill that would allow an arsenal of \n     some 2.5 million weapons from abroad to go on the U.S. \n     market.\n       This stockpile has made the rounds globally: The weapons \n     were originally paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Then as U.S. Army \n     surplus the firearms were given or sold to foreign \n     governments years ago. But they are more than quaint relics \n     for the walls of collectors; many of these firearms can be \n     converted easily into illegal automatic weapons for domestic \n     crimes such as holdups, assaults and murder. The weapons \n     could pile into the U.S. market from supplies in the \n     Philippines, Morocco, India, Turkey, Vietnam, Iran, and other \n     countries. Estimated value of these deadly weapons on legal \n     or illegal markets? Approximately $1 billion.\n       It has been for the safety of the public that the Reagan, \n     Bush and Clinton administrations all enforced a policy of \n     keeping such overseas stockpiles out of the country and thus \n     off the streets. Letting them in would\n\n[[Page S12555]]\n\n     risk driving down the price of firearms generally and making \n     weapons more easily obtainable by street criminals.\n       Law enforcement officials around the country warn that \n     there has been an increased use of these weapons against \n     police officers. More than 1,800 M1 rifles and M1911 pistols \n     were traced to crime scenes in 1995-96 and in 1997, about \n     1,000 more have been traced. According to the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 13 law enforcement officers \n     have been killed by M1 rifles or M1911 pistols since 1990.\n       Clinton administration officials have advised Sen. Frank \n     Lautenberg and others seeking to block the gun-lobby scheme \n     that senior advisers would recommend a veto if this proposal \n     comes to the president's desk. But it shouldn't come to that, \n     just as it shouldn't be slipped into any appropriations bill \n     at the eleventh hour of a congressional session. The \n     provision should be removed and if not, rejected.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 12, 1997]\n\n                     Avoiding Adjournment Blunders\n\n       The final hours before Congress takes a long recess are \n     usually dangerous. It is a time when bad riders are attached \n     to blameless appropriations bills, and complex legislation is \n     denied the measured debate it deserves. With these cautionary \n     notes, we urge Congress to avoid the following pitfalls as it \n     stumbles toward the door.\n       National Forests. The so-called ``Quincy Library Group'' \n     bill passed the House with only one dissenting vote and now \n     awaits action on the Senate floor. The Senate should delay \n     and use its vacation to rethink a measure that was marketed \n     to the House under false pretenses.\n       The bill would require at least 40,000 acres of logging \n     each year in a 2.5-million-acre stretch of national forest in \n     California's Sierra Nevada. It was advertised as an \n     experimental fire-control program and touted as a consensus \n     measure devised by local and timber industry officials who \n     met at the Quincy, Calif., town library in 1993. Yet this is \n     not a pilot program--it would double logging in the area and \n     threaten valuable watersheds. Further, the Forest Service, by \n     law the custodian of the national forests, had no real input. \n     This bill sets bad precedents and requires major revisions.\n       Family Planning. Both the House and Senate have attached to \n     their foreign aid appropriations bill a provision that would \n     deny Federal funds to any overseas family planning \n     organization that performs abortions or lobbies to change \n     foreign abortion laws--even though the groups in question use \n     their own money to further objectives. President Clinton does \n     not like this provision. Congress could avoid a nasty veto \n     fight by removing the objectionable language in conference.\n       Gun Control. Some House members want to attach to an \n     appropriations bill a dangerous amendment that would allow \n     the importation of some two million surplus military rifles \n     and handguns from countries that originally got them as a \n     form of military assistance. The N.R.A. and its supporters--\n     including dealers who would buy and re-sell the weapons--say \n     they are merely relics. But they can still kill people. This \n     attempt to overturn current law, which bans such imports, \n     deserves a crushing defeat.\n       Congress could more profitably use its final hours to \n     rectify an oversight. It granted itself a modest 2.3 percent \n     pay raise last month but failed to award the same increase to \n     Federal judges, whose pay is linked to Congressional pay. The \n     remedy is to attach an amendment to one of the appropriations \n     bills granting the raise. That is one last-minute rider we \n     would applaud.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 9, 1997]\n\n                        The Surplus Gun Invasion\n\n       Gun dealers, with the enthusiastic support of the National \n     Rifle Association, are once again trying to sneak through \n     Congress a measure that could put 2.5 million more rifles and \n     pistols onto American streets and provide a handsome subsidy \n     for weapons importers and a few foreign governments. This \n     bill, introduced with disgraceful stealth, should be pounced \n     on by the Clinton Administration and all in Congress who are \n     concerned about crime.\n       The bill is an amendment to the Treasury Department's \n     appropriation, which may come to a vote in the House this \n     week. It would allow countries that received American \n     military surplus M-1 rifles, M-1 carbines and M1911 pistols \n     to sell them to weapons dealers in the United States. The \n     countries--allies and former allies such as the Philippines, \n     South Korea, Iran and Turkey--got the guns free or at a \n     discount or simply kept them after World War II, or the \n     Korean and Vietnam wars. Current law requires them to pay the \n     Pentagon if they sell the guns and bars Americans from \n     importing them. The new bill would change both provisions.\n       The N.R.A. argues that the guns are merely relics. But they \n     are not too old to kill. In 1995 and 1996 the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms traced these models to more \n     than 1,800 crime sites. Senator Frank Lautenberg, the bill's \n     main opponent, says these guns have killed at least 10 police \n     officers since 1990. M-1 carbines can be converted to \n     automatic firing, and all the M-1's are easily converted into \n     illegal assault weapons.\n       Republicans attached a similar bill to an emergency \n     spending measure last year but took it out under pressure \n     from the White House. President Clinton should threaten to \n     veto the Treasury appropriation if the measure remains.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 4, 1997]\n\n                    Surplus Weapons, Surplus Danger\n\n       Gun sales are flat, so the nation's gun importers are \n     looking to shake up the market. Once again they want \n     permission to bring into the country an arsenal of as many as \n     2.5 million U.S. Army surplus weapons that were given or sold \n     to foreign governments decades ago.\n       The industry classifies the guns as obsolete ``curios and \n     relics'' of interest mostly to collectors and sports \n     shooters. But they're not talking about a gentleman officer's \n     pearl-handled revolvers. These are soldiers' M1 Garand \n     rifles, M1 carbines and .45-caliber M1911 pistols; some can \n     be converted to automatic or illegal assault weapons with \n     parts that cost as little as $100. For public safety reasons, \n     the Pentagon declines to transfer such surplus to commercial \n     gun vendors, which is why the Clinton, Bush and Reagan \n     administrations have enforced a policy of keeping the \n     overseas weapons out.\n       This week, the gun importers, cheered on by the National \n     Rifle Association, quietly persuaded a House appropriations \n     panel to approve language to prevent the State, Justice and \n     Treasury departments from denying the importers' \n     applications. It's a slap at the country's efforts to reduce \n     gun violence.\n       To introduce a flood of these historical weapons is to risk \n     driving down the price of firearms and putting more within \n     the reach of street criminals. It isn't simply gun-control \n     groups but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that \n     warns of an increased use of these kinds of weapons against \n     police around the country. In 1995-96 alone, 304 U.S. \n     military surplus M1 rifles and 99 surplus pistols were traced \n     to crime scenes. At least nine law enforcement officers have \n     been killed by M1 rifles or M1911 pistols since 1990, \n     according to Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), who has \n     introduced legislation to cement the import ban in law by \n     reconciling some contradictory statutes.\n       The State Department says that weapons transfers--even for \n     outdated guns--should remain an executive branch prerogative \n     to be handled country by country. Why should the governments \n     of Turkey, Italy or Pakistan collect a windfall from U.S. gun \n     importers when the products they are trading originally were \n     supplied by the U.S. government? Why should Vietnam and Iran \n     be allowed to earn currency from U.S.-made weaponry they took \n     as ``spoils of war.'' President Clinton last year headed off \n     a similar effort to allow in the surplus weapons and should \n     be counted on to do so again.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Guns--and the M-1 Boomerang\n\n       The people who bring you America's Gross National Arsenal--\n     the weapons-pushers who keep the firearms flowing to the \n     streets of neighborhoods near you--are poised to go global \n     with sales of weapons that you already bought with your taxes \n     years ago. The U.S. gun industry hopes to make a fortune by \n     importing millions of M-1 Garand rifles, M-1 carbines and \n     .45-caliber M1911 pistols--surplus American military firearms \n     that the Pentagon originally gave away or sold at a discount \n     to various countries over the years. Many of these weapons \n     are especially handy because they can be converted easily \n     into (illegal) automatic weapons for domestic uses such as \n     committing crimes and killing people.\n       That's not how this deadly deal is characterized by the \n     industry, of course, or by John Sununu, former chief of staff \n     under President Bush, or others working with the gun industry \n     who are pushing the import plan in Congress. These groups \n     prefer to talk about the weapons that would go to collectors \n     and describe the legislation they keep trying to slip quietly \n     through Congress as a harmless move to offer a new supply of \n     ``curio and relic'' guns for collectors and other souvenir-\n     seekers.\n       But as reported by Post staff writer John Mintz this week, \n     the firearms would be coming back to the United States from \n     supplies in the Philippines, Morocco, India, Turkey and other \n     countries. Gun industry lobbyists helped persuade Sen. Ted \n     Stevens of Alaska to introduce measure allowing the weapons \n     into the country--and specifically forbidding federal \n     officials from blocking their entry. In July, with no debate, \n     Sen. Stevens got the provisions slipped into the \n     appropriations continuing resolution; it wasn't until the \n     White House objected that the provision was removed. Now, the \n     senator's office and industry representative say they hope to \n     get the provision enacted soon.\n       Backers of the plan argue that the weapons at issue are \n     obsolete and pose no threat to anyone. It's true that the M-1 \n     rifle is bulky and not a great item for street crimes. But \n     the M-1 carbine and the pistols are another lethal matter. \n     The carbine can be converted easily to automatic fire. The \n     concern is not with single sales to individual collectors but \n     with supplies getting into the wrong hands. Legislation to \n     allow imports only of rifles that are, say, World War II \n     vintage or earlier could serve the collector market. But \n     Congress should consider any such proposal carefully--and \n     openly, with hearings--instead of blessing a new domestic \n     flood of weapons designed for war.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Finally, a coalition of 50 organizations including \nHandgun Control, the Violence Policy Center, and the Coalition to Stop \nGun\n\n[[Page S12556]]\n\nViolence, opposed this effort to overturn the policy of three \nadministrations on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of their \nletter on the issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 8, 1997.\n       Dear Representative: In late-July, during mark-up of the \n     Fiscal Year 1998 Treasury-Postal Service-General Government \n     Appropriations bill, the Appropriations Committee accepted an \n     amendment that would allow foreign governments to export to \n     the United States for commercial sale, millions of military \n     weapons the United States previously made available to \n     foreign countries through military assistance programs.\n       For a range of public health and safety, national security, \n     and taxpayer reasons, we strongly urge you vote to delete \n     this provision from the Fiscal Year 1998 Treasury-Postal \n     Service-General Government Appropriations bill.\n       Supporters of this amendment describe it as an innocuous \n     measure which simply allows the importation of some obsolete \n     ``curios and relics.'' In reality, the amendment would allow \n     the import of an estimated 2.5 million weapons of war, \n     including 1.2 million M1 carbines. The M1 carbine is a semi-\n     automatic weapon that can be easily converted into automatic \n     fire equipped with a 15-30 round detachable magazine.\n       This is a Public Safety Issue: Although the backers of the \n     provision claim that these World War II era weapons are now \n     harmless ``curios and relics'', in reality they remain deadly \n     assault weapons. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     and Firearms, the M1 Carbine can be easily converted into a \n     fully-automatic assault rifle. For this reason, the \n     Department of Defense has refused to sell its surplus stocks \n     of these weapons to civilian gun dealers and collectors in \n     the United States.\n       According to Raymond W. Kelley, the Treasury Department's \n     Under-Secretary for Enforcement, the inflow of these weapons \n     will drive down the price of similar weapons, making them \n     more accessible to criminals. Already, during 1995-1996, ATF \n     has traced 1,172 M1911 pistols and 639 M1 rifles to crimes \n     committed in the United States.\n       This is a Government Oversight Concern: Nearly 2.5 million \n     of these weapons were given or sold as ``security \n     assistance'' to allied governments. Under United States law, \n     recipients of American arms and military aid must obtain \n     permission from the United States government before re-\n     transferring those arms to third parties. Setting a dangerous \n     precedent, this amendment fundamentally undercuts the ability \n     of the United States government to exercise its right of \n     refusal on retransfer of United States arms.\n       The Reagan, Bush, and Clinton Administrations have all \n     barred imports of these military weapons by the American \n     public. The Appropriations bill explicitly overrides this \n     policy, prohibiting the government from denying applications \n     for the importation of ``U.S. origin ammunition and curio or \n     relic firearms and parts.'' In effect, the provision would \n     force the Administration to allow thousands of M1 assault \n     rifles and M1911 pistols into circulation with the civilian \n     population, thereby not only threatening public safety but \n     also undermining governmental oversight and taxpayer \n     accountability.\n\n\n                  STOP THE IMPORT OF MILITARY WEAPONS\n\n       This is Also a Taxpayer Concern: The amendment also \n     presents a windfall of millions of dollars to foreign \n     governments and United States gun dealers. The amendment \n     effectively terminates a requirement that allies reimburse \n     the United States treasury if they sell United States-\n     supplied weapons. According to ATF, each M1 Carbine, M1 \n     Garand rifle, and M1911 pistol currently sells for about \n     $300-500 in the United States market. The South Korean, \n     Turkish, and Pakistani governments and militaries stand to \n     make millions from the resale of these weapons. South Korea \n     has 1.3 million M1 Garands and Carbines, while the Turkish \n     military and police have 136,000 M1 Garands and 50,000 M1911 \n     pistols. These weapons were originally given free, or sold at \n     highly subsidized rates, or retrieved as ``spoils of war.'' \n     The United States Department of Defense does not sell these \n     lethal weapons on the commercial market for profit. Why \n     should we allow foreign governments to do so?\n       Again, we strongly urge you vote to delete this provision \n     from the Fiscal Year 1998 Treasury-Postal Service-General \n     Government Appropriations bill.\n       Thank you.\n         American College of Physicians, American Friends Service \n           Committee, James Matlack, Director, Washington Office; \n           American Jewish Congress, David A.

Fortunately, Mr. President, the provision was not \nincluded in the conference agreement that the Senate will consider \nlater this evening and these dangerous military weapons will not flood \nour streets. This is a huge victory for the American people.\n  Mr. President, the weapons at issue were granted or sold to foreign \ngovernments, often at a discount, through military assistance programs, \nand some were given to or left in foreign countries during wars. They \nare called curios or relics because they are considered by some to have \nhistoric value or are more than 50 years old.\n  One of them I carried in World War II when I was a soldier in Europe. \nIt was an M-1 carbine. It may be a curiosity now or a relic. But I can \ntell you it was there to be used for my protecting myself or to kill \nthe enemy. Fortunately, neither happened. But I carried it by my side \nwhen I served on the European Continent.\n  But they are not innocuous antiques or museum pieces. They remain \ndeadly weapons.\n  Proponents of allowing the importation of these weapons argue that \nthey are historic firearms that are not dangerous. In fact, the \namendment would have flooded the market with millions of lethal killing \nweapons.\n  Under the amendment that was rejected, 2.5 million, semiautomatic \nmilitary weapons--including the M-1 carbine, M-1 Garand, and M-1911 \npistol--would have flooded the streets. The M-1 carbine can easily be \nconverted into an illegal, fully automatic weapon.\n  These semiautomatic military weapons may be old, but they are lethal. \nThirteen American police officers have recently been murdered with M-\n1's and M-1911's.\n  In New Jersey in 1995, Franklin Township Sgt. Lee Gonzalez was killed\n\n[[Page S12557]]\n\nby Robert ``Mudman'' Simon during a routine stop. Simon was a Warlocks \nmotorcycle gang member. Simon, who had just committed a robbery, shot \nGonzalez twice, once in the head and once in the neck, using an M-1911 \nsemiautomatic pistol. That's the same weapon that would be imported \nunder the rejected amendment.\n  In Texas in 1991, Pasadena police officer Jeff Ginn was killed with \nan M-1 carbine. He was responding to a call about smoke coming from a \nhouse in the neighborhood he was patrolling. Ginn found Marvin Harris \nholding a woman hostage in her own home. When he saw police officer \nGinn, Harris shot him in the leg. Ginn hobbled to the front of the \nhouse, where he leaned up against a tree, begging not to be shot again. \nHarris murdered officer Ginn by shooting him in the temple and the \nabdomen with the M-1 carbine.\n  In New Hampshire--the home State of the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Judd Gregg, who knows only too well of the impact \nof the use of that weapon--Sgt. James Noyes of the New Hampshire State \nPolice was killed in the line of duty with an M-1 carbine in 1994.\n  And there are many innocent civilians who have been threatened and \nmurdered with these weapons as well. In 1995 and 1996, M-1's and M-1911 \nweapons were traced to more than 1,800 crimes nationwide. Already, \nnearly 1,000 crimes have been traced to these weapons in 1997.\n  Allowing the importation of large numbers of these killer weapons \nwould undermine efforts to reduce gun violence in this country. And \neverybody would like to have that done. I can tell you. It doesn't \nmatter what State or what kind of community--rural or urban. That is \nthe biggest fear that people have; that is, that they will lose a loved \none to a violent act, or someone will pick up a gun, or either randomly \nor directly shoot one of their children, brother, sister, mother or \nfather.\n\n  This would also reduce the cost of weapons, because there would be a \nmarketplace filled with 2.5 million--the maximum capacity for \nexportation--making them more accessible to criminals.\n  It would also provide a windfall for foreign governments at the \nexpense of the U.S. taxpayer. The weapons were paid for by the American \ntaxpayer and were provided to foreign governments through our \nassistance program. The market value of the 2.5 million that can be \ntraced to foreign governments exceeds $1 billion.\n  That adds insult to injury.\n  Allowing millions of U.S.-origin military weapons to enter the United \nStates would profit a limited number of arms importers and would not be \nin the overall interest of the American people. These weapons are not \ndesigned for hunting or for shooting competitions; they are designed \nfor war. Foreign countries should not be permitted to sell these \nweapons on the commercial market for profit.\n  There is no doubt foreign governments would make a handsome profit \nfrom their sale in the commercial market. Consequently, countries that \nthe United States assisted in times of need, such as South Korea and \nthe Philippines, and even a country like Iran could make a profit out \nof these sales. Imagine permitting weapons to be imported into this \ncountry that would send dollars back to Iran. It is an outrage.\n  In lieu of approval of an amendment to import these weapons, the \nadministration is being asked to provide a report on the curios or \nrelics issue. The report will provide information about the quantity of \napplications and articles that have been approved for importation as \nwell as an estimate of the number of firearms available for importation \nfrom overseas. It will also explain how an M-1 carbine can be converted \ninto an illegal machinegun or assault weapon.\n  I have no problem asking the Government to prepare a report for the \nuse of the House or the Senate. But I would like to make sure that this \nis a balanced report, that it doesn't simply list statistics. But I \nwant to explain why it is important for the President and Secretary of \nState to retain their authority to retain control over firearms granted \nor sold by the Government exclusively for foreign military use and \nnever intended for private use.\n  I would also encourage the administration when it submits a report to \ninclude information about applications in the Bush and Reagan \nadministration as well. After all, this administration is upholding a \npolicy that was first established by President Reagan and upheld by the \nBush administration.\n  I believe the administration should include in the report a \ndescription of any law enforcement or grand jury investigations of \nalleged illegal conduct related to the importation of M-1 or M1911 \nfirearms. A grand jury previously investigated one attempt to import \nthese weapons by a company with a peculiar name called Blue Sky. There \nwere serious allegations that the law was manipulated for personal \ngain, and the investigation ended when the lead witness mysteriously \ndied in a plane crash. The American people have the right to understand \nwhat happened in this inquiry.\n  The report I believe also--this is an expansion on what is in the \nreport requested of the administration. It is something I didn't agree \nwith. But we are at a very late point in time when these bills have to \nbe considered. So we have accepted this report against, frankly, my \nbest judgment.\n  The report also should provide an analysis of the number and types of \nweapons that have been added to the curios or relics list since 1980, \nthe process by which those weapons are added to the list, and the \nentities that have petitioned to have weapons added to the list. The \nAmerican people have the right to understand more about the way \nmilitary weapons are designated as curios and relics.\n  Finally, I believe it should include a comprehensive overview of the \nnumber of homicides and violent crimes committed against police \nofficers and against civilians with M1's or M1911's, regardless of the \nmanufacturer, or any other firearm on the curios or relics list. Though \ncurios and relics may have some historical interest for collectors, \nmany of these firearms remain of concern due to crime.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that this effort to overturn U.S. \npolicy behind closed doors in the dark of night was defeated. And just \nto clarify, for the information of those who might not understand our \narcane way of operation, there is a bill, and in the bill there is a \nmandate that certain things be done. Report language is suggested on \ntop of that bill but does not have the effect of law. That is what I am \ntalking about here--this report language, not the bill itself.\n  I am delighted, again, that this effort to overturn U.S. policy \nbehind closed doors was defeated. It would have been an insult to the \nAmerican people to overturn a longstanding policy behind the closed \ndoors of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I have introduced legislation, S. 723, to repeal a loophole in the \nArms Export Control Act that could enable these weapons to enter the \ncountry under a future administration. I hope that my colleagues will \nsupport this bill.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, this is a victory for the American \ntaxpayer and a victory for all concerned about safety.\n  I hope we reject the notion that we ought to take back and pay for \nthings that we gave away, or that we sold at sharp discounts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to respond to remarks made by \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, concerning the ``curio \nor relics'' U.S. origin historic firearms issue. I believe it's \nimportant for the Senate to be aware of this information in evaluating \nthe actions taken today on the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary \nappropriations bill.\n  The amendment that the Senator from New Jersey refers to, which has \nbeen under consideration in both the fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year \n1998 appropriations processes, is intended to correct a serious \ninjustice in the way that our nation's firearms import laws are being \nadministered. The amendment stops the Administration from ignoring \nCongress' intent that historic firearms be allowed to return to U.S. \nsoil. Despite the fact the amendment was not added to the Commerce, \nJustice, and State spending bill, I am confident, based on the \nbipartisan support enjoyed by the amendment, that it will be passed in \nthis Congress. A brief review of the history behind this issue is\n\n[[Page S12558]]\n\nin order. In 1984, Congress first enacted a statute, 18 U.S.C. 925(e), \nspecifically permitting the importation of military surplus curio or \nrelic imports. At the time of enactment, however, the statute only \nbenefited foreign collectibles, since other acts interfered with U.S. \norigin curio or relics from returning to the United States.\n  In 1987, Congress remedied the inconsistency by enacting a provision \nfor the importation of certain U.S. origin ammunition and curio or \nrelic firearms and parts into the United States at 22 U.S.C. \n2778(b)(1)(B). The Treasury Department issued implementation \nregulations after the passage of both laws. The Department of State, \nwhich in certain cases consults with the Treasury Department on \nfirearms imports, frustrated the purpose of the 1988 law by refusing to \nconsent to U.S. origin applications, ostensibly on the basis of foreign \npolicy interests. The Department of State for years has frustrated the \nefforts of importers to bring historic curio or relic firearms into the \nUnited States.\n  In addition to fully assembled U.S. origin curio and relic firearms \nbeing denied entry into the United States, curio or relic U.S. origin \nmilitary surplus parts and U.S. origin military surplus ammunition \napplications that used to be approved by ATF directly, are now being \ndenied. Many hobbyists and collectors are being denied access to these \nhistoric arms. Many millions of dollars in business will now be lost on \nrifle parts sales and rifle ammunition, severely hurting an import \nindustry that has already been very adversely affected by President \nClinton's policies.\n  With regard to the criticism that has been leveled against the \namendment, and these arms, several important facts are in order. First \nof all, this amendment was not inserted in any bill ``in the dark of \nnight'', it was part of an open mark-up over a year ago in the \nCommerce, Justice, State Subcommittee in the Senate for the \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1997, and this year, for fiscal \nyear 1998, it was added on the House side in an open full committee \nmark-up on the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill. This is a \nwell-known issue and one that has been widely publicized; in fact, \nSenator Lautenberg and other opponents of this provision have certainly \nensured that it has been given attention.\n  I realize that opponents of this amendment have been using the media \nto sensationalize the subject and to scare the general public into \nbelieving that there is something nefarious about these fine old arms. \nHowever, allegations concerning or implying a special crime threat that \n``curio or relic'' M1 Garands, M-1 Carbines and M-1911A1 pistols pose \nto police officers or innocent civilians is simply false. Similarly, \nallegations that Iran will profit from the sale of these firearms is \nalso wrong. In addition, the characterization of what the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms trace data indicates is misleading at \nbest, as even ATF acknowledges that ATF gun trace data may not be used \nto make statistical assumptions about the use of firearms.\n\n  Here are just some of the basic facts about this matter:\n  First, ``curio or relics'' are defined as firearms which are of \nspecial interest to collectors, and are at least fifty years old, or \nare certified by a curator of a municipal, State or Federal museum to \nbe curios or relics of museum interest, or have some rare, novel or \nbizarre characteristic because of their association with some \nhistorical figure, period or event. They are not the crime gun of \nchoice for criminals.\n  Second, corrective language is needed to enforce existing import laws \nand regulations that already permit the importation of U.S. origin \ncurio or relic firearms, parts and ammunition from non-proscribed \nnations (the Arms Export Control Act, Section 38, 22 U.S.C. 2778 and \nthe Gun Control Act of 1968).\n  Third, the purpose of the Gun Control Act was to provide ``support to \nFederal, State and local law enforcement officials in their fight \nagainst crime and violence,'' but not to ``place any undue or \nunnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens \nwith respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms \nappropriate to the purpose of hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, \npersonal protection, or any other lawful activity.'' Additionally, the \nenactment of the Gun Control Act was ``not intended to discourage or \neliminate the private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding \ncitizens for lawful purposes'' (i.e., such as gun collecting). The \nAdministration's actions are completely contrary to legitimate \ncollecting and hobby pursuits.\n  Fourth, these firearms and ammunition were initially supplied to \nfriendly foreign governments by sale or gift to promote the foreign \npolicy interests of the United States. The U.S., under the Foreign \nAssistance Act, can waive receipt of any proceeds derived from such a \nsale and request that the proceeds be set aside in a special account. \nIn most cases, the U.S. does so for the purposes of letting the ally \nnation modernize its military equipment. Since the U.S. usually would \nhave assisted such a nation anyway in some manner with the \nmodernization of their military equipment, the allowance of keeping the \nsale proceeds actually represents a potential cost savings to the U.S. \ntaxpayer.\n  Fifth, rifles, which constitute the vast majority of these guns, are \nnot the alleged crime threat that opponents of this provision would \nlike the American people to believe. In ATF's July, 1997 report \nentitled ``ATF, The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, Crime Gun \nTrace Analysis Reports'' 8 out of 10 crime guns traced within a 10 \nmonth period in 1996/97 were handguns. Out of an average of the trace \ndata that ATF compiled from 17 major cities across the United States, \nfrom July 1, 1997 through April 30, 1997, all rifles comprised only \n7.98 percent of the total firearms traced to crimes. In fact, according \nto ATF's latest data concerning firearms traced to a crime scene'' in \n1995, out of the 70,000 firearms traced to a crime scene, only .331 \npercent were U.S. origin firearms. In 1996, the percentage decreased: \nout of the 140,000 firearms traced to a crime scene, only .275 percent \nwere U.S. origin firearms. In 1997, U.S. origin firearms constitute \nonly .303 percent out of the total 200,000 firearms traced. In summary, \nthese firearms are generally not attractive to criminals. They are \nexpensive, heavy, cumbersome and not easily concealable.\n\n  Sixth, Senator Lautenberg's figure of 2.5 million U.S. origin ``curio \nor relic'' firearms that would be imported is incorrect. First of all, \nwe do not import ``millions'' of guns into this country on an annual \nbasis. Currently, the rough total number of all firearms that are \nannually imported into this country is in the 800,000 to 900,000 range. \nOnly a relatively modest number of U.S. origin curio or relic firearms \nare available for importation into the United States in commercially \nacceptable and safe-to-shoot condition--these will not number in the \nmillions.\n  Finally, current law--the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, \nthe Arms Export Control Act, the Foreign Assistance Act and the Gun \nControl Act of 1968--already prohibits U.S. importers from trading with \nproscribed countries, such as Iran, whose foreign policy threatens \nworld peace and the national security of the U.S. and supports acts of \nterrorism. The proposed appropriations language made it very clear that \nimportation would only be permitted from non-proscribed nations.\n  Regarding the report language that has been added to the bill. I \nwould like to point out that Senator Lautenberg's statement suggested \nexpansion of the conference report language is contrary to what was \naccepted in the bill. It is clear that the items Senator Lautenberg \noffered on the floor were specifically rejected by the Conferees, which \nare as follows:\n  First, the Conferees did not accept the Administration providing a \ndescription of any law enforcement or grand jury investigations of \nalleged illegal conduct related to the importation of M-1 or M19911 \nfirearms.\n  Second, the Conferees did not accept the Administration reporting on \nthe number and types of weapons that have been added to the ``curios or \nrelics'' list since 1980, the process by which those weapons are added \nto the list, and the entities that have petitioned to add weapons added \nto the list.\n  Third, the Conferees did not accept the Administration providing a \ncomprehensive overview of the number of homicides and violent crimes \ncommitted against police officers and against civilians with M1s or \nM19911s.\n\n[[Page S12559]]\n\n  In addition, Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg suggested by the use \nof term ``simple'' that the Administration should report on how \n``simple'' the conversion of M-1 carbine is from semi-automatic to an \nillegal fully automatic gun. That is not what the report language calls \nfor--it calls for an explanation of the facts. Converting the M-1 \nCarbine requires an M2 parts conversion kit; however, that is not \nreadily or easily accomplished, since it is strictly controlled under \nthe National Firearms Act of 1934.\n  In summary, this amendment is needed, and I regret we could not \nachieve it this year. With the additional information from the \nAdministration, and an early start on the matter, I believe we will be \nable to right what has been a wrong to the gun collecting and importing \ncommunity for many years.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 1530 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12554-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12559-S12560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we complete the 1st session of the 105th \nCongress, I would like to update my colleagues on how we have advanced \nthe judicial confirmation process. Let me say from the outset that I \nbelieve one of the Senate's most important functions is its \nconstitutional authority, and responsibility, to render advice and \nconsent to the President in his nomination of Federal judges.\n  Unique in our system of Government, Federal judges serve for life, \nand are entirely unaccountable to the electorate. When a single Federal \njudge is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he or she will exercise enormous \npower over our people, our States, and our public and private \ninstitutions, for years and years to come. As the scope of Federal \nlaw--both statutory and constitutional--has exploded to cover virtually \nall areas of our lives and culture, and as our society has become more \nlitigious, Federal judges have come to wield vast power over countless \naspects of our everyday lives. Moreover, the troubling trend toward \nincreased judicial activism has only enhanced the power that judges \nexercise in our society.\n  As a result, I have dedicated considerable time and energy to \nthoroughly review each nominee in an effort to ensure that only \nindividuals of the highest caliber are permitted to serve on the \nFederal bench. At the same time, of course, I am cognizant that as \nPresident, Mr. Clinton is entitled to some deference in his choice of \nFederal judges, and I have sought to respect the President's decisions.\n  To date, the Senate has confirmed 239 Clinton judges, of which 35 \nwere confirmed this year alone. Those 239 judges represent nearly one-\nthird of the entire Federal bench. We currently have nine judges \npending on the Senate floor. If those judges are confirmed, as I hope \nthey will be, the Senate will have confirmed 44 Federal judges during \nthis session.\n  I believe that the Judiciary Committee has been proceeding fairly and \nat reasonable pace. Indeed, I strongly believe that we must do our best \nto reduce the approximately 80 vacancies that currently exist in the \nFederal courts. There are, however, limits to what the Judiciary \nCommittee can do. We cannot, no matter how hard we may try, confirm \njudges who have yet to be nominated. Of the 43 nominees currently \npending, 9 were received in the last month.\n  And 13 of those pending nominees are individuals simply renominated \nfrom last Congress. So, of those 80 vacancies, 45 are, in effect, a \nresult of the administration's inaction. Forty-three total pending - 8 \nincomplete paperwork = 35 real nominees; 80 vacancies - 35 real \nnominees = 45 White House inaction.\n  Moreover, of the 79 total judicial nominees sent forward to the \ncommittee this year, 47 have now had hearings. Of the 47 nominees that \nhave had hearings, 41 have been reported out of committee. Of those 41 \nnominees reported out of committee, 35 have been confirmed, and 9 are \npending on the Senate floor.\n  The committee has moved noncontroversial nominees at a relatively \nspeedy pace. In fact, I pledge that when the administration sends us \nqualified, noncontroversial, nominees, they will be processed fairly \nand promptly. Indeed, in the last few months, the administration has \nfinally begun sending us nominees that I have for the most part found \nto be quite acceptable. Take Ms. Frank Hull, for example. She was \nnominated for a very important seat on the Eleventh Circuit. Ms. Hull \nwas nominated June 18, had her hearing July 22, and was confirmed on \nSeptember 4. This is a remarkably fast turnaround.\n  Or consider Mr. Alan Gold from Florida. He was nominated in February. \nWe completed his paperwork and our review in March and April, he had a \nhearing shortly thereafter in May, and he was reported out of committee \nand confirmed before the July 4 recess.\n  Two other good examples are Ms. Janet Hall from Connecticut and Mr. \nBarry Silverman, of Arizona. Ms. Hall was nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court June 5, 1997, the committee had a hearing on July 22, \nand she was confirmed September 11. Mr. Silverman may have even set the \nrecord: The committee received his nomination on November 8, held his \nhearing on November 12, and reported him out of committee today.\n  Clearly, when it comes to new, noncontroversial nominees, we are, in \nfact, proceeding with extraordinary speed and diligence.\n  More controversial nominees, however, take more time. Indeed, many of \nthe individuals renominated from the 104th Congress have proven \ndifficult to move for a variety of reasons. Unfortunately, of the 79 \nindividuals nominated this Congress, only 56 have been new; the other \n23 are individuals who were previously nominated, but have been \ncontroversial and proven difficult to move through the committee--much \nless to confirm. When the administration simply sends back nominees who \nhad problems last Congress, it takes much more time, and is much more \ndifficult, to process them. It is worth pointing out that there was, in \nvirtually every instance, a reason why the Senate confirmed 239 other \nClinton nominees but not those 23. And, if all we are left with are \njudges whom we are not ready to move, I will not compromise our advice \nand consent function simply because the White House has not sent us \nqualified nominees. As I said at the outset, the Senate's advice and \nconsent function should not be reduced to a mere numbers game. The \nconfirmation of an individual to serve for life as a Federal judge is a \nserious matter, and should be treated as such. In fact, we have sat \ndown with the White House and Justice Department and explained the \nproblems with each nominee, and they understand perfectly well why \nthose nominees have not moved.\n  Many inaccurate accounts have been written charging that this body \nhas unreasonably held up judicial nominations. That claim is simply not \ntrue. As of today, we have processed 47 nominees--35 confirmed, 9 on \nthe floor, 2 are pending in committee and 1 withdrawn. Now, not all of \nthese judges have yet been confirmed, but I expect that they will be \nconfirmed fairly promptly. Assuming most of these nominees are \nconfirmed, I think you will see that our efforts compare quite \nfavorably to prior Congresses, in terms of the number of judges \nconfirmed at this point in the 1st session of a Congress. As of today, \nwe have confirmed 35 judges. If we confirm the 9 judges pending on the \nSenate floor, we will have confirmed 44 Federal judges this year.\n\n  Republicans confirmed 55 judges as of the end of the 1st session in \nthe 104th Congress. Indeed, the Democrats confirmed only 28 judges for \nPresident Clinton at the end of the 1st session back in the 103d \nCongress. Although the Democrats confirmed 57 judges as of the end of \nthe first session back in 1991, for a Republican President, they \nconfirmed only 15 judges in 1989 and 42 judges in 1987, both for \nRepublican Presidents. So the plain fact is that we are right on track \nwith, if not ahead of, previous Congresses. And this is particularly \nsignificant given the fact that we have more authorized judgeships \ntoday than under Presidents Bush or Reagan. In fact, there are more \nsitting judges today than there were throughout virtually all of the \nReagan and\n\n[[Page S12560]]\n\nBush administrations. As of today, there are 763 active Federal judges. \nAt this point in the 101st and 102d Congresses, by contrast, when a \nDemocrat-controlled Senate was processing President Bush's nominees, \nthere were only 711 and 716 active judges, respectively.\n  The Democrat Senate actually left a higher vacancy rate under \nPresident Bush: Just compare today's 80 vacancies to the vacancies \nunder a Democratic Senate during President Bush's Presidency. In May \n1991 there were 148 vacancies, and in May 1992 there were 117 \nvacancies. I find it interesting that, at that time, I don't recall a \nsingle news article or floor speech on judicial vacancies. So, in \nshort, I think it is quite unfair, and frankly inaccurate, to report \nthat the Republican Congress has created a vacancy crisis in our \ncourts.\n  It is plain then, that current vacancies not result of Republican \nstall. First, even the Administrative Office of the Courts has \nconcluded that most of the blame for the current vacancies falls on the \nWhite House, not the Senate. It has taken President Clinton an average \nof 534 days to name nominees currently pending, for a vacancy--well \nover the time it has historically taken the White House. It has taken \nthe Senate an average of only 97 days to confirm a judge once the \nPresident finally nominates him or her, and in recent months we've been \nmoving noncontroversial nominees at a remarkably fast pace. As a \nresult, with the exception of nominees whose completed paperwork we \nhave not yet received, the White House has only sent up 43 nominees for \nthese 80 vacant seats--of which 13 were received just prior to the \nSenate going into recess. Forty-five of those seats are, in effect \nvacant because of White House inaction.\n  Second, those vacancies were caused by a record level of resignations \nafter the elections. During President Clinton's first 4 years, we \nconfirmed 204 judges--a near record high, and nearly one quarter of the \nentire Federal bench. By the close of last Congress, there were only 65 \nvacancies. This is virtually identical to the number of vacancies under \nSenator Biden in the previous Congress. The Department of Justice \nitself stated that this level of vacancies represents virtual full \nemployment in the Federal courts. So last Congress we were more than \nfair to President Clinton and his judicial nominees. We reduced the \nvacancy level to a level which the Justice Department itself considers \nvirtual full employment. But after the election last fall, 37 judges \neither resigned or took senior status--a dramatic number in such a \nshort period. This is what has led to the current level of 80 \nvacancies.\n\n  Many Judicial ``Emergencies'' are far from that: I would also like to \nclarify a term that is now bandied about with little understanding of \nwhat it really means a judicial ``emergency'' is simply a seat that has \nbeen unfilled for a certain period of time. In reality, though, many of \nthose seats are far from emergencies. Indeed, of the 29 judicial \nemergencies, the administration has not even put up a nominee for 7 of \nthose seats. As for the others, I think you will find that a number of \nthe relevant districts do not in fact have an overly burdensome \ncaseload.\n  And, keep in mind that the Clinton administration is on record as \nhaving stated that 63 vacancies--a vacancy rate of just over 7 \npercent--is considered virtual full employment of the Federal \njudiciary. The current vacancy rate is only 9 percent. How can a 2 \npercent rise in the vacancy rate--from 7 to 9 percent--convert full \nemployment into a crisis?\n  It can't. The reality is that the Senate has moved carefully and \ndeliberately to discharge its constitutional obligation to render \nadvice and consent to the President as he makes his appointments. I am \nsatisfied by the committee's work this session, and look forward to \nworking with the administration in the coming months to identify \nqualified candidates to elevate to the Federal bench.\n  I yield the floor I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12559-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12560-S12562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM B. SPONG, JR., OF VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the life and \nservice of William B. Spong, Jr., a distinguished statesman, a former \nU.S. Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia, and a mentor to many of \nus who entered politics inspired by his extraordinary conviction.\n  Bill Spong died in Portsmouth, VA, on October 8, 1997, at the age of \n77. He left behind a son, a daughter, five grandchildren, and a legacy \nof public service to the people of Virginia unmatched in his lifetime. \nAs his childhood friend, Dick Davis, said so eloquently, ``the state \nhas lost a leader that may never be replaced.''\n  Bill Spong epitomized the professional commitment and personal \nintegrity that was his hallmark. He was a quiet giant.\n  The product of two outstanding Virginia universities--Hampden Sydney \nCollege and the University of Virginia School of Law--Bill Spong could \nhave gone anywhere and made money. But he went home to Portsmouth, set \nup a law practice with his friend, Dick Davis, and successfully ran for \nthe Virginia House of Delegates and then the State senate.\n  A philosopher once said, while ``every man is a creature of the age \nin which he lives, very few are able to raise themselves above the \nideas of the time.'' We, in Virginia, will be forever grateful that \nBill Spong was one of those rare individuals who thought--and acted--\nahead of his time. While in the House of Delegates, he joined a \nmoderate group of ``Young Turks'' to pressure the legendary Byrd \nMachine into investing more money into education. And as a member of \nthe State senate in 1958, he exhibited what would become a lifetime \nunderstanding of the value of learning by chairing a statewide \nCommission on Public Education.\n  Then, in 1966, Bill Spong made history. In a Democratic primary, he \nchallenged U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson, a 20 year Byrd machine-\nbacked incumbent, and won by 611 votes. ``We called him Landslide \nSpong,'' remembered his friend and campaign manager William C. Battle.\n  As a member of this body, Mr. President, Bill Spong focused not on \npolitics, but on policy and principle. ``He agonized over legislation \nin his quest to do what he believed to be right,'' his former Press \nSecretary, Pete Glazer, said recently.\n  ``Bill Spong was the kind of public servant we all try to emulate,'' \nsaid Congressman Robert C. Scott, ``a man of integrity who courageously \nstood by his convictions and his principles, even when it might not be \nthe immediately popular thing to do.'' As Alson H. Smith, Jr., \nreflected: ``If Bill Spong thought it was right, he did it.''\n  Mr. President, Bill Spong was a statesman.\n  But 1972 taught us that Senators with great courage can be demagogued \nand out spent, and Bill Spong lost his Senate seat amidst George \nMcGovern's landslide defeat to Richard Nixon. ``In the Watergate year \nof 1971,'' remembered his college friend, and former U.S. attorney, Tom \nMason, ``Bill Spong became an early victim of the 11th hour 30-second \ntelevision spots that continue to plague our political system.'' ``In \nmy judgement,'' Mason said, ``Bill Spong's defeat in 1972 was one of \nthe worst developments in Virginia's political history.''\n  The Senate's great loss, however, was the Commonwealth's great gain, \nas Bill Spong left this institution to continue his extraordinary \nservice to Virginia. He became dean of William and Mary's Marshall-\nWythe School of Law in 1976 and his stewardship brought our Nation's \noldest law school from near ruin to national prominence. In 1989, he \nbecame the interim president of Old Dominion University in Norfolk.\n  ``He had a real intellectual bent,'' remembered Bill Battle. ``He was \nprobably more comfortable as Dean of the Law School at William and Mary \nthan at any other time of his life.''\n  ``His sense of humor was unbelievable,'' Battle continued. ``When we \nwere in law school together after World War II, he was always where the \ntrouble was but never in it. It's hard to believe he's no longer \naround.''\n  Mr. President, we may mourn Bill Spong's death. We may remember his \nlife. But we may never know the breadth of his legacy, or the \ninspiration he lent along the way. No political leader in the \nCommonwealth was more responsible for my own entry into Virginia \npolitics than Bill Spong. Dick\n\n[[Page S12561]]\n\nDavis entered public life because he was angry that his lifelong \nfriend--who he described last week as ``a great Virginian and a great \nSenator'' --lost his Senate seat. There's no question that Bill Spong \nwas an enormous force in the leadership of our State that began in \n1981.\n  In fact, in 1977, when I was Lieutenant Governor and our party was \nfractured and discouraged, I asked Bill Spong to help us put the pieces \nback together. I'll always be grateful that the Spong Commission \nReport, as we called it, laid the groundwork for the unity we needed to \nsucceed 4 years later.\n  Mr. President, during the time I served as Governor, I appointed Bill \nSpong to the Council on Higher Education and asked him to Chair the \nGovernor's Commission on the Future of Virginia. The latter produced an \nextraordinary report that helped guide public policy--and progress--in \nVirginia for over a decade. Just last summer, I asked Bill Spong to \nchair a judicial nomination committee to recommend a nominee for the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. As always, \nhis extraordinary judgement and unique vision were invaluable.\n  ``Bill worked hard throughout his public and private life to bring \nVirginians together to make a better world for all of us,'' Congressman \nScott said. ``I will miss his leadership and his friendship.''\n  ``He never forgot where he came from,'' remembered his former press \naide, Pete Glazer, ``and he died in the city where he was born.''\n  ``Two hundred years ago, we were fortunate to have dedicated and \nenlightened leaders of this Commonwealth,'' said H. Benson Dendy III. \n``Truly Senator Spong was such as a leader of our time.''\n  I will close, Mr. President, with two eulogies delivered at Bill \nSpong's memorial service in Williamsburg by Robert P. Crouch, Jr. and \nTimothy J. Sullivan. Their eloquence is a shining tribute to a man who \nhas been an inspiration to so many.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the eulogies were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Remarks on the Life of the Honorable William B. Spong, Jr.\n\n                       (By Robert P. Crouch, Jr.)\n\n       Athenians of antiquity defined a statesman as one who \n     plants trees knowing he will never enjoy their shade. Such \n     was the statesmanship--such was the life--of William Belser \n     Spong, Jr.\n       Bill Spong entered my life in June of 1971, when I followed \n     my friend, the Senator's good and devoted friend, Whitt \n     Clement, as the Senator's driver and aide. I traveled with \n     the Senator in that capacity for the remaining year and a \n     half of his Senate service.\n       It was an unusual position that we who served as ``wheelman \n     and gofer'' occupied. Callow and often bungling, just out of \n     college, we had a staff position that was among the most \n     humble in the office . . . in title, in rank, and in salary.\n       But ours was also the most privileged position on the \n     staff. For we were with the Senator. And anyone who was with \n     Bill Spong for much time at all became his student.\n       Awestruck to work for this Senator whose career I had \n     admired from a distance, I traveled with him to his beloved \n     Portsmouth during my first week on the job. Entering the \n     Spong home, luggage in hand, I was met by the Senator's \n     mother, Emily Spong. (My awe was to increase very rapidly.) \n     She stood at the top of the stairs and said to me, with what \n     I would come to know as unquestionable authority:\n       ``Young man, you go tell Billy, the one you call `Senator,' \n     to get in here right now!''\n       I quickly developed a tremendous affection for Emily Spong, \n     fueled, in part, by her sharing with me stories of youthful \n     misbehavior of the Senator and his best friend Richard, but I \n     never stopped calling her son ``The Senator.''\n       And while we of his Senate staff would, over the years, \n     hear him referred to as ``Dean Spong,'' then ``President \n     Spong'' (I liked that one a lot, and suspect that he enjoyed \n     it as well), or--more familiarly as--``Bill,'' or ``Billy,'' \n     or even ``Spongo,'' by some of his oldest and dearest \n     friends--Tom Mason, Dick Davis, the Battle boys, John and \n     Bill, among others--most of those of us who worked with him \n     in Washington would always refer to him as ``The Senator.'' \n     And always will.\n       The details of that Senate service--the legislation, the \n     tough decisions on tough votes, the campaigns--are well known \n     and have been well reviewed in recent news articles. I prefer \n     to take this brief time to speak of the character of his \n     public service.\n       An anecdote shared with me by an assistant United States \n     attorney in our Roanoke office, Don Wolthuis, who was a \n     student of the Senator at the Marshall-Wythe School of Law, \n     captures that character. Faced with a difficult personal \n     decision, Don went to Dean Spong for advice. After hearing \n     Don explain his dilemma, the Senator simply responded: \n     ``Whatever you do, do it well.''\n       But ``doing it well'' was not a simple or brief process for \n     Bill Spong. It was a well ordered and deliberate process. And \n     it was this he applied to his Senate service as he did to \n     every other aspect of his life. It involved anticipating the \n     challenges and the needs of the future; scanning the horizon \n     of time; thoughtfully examining options and consequences; \n     making a well informed choice, then carrying through with \n     that decision with grace and excellence. He lived the motto \n     of Virginia-born Sam Houston: ``Do the right thing and risk \n     the consequences.''\n       The Senator delighted in one reporter's description of him \n     as ``A gray cat in the Chesapeake fog.'' During that time, in \n     the years since, and in the past several days, the word \n     ``cautious'' has been frequently used to describe him. If \n     caution is understood to mean ``risk adverse,'' then it is \n     incorrectly applied to Bill Spong, for it is the seemingly \n     ``cautious'' choice which is often the least popular; the \n     most difficult to make; the least understood by others; \n     the most frustrating to sustain; and the most expensive.\n       His integrity--intellectual and moral--informed all that \n     Bill Spong did in the United States Senate, and it earned him \n     the respect and affection of his colleagues of both political \n     parties, and of their office and committee staff.\n       We who worked for him during those years learned not only \n     from the Bill Spong of the Senate office and the Senate \n     floor. He later acknowledged that his political fortune was \n     the victim of his Senate duty--and it is correct that he \n     chose to sacrifice the votes of civil club meetings to the \n     votes duty required he cast on the Senate floor. However, it \n     should also be understood that whenever he was free from \n     Senate duties, he was in the State. During that year and a \n     half, for example, we traveled to all but one of Virginia's \n     counties. And what travels those were.\n       He loved two Virginias. First, Virginia Wise Galliford, the \n     Marine Corps general's daughter he married and with whom he \n     raised Martha and Tom. She was a beautiful, generous, and \n     strong woman who also graced the lives of many here today, \n     and we misss her.\n       And to be with the Senator was to learn of the other \n     Virginia of his life, the Commonwealth: its magnificent \n     natural beauty, its wonderful and diverse people, its \n     history--colonial, Civil War, twentieth century--and, \n     certainly, its politics; traveling with Senator Spong was a \n     course in the rule of law; a class in big band music; a \n     seminar in sports from Bill Belser, his Walter Mitty-\n     sportswriter self (and if last week's resignation of UNC's \n     Dean Smith marked the departure of the ACC's greatest coach, \n     it has also just lost its greatest fan in Bill Spong).\n       We, his staff and supporters, knew then, of course, that \n     his Senate tenure was too short. History knows it now. Yet, \n     the Senate's loss, the Nation's loss, was clearly the gain of \n     this great institution and of many others he cared so deeply \n     about.\n       His departure from the Senate enabled him to spend more \n     time with his family, with Virginia, with Martha, and with \n     Tom. News articles have related his expression in later years \n     of how important that was to him. Many of us with him in 1972 \n     heard him say it then.\n       To Martha and Tom and to other members of the Spong family, \n     our thoughts and prayers for you today will extend into the \n     future. He was immensely proud of you, and of his and \n     Virginia's five splendid grandchildren: Edward, Peter, Chase, \n     Madison, and Lucy.\n       These beautiful and historic surroundings remind us that \n     there have been other ``gray cats'' in Virginia's history. \n     George Wythe, George Mason, come to mind. They turned events, \n     and their lives sent ripples through decades and generations, \n     and into the centuries.\n       As we reflect on the life of William Spong, our fine \n     teacher, many of us know our own lives were enriched and \n     blessed by the important place he has had, and will continue \n     to have, in them.\n       We know, too, and history will conclude, that in his public \n     service, Mr. Spong of Virginia was the best of his day, and \n     is among the greatest of Virginians.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    Eulogy for William B. Spong, Jr.\n\n                        (By Timothy J. Sullivan)\n\n       It all began--with bourbon--and with tuna salad. Not a few \n     of you must be wondering what I could possibly mean. How \n     could Bill Spong's triumphant William and Mary years have \n     anything at all to do with bourbon and tuna salad? But that \n     is the way they did begin, and you should know the story.\n       On a brilliant autumn Saturday sometime in October of 1975 \n     I drove from Williamsburg to Portsmouth. I was the very young \n     chair of the William and Mary Law Dean Search Committee. My \n     job--and it seemed to me mission impossible--was to help \n     convince Senator Spong that he really--really--did want to \n     become dean of a law school which was at substantial risk of \n     losing its professional accreditation.\n       Bill invited me to meet him at his home. We sat down to \n     lunch at the kitchen table. His beloved Virginia provided the \n     tuna salad--which was very good, Bill supplied the bourbon--\n     which was also good. Martha hovered--so it seemed to me--\n     skeptically on the\n\n[[Page S12562]]\n\n     fringes of the room. Tommy would occasionally catapult \n     through in pursuit of an errant soccer ball.\n       Bill and I talked--he was interested--and the rest is happy \n     history. Bill Spong did--as we all know--come to William and \n     Mary, and his leadership first healed a crippled institution \n     and then raised it to a level of national distinction that \n     none of us dared dream. He built a place of genuine \n     intellectual excellence--but he did more. He built a law \n     school of which George Wythe would have approved. And that is \n     not a casual compliment. George Wythe's approval mattered to \n     Bill--it mattered very much. Bill's inspiration shaped a \n     place where would be lawyers learned not only their duty to \n     their clients, but their duty to humanity--a place where \n     professional success was and is defined not only by hours \n     billed--but by a client's burdens lifted--by anguish eased.\n       During much of Bill's deanship, I served as one of his \n     associate deans. We became friends--more than friends \n     really--our association deepened in ways that--then and now--\n     makes it one of the great treasures of my life.\n       He was my teacher, too. I learned life lessons that I have \n     never forgotten and for which I have never failed to be \n     grateful. As a teacher, Bill was almost magical. He taught \n     without seeming to teach, and you learned without realizing \n     that you were being taught--until afterwards--when you were \n     left to discover--with manifest joy--the power of the lessons \n     he had lodged deep within your heart.\n       As most of you know, Bill did not drive. When he was here, \n     I was one of those who shared with Virginia the \n     responsibility of getting him where he needed to go--and that \n     led to not a few adventures.\n       One day he asked me whether I would like to go to Hampden-\n     Sydney. I said yes. I had never been there--and I was anxious \n     to see for myself--a place Bill really believed was some kind \n     of collegiate paradise. I asked him when I should pick him \n     up. He said--don't worry--just be here in the morning. When I \n     arrived on the next day, I discovered he had engaged Mr. \n     Albert Durant--a loquacious and long-time chauffeur for \n     hire--who was something of a local institution. Mr. Durant's \n     vehicle was a great, long black limousine--the vintage of \n     which would have given it pride of place in President \n     Eisenhower's first inaugural parade.\n       We bought sandwiches from the Cheese Shop and rolled up the \n     road to Farmville--fully occupied by Mr. Durant's non-stop \n     commentary while eating our lunch out of paper sacks in the \n     back seat.\n       When we approached the limits of that collegiate paradise--\n     Bill leaned forward and said--Mr. Durant . . . ``Mr. Durant . \n     . . see that alley up there on the right--turn in there. I \n     can't let them see me coming in a car like this.'' Now--it \n     wouldn't have been accurate exactly--to say that we snuck on \n     to the campus in camouflage--but it would be accurate to say \n     that we didn't make a point of being seen until we were a \n     safe distance from any possible connection with Mr. Durant's \n     gleaming but antique limousine.\n       On the way home, we stopped to get gas in what was then the \n     wilderness of Chesterfield. I got out with Mr. Durant to \n     stretch my legs. Bill stayed in the car. As he serviced the \n     car, the attendant peered in to the back window--turned to \n     me--and asked with some awe in his voice--``Would that be the \n     Governor in there?'' ``No,'' I said, ``but he should have \n     been.'' I still think that. He should have been.\n       But now, all is memory--the life is complete. What he \n     should have been doesn't matter. What does is what he was. \n     And what he way--was the most thoughtful public servant of \n     his generation--a great man who lived this Commonwealth--not \n     uncritically--but loved it still--the beauty of the land--the \n     decency of its people--the glory of its history.\n       What he was--was a teacher and builder who believe \n     profoundly in the power of education and who struck many a \n     powerful blow for civility and civilization.\n       What he was--was a friend whose friendship made you laugh \n     for the sheer joy of it, whose love gave you strength and \n     whose example gave you courage.\n       All that we must consign to memory--at the moment it is a \n     memory that wounds--and deeply.\n       But we all know--that in God's good time--that the would \n     will mostly heal--the pain will largely disappear--and we \n     will be left with the wonder--and may I say the warming glory \n     of having been numbered among that special band who loved and \n     were loved by our eternal friend--Bill Spong.\n\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Senate \npassage of the Mammography Quality Standards Act. I am delighted that \nthe Senate acted on Sunday, November 9 to unanimously approve this \nimportant legislation. The bill that the Senate has now passed \nreauthorizes the original legislation which passed in 1992 with \nbipartisan support. This year's bill is presented to the Senate with 55 \ncosponsors.\n  What MQSA does is require that all facilities that provide mammograms \nmeet key safety and quality-assurance standards in the area of \npersonnel, equipment, and operating procedures. Before the law passed, \ntests were misread, women were misdiagnosed, and people died as a \nresult of sloppy work. Since 1992, MQSA has been successful in bringing \nfacilities into compliance with the federal standards.\n  What are these national, uniform quality standards for mammography? \nWell, facilities are required to use equipment designed specifically \nfor mammography. Only radiological technologists can perform \nmammography. Only qualified doctors can interpret the results of \nmammography. Facilities must establish a quality assurance and control \nprogram to ensure reliability, clarity and accurate interpretation of \nmammograms. Facilities must be inspected annually by qualified \ninspectors. Finally, facilities must be accredited by an accrediting \nbody approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  This current reauthorization makes a few minor changes to the law to \nensure the following: Patients and referring physicians must be advised \nof any mammography facility deficiency. Women are guaranteed the right \nto obtain an original of their mammogram. Finally, both state and local \ngovernment agencies are permitted to have inspection authority.\n  I like this law because it has saved lives. The front line against \nbreast cancer is mammography. We know that early detection saves lives. \nBut a mammogram is worse than useless if it produces a poor-quality \nimage or is misinterpreted. The first rule of all medical treatment is: \nAbove all things, do no harm. And a bad mammogram can do real harm by \nleading a woman and her doctor to believe that nothing is wrong when \nsomething is. The result can be unnecessary suffering or even a death \nthat could have been prevented. That is why this legislation is so \nimportant. This law needs to be reauthorized so that we don't go back \nto the old days when women's lives were in jeopardy.\n  A strong inspection program under MQSA is extremely important to \nensure the public that quality standards are being met. In a GAO report \nwhich evaluated the MQSA inspection program, GAO praised the program. \nThey also recommended changes to further strengthen the program. FDA is \nin the process of implementing these recommendations. The FDA has \nproposed to direct its attention to conducting comprehensive \ninspections on those facilities where problems have been identified in \nthe past, while decreasing the extensiveness of inspections at those \nfacilities with excellent compliance records. I think it is important \nfor the FDA to move promptly in this direction. The best way to protect \nthe public health is for the FDA to focus its resources on the problem \nfacilities.\n  I want to make sure that women's health needs are met \ncomprehensively. It is expected that 180,000 new cases of breast cancer \nwill be diagnosed and about 44,000 women will die from the disease in \n1997. This makes breast cancer the most common cancer among women. And \nonly lung cancer causes more deaths in women.\n  We must aggressively pursue prevention in our war on breast cancer. I \npledge to fight for new attitudes and find new ways to end the needless \npain and death that too many American women face. This bill is an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  As the 105th Congress comes to a close, we can look back on some \ngreat bipartisan victories and other great partisan frustrations. But \none area Republicans and Democrats have always worked together on is \nwomen's health. I am proud of this bill's broad bipartisan support. I \nwant to take this opportunity to thank all the cosponsors for making \nthis happen. A special thanks to Senator Jeffords for working with me \non making passage of this bill a reality. As Dean of the Democratic\n\n[[Page S12563]]\n\nWomen, I want to also thank the Dean of the Republican Women, Kay \nBailey Hutchison, for always reaching out to work together on the \nissues that matter most to American women and their families.\n  Still, Senate passage alone does not assure reauthorization. It is my \nhope that the strong show of bipartisan support for this bill here in \nthe Senate will encourage the House of Representatives to promptly move \nforward on this bill. I hope they will follow our lead to ensure a \nquick reauthorization of MQSA. America's women are counting on it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Mikulski and many of my \ncolleagues today to support reauthorization of the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act. I want to especially commend Senator Mikulski for her \ninvaluable leadership on this issue. She brought the problem of poor \nquality mammography screening to the Senate's attention several years \nago and authored the historic legislation we are today reauthorizing.\n  As many of you know, I lost my sisters at an early age because of \nbreast cancer. This experience has helped to make me acutely aware of \nthe need for research on and improved early detection of breast cancer. \nI've always thought if they had had access to quality mammography \nscreening, they would be alive with us today.\n  Starting in 1990, as chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I worked with Senator Mikulski and others \nto start and fund a program at the CDC to provide screening for lower \nincome women without insurance. And in 1992, I offered an amendment to \ndedicate $210 million in the Defense budget for breast cancer research. \nBecause of this legislation, funding for breast cancer research has \nbeen included in the Defense Department budget every year since 1992, \nand will be included again in Fiscal Year 1998.\n  It is clear that if we are to win the war on breast cancer we must \ncontinue to support research on improved treatments, but we must also \nensure that breast cancer is detected early enough to apply these \ntreatments effectively. The need for legislating mammography quality \nstandards is obvious--every year approximately 180,000 women will be \ndiagnosed and 44,000 women will die of breast cancer. We can prolong \nand save the lives of millions of women if we can detect the cancer \nearly in its development. The earlier we can diagnose breast cancer, \nthe sooner a women can begin to receive appropriate treatment, and the \nmore likely it is that she will survive. It is vital that all women \nhave access to mammograms which are both properly performed and \naccurately analyzed. This screening is a very powerful weapon in the \nbattle against cancer.\n  Early diagnosis, and consequently early treatment, depend upon \naccurate evaluations of breast tissue. This means that the health care \nprofessionals taking mammograms and reading mammograms must be properly \ntrained. This Act sets forth requirements that all mammography \nfacilities meet stringent standards in terms of equipment used, \npersonnel, and reporting of mammography findings.\n  Congress must act quickly to pass this reauthorization so that women \nthroughout our nation can be confident that they are receiving the \nsafest, most reliable mammography available. Without these standards, \nwomen do not have such guarantees. They would be forced to place their \nlives in the hands of a random patchwork of Federal, State, and \nvoluntary standards. This is unacceptable. We cannot return to the days \nbefore this law was passed, when women were misdiagnosed because \nmammography clinics did not have standards for quality control.\n  Women also deserve the best technology available when it comes to \nearly detection of cancer because advanced technology means more \naccurate, and therefore earlier diagnosis. One such advance is digital \nmammography. This screening technique involves the creation of digital \nimages which are more easily visualized and can also be stored and \nforwarded to other medical sites. This can provide women in rural areas \nwith vital access to expert medical diagnosticians.\n  When women and their doctors have access to the best technology \navailable, such as digital mammography, it can mean the difference \nbetween life and death. It can also mean money saved, because it is \ncheaper to treat a small, confined tumor than it is to treat a full-\nblown metastactic cancer which has spread to other organ systems.\n  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, but it \ndoes not have to be the No. 1 cancer killer among women in the United \nStates because we have ways to detect it early on. The National Cancer \nInstitute advises that ``high-quality mammography combined with a \nclinical breast exam is the most effective technology presently \navailable to detect breast tumors.'' We have an obligation to American \nwomen to ensure that the mammographies they receive meet high-quality \nfederal standards. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation and I look forward to its speedy passage into law.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues \nfor passing the Mammography Quality Standards Act, assuring that \nnational, uniform quality standards will be in place for this \nlifesaving, preventive procedure.\n  Experts universally agree that mammography is one of the best ways to \ndetect breast cancer early. Yet, statistics show that the majority of \nwomen who need mammograms are not getting them. Nearly 40 percent of \nwomen ages 40 to 49, 35 percent of women ages 50 to 64, and 46 percent \nof women 65 years of age and over have not received a mammogram in the \npast 2 years. With 44,000 women dying annually from breast cancer, one \nin three of these might be saved if her breast cancer is detected \nearly.\n  Since almost 10 percent of breast cancers are not detected by \nmammography, it's essential to remember breast self-examination and \nclinical screening as the other important early detection tools we have \nat our disposal.\n  This was the first year that the National Cancer Institute joined the \nAmerican Cancer Society and other breast cancer organizations in \nsupport of screening mammograms on a regular basis. Dr. Richard \nKlausner, NCI Director, announced in March that the mammography \nrecommendations of the National Cancer Screening Board would be adopted \nby NCI.\n  Dr. Klausner spoke movingly about NCI-conducted focus groups that \nfound that many women are not aware that breast cancer risks increase \nwith age and that most women who develop breast cancer have no family \nhistory of the disease. He is to be commended for launching a new \neducation campaign featuring new breast health and mammogram fact \nbooklets, and breast health information hotline and Internet website.\n  The passage of the reauthorization of the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act dovetails nicely with these efforts. The original \nlegislation passed in 1992 has been successful in bringing mammography \nscreening facilities into compliance with a tough Federal standard. \nPatients can be assured that their mammography procedures and results \nare provided by qualified technical professionals and with annually \ninspected radiographic equipment and facilities.\n  This reauthorization makes some needed improvements to existing law. \nFacilities are now required to inform the patient as well as the \nphysician about the screening results, and patients may now obtain \ntheir original mammogram films and report. Consumers and physicians \nmust now be advised of any mammography facility deficiencies, and both \nState and local government agencies are granted inspection authority. \nThese improvements were recommended in a GAO report as ways to assure \nthat this vital prevention program continues to protect the public \nhealth and address women's health needs.\n  Last, I want to thank all the countless radiologists, radiologic \ntechnicians, and support workers who provide this very worthwhile \nservice and make the time spent undertaking this procedure as pleasant \nas possible. These are the soldiers in our war against cancer, and \ntheir contributions are invaluable. I thank you all for your support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12562-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12563-S12564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to advise Members of the\n\n[[Page S12564]]\n\nSenate why I have objected to the Senate consideration of H.R. 2513. \nThis bill, which was sent by the House to the Senate in the closing \ndays of this session, would provide tax relief for certain matters \ninvolving active financing income from foreign personal holding company \nincome and sale of stock in agricultural processors to certain farmers' \ncooperatives.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I have no objection to the provisions \nwhich provide tax relief in these matters. However, I do object to the \nmanner in which the House has proposed that we pay for these tax \nreductions. The use of sales of defense stockpiles to finance these tax \nrelief measures is, in my opinion, inappropriate and inconsistent with \nsection 311 of the Budget Act.\n  While I am removing my objection to the consideration of H.R. 2513, I \nwant to make clear to Members in both the Senate and the House that I \ndo not consider that a precedent is being established for using defense \nassets as offsets for non-defense-related expenditures. I want to make \nit clear also that I intend to object to any similar tax relief \nlegislation which is paid for in such a manner in the future.\n  As the majority leader moves to close out the remaining business so \nthat the Senate can adjourn, I want to take this opportunity to commend \nhim for his superb leadership and the outstanding manner in which he \nhas managed the Senate's business as the majority leader. I look \nforward to continuing to work with him in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12563-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12564-S12565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBAL FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate an issue which, I believe, needs to be addressed. Title IV-E \nof the Social Security Act, Federal payments for foster care and \nadoption assistance, does not provide equitable foster care and \nadoption services for Indian children living in tribal areas. I had \nhoped we might be able to amend this bill, which is designed to better \nserve children in need of permanent, loving homes, to include children \nliving in tribal areas. However, it appears that we will be unable to \ndo that at this time. Nonetheless, it is clear that the funding that \nprovides services to Indian children is sufficient to address the \ncompelling needs of children not equivalent to that provided for \nservices to children not living on reservations, and for that reason, I \nwould like to engage in a discussion about how we might address this \nissue.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am happy to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Democratic leader. Can the leader tell me what constitutes the \nprimary impediment to Indian children and tribal government access to \nthe Federal foster care program and Federal adoption assistance \nprogram?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the flaw in the statute is that it \nprovides IV-E assistance only to children placed by State courts or \nagencies with whom States have agreements. In doing so, the law has \nleft out Indian children living in tribal areas who are placed in \nfoster care and adoptive homes by tribal courts. A relatively small \nnumber of tribes--50, or 10 percent of the total number of federally \nrecognized tribes--has been able to work out tribal/State agreements \nwhereby foster care payments are made for children placed by tribal \ncourts. These agreements do not provide the full services of the title \nIV-E program, as they by and large do not include training and \nadministrative funding for tribal governments. A major impediment to \nreaching even these less-than-ideal tribal/State agreements is that \nState governments retain liability under the agreements, something that \nStates are reluctant to do.\n  The result is that Indian children--often the poorest of the poor in \nour Nation--are sometimes placed in unsubsidized homes without \nnecessary foster care services. This should not be the case. Other \nchildren in this Nation who meet the eligibility requirements are \neligible for the services of the open-ended Foster Care and Adoption \nAssistance Entitlement Program. State governments have benefited from \nlarge amounts of Federal administrative and training funds for their \nfoster care/adoption assistance programs. Tribal governments and Indian \nchildren have not.\n  The legislation being considered today is designed to improve \nservices and encourage permanent placements for children. Indian \nchildren living in tribal areas, however, have not benefited to the \nsame extent as other children under the current program, and we should \nensure that that discrepancy is eliminated.\n  The IV-E program provides help to fund the basics, such as food, \nshelter, clothing, and school supplies for the children, but this \nprogram does not include Indian children. We need to get our priorities \nin order, and help all children, especially those with special needs, \nincluding Indian children. I understand the primary reason for not \nincluding an amendment to make Indian children in tribal areas and \ntribal government eligible for the IV-E program is that no offset was \nprovided for the cost.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. \nUnfortunately, there are many provisions and new investments that \nMembers wanted to include. But we are running out of time in this \nsession, and securing new funding and appropriate revenue offsets is an \noverwhelming challenge. I appreciate the concerns the Senator has \nraised and would like to work with him in the future. As my colleagues \nknow, Indian children are covered under a special law, known as the \nIndian Child Welfare Act. We should work together to ensure that this \nlaw and other Federal programs for abused and neglected children are \nbetter coordinated.\n\n  Let me assure my colleagues, though, that this package will help \nIndian children. Within the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support \nfor Abused and Neglected Children, the PASS Act, is a provision to \nextend the 1993 law to provide funding for family preservation and \nfamily support for 3 additional years. This program is designed to \nsupport community-based programs to help innovative projects invest in \nprevention and programs to strengthen families. Within the existing law \nis a 1-percent set aside for the tribes. This will be extended 3 more \nyears, and I hope this funding will enable the tribes to continue \nongoing efforts to help Indian children.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I, too, want to express my strong interest \nin amending the title IV-E statute so that Indian children placed by \ntribal courts have access to this program on the same basis as other \nchildren and that tribal governments with approved programs be made \neligible for IV-E administrative and training funds on the same basis \nas States. Senator Campbell and I jointly wrote the Finance Committee \non this matter.\n  I would point out that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, in \nApril 1995, held a hearing on welfare reform proposals. At that \nhearing, a representative of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Office of the Inspector General, testified with regard to its \nAugust 1994 report: ``Opportunities for Administration on Children and \nFamilies to Improve Child Welfare Services and Protections for Native \nAmerican Children,'' which documented that tribes receive little \nbenefit or funding from the title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption \nAssistance Program--and other Social Security Act programs. The OIG \nreport states: ``The surest way to guarantee that Indian people receive \nbenefits from these Social Security Act programs is to * * * provide \ndirect allocations to tribes.'' The OIG report also noted that the \nState officials with whom they talked preferred direct IV-E funding to \ntribes:\n\n       With respect to IV-E funding, most State officials with \n     whom we talked favored ACF (Administration on Children and \n     Families) dealing directly with Tribes. This direct approach \n     for title IV-E would eliminate the need for Tribal-State \n     agreement, and because title IV-E is an uncapped Federal \n     entitlement, would not affect the moneys available to the \n     States. (p. 13)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I share the concerns expressed by my \ncolleagues about basic fairness. Last year during consideration of \nwelfare reform, I advocated that we use that bill as a vehicle to fix \nthe title IV-E law with regard to tribes and Indian children in tribal \nareas. Under the current law, states cannot even administer a Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families [TANF] program unless they have in place \na foster care/adoption assistance program. I appreciate the efforts of \nRepresentatives Hayworth and McDermott in trying to fix this problem \nduring the Ways and Means Committee consideration of its adoption\n\n[[Page S12565]]\n\nbill, H.R. 867, and also of former Representative Bill Richardson who \nearly this year introduced a freestanding bill on this issue. It seems \nthat we keep running into the issue of funding. This is, however, a \nclear-cut case of fairness, and we must work together to provide \nequitable assistance to Indian children.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the perspective my \ncolleagues bring to this issue. Clearly, we need to take into account \nthe status of tribes and tribal court system and the children under \ntheir jurisdiction in determining IV-E payments. I will work with them \nto correct this inequity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues \nwho share my belief that it is fundamentally unfair for Indian children \nplaced by tribal courts to be ineligible for IV-E assistance even \nthough these children otherwise meet the eligibility requirements. In \nmy judgment, we have a responsibility, both because of the Federal \nGovernment's trust relationship with Indian tribes and because of the \ndesperate need that exists in Indian country for this funding, to \ncorrect this oversight as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for joining \nme in this discussion and for their acknowledgment that this is an \ninjustice that must be corrected. I look forward to working with them \nto make sure we provide the same resources for Indian children as we do \nfor other children in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12564-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE LATE BOB JONES, JR.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Students who attend this \ninstitution learn the fundamentals of Christianity while gaining a \nvaluable education that will prepare them for their future. The \nuniversity's talented and devoted staff of educators make many \ncontributions to the world through their service to the community and \ntheir dedication to teaching others the truths of the Bible. Graduates \nof Bob Jones University are employed throughout the Nation in many \ndifferent fields, but each possesses the qualities and values of a good \nChristian upbringing, and are sound in both mind and body.\n  In addition to his service at the university, Dr. Jones was a well \nrespected preacher and Christian leader throughout the Nation. \nAddressing crowds at church services, conferences, and meetings around \nthe world, he was often touted as an evangelical leader who gained an \nunequaled respect and admiration from those who had the privilege of \nhearing him speak. Words cannot possibly express the degree of his \ndevotion to the Christian faith, his community, family, and friends. \nHis death has left a large void that will serve to remind us of the \ngreat impact he had upon each of these. Dr. Jones was a dear friend of \nmine, and I feel a deep loss in his death, as do so many throughout our \nNation.\n  His family, which includes his wife, Fannie May Holmes Jones; his \nthree children; 10 grandchildren; and his three great-grandchildren, \nall have my deepest sympathies. They have lost a wonderful husband, \nfather, grandfather, and great-grandfather, and South Carolina has lost \nan irreplaceable son.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12565-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

There are ways of burning coal so that it \nproduces only a tiny fraction of the air pollution now being emitted by \nthese powerplants. And, since virtually all of these powerplants are \nreaching the age at which significant investment is required to keep \nthem on line, the nation has a unique and valuable opportunity to \naddress the problem.\n  Steps should be taken not only to prevent further degradation of our \nenvironment, but also to ensure fairness in retail electricity \ncompetition.

Mr. President, I would like to discuss a very important \nbill that I first introduced on October 31, 1997. The bill, S. 1354, \nwhich is cosponsored by Senators Campbell, Stevens, Inouye, Daschle, \nand Dorgan, is an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934. The \namendment enables the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to \ndesignate common carriers not under the jurisdiction of a State \ncommission as eligible recipients of universal service support.\n  Universal Service provides intercarrier support for the provision of \ntelecommunications services in rural and high-cost areas throughout the \nUnited States. However, section 254(e) of the Communications Act states \nthat only an eligible carrier designated under section 214(e) of the \nCommunications Act, shall be eligible to receive specific Federal \nuniversal support after the FCC issues regulations implementing the new \nuniversal service provisions into the law. Section 214(e) does not \naccount for the fact that State commissions in a few States have no \njurisdiction over certain carriers. Typically, States also have no \njurisdiction over tribally owned common carriers which may or may not \nbe regulated by a tribal authority that is not a State commission per \nse.\n  The failure to account for these situations means that carriers not \nsubject to the jurisdiction of a State commission have no way of \nbecoming an eligible carrier that can receive universal service \nsupport. This would be the case whether these carriers are traditional \nlocal exchange carriers that provide services otherwise included in the \nprogram, have previously obtained universal service support, or will \nlikely be the carrier that continues to be the carrier of last resort \nfor customers in the area.\n  This simple amendment will address this oversight within the \namendments made by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and prevent the \nunintentional consequences it will have on common carriers which \nCongress intended to be covered under the umbrella of universal service \nsupport.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would this bill have any effect on the existing \njurisdiction of State commissions over new or incumbent local exchange \ncarriers, or providers of commercial mobile radio services?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No, this bill does nothing to alter the existing \njurisdiction that State commissions already have over local exchange \ncarriers or providers of commercial mobile radio services as set forth \nin section 332(c)(3) of the Communications Act. Nor will this bill have \nany effect on litigation that may be pending regarding jurisdictional \nissues between the States and federally recognized tribal governments. \nI thank the Democratic leader for his interest in this matter.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his clarification of this \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12568-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12568-S12569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Veterans \nDay, that day on which all of us are called on to honor the sacrifices \nmade for our country by those who serve in her armed forces and those \nwho risked or gave their lives defending her.\n  It is only right, Mr. President, that we pay tribute to the brave men \nand women who put their country before themselves in time of danger. On \nthe beaches of Normandy or in the jungles of Vietnam, in the South \nPacific or the Persian Gulf, on the shores of Inchon or the deserts of \nNorth Africa, our soldiers and sailors have defended this country \naround the globe, in the face of bombs, bullets, disease and hunger. \nNothing we do can repay the debt we owe them. But we must note that \ndebt, recognize it and make certain our children know how great it is.\n  As we remember the brave young people who have defended our nation in \ntime of war, we should not forget that many of them put their lives on \nthe line for America even though they were born in a different land. \nThese soldiers and sailors were not born in this country. But they \nloved her enough to risk their lives to protect her.\n  Over 60,000 active military personnel are immigrants to this country. \nMore than 20 percent of recipients of our highest military declaration, \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, have been immigrants. And the most \ndecorated combat team of World War II was a regiment made up of the \nsons of Japanese immigrants.\n  Many immigrants have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. \nMore than once I have told audiences the story of Nicolas Minue, the \nPolish born soldier who served the United States in World War II. I \ntell this story because of the inspiring bravery that is its subject, \nbecause of the pride it should evoke in every American, native or \nforeign born.\n  In Tunisia in 1943, private Minue's company was pinned down by enemy \nmachine gunfire.\n  According to the official report, ``Private Minue voluntarily, alone, \nand unhesitatingly, with complete disregard of his own welfare, charged \nthe enemy entrenched position with fixed bayonet. Private Minue \nassaulted the enemy under a withering machine-gun and rifle fire, \nkilling approximately ten enemy machine gunners and riflemen. After \ncompletely destroying this position, Private Minue continued forward, \nrouting enemy riflemen from dugout positions until he was fatally \nwounded. The courage, fearlessness and aggressiveness displayed by \nPrivate Minue in the face of inevitable death was unquestionably the \nfactor that gave his company the offensive spirit that was necessary \nfor advancing and driving the enemy from the entire sector.''\n  America remains free because she has been blessed with many American \nheroes, willing to give their lives in her defense. Nicolas Minue \nshowed that not every American hero was born in America.\n  Michigan, too, has her share of heroes. More than once, I have \nrelated the story of Francisco Vega, a citizen of my state who was born \nand raised in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Mexican immigrants. His \nfather, Naba Lazaro Vega served in the American Army during World War \nI. I tell Mr. Vega's story because it, too, is one of inspiring bravery \nand love of country.\n  Mr. Vega volunteered for the Army in October 1942 and served during \nthe Second World War. He fought for the Americans in five major battles \nin Europe, including the crucial landing at Omaha Beach in Normandy. He \nwas awarded bronze stars for bravery in each of these five battles. Mr. \nVega was discharged in December 1945 and came to Michigan, where he \nattended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and graduated from \nAquinas College in Grand Rapids. He retired from his own cemetery \nbusiness in 1993 and currently resides in Grand Rapids.\n  In Vietnam, also, immigrants served our nation and became heroes. For \nexample, Alfred Rascon immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico. At age 20, \nwhile a lawful permanent resident, Mr. Rascon volunteered to serve in \nVietnam. During a firefight he twice used his body to shield wounded \nsoldiers. He was nearly killed dashing through heavy enemy fire to get \ndesperately\n\n[[Page S12569]]\n\nneeded ammunition, but refused medical attention until the wounds of \nall the other soldiers in his unit were tended. Asked why he showed \nsuch courage even though he was not yet a U.S. citizen, Mr. Rascon \nreplied ``I was always an American in my heart.'' So impressed were \nthey by his bravery that fellow soldiers who witnessed his acts have \nurged that he receive the Medal of Honor.\n  I could tell many more such stories. But let these three suffice to \nshow the commitment to America's ideals and way of life that has been \nshown by so many brave young soldiers and sailors over the years.\n  We owe a debt to all these people for keeping our nation free and \nsafe in a dangerous world. And we owe a continuing debt of gratitude to \nthose today who serve, guarding our country, our homes and our freedom. \nLike all good things, freedom must be won again and again. I hope all \nof us will remember those, immigrants and native born, who have won \nfreedom for us in the past, and stand ready to win freedom for us \nagain, if they must.\n  May we never forget our debt to the brave who have fallen and the \nbrave who stand ready to fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12568-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING JEAN FORD FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GREAT STATE OF \n                                 NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Nevadan \nwhose dedication, foresight and work on behalf of women and minorities \nhas profoundly changed the face of the Silver State. Jean Ford can be \ncalled a role model and an inspiration for generations to come, not \nonly in Nevada but across our great Nation. Time and again she has \ngiven of herself to better the lives of those around her and she has \ncreated a legacy that will long endure in the history of Nevada.\n  Jean Ford has been a State legislator, an educator, a successful \nbusinesswoman and I am proud to say a true friend to me and my family. \nOver the years we worked together on a great many projects, and I have \ncome to deeply admire Jean's compassion for all people, and her \ndevotion to protecting and preserving Nevada's natural beauty.\n  I first met Jean Ford more than 25 years ago when she was elected to \nNevada's State Assembly. Jean quickly rose to become a driving force \nfor women's equality in Nevada, introducing the equal rights amendment \nin our State and working to end sex discrimination and break down long \nstanding gender barriers. Through the years, her work in the \nlegislature also carried over to other minority groups who found in \nJean a voice, and a visionary willing to lead them on what was often a \nlong, hard struggle for equal treatment under the law. Senior citizens, \nthe disabled, single mothers, they were all important to Jean, and in \nturn, she helped make them important to each of us.\n  It was through working with Jean that I came to realize the \nimportance of many of the issues that I have taken on in my own \nlegislative career. Women's health, child care, the environment, equal \nrights, protecting our seniors and the list goes on. I also owe her a \ngreat deal of thanks for bringing to my attention the need for \ninvolvement by women at every level of the political spectrum. From the \nState legislature where Jean and I both cut our political teeth, to \nthis very body I stand before today. Diversity of opinion is the \nlifeblood that feeds democracy and I am grateful that people like Jean \nFord helped break down the walls that once kept all but a privileged \nfew out of the political realm.\n  For her work in opening these doors, Jean has been honored dozens of \ntimes by groups throughout Nevada, including being named `` Outstanding \nWoman of the year'' by the Nevada Women's Political Caucus, and ``Civil \nLibertarian of the year'' by the ACLU. Jean's legacy also encompasses \nseveral political organizations which she helped co-found including the \nNational Women's Legislator's Network, and the Nevada Elected Women's \nNetwork.\n  More recently, Jean has dedicated herself to helping future Nevadans \nthrough her work in the classroom. Since 1991, Jean has been an \ninstructor at the University of Nevada--Reno, where she served as \nacting director of the Women's Studies Program. She has also been an \ninstructor of History and Political Science, and helped developed the \nNevada Women's archives through the University library system. It is \nonly fitting that Jean is also the current State coordinator for the \nNevada Women's History Project.\n  But In spite of all that she has endeavored to create, the \nmagnificent achievements of Jean Ford are truly overshadowed by the \nwarmth and graciousness which she has exhibited through the many years \nthat I have known her. I am sure if you could count them, her friends \nwould number in the thousands, and her admirers would number even more. \nThat is the true testament to a life long list of accomplishments.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join with me today to recognize a true \npioneer who changed her world for the better, and whose efforts have \ntouched not only those who call Nevada home, but the hearts and minds \nof all who have had the pleasure and the honor to know my friend Jean \nFord.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12569-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12569-S12570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS DURING THE FIRST SESSION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we wrap up our business for the first \nyear of the 105th Congress, I believe it is appropriate to take account \nof the Senate's advice and consent on judicial nominations. As I have \nsaid many times this year in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate \nfloor, the Senate has failed to fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibilities to the Federal judiciary.\n  In recent days, the Senate has quickened its painfully slow pace on \nreviewing and confirming judicial nominations. I have commended the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee for holding two judicial \nnominations hearings in September and October and for holding another \nhearing yesterday, which brings the total for the year to nine.\n  Unfortunately, we had no hearings at all in 4 months--January, \nFebruary, April or August--and none is anticipated in December. I \nrepeat that we have never had a day go by this session without having a \nbacklog of at least 20 judicial nominations awaiting a hearing. Even \nwith the virtual frenzy of last-minute hearings, we will close the year \nwith more than 30 nominees having never been accorded a confirmation \nhearing.\n  I acknowledge that the majority leader has allowed the Senate to \nproceed to confirm 13 judicial nominees in the last week, but that \nstill leaves eight outstanding nominees on the Senate Calendar still to \nbe considered.\n  I understand that Senator Boxer has received a commitment from the \nRepublican leadership to proceed to consideration of the longstanding \nnomination of Margaret Morrow by the middle of February next year. I \ncommend the Senator from California for achieving what appeared to be \nimpossible, getting the Senate to debate this outstanding nominee. I \ndeeply regret that we have not proceeded to debate and vote to confirm \nMargaret Morrow to the District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia this year. Hers is the nomination that has been stalled \nbefore the Senate the longest, since June 12.\n  She has twice been reported to the Senate favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee. She has been unfairly maligned and her family and law \npartners made to suffer for far too long without cause or \njustification. Some have chosen to use her nomination as a vehicle for \npartisan political, narrow ideological, and conservative fund raising \npurposes. She deserved better treatment. The people of California \ndeserved to have this nominee confirmed and in place hearing cases long \nago. The wait can never be rectified or justified.\n  I hope that the Republican leadership will not require any of the \nother nominees currently pending on the calendar to remain hostage to \ntheir inaction. Ann Aiken was finally reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee earlier this month. Her nomination was first \nreceived in November 1995, 2 years ago. She had an earlier hearing in \nSeptember 1996 and another last month. This is a judicial emergency \nvacancy that should be filled without further delay.\n  G. Patrick Murphy would be a much-needed addition to the District \nCourt for the Southern District of Illinois. He\n\n[[Page S12570]]\n\nwas reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee and his \nconfirmation should be expedited.\n  Michael P. McCuskey was likewise reported without a single objection \nby the Judiciary Committee for a vacancy that is a judicial emergency \nthat ought to be filled without delay.\n  Frederica Massiah-Jackson is a Pennsylvania State court judge. The \nSenate should move to consider her nomination without the months of \ndelay that will ensue following adjournment.\n  As we enter the final hours of this session, the Senate has confirmed \n36 of the President's 77 judicial nominations. That is certainly better \nthan the 17 confirmed last year. It is better than the total of only 9 \nwho had been confirmed before September this year. But in a time period \nin which we have experienced 121 vacancies on the Federal courts, the \nSenate has proceeded to confirm judges at an annual rate of only three \nper month. And that does not begin to consider the natural attrition \nthat will lead to more vacancies over the next several months.\n  I want to thank the President of the United States for helping. Not \nonly has the President sent us almost 80 nominees this year but he \ndevoted a national radio address to reminding the Senate of its \nconstitutional responsibility to consider and confirm qualified \nnominees to the Federal bench. When he spoke, the American people, and \nmaybe even the Senate, listened. Since word that he would be speaking \nout on this issue reached Capitol Hill, the pace has picked up a bit.\n  Unfortunately, the final report on this session of Congress is that \nthe Senate did not make progress on the judicial vacancy crisis. In \nfact, there are many more vacancies in the Federal judiciary today than \nwhen the Senate adjourned last year. At the snail's pace that the \nSenate has proceeded with judicial nominations this year, we are not \neven keeping up with attrition. When Congress adjourned last year, \nthere were 64 vacancies on the Federal bench. In the last 11 months, \nanother 57 vacancies have occurred. Thus, after the confirmation of 36 \njudges in 11 months, there has been a net increase of 16 vacancies, an \nincrease of more than one-third in the number of current Federal \njudicial vacancies.\n  Judicial vacancies have been increasing, not decreasing, over the \ncourse of this year and therein lies the vacancy crisis, which the \nChief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the rising \nnumber of vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the Federal \njudiciary.''\n  The Senate still has pending before it 11 nominees who were first \nnominated during the last Congress, including five who have been \npending since 1995. While I am delighted that we are moving more \npromptly with respect to some of this year's nominees, I remain \nconcerned about the other vacancies and other nominees.\n  There remains no excuse for the Senate's delay in considering the \nnominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. \nFletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, M. Margaret \nMcKeown, Susan Oki Mollway, Margaret M. Morrow, Clarence J. Sundram, \nAnn L. Aiken, Annabelle Rodriguez, Michael D. Schattman and Hilda G. \nTagle, all of whom have been pending since the last Congress. All of \nthese nominees have been waiting at least 18 months and some more than \n2 years for Senate action.\n  Most of these outstanding nominees have been waiting all year for a \nhearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably \nreported last year. Judge Paez had a hearing last year but has been \npassed over so far this year. Judge Paez, Professor Fletcher, and Ms. \nMcKeown are all nominees for judicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth \nCircuit, as well.\n  Next year, I hope that the Committee will proceed without delay to \nconsider these nominations, as well as the nominations of Clarence \nSundram and Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who have participated in hearings \nbut are still bottled up in the Judiciary Committee.\n  We should be moving promptly to fill the vacancies plaguing the \nFederal courts. Thirty-five confirmations in a year in which we have \nwitnessed 121 vacancies is not fulfilling the Senate's constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  At the end of Senator Hatch's first year chairing the Committee, \n1995, the Senate adjourned having confirmed 58 judicial nominations. In \nthe last year of the Bush Presidency, a Democratic majority in the \nSenate proceeded to confirm 66 judges.\n  Unfortunately, this year there has been a concerted campaign of \nintimidation that threatens the very independence and integrity of our \njudiciary. We are witnessing an ideological and political attack on the \njudiciary by some, both outside and within Congress. Earlier this fall \nthe Republican Majority Whip in the House and the Majority Leader in \nthe Senate talked openly about seeking to ``intimidate'' the Federal \njudiciary. It is one thing to criticize the reasoning of an opinion, \nthe result in a case, or to introduce legislation to change the law. It \nis quite another matter to undercut the separation of powers and the \nindependence that the Founders created to insulate the judiciary from \npolitics. Independent judicial review has been an important check on \nthe political branches of our Federal Government that have served us so \nwell for over 200 years.\n  I want to commend all those who have spoken out against this \nextremist and destructive rhetoric.\n  I also thank my Democratic colleagues for their patience this year. \nNo Democrat has delayed or placed a ``hold'' on a single judicial \nnominee for a single day, all year. It is the normal course in the \nSenate when one Senator sees the recommendations of other Senators of \nthe other party moving through to confirmation while his or her \nnominees are being held back, to place such a hold. This year we \nresisted.\n  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to \nhave the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfil its constitutional \nresponsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these \nvacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the \nadministration of justice.

Mr. President, last year the Congress enacted, and the \nPresident signed into law, the Line Item Veto Act--Public Law 104-130. \nThis act delegated specific authority to the President to cancel in \nwhole any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority identified by \nCongress, new direct spending, and limited tax benefits. As the \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee at that time, I was \nchairman of the conference committee and one of the principal authors \nof the act. Another principal author was the Senator from New Mexico, \nmy good friend and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. We are here \non the floor today to say that the President exceeded the authority \ndelegated to him when he attempted to use the Line Item Veto Act to \ncancel section 642 of the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Act of 1998, which is Public Law 105-61.\n  Section 642 of that law would allow a six month open season for \nemployees currently under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to \nswitch to the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS). The last such \nopen season was in 1988.\n  On October 16 President Clinton sent a special message to Congress in \nwhich he claims to have canceled section 642 pursuant to the authority \ndelegated to him by Congress in the Line Item Veto Act. Under the Act \nthe President is permitted to cancel in whole any dollar\n\n[[Page S12571]]\n\namount of discretionary budget authority, any item of new direct \nspending, or any limited tax benefit if the President determines that \nsuch cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit, not impair \nany essential government function, and not harm the national interest. \nA cancellation must be made and Congress must be notified by special \nmessage within five calendar days of the date of enactment of the law \nproviding the dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, item of \nnew direct spending, or limited tax benefit that was canceled.\n  The President's special message number 97-56 on the Treasury and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Act of 1998 states that the President \nis canceling $854 million in discretionary budget authority provided by \nsection 642. The President arrives at this figure by estimating the \ndollar amount that employee contributions to the CSRS would be reduced \nas a result of Federal employees shifting to FERS. Unfortunately for \nthe President, these contributions do not represent a ``dollar amount \nof discretionary budget authority'' as defined by the Line Item Veto \nAct. Therefore those funds could not be canceled pursuant to that Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with my colleague from Alaska. Congress added \nthe Line Item Veto Act as Part C of title X of the Congressional Budget \nand Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which is more commonly referred to \nas the Budget Act. This was done deliberately, so that the cancellation \nauthority provided by the Line Item Veto Act is part of a larger, \nestablished system of budgetary tools that Congress imposes on itself \nor has delegated to the President to control federal spending.\n\n  The Line Item Veto Act provides a detailed definition of what \nrepresents a ``dollar amount of discretionary budget authority.'' The \ndefinition specifically allows the President to cancel the ``entire \ndollar amount of budget authority required to be allocated by a \nspecific proviso in an appropriation law for which a specific dollar \nfigure was not included,'' which appears to be the definition which the \nPresident used to justify the cancellation of section 642. However, in \ndoing so it appears that the President's advisors failed to realize \nthat section 642 does not constitute ``budget authority'' as defined in \nsection 3 of the Budget Act. That definition also applies to Part C of \ntitle X of the Budget Act, which as I mentioned is the Line Item Veto \nAct.\n  ``Budget authority'' is defined in the Budget Act as ``provisions of \nlaw that make funds available for obligation and expenditure * * * \nborrowing authority * * * contract authority * * * and offsetting \nreceipts and collections * * *.'' Section 642 does not make any funds \nspecifically available, so it does not meet that definition of budget \nauthority. Nor does it provide authority to borrow money or the \nauthority to obligate funds for future expenditure. This means that in \norder to qualify as budget authority, the $854 million reduction in \nCSRS employee contributions the President purported to cancel using the \nLine Item Veto Act would have to be offsetting receipts.\n  Unfortunately for the President, his advisors seem to have overlooked \nthat employee contributions to retirement accounts are considered \ngovernmental receipts, and not offsetting receipts, so they do not meet \nthe definition of budget authority.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The senator from New Mexico is making my point exactly. \nThe President's advisors cannot change the definition of budget \nauthority to permit him to reach this provision. As a senior member of \nthe Appropriations Committee I was particularly concerned with the \nprecise nature of the authority delegated to the President, and worked \nvery hard along with my staff to ensure that the definitions were clear \nand unambiguous. That is the reason for the detailed definition in \nsection 1026 of the Budget Act, as added by the Line Item Veto Act, \nwhich incorporates the long established definition of budget authority \nin section 3 of the Budget Act. Is it the Senator from New Mexico's \nunderstanding that prior to the attempted cancellation of section 642 \nthat the President's own documents classified employee contributions to \nretirement accounts as governmental receipts that are counted as \nrevenue and not offsetting receipts that offset budget authority and \noutlays?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Alaska is correct. In the President's \nBudget for Fiscal Year 1998 there is a proposal to increase employee \ncontributions to both CSRS and FERS. This proposal is shown on page 317 \nof the Budget, in Table S-7 that shows the impact of tax relief \nprovisions and other revenue measures, as an increase in governmental \nreceipts. This same proposal is listed under ``miscellaneous receipts'' \nin Table 3-4 showing Federal receipts by source on page 59 of the \nAnalytical Perspectives document that accompanied the FY 98 Budget. The \nfact that section 642 would have resulted in a reduction in employee \ncontributions to CSRS does not alter their treatment under the Budget \nAct; they are still governmental receipts collected from employees \nthrough the government's sovereign powers and not offsetting receipts \ncollected as a result of a business-like or market oriented activity.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for that \nexplanation. In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to \nclarify further how the Line Item Veto Act operates. Section \n1021(a)(3)(B) of the Budget Act--the section of the Line Item Veto Act \nthat provides the cancellation authority--makes it clear that the \nauthority is limited to the cancellation of a dollar amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority that is provided in the just-signed law \nbefore the President. Under the specific terms and definitions provided \nin the Line Item Veto Act, the President cannot reach a dollar amount \nof discretionary budget authority provided in some other law that is \nnot the one before the President. The Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Act did not provide $854 million in discretionary budget \nauthority for section 642, so that amount could not be rescinded under \nthe terms of the Line Item Veto Act. The $854 million figure came from \nthe President's estimates of the loss of employee contributions to CSRS \ngovernment-wide. As we have explained above that loss is not budget \nauthority, so it cannot be canceled. But even if it were, the President \ncould not reach dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority \ngovernment-wide unless the dollar amount of budget authority needed \ngovernment-wide was provided in the specific appropriations law before \nhim.\n  As the definition of cancel in section 1026 of the Budget Act clearly \nstates, in the case of a dollar amount of discretionary budget \nauthority the term ``cancel'' means ``rescind''--a term which itself \nhas a long history in congressional-executive branch relations. The \nrecission of budget authority in a specific law does not change the \noperative effect of a general provision in that specific law with \nrespect to budget authority provided in another law. As the statement \nof managers accompanying the Line Item Veto Act makes clear, the \ndelegated authority in the Act does not permit the President to strike \nout or rewrite the law. It merely allows him discretionary authority to \nclose the doors to the Federal Treasury and refuse to spend funds \nappropriated by Congress in that particular law.\n  In contrast, the definition of ``cancel'' with respect to new direct \nspending, which also results in the expenditure of budget authority, is \nto prevent the specific provision of law or legal obligation from \n``having legal force or effect.'' This distinction recognizes that \nprovisions of law that result in new direct spending may not actually \nprovide budget authority that can be canceled at that time--say for \nexample a provision of law that simply increases the amount an \nindividual will receive at a future date under an existing benefit \nprogram provided in a law enacted years before. Such provisions create \na legal obligation or right that may be exercised in the future, or \nwhich result in a future increase in expenditures from budget authority \nprovided elsewhere. If the President wishes to remove the legal force \nor effect of a specific provision of law that applies to budget \nauthority provided in a law other than the appropriations law the \nprovision is in, then he may only do so if that provision is new direct \nspending under the Line Item Veto Act.\n  Section 642 is not an ``item of new direct spending'' as defined in \nsection 1026 of the Budget Act because it results in savings to the \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S12572]]\n\nwhen compared to the present budget baseline. As explained above, the \nPresident's wish to the contrary notwithstanding, it does not result in \na dollar amount of discretionary budget authority. Thus, the President \nhas exceeded his delegated authority by violating the terms of the \nstatute, and I would urge the Justice Department to concede that the \ncancellation of section 642 was outside the authority provided by the \nstatute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur in the Senator's analysis and recommendation. \nThe Line Item Veto Act is a carefully crafted delegation of authority. \nThe President undermines that delegation when he attempts to reach \noutside the clear limits of that Act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for joining me in \nthis colloquy, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12570-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    STATUS OF OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM AND OECD SHIPBUILDING AGREEMENT \n                              LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to address the status of the \nOcean Shipping bill and the implementation of the OECD Shipbuilding \nAgreement in the Senate. These are very important bills which are badly \nneeded to reform America's maritime industry.\n  A number of my Senate colleagues joined me in working very hard this \nyear, in a bipartisan way, to get these two bills done. The legislation \nand amendments reflected a balance among the concerns of all affected \nparties. However, I must report that a few Senators have held up each \nbill. This minority of Senators wants more than most of us believe is \ndo-able. Given the waning hours of this session, the Senate will not be \nable to consider and pass either of these bills this year. I am deeply \ndisappointed.\n  Mr. President, maritime issues are very important to me. I grew up in \nthe port town of Pascagoula. I still live there. My father worked in \nthe shipyard. I have spent my entire adult life working on maritime \nissues. So I am very concerned by the Senate's inaction on these two \npieces of legislation.\n  The Ocean Shipping Act is D.I.W.--``dead in the water'', at least for \nthis year. The incremental Shipping Act reforms have been stopped \nbecause some want to inject new issues into the legislation. Issues \nthat should be resolved at the labor-management negotiating table. \nIssues not directly related to making America's container ships more \ncompetitive in the international marketplace.\n  Mr. President, the bill's sponsors have made it clear on several \noccasions that we are not trying to undo or inject the Senate into the \ncollective-bargaining process for port labor agreements. These concerns \ncan and should be addressed in a fair and even-handed manner at the \nbargaining table.\n  Despite my efforts to work through this issue this past weekend, some \nSenators on the other side of the aisle have chosen to stop the Ocean \nShipping Reform bill.\n  Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform bill is necessary.\n  Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform bill helps U.S. exporters in \nevery State of this nation compete with their foreign competitors.\n  Without Ocean Shipping Reform, the Senate keeps 50 states D.I.W. for \na small organized group.\n  Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform bill helps America's \ncontainer ships and exporters.\n  When we take up this bill early next year, each Senator will be asked \nto choose between helping the thousands of workers in his or her State \nor harming them.\n  Mr. President, the second piece of important maritime legislation I \nwould like to see passed is the implementation of the OECD Shipbuilding \nAgreement, signed nearly 3 years ago. This legislation, I am \ndisappointed to report, is also D.I.W.\n  Senators on two committees worked very hard this session, in a \nbipartisan manner, to address the legitimate concerns of our nation's \nlargest shipyards. U.S. participation in this agreement is essential, \nbut it must be based on the firm understanding that the Jones Act and \nnational security requirements regarding vessel construction will not \nbe restricted by other countries. What America desires is a level \nplaying field, without compromising our national security interests.\n  I believe that S. 1216, with the Lott-Breaux amendment, addresses \nthese principles in a good faith effort to resolve the issues \nidentified by Representative Bateman. I would not support any \nlegislation that didn't respect these principles.\n  Let me be clear. I am a Jones Act supporter, period. And I believe \nthe amendment protects the integrity of the Jones Act.\n  But once again, a few Senators have stopped this vital legislation in \nmid-ocean. Another D.I.W. bill.\n  This minority of Senators wants to include additional exceptions to \nthe OECD Agreement's limitations on commercial vessel construction \nsubsidies and credits. I am concerned that this attempt will scuttle \nthe entire Agreement. This is counter-productive. This would force U.S. \nshipbuilders back into a subsidy race that the U.S. cannot afford to \nwin. This small minority of Senators are not just stopping this \nlegislation in mid-ocean, but scuttling it--sinking it. And I believe \nthat, no matter how well-meaning they may be, they will eventually \njeopardize the very U.S. commercial shipbuilding industry they are \ntrying to protect. Our commercial shipbuilding industry needs a \nworldwide, level playing field. We need it now.\n  Mr. President, it is time for these few Senators to set aside narrow \nregional and partisan interests and take up an oar and start rowing \nwith the rest of the Senate. The Senate needs to get the Ocean Shipping \nand OECD bills moving. I intend to put these bills to a Senate vote \nearly next year.\n  In the meantime, the Senate has left two vital pieces of maritime \nlegislation stranded in the middle of the ocean, for a long winter. \nD.I.W. Dead in the water. This is not good for America's maritime \nworld. This is not good for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12572-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12572-S12573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 13, 1997, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that House had passed the following bills, \neach without amendment:\n\n       S. 1378.

A bill to authorize an exchange of land between the \nSecretary of Agriculture and Secretary of the Interior and the Big Sky \nLumber Co.; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the gallatin land consolidation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I am introducing draft legislation to \ncomplete the third phase of the Gallatin Land Consolidation Act. As \nCongress winds down to the final hours of this session it has become \nincreasingly important to show Montanans that we are committed to \ncompleting this act.\n  In Montana there are many folks who have small problems with the \ndetails of the proposed agreement between Big Sky Lumber and the U.S. \nForest Service. Also at stake are the exceptional natural resources of \nthe Taylors Fork lands. These lands are privately owned and face an \nuncertain future. By showing the private landowners that Congress is, \nin fact, committed to completing this exchange, the environmental value \nof Taylors Fork will be preserved.\n  Taylors Fork is a migration corridor for wildlife which leave \nYellowstone National Park for winter range in Montana. With legislation \nI am committed to preserving Taylors Fork as close to a natural state \nas possible.\n  I am confident that by working together, the Montana congressional \ndelegation will be able to resolve the outstanding land use issues in \nthe Bridger-Bangtail area. I also believe we can resolve the concerns \nof the timber small business set-aside.\n  This bill is a placeholder. There are many details that need to be \nincluded. The deadline for ensuring the Taylors Fork lands remain \nincluded in the agreement is December 31 of this year. My intent with \nthis bill is to satisfy the deadline to preserve our option on Taylors \nFork and to provide a forum for Montanans to begin to comment on the \ndetails of the package. I look forward to moving ahead with Senator \nBaucus and Congressman Hill and completing the original act of 1993 in \nthe next session of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1529. A bill to enhance Federal enforcement of hate crimes, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the hate crimes prevention act of 1998\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Specter \nand Senator Wyden in introducing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of \n1998. Last Monday, President Clinton convened a historic White House \nConference on Hate Crimes. This conference brought together community \nleaders, law enforcement officials, religious and academic leaders, \nparents, and victims for a national dialogue on how to reduce hate \nviolence in our society.\n  I commend President Clinton for his leadership on this important \nissue. Few crimes tear at the fabric of society more than hate crimes. \nThey injure the immediate victims, but they also injure the entire \ncommunity--and sometimes the entire nation. So it is entirely \nappropriate to use the full power of the federal government to punish \nthem.\n  This bill is the product of careful consultation with the Department \nof Justice, constitutional scholars, law enforcement officials, and \nmany organizations with a long and distinguished history of involvement \nin combating hate crimes, including the Anti-Defamation League, the \nNational Organization of Women Legal Defense Fund, the Human Rights \nCampaign, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and the \nAmerican Psychological Association. President Clinton strongly supports \nthe bill, and we look forward to working closely with the \nadministration to ensure its passage.\n  Hate crimes are on the rise throughout America. The Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation documented 8,000 hate crimes in 1995, a 33-percent \nincrease over 1994. The 8,000 documented hate crimes actually \nunderstate the true number of hate crimes, because reporting is \nvoluntary and not all law enforcement agencies report such crimes.\n  The National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium recently \nreleased its 1997 Audit of anti-Asian violence. Their report documented \na 17-percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans. The \nNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force documented a 6-percent increase in \nhate violence against gay, lesbian, and bisexual citizens in 1996. \nEighty-two percent of hate crimes based on religion in 1995 were anti-\nSemitic.\n  Gender motivated violence occurs at alarming rates. The Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights recently issued a report on hate crimes \nwhich correctly noted that ``society is beginning to realize that many \nassaults against women are not `random' acts of violence but are \nactually bias-related crimes.''\n  The rising incidence of hate crimes is simply intolerable. Yet, our \ncurrent Federal laws are inadequate to deal with this violent bigotry. \nThe Justice Department is forced to fight the battle against hate \ncrimes with one hand tied behind its back.\n  There are two principal gaps in existing law that prevent federal \nprosecutors from adequately responding to hate crimes. First, the \nprincipal federal hate crimes law, 18 United States Code 245, contains \nanachronistic and onerous jurisdictional requirements that frequently \nmake it impossible for\n\n[[Page S12577]]\n\nfederal officials to prosecute flagrant acts of racial or religious \nviolence. Second, federal hate crimes law do not cover gay bashing, \ngender-motivated violence, or hate crimes against the disabled.\n  Our bill closes these gaps in existing law, and gives prosecutors the \ntools they need to fight bigots who seek to divide the nation through \nviolence. Our bill expands the federal government's ability to punish \nracial violence by removing the unnecessary jurisdictional requirements \nfrom existing law. In addition, the bill gives federal prosecutors new \nauthority to prosecute violence against women, against the disabled, \nand against gays and lesbians.\n  The bill also provides additional resources to hire the necessary law \nenforcement personnel to assist in the investigation and prosecution of \nhate crimes. The bill also provides additional resources for programs \nspecifically targeted at preventing hate crimes.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the growing problem of adults who recruit \njuveniles to committee hate crimes. In Montgomery County, Tennessee, a \nwhite supremacist founded a hate group known as the ``Aryan Faction,'' \nand recruited new members by going into local high schools. The group \nthen embarded on a violent spree of firebombings and arsons before \nbeing apprehended. Hate crimes disproportionately involve juveniles, \nand the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to study this problem \nand determine appropriate additional sentencing enhancements for adults \nwho recruit juveniles to commit hate crimes.\n  The structure of this bill is modeled after the Church Arson \nPrevention Act, the bipartisan bill enacted by the Senate unanimously \nlast year in response to the epidemic of church arson crimes. Combating \nhate crimes has always been a bipartisan issue in the Senate. The Hate \nCrimes Statistics Act has overwhelming bipartisan support, and it was \nextended last year by a unanimous vote. The Hate Crimes Sentencing \nEnhancement Act was enacted in 1994 by a 92-4 vote in the Senate.\n  The bill we are introducing today is the next step in our bipartisan \neffort to combat hate violence. This bill is an essential part of the \nbattle against bigotry, and I urge the Senate to give high priority \nwhen Congress returns to session in January.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Kennedy and Specter, in introducing a bill that will make it \nclear that this country will no more tolerate violence directed at \ngays, women, or people with disabilities. This legislation will end the \nbizarre double standard which says that hate crimes motivated by one \nsort of prejudice are a Federal crime, while those motivated by other \nbiases are not. It will assure that every American who becomes a victim \nof a hate crime has equal standing under Federal law, because hatred \nand violence are always wrong.\n  This bipartisan bill is based on a common conviction that this \ncountry still has work to do in rooting out hatred, prejudice and the \nviolence they generate. Hate crimes--the threat or use of force to \ninjure, intimidate or interfere with another person solely because of \nthe person's race, color, religion or national origin--cannot be \ntolerated in our society. That point has already been enshrined in law \nand passage of the Hate Crimes Statistics Reporting Act in 1990, \nfollowed by the Hate Crimes Penalty Enhancement Act in 1993 and the \n1996 resolution condemning church burnings.\n  Our bill simply seeks to offer the same protection to victims of gay \nbashing, woman beating and crimes against people with disabilities that \nhas already been offered to victims of bias crimes based on racial and \nethnic discrimination.\n  Today, the perpetrator who hurls a brick at someone because he is \nAsian-American can be prosecuted under Federal law. The one who attacks \ngay men to ``teach them a lesson'' cannot. The perpetrator who burns a \nblack church or defaces a synagogue can be prosecuted under Federal \nlaw. The one who targets people in wheelchairs or blind people cannot. \nThis legislation would erase that double standard from the books. Hate \ncrimes are all the same, and they are never acceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in moving forward with this important \nlegislation when we return here next year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1530. A bill to resolve ongoing tobacco litigation, to reform the \ncivil justice system responsible for adjudicating tort claims against \ncompanies that manufacture tobacco products, and establish a national \ntobacco policy for the United States that will decrease youth tobacco \nuse and reduce the marketing of tobacco products to young Americans; \nread the first time.\n\n\nTHE PLACING RESTRAINTS ON TOBACCO'S ENDANGERMENT OF CHILDREN AND TEENS \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, perhaps the most important legacy this \nCongress can leave for future generations is implementation of a strong \nplan to curb tobacco use, and especially its use by children and teens.\n  Quite simply, something needs to be done to get tobacco out of the \nhands of children--or perhaps more accurately, out of the lungs and \nmouths of children.\n\n\n                         TEENS AND TOBACCO USE\n\n  The numbers of children who smoke cigarettes and use other tobacco \nproducts such as snuff and chewing tobacco are truly alarming. And \nthese numbers are on the rise.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most \nyouths who take up tobacco products begin between the ages of 13 and \n15. It is astounding that up to 70% of children have tried smoking by \nage 16.\n  Again according to the CDC, nearly 6,000 kids a day try their first \ncigarette, and 3,000 of them will continue to smoke. One-thousand of \nthem will die from smoking.\n  At the Judiciary Committee's October 29 hearing, Dr. Frank Chaloupa, \na renowned researcher who has spent the last decade studying the effect \nof prices and policies on tobacco use, told us that ``there is an \nalarming upward trend in youth cigarette smoking over the past several \nyears. Between 1993 and 1996, for example, the number of high school \nseniors who smoke grew by 14%, the number of 10th grade smokers rose by \n23%, and the number of eighth grade smokers increased 26%.''\n  During the time between the issuance of the first Surgeon General's \nreport in 1964 and 1990, the number of kids smoking was on the decline. \nUnfortunately, at that time, the number of children who try tobacco \nproducts started to rise.\n  Nearly all first use of tobacco occurs before high school graduation, \nwhich suggests to me that if that first use can be prevented, perhaps \nwe can wean future generations off these harmful tobacco products.\n  We also know that adolescents with lower levels of school \nachievement, those with friends who use tobacco, and children with \nlower self-images are more likely to use tobacco. Experts have found no \nproven correlation between socio-economic status and smoking.\n  An element that is compelling to me as Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is the fact that tobacco use is associated with alcohol and \nillicit drug use and is generally the first substance used by young \npeople who enter a sequence of drug use.\n  Public health experts have found a number of factors associated with \nyouth smoking. Among them are: the availability of cigarettes; the \nwidespread perception that tobacco use is the norm; peer and sibling \nattitudes; and lack of parental support.\n  Unfortunately, what many young people fail to appreciate is that \ncigarette smoking at an early age causes significant health problems \nduring childhood and adolescence, and increased risk factors for adult \nhealth problems as well.\n  Smoking reduces the rate of lung growth and maximum lung functioning. \nYoung smokers are less likely to be fit. In fact, the more and the \nlonger they smoke, the less healthy they are. Adolescent smokers are \nmore likely to have overall diminished health, not to mention shortness \nof breath, coughing and wheezing.\n\n\n                     The Health Effects of Smoking\n\n  We all know that tobacco is unhealthy. Just how unhealthy is hard to \nimagine.\n  According to a 1988 Surgeon General's report, the nicotine in tobacco \nis as addictive as heroin or cocaine.\n  Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of premature death and disease \nin the United States.\n\n[[Page S12578]]\n\n  Each year, smoking kills more Americans than alcohol, heroin, crack, \nautomobile and airplane accidents, homicides, suicides, and AIDS--\ncombined. Cigarettes also have a huge impact on fire fatalities in the \nUnited States. In 1992, cigarettes were responsible for almost 23% of \nall residential fires, resulting in over 1,000 deaths and over 3,200 \ninjuries.\n  And, Mr. President, too many Americans smoke.\n  According to the CDC, one-quarter of the adult population--almost 50 \nmillion persons--regularly smoke cigarettes.\n  In my home state of Utah, there are 30,000 youth smokers, grades 7-\n12, and 163,000 adult smokers. The Utah Department of Health has found \nthat over 90% of current adult Utah smokers began smoking before age \n18; 60% started before age 16. And I would note that it is note legal \nto smoke in Utah until age 19.\n  And, so, it has been established that tobacco products are harmful, \nthat children continue to use them despite that fact, and that \ncigarettes can provide the gateway through which our youth pass to even \nmore harmful behaviors such as illicit drugs.\n\n\n                          Curbing Tobacco Use\n\n  How can we reverse these trends? Many in the Congress have heeded the \npublic health community's advice that increases in the price of tobacco \nproducts are the most important way that youth tobacco use can be \ncurbed.\n  According to testimony that Dr. Chaloupa presented to us, for each \n10% increase in price, there is corresponding overall reduction in \nyouth cigarette consumption of about 13%. For adult smoking, Dr. \nChaloupa has found, a 10% price increase only corresponds to a 4% \ndecrease in smoking.\n  As Dr. Chaloupa relates, there are several factors which cause \nteenagers to be more responsive to cigarette prices, including: their \nlack of disposable income; the effect of peer pressure; the tendency of \nyouth to deny the future; and the addictive nature of tobacco products.\n  The important thing about a price increase is not that it keep \nsmokers from buying cigarettes, it is that it can help keep people from \nstarting to smoke. If we can keep a teen from smoking, we may very well \nbe keeping an adult from smoking. The important thing to keep in mind \nis that There is an exponential increase in risk based on when you \nstart smoking. The earlier you start, the worse it is for your health.\n  Kids who smoke start out smoking less and then build up. After a few \nyears, they are pack a day smokers. The national average for smokers is \n19 cigarettes a day, one fewer than a pack.\n  Much has been debated about the effect of advertising on teen \nsmoking. The plain fact is that kids prefer to smoke the most \nadvertised brands. One study indicates that 85% of kids smoke the top \nthree advertised brands, whereas only about a third of adults smoke \nthose brands.\n  We also know that children are three times more affected by \nadvertising expenditures than adults (in terms of brand preference). \nResearch is unclear on the effect of advertising in terms of getting \nkids to start smoking. Movies, TV and peer pressure seem to be key \nfactors, but kids deny that.\n  These facts lead me to conclude that it is in the national interest \nfor us to undertake a campaign which will discourage the advertising of \ntobacco products to children and youth. In so doing, however, we must \nbe mindful of the Constitution's First Amendment freedom of speech \nprotections.\n  In fact, we also need to take advantage of the power that media hold \nover youth, and undertake counter-advertising on tobacco products. \nPublic health experts advise me that there is good evidence that \ncounter-advertising has a measurable and positive effect on teen \nsmoking. However, the U.S. has never had a national counter-advertising \ncampaign.\n  Restrictions on youth access are also an important part of the no-\nteen-smoking equation. While there is not a solid body of knowledge on \nthis issue, it is important to note that Florida has an aggressive \npolicy on enforcement of laws against youth smoking, and they now have \na success rate of 10% for youths who try to buy tobacco products \nillegally vs. a 50% national average.\n  An equally important factor is the influence of the family in \ndeveloping an atmosphere in which kids don't want to smoke. That is \nsomething we will never be able to legislate, any more than we can \nlegislate against teen pregnancy. However, we can help families develop \nthe skills and have the information they need to create as favorable a \nno-tobacco climate as possible in the home.\n\n  For example, we know that the more directed information kids receive, \nthe less likely they are to smoke. We also know that kids are very \nattuned to hypocritical messages. For example, if a school has a no-\nsmoking policy, but the teachers smoke, that can have a very \ndetrimental effect.\n\n\n                  Work by the State Attorneys General\n\n  Against that backdrop, a very courageous cadre of State Attorneys \nGeneral began filing suits against the tobacco industry. Most of these \nsuits, but not all, were based on the fact that the States' Medicaid \ncosts were rising dramatically because of the costs of treating \nunhealthy smokers.\n  Subsequent to those suits, negotiations began with the tobacco \nindustry, the AGs, a representative from the public health community, \nand the litigants from a large class-action tobacco suit, the Castano \nsuit.\n  As some of my colleagues may be aware, Mrs. Castano is the lead \nplaintiff in the first class action lawsuit filed against the tobacco \ncompany in March 1994. She has testified before our Committee in favor \nof the proposed settlement and has presented a very compelling story.\n  Quite simply, Mrs. Castano related to us that her goal is to raise \nthe public awareness about the power of nicotine. She told the \nCommittee she believes that if the proposed agreement's health \nprovisions were enacted, it would have prevented her husband's death. \nPeter Castano began smoking at 14, attempted to quit numerous times, \nand died of lung cancer at the age of 47 after smoking 33 years.\n  Mrs. Castano's legal team organized 64 law firms with individual \npending cases and combined them into a large class eventually \nrepresenting 60% of smokers, and this large class was had a place at \nthe negotiation table.\n  Many of us watched the progress of those negotiations as we would \nwatch a cliff-hanger sports event. We wanted a victory, but we couldn't \nbelieve our team could come from behind and win.\n  On June 20, those Attorneys General, led by Mississippi General Mike \nMoore, who had brought the first suit, made a dramatic announcement \nthat a settlement had been reached. Six days later, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee held the first of the 16 congressional hearings \nthat have been held thus far, during which we heard testimony from the \ntobacco industry, the State Attorneys General, and the public health \ncommunity.\n  The settlement, which was ratified by the five major tobacco \ncompanies and which must have many of its provisions approved by \nCongress through implementing legislation, offers our Nation a once-in-\na-generation opportunity to reduce teen smoking and to undertake a \nmajor anti-tobacco, anti-addiction initiative never before thought \npossible.\n  At this point, it would be useful to give a brief summary of the \nproposal which has been submitted to the Congress.\n  As proposed by the 40 State Attorneys General on June 20, 1997, this \nglobal tobacco settlement would require participating tobacco companies \nto pay $368.5 billion (not including attorneys' fees) over a 25-year \nperiod, the major of which will go to fund a major new national anti-\ntobacco initiative. Part of the money would also be used to establish \nan industry fund that would be used to pay damage claims and treatment \nand health costs to smokers.\n  During negotiations on the June 20 proposal, parties agreed there \nwould be significant new restrictions on tobacco advertising. It would \nbe banned outright on billboards, in store promotions and displays, and \nover the Internet. Use of the human images, such as the Marlboro Man, \nand cartoon characters, such as Joe Camel, would be prohibited. The \ntobacco companies would also be banned from sponsoring sports events or \nselling or distributing clothing that bears the corporate logo or \ntrademark. The sale of cigarettes from\n\n[[Page S12579]]\n\nvending machines would be banned, and self service displays would be \nrestricted. Cigarette and other tobacco packages must carry strong \nwarning labels concerning the ill effects of cigarettes (such as, its \nuse causes cancer) that cover 25% of the packages. The tobacco \ncompanies would have to pay for the anti-tobacco advertising campaigns.\n\n  Parties to the agreement would consent to the FDA's jurisdiction over \nnicotine. The FDA would have the authority to reduce nicotine levels \nover time. The FDA, however, could not eliminate nicotine from \ncigarettes before 2009. Furthermore, as part of the settlement, tobacco \ncompanies would have to demonstrate a 30 percent decline of aggregate \ncigarette and smokeless tobacco use by minors within 5 years, a 50 \npercent reduction within 7 years, and a 60 percent reduction within 10 \nyears. If not successful, penalties may be assessed against the tobacco \ncompanies up to $2 billion a year.\n  In return, future class-action lawsuits involving tobacco company \nliability would be banned. This would settle suits brought by 40 States \nand Puerto Rico seeking to recover Medicaid funds spent treating \nsmokers. Also settled would be one State class action against industry \nand 16 others seeking certification. Current class actions, therefore, \nwould be settled, unless they are reduced to final judgment prior to \nthe enactment of legislation implementing the agreement. Claimants who \nopt out of existing class actions would be permitted to sue for \ncompensatory damages individually, but the total annual award would be \ncapped at $5 billion. These amounts would be paid from the industry \nfund. In return for a payment (to be used as part of the industry \nfund), punitive damage awards would be banned. Nevertheless, claimants \ncould seek punitive damages for conduct taking place after the \nsettlement is adopted and implementing legislation is passed.\n  That is an overview of the settlement, as explained to the Judiciary \nCommittee at our June 26 hearing.\n  Even a cursory examination of the settlement presents Congress with a \nclear question: should we seize the opportunity to undertake a serious \nnew national war on tobacco by implementing certain liability reforms \nin exchange for enhanced FDA regulation, substantial industry payments, \nand, in short, a new national commitment.\n\n\n                   Judiciary Committee consideration\n\n  Our Committee has examined this in great detail, during four \nhearings.\n  At our second hearing, in July, we heard testimony from two \nconstitutional experts, who advised the Committee on the \nconstitutionality of the settlement, including its advertising \nprovisions. That testimony was extremely valuable in both reassuring me \nthat legislation could be written which would pass constitutional \nmuster, and in guiding me on how an appropriate legislative framework \nshould be crafted.\n  But as important as the legal issues are, we must never lose sight of \nthe fact that this proposed settlement must be a public health \ndocument, a public health statement, a commitment on the part of our \ncountry.\n  At our third hearing, the Committee heard additional testimony from \npublic health experts about the proposed settlement.\n  I recall with great clarity a very vivid statement made by Dr. Lonnie \nBristow, the immediate past president of the American Medical \nAssociation and the only physician to participate in the global \nsettlement discussions, who said this settlement has the potential to \nproduce greater public health benefits than the polio vaccine.\n  In apprising the Committee about the enormous potential of the public \nhealth provisions contained in the settlement, Dr. Bristow recommended \nthat our public health agenda with respect to smoking be guided by \nthree ultimate objectives: First, significantly reducing the number of \nchildren who start smoking, second, reducing the number of existing \nsmokers who will die from their addiction; and third, making the \nindustry pay for the damage it has done.\n  Dr. Bristow also addressed the fundamental question of who will \nbenefit from the proposed settlement, relating that the American Cancer \nSociety has estimated one million children will be saved from premature \ndeath if certain key provision of the settlement are implemented. These \ninclude enforcement of proof-of-age laws, requiring point-of-purchase \nsales, mandatory licensing of retailers, dramatic restrictions on \nadvertising, and stronger warning labels.\n\n  And so, it appears to me that the elements are there for development \nof a new national tobacco policy which will make unprecedented gains in \npublic health. The question is whether this Congress has the \nwherewithal to make the tough decisions, with all the attendant \npolitical implications, in order to codify the settlement and move us \ntoward a substantial new commitment to improving public health.\n  Three years ago, on the 30th anniversary of the first Surgeon \nGeneral's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health report, I received a \nletter from seven past Surgeon Generals of the United States, \nrepresenting the Administrations spanning Eisenhower through Bush. In \nthat letter, the Surgeon Generals said:\n\n       While the scientific evidence is overwhelming and \n     indisputable, significant policy changes in how this product \n     is manufactured, sold, distributed, labeled, advertised and \n     promoted have been slow in coming. There has been little \n     federal leadership for policy changes for the last 30 years. \n     It seems inconceivable to those of us in the public health \n     community that this nation's single most preventable cause of \n     death is also its least regulated.\n\n  They continued:\n\n       As past Surgeons General of the United States we have had \n     great hopes that a day would come before the year 2000 when \n     we will achieve the goal of a smoke-free society. However, it \n     is very clear from the past 30 years that such a goal will \n     not be achieved unless there is federal leadership and a \n     commitment to change that has as its goal the health and \n     welfare of the American public.\n\n  And now the question before this body is whether we are willing to \naccelerate our efforts and rise up to the challenge offered us by the \nSurgeons General.\n  If ever there were to be such a time, it is now.\n  I believe that the June 20 proposal offers us the solid basis for \nsuch a national initiative.\n  I think it behooves the Congress to seize upon that initiative, to \nimprove it where we can without jeopardizing any of its basic \ncomponents, and to pass legislation immediately upon our return in \nJanuary.\n  That task will not be easy. Since the settlement has provisions that \nspan the jurisdiction of more than half the Senate committees, it will \nbe a monumental procedural undertaking.\n  Nevertheless, after my considerable study of this issue, I have \nconcluded it is in the national interest for us to approve the \nsettlement, and I intend to do everything I can to move us toward the \npublic health goals it offers.\n\n\n                    Introduction of the PROTECT Act\n\n  Accordingly, I am today introducing legislation I have drafted as a \ndiscussion vehicle and which I hope will engender the public debate we \nneed on all the fine points of this massive issue so that we are ready \nto move legislation upon our return.\n  I expect this bill to be a ``lightening rod,'' a draft work product \nwhich can be refined over the next 2 months.\n  The proposed global tobacco settlement is incredibly complex. \nDrafting this legislation has required 101 decisions, many of them \ninterrelated.\n  I am willing, indeed eager, to work with all interested parties to \nrefine this legislation as it moves forward. What I am not willing to \ndo, however, is further delay action on what could be the most \nimportant opportunity to advance public health in decades.\n  I have entitled the legislation I introduce today the ``PROTECT'' \nAct, or ``Placing Restraints on Tobacco's Endangerment of Children and \nTeens Act.''\n  I consider this to be a ``settlement plus'' bill. It retains and, \nindeed, strengthens the major provisions of the settlement; but, it \ndoes so in a carefully balanced way which I believe will not only pass \nconstitutional muster but also could be enacted.\n  Let me be clear about what this bill is.\n  I consider this to be a discussion draft, a vehicle for the dialogue \nwe must have about this important issue during the next 2 months when \nCongress is not in session and when we are able to consult with our \nconstituents back home.\n  At the outset, let me say that I have aimed for a consensus document, \na\n\n[[Page S12580]]\n\npiece of legislation which bridges the divide over contentious issues \nin a way that is legislatively viable.\n  Because it starts with this as a goal, I am painfully aware that this \nbill will totally please no one. Interest groups, by their very \ndefinition, advocate a particular position. Enactment of a tobacco \nsettlement bill will require us to meld many of those positions, to \ndevelop a consensus around the center.\n  As a consensus document put out for discussion purposes, it is my \nintention that the PROTECT Act would be a useful departure point for \nfuture, productive discussions.\n  I am also cognizant of the anti-tobacco groups' interest in seeing a \npiece of legislation that does its utmost to discourage tobacco use.\n  I would like to do that as well.\n  That is my primary goal.\n  I say that not only as a Senator who represents a State which has the \nlowest smoking rates in the country, not only as a member of a Church \nwhich condemns the use of tobacco, but also as a Senator who has \ndevoted the majority of his career to the public health.\n  Yet, many anti-tobacco groups may be disappointed because this bill \nis not as stringent as they would like. But I urge those who might \nbelieve this to keep an open mind. I think they will find that, in many \ncases, my bill is more stringent than the AG's proposal.\n  I would also urge them to keep in mind our primary goal of helping \nfuture generations of children. The only way to do that is to approve \nlegislation, which necessitates legislation which is approvable. That \nis my goal--to get a good bill enacted. A bill that is ``perfect'' from \nthe point of view of one side or the other cannot be enacted; it must \nbe a consensus.\n  For that reason, the bill must also contain the legal reform \nprovisions put forward by the attorneys' general. Those liability \nprovisions were agreed to not only the industry, but also by the \nrepresentatives of 40 states, by the public health community, and some \nmembers of the plaintiff's bar.\n  We should not fool ourselves into believing that such a massive anti-\ntobacco policy as is embodied in either the AG's proposal or the \nPROTECT Act can be enacted absent the liability provisions agreed to in \nJune.\n  Yes, we should keep the pressure on for as anti-tobacco bill as we \ncan. But if we are to enact this bill next year, which is my goal, we \nmust be realistic. There are very few legislative days left, believe it \nor not.\n\n\n                   General Description of PROTECT Act\n\n  Accordingly, I have drafted my bill as a global tobacco settlement, \nwhich mirrors in many ways the key components of the proposal put \nbefore us on June 20.\n  Unlike other bills introduced thus far this session, it is a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  It contains all of the elements of the June 20 document, embodying \nthe critical balance among the punitive, the preventive, and the \nrealistic. It combines strong penalties on the tobacco industry with \nstrict regulation of tobacco products by the FDA, implementation of a \nmajor national anti-tobacco, anti-addiction campaign, and defined \nliability protections for the tobacco industry.\n  The PROTECT Act requires substantial industry payments to fund state \nand federal public health activities, contains restrictions on tobacco \nadvertising aimed at youth, and provides continuing oversight of the \nindustry through a strong ``look-back'' provision.\n  In addition, the PROTECT Act improves on the state attorneys general \nJune 20 settlement, in a number of key areas:\n  First, industry payments over 25 years will total $398.3 billion. Of \nthose payments, $95 billion will represent the punitive damages for \nthe tobacco industry's past reprehensible conduct. These funds will be \ndevoted toward a National Institutes of Health Trust Fund for \nbiomedical research, similar to the legislation drafted by our \ncolleagues Senator Connie Mack and Senator Tom Harkin.\n\n  Second, I have inserted a strong provision to preclude youth access \nto tobacco products, sponsored by our colleague Senator Gordon Smith. \nSince the States have a substantial role in enforcing the laws \nprecluding youth smoking, I have also made State receipt of the public \nhealth funds contained in this bill contingent upon enforcement of \nthose youth anti-tobacco provisions.\n  Third, to address a concern expressed by members on both sides of the \naisle, as well as the President, this bill provides transitional \nassistance to farmers modeled after the legislation introduced by \nAgriculture Committee Chairman Dick Lugar, combined with educational \nassistance for retraining taken from the ``LEAF'' Act, drafted by \nSenators McConnell, Ford, Faircloth, and Helms. There is much to \ncommend both of these bills, and I look forward to working with \nproponents of each to refine further these provisions as the \nlegislation moves forward.\n  Fourth, a National Institutes of Health [NIH] Trust Fund is \nestablished with funds paid by tobacco companies for the settlement of \npunitive damages for their past reprehensible marketing of tobacco. It \nwill significantly enhance research related to diseases associated with \ntobacco use, such as cancer, lung, cardiovascular and stroke--similar \nto Mack-Harkin. This fund would provide an additional $95 billion for \nbiomedical research, a goal which clearly must rank at the top of our \nnational agenda in this day of ever-emerging medical discoveries.\n  In earlier versions of this legislation, I had considered making \nthese punitive damages not tax-deductible. However, upon further \nreflection about the precedent this would set in tax law, and the fact \nthat the June 20 proposal was intended to be tax deductible, the bill I \nam introducing today does not contain that provision at this time.\n  Fifth, my legislation contains a substantial new program to enhance \nsignificantly Indian health care efforts, particularly related to \ntobacco use. This provision will be funded at $200 million per year.\n  Sixth, significant new funding is provided to States for anti-\nsmoking, anti-addiction efforts. States will receive $186 billion \ndirectly. These funds will be allocated based on the agreement of the \nState attorneys general. States will be able to use whatever portion of \nthe funds that would have been attributable to their State Medicaid \nmatch with no strings whatsoever. The portion that would be \nattributable to the Federal Medicaid match must be used for delineated \nhealth-related anti-tobacco programs. None of these funds are \nconsidered to be part of the Medicaid program, however. The Federal \nanti-tobacco program, administered by HHS, will provide an additional \n$92 billion to States, half of which will be administered through a \nblock grant program.\n  Seventh, in a departure from the AG's agreement and the FDA rule, \nwhich regulates tobacco as a restricted medical device, the bill treats \ntobacco products as their own class and as unapproved drugs. However, \nthe bill provides the FDA with substantial new authority over tobacco \nproducts, including the authority to control their composition through \nreductions or eliminations of all constituents. Unlike the AG \nagreement, though, which gives FDA the authority to ban tobacco \nproducts after 12 years, my proposal allows the Secretary to make that \nrecommendation in any year, but it cannot be implemented unless \napproved by Congress.\n  Eighth, the ``look-back'' surcharge on tobacco manufacturers has been \nsignificantly strengthened with penalties more than doubled and the cap \non payments removed. The Secretary may abate all or part of a penalty, \ntotally at her discretion.\n  Ninth, after funding is provided for a limited program on tobacco-\nrelated asbestos liability, transitional agricultural assistance, and \nthe new Indian health program, my bill divides the remaining funding in \nhalf. Fifty percent will be provided to the Federal Government for our \nnew war on tobacco addiction and tobacco use. Fifty percent will be \nprovided to the States for anti-tobacco programs.\n\n  These funds will be provided to each state by a formula agreed upon \nby the Attorneys General Allocation Subcommittee on September 16. My \nbill does not treat these payments to the states as Medicaid recoveries \nper se, and indeed, my bill waives the Medicaid subrogation law. \nHowever, for purposes of use of these State funds, the States will be \nable to retain that portion of the funds which would have\n\n[[Page S12581]]\n\nbeen attributable to their Medicaid matching rate, and use those funds \nwith absolutely no restrictions. The portion of the funds which would \nhave represented the Federal share under Medicaid, generally the larger \nshare, must be used for certain anti-tobacco public health purposes \ndelineated in the bill.\n  I want to take the opportunity today to discuss many of these areas \nin more detail.\n\n\n                 National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund\n\n  The bill establishes a Trust Fund--termed the ``National Tobacco \nSettlement Trust Fund.'' This is the apparatus that takes the inflow of \nproceeds made by the participating tobacco manufacturers and makes \npayments to the states and various federal health programs.\n  Here is how the fund works: The participating manufacturers must \ndeposit $398.3 billion in the Trust Fund. Of this amount, $303 billion \nreflects settlement for compensatory damages and $95 billion for the \nsettlement of punitive damages for bad acts of the tobacco industry \nprior to the legislative settlement of the claims.\n  These amounts are deposited into two accounts: a state account for \nuse to pay back the states for Medicaid expenditures and a federal \naccount to fund health and tobacco anti-cessation programs. A detailed \nexpenditure table is provided in the bill which earmarks where the \npayments are being made.\n  These payments represent a licensing fee, of which $10 billion is \npaid ``up front'' to the Trust Fund by the participating tobacco \nmanufacturers and the remainder will be paid in annual amounts \nstipulated in the bill. The bill thereafter sets the base amount \nlicensing fee that the participating manufacturers must pay to the \nTrust Fund for the 25 year base period.\n  The bill also provides for penalties and the possible loss of the \ncivil liability protections of the Act if the participating \nmanufacturers default on payments.\n  The U.S. Attorney General shall administer the Trust and the \nSecretaries of Treasury and Health and Human Services shall be co-\ntrustees. To ensure that each participant of the tobacco settlement has \na fair say, an advisory board is created to advise the Trustees in the \nadministration of the Trust Fund. Four members are to be appointed by \nthe House and Senate majority and minority leadership, and one member \neach representing the state attorneys general, the tobacco industry, \nthe health industry, and the Castano plaintiffs' class.\n\n\n                       National Tobacco Protocol\n\n  The bill establishes a Protocol--in essence a binding contract among \nthe federal government, the States, the participating tobacco \nmanufacturers, and the Castano private class.\n  The primary purpose of the Protocol is to effectuate the consent \ndecrees, which terminate the underlying tobacco suits. To receive the \ncivil liability protections of the bill, the participating \nmanufacturers must sign the Protocol. This works as a powerful \nincentive for the participating members of the tobacco industry to \nabide by the restrictions contained in the protocol.\n  Basically, the Protocol establishes restrictions on advertising by \nindustry and includes general and specific restrictions, format and \ncontent requirements for labeling and advertising, and sets a ban on \nnontobacco items and services, contents and games of chance, and \nsponsorship of events.\n  Because these restrictions raise serious First Amendment concerns, \nand to avoid years of litigation that would surely tie up the \nimplementation of the bill, we have placed these restrictions in the \nProtocol contract provision.\n  More specifically, here is how the Protocol works.\n  To be eligible for liability protection, each participating tobacco \nmanufacturer must sign the Protocol and thus contractually agree to the \nprovisions restricting their tobacco advertising.\n  The Protocol will also bind the manufacturer's distributors and \nretailers to agree to the restrictions by requiring that in any \ndistribution or sales contract between these parties, the restrictions \nwill become material terms. If a tobacco manufacturer, or one of his \ndistributors or retailers, violates any provision contained in the \nProtocol, liability protection for the manufacturer is no longer \nafforded. The restrictions on advertising include prohibitions on \noutdoor advertising, in the use of human and cartoon figures, on \nadvertising in the Internet, on point of sale advertising, and in \nsporting events. Advertising is also subject to brand name, types of \nmedia, and FDA restrictions\n  As I stated, the restrictions were placed in the Protocol because \ncurrent statutory restrictions on tobacco advertising contained in a \nFDA final rule, and in other proposed legislation, raise serious \nconstitutional questions.\n  It remains unclear whether such statutory restrictions violate the \nFirst Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. And this doubt \ninvites years of litigation to determine whether or not the statutory \nrestrictions are constitutional.\n  Rather than open the door to endless litigation, which could delay \nthe implementation of the restrictions for years, I have made the \nrestrictions contractual. Because the Protocol is a binding and \nenforceable contractual agreement between the interested parties, a \nchallenge to the constitutionality of the restrictions is avoided. \nThis, I believe, the wisest and most effective approach in dealing with \ntobacco advertising restrictions.\n  As a type of commercial speech, tobacco advertising is entitled to \nsome, but not full, First Amendment protection. The law provides that \ncommercial speech may be banned if it advertises an illegal product or \nservice, and unlike fully protected speech, may be banned if it is \nunfair or deceptive. Even when it advertises a legal product and is not \nunfair or deceptive, the government may regulate commercial speech more \nthan it may regulate fully protected speech. This is the case of \ntobacco advertising.\n  In May 1996, in 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, the Supreme \nCourt increased the protection that the Supreme Court in its Central \nHudson test guarantees to commercial speech by making clear that a \ntotal prohibition on the ``dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading \ncommercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair \nbargaining process'' will be subject to a stricter review than a \nregulation designed to ``protect consumers from misleading, deceptive, \nor aggressive sales practices.''\n  This case may evidence a trend on the part of the Supreme Court's \npart to increase the First Amendment protection it accords to \ncommercial speech. If this trend continues, a court is more likely to \nfind that restrictions on tobacco--a legal product--is subject to \nstricter scrutiny than the traditional antifraud type commercial free \nspeech cases, particularly when the tobacco advertising is truthful and \nnondeceptive.\n  The Protocol also contains a provision establishing an arbitration \npanel to determine the legal fees for the tobacco settlement and caps \nsuch awards to 5 percent of the amounts annually paid to the Trust \nFund, any remainder to be paid the next fiscal year. The attorney fees \nare to paid by the manufacturers and are not to be counted against the \nTrust Fund fees and deposits. Finally, the Protocol may be enforced by \nthe Attorney General, the State attorneys general, and the private \nsignatories in the applicable courts.\n\n\n                          The Consent Decrees\n\n  The primary purpose of this section is to settle existing claims \nagainst the participating tobacco manufacturers. Once signed by the \nparties (federal and state governments, the Castano class private \nlitigants, and the participating tobacco manufacturers) as \nan enforceable contract, the consent decree becomes effective on the \ndate of the bill's enactment and allows for three important things: (1) \na state receives Settlement Trust funding; (2) a manufacturer receives \nliability protection; and (3) the Castano claims are settled.\n\n  The consent decrees require the parties to agree to various \nrestrictions, including restrictions on tobacco advertising, and on \ntrade associations and lobbying, the disclosure of tobacco smoke \nconstituents and nontobacco ingredients in tobacco products, the \ndisclosure of important health documents, the dismissals of the various \nunderlying tobacco suits, requirements for warning labels and other \npackaging restrictions, and the obligation to make payments for the \nbenefit of the States, the private litigants, and the general public.\n\n[[Page S12582]]\n\n  Pursuant to the consent decrees, the parties waive their right to \nbring constitutional claims. It also provides that the provisions are \nseverable. The Attorney General must approve the consent decrees, and a \nstate may bring an action to enforce provisions contained in the \nconsent decree, if appropriate. Civil Liability Provisions\n  In exchange for payments and other concessions, of which I already \nspoke, the tobacco manufacturers will gain certain benefits from the \nbill. It is these benefits which have given the tobacco companies the \nincentive to come forward and participate in the negotiations which \nwere necessary to resolve the massive litigation surrounding tobacco \nuse. Keep in mind that these benefits only apply to those tobacco \nmanufacturers who voluntarily enter into the Protocol and consent \ndecrees. There are several aspects to this section of the bill:\n  First, all actions which are currently pending against the \nmanufacturers will be dismissed. Those actions include actions by \nstates or local governments, class actions, or actions based on \naddiction to tobacco or dependency on tobacco. The tobacco companies \nwill be immune from such class action claims in the future. I want to \nemphasize that personal injury claims will still be viable. An \nindividual will still be able to make claims directly against tobacco \ncompanies after the enactment of the bill.\n  Second, the primary benefit which the tobacco companies will receive \nunder this bill is relief from liability for punitive damages. This \nrelief only applies to punitive damages for actions which the tobacco \ncompanies took prior to this bill's enactment. If, at some future date, \nthe tobacco companies take some action or commit some wrong that would \nsubject them to punitive damages, this bill will not relieve them of \nthat future liability.\n  Third, this bill makes the participating manufacturers jointly and \nseverally liable for damages arising out of claims by individuals. Of \ncourse, manufacturers who do not voluntarily consent to the terms of \nthe protocol and consent decree will be treated separately and lawsuits \ninvolving both types of tobacco companies will be tried separately.\n  Fourth, the bill includes a cap on the amount of damages that can be \npaid out on individual claims each year. The cap is one-third of the \ntotal annual payments that are due from all the participating tobacco \nmanufacturers. The excess over the cap and the excess of any individual \nclaim over $1 million will be paid in the following year. Eighty \npercent of those payments to individuals will be credited toward \npayments due to the fund. These provisions were all drawn from the June \n20th proposal and are drafted to be identical to that agreement.\n  Finally, as an enforcement mechanism, if a tobacco company which has \nsigned the protocol and consent decree is delinquent in payment by more \nthan 12 months, the benefits granted under this bill will no longer \napply. The bill also contains enforcement mechanisms for material \nbreaches of the protocol and consent decree. I must point out that \nnonsignatories--such as tobacco companies that refuse to sign the \nprotocol and consent decrees--are not eligible to receive the civil \nliability protections in the bill.\n  With regard to a state's eligibility to receive funds under this \nbill, it is relatively simple. A state must dismiss any claims it has \npending against the participating tobacco companies and it must adopt \nprovisions in its state code which mirror the benefits granted to \nthe participating tobacco companies in this bill. On an annual basis, \nthe Attorney General will certify each state which is eligible to \nreceive funds.\n\n\n                 FDA Jurisdiction Over Tobacco Products\n\n  It is may surprise some in this body to learn that the current \nprovision in food and drug law that established the efficacy standard \nfor drugs was enacted in 1962 through Judiciary Committee leadership \nwhen Senator Kefauver was chairman.\n  As the current chairman of the committee, I has great reservation \nabout embarking down a path that appears to turn the world upside down \nand gut the normal safety and efficacy requirements as applied to \nmedical devices by creating an exception that swallows the rule.\n  Using the restricted device law--a law whose purpose is to regulate a \nclass of products that require special controls to help patients--to \nkeep an inherently dangerous product on the market troubles me. I am \nnot certain what kind of precedent this will be but I fear that it will \nbe significant and of questionable necessity and benefit.\n  As I understand it, the only product that has been regulated under \nthe restricted device provisions of the law are hearing aids. I am not \nsure why some apparently feel a compelling need to equate the treatment \nof cigarettes with hearing aids. I don't share this enthusiasm.\n  Judging by some of the public rhetoric since the June 20 announcement \nof the Attorney General's agreement, one of the most hotly contested \nareas of the proposed settlement concerns the provision addressing the \nFederal Government's authority to regulate tobacco products.\n  Since June 20 some have adopted the rallying cry of ``unfettered FDA \nauthority'' and have suggested that there are major deficiencies in the \nproposed agreement relating to the ability of FDA to regulate tobacco \nproducts.\n  I suggest that the quality and substance of this debate would improve \nif we focus on the real issues.\n  As far as I am concerned, the substantive issue is not whether FDA \nshould have authority over tobacco products; the real question is \nprecisely how much and precisely what kind of authority that FDA should \nbe delegated over these dangerous products.\n  Frankly, I am of the school that unfettered FDA authority is a bad \nidea. As a conservative, the notion of giving any Federal agency \nunfettered authority is a not a good idea.\n  Anyone who argues for the principle of unfettered FDA authority \napparently has not ever read FDA's organic statute, the Federal, Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act. This important law has its origins in the 1906 \nPure Food and Drugs Act safeguards our Nation's supply of food, drugs, \ncosmetic, medical and radiological devices. My version of this law \ncontains 254 pages of ``fetters'' on the FDA. And this does not even \ninclude the many pages of additional ``fetters'' placed on FDA in the \nPublic Health Service Act provisions relating to the regulation of \nbiologicals.\n  Frankly, I am not sure that many other executive agencies have as \nmany fetters placed upon it as FDA. And that is a good thing. FDA \nperforms such critical public health missions as approving new drugs \nand medical devices.\n  In a democratic society it is only reasonable to expect that the \nAmerican public--which has some much at stake with respect to FDA's \ndecisions--will require its elected representatives to watch closely \nwhat FDA is doing and enact legislation that will improve the \nefficiency of its operations.\n  Just this last Sunday, Congress completed its latest exercise in \nfettering the FDA when this Senate passed, and passed by a unanimous \nvoice vote I must add, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. This bill \ntakes up fully 22 pages in the Congressional Record.\n  So if anyone is under the false impression that ``unfettered FDA \nauthority'' is the norm, I would only invite them to read the statute \nand its latest modification.\n  The Congress would not, and should not, pass a bill that says \nin essence that FDA has unfettered authority over tobacco any more than \nwe would pass laws that said that FDA has plenary, unfettered power \nover drugs and devices.\n\n  As I said earlier, the real question tobacco products is not if but \nwhat precise authority we give FDA over these products.\n  I think that Attorney General Mike Moore got it right as when he told \nseveral Senate Committees that all he asked from the public health \ncommunity is to be told exactly how tobacco should be regulated.\n  There was no intent by the Attorney Generals, the Castano plaintiffs \ngroup, the public health representatives to act to undermine FDA's \nability to regulate tobacco. For that matter, we must recognize that, \neven while they were, and are, litigating the issue of FDA authority in \nthe Federal courts, the industry negotiators made unprecedented \nconcessions in terms of FDA's authority in the June 20 agreement.\n  It is possible, as many legal experts believe, that the Fourth \nCircuit Court will rule that FDA does not have the authority to \nregulate tobacco.\n\n[[Page S12583]]\n\n  One thing that I do know is that whatever happens at the court of \nappeals, the loser will likely appeal its decision.\n  This will take time, time in which more and more young children will \nstart a lifetime addiction to tobacco products that will lead to \nillness and premature death.\n  Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, I am convinced that \nthis Congress has a public duty to act, and act now.\n  Title IV of my bill describes in detail what I think is the \nappropriate way for FDA to regulate tobacco products.\n  First of all, let me start by taking my hat off to FDA and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services under the leadership of \nSecretary Shalala for its creativity of using the existing food and \ndrug laws in fashioning its final rules on youth tobacco.\n  In many ways, these regulations created the environment that made it \npossible for the negotiators to sit at the table and bring us the \nsettlement proposal that we are considering today. So I take my hat off \nto the negotiators as well.\n  As fully explained in the preamble to the final rule and accompanying \nlegal justification, one of the major reasons why FDA regulated tobacco \nproducts as restricted medical devices was because of the relative \ninflexibility of the drug laws versus the flexibility of the medical \ndevice laws.\n  We all know that this question is before the Fourth Circuit, and we \nexpect a decision very soon. But regardless of the outcome of that \ncase, many have expressed the concern that FDA has stretched the \nstatute beyond the breaking point when it uses a statutory provision \nwhose hallmark is the safety and efficacy standard in a fashion to \nreach products that are inherently unsafe and ineffective.\n  Call it what it is: A tobacco product is a tobacco product, not a \nmedical device.\n  My proposal is to create a new regulatory chapter that exclusively \naddresses tobacco products. New chapter IX contains the rules that will \napply to tobacco products.\n  If a tobacco product is not in compliance with this chapter it will \nrun afoul of the FDC statute by the two new prohibited acts that S. \n1530 creates in section 301 of the act. It will be against the law to \nintroduce into interstate commerce any tobacco product that does not \ncomply with these tough new provisions.\n  In addition, S. 1530 proposes to alter the definition of drug to \ninclude tobacco products that do not comply with new chapter IX. That \nmeans that nonconforming tobacco products will be subject to the rigid \ntreatment accorded drugs. Talk about an incentive to comply with the \nnew chapter.\n  My new proposed chapter IX includes many tough provisions including, \ntobacco product health risk management standards, good manufacturing \nstandards, tobacco product labeling, warning, and packaging standards, \nreduced risk tobacco product standards, tobacco product marketing.\n  As well, my bill creates a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory \nCommittee that will advise the Secretary and FDA on all of these new \nstandards.\n  I want to highlight that unlike the proposed settlement that my bill \nwould allow the Secretary to recommend that tobacco products be banned \nat any time. The AG agreement had a 12-year bar to any such actions.\n  But because this decision is a major public health decisions with \nconsiderable political, social economic, and even philosophical \nconsequences, I require that any such decision to ban products to be \nmade personally by the Secretary and require the concurrence of \nCongress.\n  So please examine my proposal. I want to hear the comments and \nconstructive criticism of all of my colleagues in this body and other \ninterested parties and citizens.\n  From my experience, I know that FDA legislation is always \ncontroversial and contentious. There are always a lot of devilish \ndetails.\n  I put out this proposal in the interest of moving the tobacco debate \nforward in the Senate and in public debate.\n  I challenge those who have in an interest in FDA prevailing in court \nin the current litigation to put that litigation aside as you read my \nFDA language and consider what law you would write if you were not \nconstrained by the current drug and device paradigms.\n  I salute those many public health groups and officials who have \nbrought the antitobacco use battle so far in the last few years.\n  Let us start from a clean blackboard. I believe that my approach is \npreferable than to continue to stretch a perhaps already overstretched \nstatute.\n  If any in this body believe that my proposal falls short, I hope they \nwill tell me how. If some believe it is too lenient here and too rigid \nthere, I hope they will respond with fixes, not with shouts.\n  I look forward to this aspect to the debate because of my long term \ninterest in the FDA and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Let \nus take particular care in crafting this language and do so in a way \nthat does not distract FDA from its core missions, including its \ncentral role in getting the latest in medical technology to the \nAmerican public.\n\n\n                     The Price of Tobacco Products\n\n  Another issue of keen concern to the public health community is the \nprice of tobacco products. Earlier this year, I joined with several of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to propose the Child Health \nInsurance and Lower Deficit Act, the CHILD bill. That bill, most of \nwhich has now been enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act, made \nhuge strides toward providing uninsured children with health care \nservices, and it was predicated on a 43 cents increase in the excise \ntax on cigarettes.\n  We had a bipartisan coalition under the best of circumstances, and in \nthe end, our 43 cents was whittled down to 10 cents phased up to 15 \ncents.\n  In that climate, I do not think it is reasonable for anyone to expect \nthat this Congress will enact a cigarette excise tax of $1 or $1.50.\n  I do, believe, however, that there is consensus that it would be an \nimportant public health goal for the price of cigarettes and other \ntobacco products to be raised significantly to discourage youth \nconsumption.\n  It is possible to do that without an excise tax, and that is what my \nbill does. Under my proposal, which predicates payments upon a Federal \nlicensing fee, I estimate that when fully phased in year six, cigarette \nprices will go up an additional $1.09 per pack at the manufacturer \nlevel, which will be reflected in a retail level of $1.50 or more.\n  Economists have found that markups by cigarette manufacturers are \nalways accompanied by increases down the distribution chain, including \nstate excise tax increases. Thus, for purposes of this debate, I \nthink it is critical that we discuss potential price increases in net \nterms, rather than the manufacturer markup.\n\n  There is an important reason to implement the agreement through a \nlicensing payment, as opposed to a tax. Law enforcement officials have \nnoted that the closer the price rise is to the source of the \ncigarettes, the less opportunity there is for diversion.\n  For example, if this bill were predicated on an excise tax, \nmanufacturer sales to distributors would not reflect the higher price, \nand there would be ample opportunity for diversion into the black \nmarket of the cheaper goods.\n  In sum, I believe that my proposal will bring the price of cigarettes \nto a high level and do so in a way that discourages black market \ndiversion.\n  Another issue of keen concern to the Congress are the tobacco \nfarmers, most of whom could be displaced if this legislation is \nsuccessful.\n\n\n                        Agricultural Provisions\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot forget about our country's tobacco farmers. \nEven though the tobacco farmers have the most to lose from the tobacco \nsettlement, they were completely left out of the settlement \nnegotiations.\n  Tobacco farms in this country are often small family run businesses, \nand in many cases, the entire economic foundation of a community is \ntied up in the production or processing of tobacco.\n  As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, I would probably be the \nlast person to stand up and defend the tobacco industry or our nation's \ntobacco program. I feel strongly, though, that we should not turn our \nbacks on tobacco farmers and their communities at a time when many will \nbe harmed as a consequence of the tobacco settlement.\n\n[[Page S12584]]\n\n  Senator Lugar, the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has \nintroduced a bill that would end the tobacco program while providing \npayments and other assistance to tobacco farmers over a three-year \ntransition period. His proposal follows the pattern established by the \n1996 farm bill, by getting the government out the farming business and \nby making temporary assistance available to farmers as they adjust to \nthe free market.\n  Senator Ford has introduced the LEAF Act, which provides some of the \nsame assistance contained in Senator Lugar's bill but adds additional \ngrants and assistance for tobacco farmers and workers employed in the \nprocessing of tobacco. However, Senator Ford's bill maintains the \ntobacco program largely intact.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I believe our tobacco communities have tough \nchallenges ahead of them. For that reason, I have combined what I think \nare the best parts of each of these two bills into the PROTECT Act to \nensure that we care for our nation's tobacco farmers and our tobacco \ndependent communities.\n  My bill establishes a Tobacco Transition Account, funded through the \nTrust Fund. The Transition Account will provide buyout payments to \ntobacco quota owners, who will lose their quotas, and assistance \npayments to farmers who lease their quotas from these owners. In \naddition, the PROTECT Act creates Farmer Opportunity Grants. These will \nbe available to eligible family members of tobacco farmers to help pay \nfor higher education. Eligibility requirements for Farmer Opportunity \nGrants will be similar to those of the Pell Grant program.\n  Mr. President, we should also remember the workers in the tobacco \nprocessing industry who could be displaced as a result of the tobacco \nsettlement. The PROTECT Act sets up the Tobacco Worker Transition \nprogram. Patterned after the NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance program, \nthe Tobacco Worker Transition program will provide assistance to \ndisplaced workers and help them receive job retraining.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the PROTECT Act will provide a total of $300 \nmillion over three years in block grants to affected states for \neconomic assistance. Governors will be able to use these grants to help \nrural areas and tobacco dependent communities make the transition to \nbroader based economies and to the free market.\n\n\n                   Native American Health Provisions\n\n  Let me next turn toward another component of my legislation which \nrelates to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  Tobacco use and abuse are significant health issues in Indian \ncountry. Native Americans smoke more than any other ethnic group--more \nthan twofold for Indian men and more than fourfold for Indian women \nover non-Indians. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that 40 \npercent of all adult American Indians and Alaska Natives smoke an \naverage of 25 or more cigarettes daily.\n  Moreover, according to the Indian Health Service [IHS] lung cancer \nremains the leading cause of cancer mortality. The IHS further reports \nthat in some parts of the country 80 percent of Indian high school \nstudents smoke or chew tobacco. The statistics further show that \nsmoking by American Indians is actually increasing while it is on the \ndecline among other groups.\n  Clearly, in the context of this global tobacco settlement, measures \nmust be taken to address the unique problems Indian country faces with \nthe use and regulation of tobacco products.\n  Accordingly, my bill contains several Indian specific provisions that \nensure tribal governments will have the regulatory authority to address \nissues of particular concern to tribal health officials while \nmaintaining the interest of the tribe in its sovereign authority over \nactivities occurring on its reservation.\n  These provisions have been developed, in part, on recommendations \nmade at an October 6, 1997, oversight hearing on the tobacco settlement \nby the Committee on Indian Affairs on which I serve.\n  Let me also add that I welcome additional input from Indian country \non these important provisions. Overall, my provisions are designed to \nrecognize the unique interests of Indian country in the implementation \nof the act as well as provide assistance to improve the health status \nof native Americans.\n  Specifically, my bill makes clear that the provisions of the act \nrelating to the manufacture, distribution and sale of tobacco products \nwill apply on Indian lands as defined in section 1151 of title 18 of \nthe U.S. Code.\n  The fundamental precept of the Indian provisions is that tribal \ngovernments will be treated as States in the implementation of the \nprovisions of the act.\n  The Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Secretary of the \nInterior, will be required to develop regulations to permit tribes to \nimplement the licensing requirements of the act in the same manner by \nwhich the States are accorded this authority.\n  Indian tribes will also be considered as a State for purposes of \nreceiving public health payments in order to carry out the provisions \nof the act and in accordance with a plan submitted and approved by the \nSecretary.\n  Indian tribes are permitted flexibility to utilize these funds to \nmeet the unique health needs of their members as long as their programs \nmeet the fundamental health requirements of the act.\n  The amount of public health payment funds for tribes will be \ndetermined by the Secretary based on the proportion of the total number \nof Indians residing on a reservation in a State as compared to the \ntotal population of the State. Moreover, a State may not impose \nobligations or requirements relating to the application of this act to \nIndian tribes.\n  Tobacco use remains a significant health factor for Indians and the \ncosts associated for patient care and treatment are extremely high and \nresult in a disproportionate allocation of limited IHS dollars for \ntobacco related illnesses.\n  Accordingly, my bill establishes a supplemental fund for the IHS to \naugment its program mission of providing health care services to \nIndians. A $5 billion account is established to be allotted to the IHS \nin increments of $200 million annually for 25 years.\n\n\n                          Antitrust Provision\n\n  Let me also discuss another issue briefly. The proposed settlement is \npredicated upon the tobacco companies receiving immunity from antitrust \nlaws in a number of limited areas. For example, in order to determine \nthe price increase that will be passed on to consumers due to the \nsettlement licensing fee. Another area in which such antitrust \nclarification will be needed is in enforcement of the protocol which \naccompanies the settlement legislation.\n\n  In introducing the bill today, I want to acknowledge that this \nlanguage may need to be refined and tightened up. I do not intend to \ngive the tobacco companies blanket antitrust immunity. That would be \ntotally unwarranted.\n  I intend to work closely with Senators Mike DeWine and Herb Kohl, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, \nto further polish this language. They have indicated their willingness \nto work with me on this issue, and I appreciate their expertise and \nassistance.\n\n\n                                Asbestos\n\n  There exists medical evidence that tobacco use is a contributory \nfactor in asbestos-related diseases and injuries. This bill contains a \nprogram to provide limited compensation for individuals who are exposed \nto asbestos and whose condition proven to have been exacerbated by \ntobacco use. The asbestos program is administered by the Secretary of \nLabor, who will establish standards whereby it can be demonstrated that \ntobacco is a significant factor in the cause of asbestos-related \ndiseases. This program would be funded at $200 million per year and \nwould complement the existing system for payments related to asbestos.\n\n\n                                Closing\n\n  As I close, I would like to make one final observation. Three \nthousand kids a day start smoking; countless others start using \nsmokeless tobacco products like snuff.\n  These children are becoming addicted to powerful tobacco products \nwhich can only harm them. The scientific evidence is clear.\n  I am extremely cognizant of the fact that there is a long history of \nlegal use of tobacco products in this country.\n  Millions have used them; millions do use them.\n\n[[Page S12585]]\n\n  I am trying to strike a delicate balance here: That of allowing \nadults to continue to use these products as they choose, but of \ndiscouraging it whenever we can and helping those who are addicted wean \nthemselves from these powerful tobacco products.\n  But most importantly, we have to renew our efforts aimed at teen \ntobacco use. The funds provided in the global tobacco settlement will \nallow us to set that course.\n  Let me say right now that I fully anticipate criticism of my proposal \nfrom those who are afraid it is too large, and perhaps too \nbureaucratic.\n  To them I would say that the value of this proposal is in its size. \nWe need to show that we are serious about stopping kids from smoking. \nWe need to penalize the tobacco industry as part of that effort.\n  I have tried to rely upon the existing administrative structure \nwherever possible in the implementation of my plan. If others have a \nbetter way to run the program, I welcome their advice.\n  But to those who would advocate a smaller program, let me share my \nserious concerns about lowering the amount the tobacco industry has \nalready agreed to pay.\n  I would also have serious concerns about raising the amount and using \nthe funds for unrelated purposes. This is not the pot of money under \nthe rainbow which will allow us to fund 60's-era left-leaning \ninitiatives. This is a tobacco settlement which will provide us with \nsignificant new funding for new war on tobacco. A war to save our \nchildren.\n  My bill differs markedly from the others that have been introduced in \nthat it is comprehensive, it includes all the components of the \nsettlement in one piece of legislation, and it makes all the hard \nchoices necessary to delineate how a settlement will operate. Further, \nit is drafted to be constitutional.\n  Many have begun to criticize my bill before they have even read it. \nIt happened with the CHILD bill. It will happen again.\n  But to those who wish to sling barbs at my bill, I urge you to study \nit carefully. It is not the Kennedy bill. And, by the way, it was never \nintended to be. It is not the Lautenberg bill, nor the McCain bill.\n\n  It is a discussion draft intended to embrace, and improve, the \nproposed global tobacco settlement recommended to the Congress by 40 \nstates this June. I welcome any suggestions for improvements which may \nbe offered to my bill. That is why I am putting it forward today as a \ndiscussion vehicle.\n  I hope that the majority of Congress will agree with me that this \nshould become a national priority, and begin to move legislation \nimmediately upon our return in January.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank all of my colleagues who \nprovide advice and assistance in drafting this legislation. It is clear \nthat we must have a collaborative process if this legislation is to \nmove forward, and I look forward to being a part of that process in the \nmonths to come. We can leave no greater legacy to our children.\n  I want to say a special thanks to Bill Baird in the Office of \nLegislative Counsel. He worked day and night to get this bill drafted \nfor us, and I want to say publicly how much I appreciate this extra \neffort.\n  Anyone who wishes to read the entire text of the bill will soon be \nable to access it on the Hatch web page which can be reached at: \n``www.senate.gov/ hatch/''. It will take us a day or two, but it will \nbe available to the public. Since it is 308 pages, I think this is the \nmost efficient way to make it available to the public. And, as I just \nsaid, I welcome suggestions.\n  Finally, for those who just want the digest version, I ask unanimous \nconsent to insert a section-by-section summary of the PROTECT Act in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the section-by-section analysis was ordered \nto be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. Entitles the \n     bill ``Placing Restraints on Tobacco's Endangerment of \n     Children and Teens'' Act ``PROTECT'') and lists a table of \n     contents.\n       Section 2. FINDINGS. Makes a series of congressional \n     findings with respect to tobacco, its harmful health effects \n     on children and adults, and the role of government in \n     regulating tobacco products.\n       Section 3. GOALS AND PURPOSES. Sets forth the goals and \n     purposes of the legislation, including decreasing tobacco use \n     by youth and adults, enhancing biomedical research efforts, \n     setting forth Federal standards for smoking in public \n     establishments, establishing the authority of the Food and \n     Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products, providing \n     transitional assistance to farmers, and reforming tobacco \n     litigation practices.\n       Section 4. NATIONAL GOALS FOR THE REDUCTION IN UNDERAGE \n     TOBACCO USE. Sets out national goals for reduction in youth \n     tobacco use. For cigarettes, the national goals, measured \n     from the baseline year, will be a 30% reduction in use in \n     2003 and 2004; a 50% decrease in 2005, 2006 and 2007; and a \n     60% reduction thereafter. For smokeless tobacco, the national \n     goals, measured from the baseline year, will be a 25% \n     reduction in use in 2003 and 2004; a 35% reduction in 2005, \n     2006, and 2007; and a 45% reduction thereafter.\n       Section 5. DEFINITIONS. Defines pertinent terms used in the \n     bill.\n\n\n            TITLE I--NATIONAL TOBACCO SETTLEMENT TRUST FUND\n\n       Section 101. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST FUND. Creates a \n     National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund that will receive \n     payments from tobacco manufacturers according to a schedule \n     set out in the bill. Over the next 25 years, deposits will be \n     $398 billion, of which $95 billion are considered punitive \n     damages and will be used to fund a biomedical research trust \n     fund.\n       The National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund will be \n     administered by the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services, and the Secretary of Treasury, and will \n     be advised by a board composed of the Trustees and \n     representatives of State attorneys general, public health \n     experts, the Castano plaintiffs, and the tobacco industry. \n     The initial $10 billion down payment from the tobacco \n     industry, the continued annual payments, and any look-back or \n     surcharge payments or penalties will be deposited into the \n     Settlement Trust Fund.\n       The Settlement Trust Fund consists of a State Account and a \n     Federal Account. Generally, as specified in section 101(c), \n     the funds are distributed as follows: First, a portion of the \n     total funds are set aside in the Federal Account for a \n     transitional agriculture assistance program, a limited fund \n     for asbestos-related litigation (where it can be proven that \n     tobacco use was a cause of injury), and a new program to \n     enhance Native American health. The remaining funds are \n     divided equally with one-half provided to the States and one-\n     half to the Federal government. In addition to the set aside \n     funds for tobacco farmers, tobacco/asbestos plaintiffs, and \n     Native American activities, the remaining funds from the \n     Federal Account will be essentially divided equally between \n     tobacco-related biomedical research and public health \n     activities as provided in sections 521 and 522, respectively.\n       Funds from the State Account may be used by the states for \n     both general purposes and for tobacco related programs as \n     specified in sections 501 and 502, respectively. The Trustees \n     are precluded from making an expenditure for programs which \n     are currently being funded at either the Federal or State \n     levels, so that the funds provided in this Act are \n     supplemental to any on-going activities and not a \n     substitution.\n       Section 102. PAYMENT SCHEDULE. As a condition of receiving \n     the liability provisions contained in Title II, participating \n     manufacturers must execute a protocol with the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, each respective state attorney \n     general, and Castano litigants, sign consent decrees with \n     States and Castano plaintiffs, and deposit an initial $10 \n     billion payment into the Trust Fund. In addition, to be \n     eligible for the liability protections, manufacturers must \n     make payments according to a schedule listed in the bill. The \n     Trustees are authorized to adjust those continuing payments \n     in two cases: 1) an annual inflation adjustment; 2) a volume \n     adjustment which could either increase or reduce the base \n     payments. The amount that each participating manufacturer \n     will pay will be determined under the protocol appended to \n     the agreement.\n       Section 103. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Attorney \n     General will hold the Trust Fund and will report annually to \n     the relevant congressional committees on the financial \n     condition of the Trust Fund. The Trustees will invest excess \n     balances of the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the \n     U.S. and proceeds therefrom will become a part of the \n     account. Members of the Trustees' advisory board shall serve \n     without compensation, although travel expenses will be \n     reimbursed, and overall costs of the advisory board are \n     capped. Receipts and disbursements from the Trust Fund \n     will not be included in the annual budget, and cannot be \n     transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.\n       Section 104. ENFORCEMENT. Any participating manufacturer \n     which fails to make payments required by the Act will be \n     subject to daily fines. If the manufacturer has not made the \n     required payment within one year, the manufacturer will be \n     considered non-participating, will lose the liability \n     protections contained in the Act, and will be ineligible from \n     becoming a participating manufacturer in the future.\n\n[[Page S12586]]\n\n          TITLE II--NATIONAL PROTOCOL AND LIABILITY PROVISIONS\n\n           Subchapter A--Protocol Restrictions on Advertising\n\n       Section 201. REQUIREMENT. To be eligible for the liability \n     protections contained in Subtitle C, each tobacco \n     manufacturer shall enter into a binding and enforceable \n     contract (``the Protocol'') in each state, with the Attorney \n     General on behalf of the Chief Executive Officer of the state \n     and representatives of the Castano litigants. As part of the \n     protocol, a participating manufacturer shall agree, in any \n     contract entered into with a distributor and retailer, to \n     require the distributor and retailer to comply with the \n     applicable terms of the protocol.\n       Section 211. APPLICATION OF SUBCHAPTER. The following \n     provisions will be considered part of the Protocol.\n       Section 212. AGREEMENT TO PROHIBIT ADVERTISING. Parties to \n     the executed Protocol agree that they will not use any form \n     of outdoor product advertising, nor will they advertise in \n     any arena or stadium where athletic, musical, artistic or \n     other social or cultural events or activities occur. Parties \n     also agree not to use human images or cartoon characters in \n     tobacco-related advertising, labeling or promotional \n     materials, and not to advertise tobacco products on the \n     Internet. Parties also agree to limit point of sale \n     advertising of tobacco products both in terms of number of \n     advertisements and format, except in adult-only stores and \n     tobacco outlets.\n       Section 213. GENERAL RESTRICTIONS. Parties agreeing to the \n     Protocol will not use a trade or brand name of a non-tobacco \n     product as the trade or brand name for a cigarette or \n     smokeless tobacco product, except for products sold in the \n     United States before January 1, 1995. Parties further agree \n     to limit the media in which tobacco products will be \n     advertised and will not make payments for placement of \n     tobacco products in television programs, motion pictures, \n     videos or video game machines.\n       Section 214. AGREEMENT ON FORMAT AND CONTENT REQUIREMENTS \n     FOR LABELING AND ADVERTISING. Those signing the Protocol \n     agree to limit tobacco-related advertising to black text on \n     white background, except in certain cases such as vending \n     areas not visible from the outside and adult publications. \n     Further, parties using audio or video formats agree to \n     certain limits, such as restrictions on music or sound.\n       Section 215.

Parties to the Protocol agree to ban all non-tobacco \n     merchandise bearing the brand name, logo or other identifier \n     of tobacco products. They also agree not to offer any gift or \n     item in connection with the purchase of a tobacco product. \n     Parties agree not to sponsor any athletic, musical, artistic \n     or other social/cultural event in which identifiers of \n     tobacco products are used, although the use of a corporate \n     number in use in the United States prior to January 1, 1995 \n     would be permissible.\n\n\n             Subchapter B--Provisions relating to Lobbying\n\n       Section 220. APPLICATION OF SUBCHAPTER. The provisions of \n     this subchapter will be considered part of the Protocol.\n       Section 221. AGREEMENT TO PROVISIONS RELATING TO LOBBYING. \n     A manufacturer signing the Protocol must require that any \n     lobbyists it retains will sign an agreement consenting to \n     comply with applicable laws and regulations governing tobacco \n     products, including this Act and the consent decree under \n     this Act, and agreeing not to support or oppose any Federal \n     or State legislation without express consent from the \n     manufacturer.\n       Section 222. AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE CERTAIN ENTITIES. \n     Parties to the Protocol agree that, within one year of \n     enactment, the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco \n     Research, U.S.A. will be terminated, and that any successor \n     organizations will meet strict guidelines with respect to \n     membership and activities and will be subject to oversight by \n     the Department of Justice.\n\n\n                     Subchapter C--Other Provisions\n\n       Section 225. APPLICATION OF SUBCHAPTER. The provisions of \n     this subchapter will be considered part of the Protocol.\n       Section 226. DETERMINATION OF PAYMENT AMOUNT. Manufacturers \n     agreeing to the Protocol will determine the percentages each \n     specific manufacturer must pay.\n       Section 227. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND EXPENSES. Within 30 days \n     of enactment, an arbitration panel will be appointed by the \n     Trustees, the participating manufacturers, and State \n     Attorneys General participating in the June 20, 1997 \n     memorandum of understanding and the Castano litigants. The \n     arbitration panel will establish procedures for its \n     operation, receive petitions for attorneys' fees and \n     expenses, and make awards based on enumerated criteria \n     subject to an annual cap which is equal to 5% of the \n     amount paid to the Trust Fund for the applicable year. \n     Awards made by the panel will be paid by the participating \n     manufacturers and will not be paid from the Trust Fund.\n       Section 228. LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INDIAN COUNTRY. \n     Participating manufacturers will agree not to conduct any \n     activity within Indian country that is otherwise prohibited \n     under this Act, and agrees to sell or otherwise distribute \n     tobacco products to an Indian tribe or tribal organization \n     under the same terms and conditions as the manufacturer \n     imposes on others.\n       Section 231. FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROTOCOL. Sets \n     forth the terms and conditions under which the Attorney \n     General may bring civil actions, including imposition of \n     stiff penalties, to enforce the Protocol. The Attorney \n     General may enter into contracts with state agencies to \n     assist in enforcement. The Attorney General is authorized to \n     utilize funds from the Trust Fund for performance of her \n     duties under this section.\n       Section 232. STATE ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROTOCOL. The chief \n     law enforcement officer of a state may bring actions to \n     enforce the protocol if the alleged violation is the subject \n     of a proceeding within that State. However, the State must \n     first give the Attorney General 30 days' notice before \n     commencing such a proceeding, and the State may not bring a \n     proceeding if the Attorney General is diligently prosecuting \n     or has settled a proceeding relating to the alleged \n     violation.\n       Section 233. PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT OF PROTOCOL. A \n     participating manufacturer may also seek a declaratory \n     judgment in Federal District Court to enforce its rights and \n     obligations under the Act, and may also bring a civil action \n     against other participating manufacturers to enforce or \n     restrain breaches of the contract. In general, no such \n     actions may be commenced, however, if the Attorney General or \n     applicable State is already pursuing an action on the same \n     alleged breach.\n       Section 234. REMOVAL. The Act allows removal to Federal \n     court of state claims which seek to enforce the Protocol.\n\n\n                      SUBTITLE B--CONSENT DECREES\n\n       Section 241. CONSENT DECREES. For a State to receive \n     funding under Title V, for a manufacturer to receive \n     liability protections under subtitle C, and for settlement of \n     the Castano claims, consent decrees must be signed effective \n     on the date of enactment.\n       The consent decrees shall include provisions relating to \n     restrictions on tobacco advertising and youth access, \n     restrictions on trade associations and lobbying, disclosure \n     on tobacco smoke constituents, disclosure of nontobacco \n     ingredients in tobacco products, disclosure of all documents \n     relating to health, toxicity, and addiction, the obligation \n     of manufacturers to make payments for the benefit of States, \n     the obligation of manufacturers to deal only with \n     distributors and retailers that comply with all laws \n     regarding tobacco products, requirements for warnings, \n     labeling, and packaging, the dismissal of pending litigation \n     as required under this Act, and any other matters deemed \n     appropriate by the Secretary.\n       The consent decrees shall not include information on \n     tobacco product design, performance, or modification, \n     manufacturing standards and good manufacturing practices, \n     testing and regulation with respect to toxicity and \n     ingredients, and the national goals relating to reductions in \n     underage use of tobacco. Constitutional claims shall be \n     waived and the provisions are severable. The decree must be \n     approved by the Attorney General. The decree shall remain in \n     effect regardless of amendments to the Act, except as \n     superseded by said amendments. A state may only seek \n     injunctive enforcement of the consent decree in state court. \n     The Attorney General will regulate to ensure consistency of \n     state court rulings regarding consent decrees which are not \n     exclusively local.\n       Section 242. STATE ENFORCEMENT OF CONSENT DECREES. A State \n     may bring an injunctive action to enforce the terms of a \n     consent decree which falls within its jurisdiction. It can \n     only seek criminal or monetary relief for a subsequent \n     violation of an injunction previously granted.\n       Section 243. NON-PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS. Provides an \n     incentive for manufacturers to participate in the national \n     tobacco control protocol. Non-participating firms will not be \n     protected by the civil liability protections of this bill. A \n     non-participating company will be required to transfer funds \n     to the National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund in an amount \n     based on the proportion of the market share of the sales of \n     the firm. Each non-participating manufacturer shall place \n     into an escrow reserve fund each year an amount equal to 150% \n     of its share of the annual payment required of participating \n     manufacturers.\n\n\n                    SUBTITLE C--LIABILITY PROVISIONS\n\n       Section 251. DEFINITIONS. Defines pertinent terms used in \n     Subtitle C.\n\n\n           CHAPTER 1--IMMUNITY AND LIABILITY FOR PAST CONDUCT\n\n       Section 255. APPLICATION OF CHAPTER. This chapter is the \n     sole enforcement mechanism and exclusive remedy for any \n     claims against any participating manufacturer which have not \n     reached final judgment or settlement by the effective date \n     of this act. Any court judgment entered subsequent to this \n     bill's enactment shall include express language subjecting \n     the judgment to the act. No bond, penalty, or increased \n     interest shall be required in connection with appeal of \n     any judgment arising under this act.\n       Section 256. LIMITED IMMUNITY. All pending actions against \n     participating manufacturers whether brought by a State or \n     local government entity, as a class action, or as a civil \n     action based on addition to or dependence, are hereby \n     terminated. All participating manufacturers are hereby immune \n     from any future action brought by a State or local \n     governmental entity, as a class action,\n\n[[Page S12587]]\n\n     or as a civil action based on tobacco addiction or \n     dependence. Individual personal injury claims arising from \n     the use of tobacco are preserved.\n       Section 257. CIVIL LIABILITY FOR PAST CONDUCT. This section \n     applies to all actions permitted under section 256 for \n     conduct before enactment. Punitive damages are prohibited.\n       All actions must be brought by individuals and may not be \n     consolidated without consent of defendants. The only means to \n     remove an action is if a defendant removes it to Federal \n     court. Participating manufacturers must jointly share in \n     civil liability for damages; they shall not be jointly and \n     severally liable with non-participating manufacturers; and \n     actions involving participating and non-participating \n     manufacturers shall be severed. Permissible plaintiffs are \n     individuals, their heirs, and third-party payers who are \n     bringing individual claims for tobacco-related injuries and \n     third-party payers whose claims are not based on subrogation \n     that were pending on June 9, 1997. Defendants under this \n     section are participating manufacturers, their successors or \n     assigns, any future fraudulent transferees, or any entity for \n     suit designated to survive a defunct signatory. Vicarious \n     liability for agents applies. Subsequent development of \n     reduced risk tobacco is not admissible or discoverable.\n       Aggregate annual cap is 1/3 of annual payments required of \n     all signatories for the year involved. Excess amounts shall \n     be paid in the following year. Signatories shall receive \n     credit of 80% of amounts paid under judgments or settlements \n     for the year involved. Any amount awarded over $1,000,000 may \n     be paid in the following year. Each annual payment shall not \n     exceed $1,000,000, unless all judgments in the first year can \n     be paid without exceeding the aggregate annual cap. \n     Defendants shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs.\n       Section 258. CIVIL LIABILITY FOR FUTURE CONDUCT. This \n     section applies to all actions permitted under section 256 \n     for conduct after enactment. Sections 257(c ) and (e) through \n     (I) shall apply to actions under this section. Third-party \n     payor claims not based on subrogation shall not be commenced \n     under this section. There is no prohibition for punitive \n     damages under this section.\n       Section 259. NON-PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS. This title \n     shall not apply to non-signatories to the Protocol and \n     participating manufacturers who are 12 months delinquent in \n     payments due pursuant to the act.\n       Section 260. PAYMENT OF JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS. A \n     participating manufacturer may seek injunctive relief in \n     federal court to stop a state court from enforcing a judgment \n     which is unenforceable under this chapter. The federal court \n     shall issue an injunction if the participating manufacturer \n     demonstrates that the judgment or settlement is unenforceable \n     under this chapter.\n       Section 261. STATE ELIGIBILITY. A state shall be eligible \n     to receive funds under this act if (1) (by the effective date \n     of the act) it adopts sections 256 through 259 as unqualified \n     state law and any defendant in a civil action under this act \n     shall have a right to a prompt interlocutory appeal to the \n     highest court of the state to enforce the requirements of \n     state law; and (2) it withdraws and dismisses any claims \n     required to be dismissed under section 256.\n       Within 6 months of the effective date of this act (with \n     special provision for states whose legislature do not meet \n     within that time frame), and annually thereafter, the AG \n     shall certify that each state eligible to receive funds has \n     complied with this section--states not certified shall not \n     receive funds. No state claim may be maintained in any court \n     of that state if it does not comply with subsection (a)(1) \n     herein. This chapter governs any action by a state which is \n     not in compliance with subsection (a)(1) herein but is \n     otherwise maintainable in the state.\n       Section 262. REMOVAL. This section amends the existing code \n     to enact the removal provisions and give the federal court \n     jurisdiction.\n       Section 263. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The section conforms \n     existing code sections with this act.\n\n\n              TITLE III--REDUCTION IN UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE\n\n       Subtitle A--State Laws Regarding the Sale of Tobacco \n     Products to Minors\n       Section 301. STATE LAWS REGARDING SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS \n     TO INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. Expands upon what is \n     popularly known as the ``Synar amendment'' (relating to the \n     sale or distribution of tobacco products to individuals under \n     the age of 18) P.L 102-321.\n       Effective in FY 1999 (or FY 2000 for States with \n     legislatures which do not convene in 1999) and thereafter, a \n     State which wishes to receive funding under Title V of this \n     Act must have in effect a State law consistent with the \n     provisions contained in the model law described in section \n     302. A State must enforce the law systematically and \n     conscientiously and in a manner which can reasonably be \n     expected to reduce the extent to which tobacco products \n     are available to individuals under age 18. A State must \n     also certify that enforcement of the law is a priority, \n     conduct random, unannounced inspections to ensure \n     compliance, and annually transmit to the Trustees a report \n     describing its operation of the program. As a funding \n     source for the program, States may use payments from the \n     Trust Fund, grants under sections 1901 and 1921 of the \n     Public Health Service Act, license fees or penalties \n     collected pursuant to this Act, or any other funding \n     authorized by the State legislature. The Trustees are \n     authorized to reduce payments to States for noncompliance.\n       Section 302. MODEL STATE LAW. Describes the provisions of \n     the model state law. Under that model, a series of conditions \n     are placed on the sale of tobacco to restrict use by persons \n     under age 18. It will be unlawful for a person to distribute \n     a tobacco product to an individual under age 18. Persons who \n     violate this section, and employers of employees who violate \n     the section, are liable for civil penalties. Under the model, \n     it is also unlawful for an individual under age 18 to \n     purchase, smoke or consume (or attempt such acts) in a public \n     place. Penalties are imposed for violations of this \n     provision. Law enforcement agencies are required to notify \n     promptly the parent(s) or guardians about such violations. \n     Persons who sell tobacco products at retail must post signs \n     communicating that the sale to individuals under 18 is \n     prohibited. It is also unlawful for product samples or opened \n     packages to be provided to anyone under 18, or for packages \n     to be displayed so that individuals have direct access. Civil \n     penalties for violations of these requirements apply.\n       The model law also requires employers who distribute \n     tobacco products at retail to implement a program to ensure \n     that employees are not distributing tobacco products to \n     minors in violation of the preceding requirements. The model \n     also requires appropriate state and local law enforcement \n     officials to enforce the Act in a manner reasonably expected \n     to reduce the extent to which individuals under age 18 have \n     access to tobacco products. Under certain conditions, states \n     are authorized to use individuals under age 18 to test \n     compliance with this act. The Act also sets forth \n     requirements for states to license persons engaged in the \n     distribution of tobacco products, and describes the \n     procedures which will be used for suspension, revocation, \n     denial and non-renewal of licenses. States are required to \n     report annually on compliance with the Act.\n\n\n            Subtitle B--Required Reduction in Underage Usage\n\n       Section 311. PURPOSE. Encourages achievement of dramatic \n     and immediate reductions in the number of underage consumers \n     of tobacco through substantial financial surcharges on \n     manufacturers if targets are not met.\n       Section 312. DETERMINATION OF UNDERAGE USE BASE \n     PERCENTAGES. Sets forth a methodology for the Secretary of \n     HHS to set base percentages for the calculation by age group \n     of children who use tobacco products.\n       Section 313. ANNUAL DAILY INCIDENCE OF UNDERAGE USE OF \n     TOBACCO PRODUCTS. Five years after enactment, and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall make a determination \n     according to the methodology set out in this section of the \n     average annual incidence of daily tobacco use by individuals \n     under age 18.\n       Section 314. REQUIRED REDUCTION IN UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE. \n     Requires the Secretary to determine if the annual incidence \n     of the daily use of tobacco products exceeds the national \n     goals set forth in section 4.\n       Section 315. APPLICATION OF SURCHARGES. If the Secretary \n     determines that the national goals have not been met in any \n     year following year five, she will make a report to Congress \n     outlining changes to the national program established in this \n     act that she believes must be undertaken to move the country \n     toward achievement of the national goals. The Secretary is \n     authorized to impose a surcharge on cigarette manufacturers \n     of $100 million per percentage point for each of the first \n     five percentage points by which the goal is not met; the \n     surcharge will be $200 million for each of the next five \n     percentage points by which the goal is not met, and $300 \n     million per percentage point for the amount that the goal is \n     not met by eleven or more percentage points. In the case of \n     smokeless tobacco products, which represent one-seventh of \n     youth use of tobacco products, the potential lookback \n     penalties will be $15 million per applicable percentage point \n     for each of the first five points by which the goal is not \n     met. The potential surcharge that could apply would be $30 \n     million and $45 million for the next two five percentage \n     point increments, respectively.\n       Five years after the surcharge provisions are applicable \n     (the eleventh year after passage), the surcharge payments \n     will be increased. For cigarettes, the surcharge payment will \n     be $250 million for each of the first five percentage points \n     that the goal is not met and $500 million for each additional \n     percentage point by which the goal is not met. (E.g., If \n     cigarette usage failed to meet the applicable target by 6 \n     percentage points, in year 6 the surcharge assessment is $700 \n     million, and in year 11 is $1.75 billion.) For smokeless \n     tobacco products, the corresponding surcharge amounts will be \n     $30 million and $60 million, respectively. This section \n     provides an annual cap on surcharge payments for cigarettes \n     of $5 billion for the first five years in which the \n     surcharges apply under the Act (the sixth year after passage) \n     and $10 billion thereafter. For smokeless tobacco products, \n     the analogous caps are, $500 million and $1 billion, \n     respectively.\n       Any surcharge imposed under this section is the joint and \n     several obligation of all participating manufacturers \n     (subject to the abatement provisions contained in section \n\n[[Page S12588]]\n\n     316) as allocated by the market share of each \n     manufacturer. Any funds generated under this section will \n     be available to the Trust Fund.\n       Section 316. ABATEMENT PROCEDURES. A manufacturer who \n     becomes subject to any surcharge that might be imposed under \n     section 315 must first pay the surcharge, and then may \n     petition the Secretary for abatement of the surcharge. The \n     Secretary is required to hold a hearing on the abatement \n     petition, during which the burden will be on the \n     participating manufacturer to prove by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the manufacturer should be granted the \n     abatement. The Secretary will make her decision based on \n     criteria described in this section. She may abate all or part \n     of the surcharge, but this is totally at her discretion. \n     Judicial review of the Secretary's decision may be sought.\n       Section 317. INCENTIVES FOR EXCEEDING THE NATIONAL TOBACCO \n     PRODUCTS USE REDUCTION GOALS. In any year, including the \n     first five program years, that the ultimate national tobacco \n     product use reduction goals are exceeded (a 60% reduction for \n     cigarettes and a 45% reduction for smokeless tobacco \n     products, tobacco manufacturers will be assessed reduced \n     payments. This section provides that for payments related to \n     cigarettes, for each percentage point by which the 60% \n     reduction goal has been exceeded payments will be reduced by \n     a factor of \\1/80\\ per percentage point. (E.g., if cigarette \n     use dropped by 80% from the base year in a given year, the \n     payment would be reduced by 20/80th's, or 25%). The \n     corresponding factor for smokeless tobacco products is 1/110 \n     per percentage point that the 45% goal is exceeded.\n\n\n       TITLE IV--HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS\n\n                     Subtitle A--General Authority\n\n       Section 401. Amendments to Definitions Contained in the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This title grants clear \n     jurisdiction over tobacco products and establishes the \n     framework for the Secretary of Health and Human Service, \n     acting through the Food and Drug Administration, to oversee a \n     new comprehensive regulatory system for tobacco products. \n     ``Tobacco product'' and other relevant terms are defined for \n     the first time in the FDA's basic regulatory statute, the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This section adds two \n     important new prohibited acts to the FD statute that make \n     it illegal to manufacture and market tobacco products that do \n     not comply with the new Tobacco Products chapter, Chapter IX. \n     The bill amends the definition of ``drug'' to give FDA \n     authority to regulate tobacco products as unapproved drugs if \n     they do not comply with new Chapter IX. No change is made in \n     the definition of ``medical device'' and this bill does not \n     contemplate that tobacco products shall be regulated as \n     restricted medical devices.\n       Adds a new Chapter IX to the Federal Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act, which will be entitled ``Health and Safety \n     Regulatory Requirements Relating to Tobacco Products. It will \n     contain the following new sections.\n       Section 900. Definitions. Definitions of the term \n     ``cigarette,'' ``cigarette tobacco,'' ``nicotine,'' \n     ``smokeless tobacco,'' ``tar,'' ``tobacco additive,'' and \n     ``tobacco product'' will be added to the FD Act.\n       Sec. 901. Statement of General Duties. The Secretary of HHS \n     is directed to undertake a number of regulatory activities, \n     detailed in section 902 through section 908, in furtherance \n     of the comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention \n     program that the PROTECT Act establishes for tobacco \n     products.\n       Sec. 902. Tobacco Product Health Risk Management Standards. \n     This section directs the Secretary to issue regulations, \n     through routine notice and comment rulemaking procedures and \n     in consultation with public health experts, that establish \n     rigorous controls over the composition of tobacco products. \n     These regulations will include provisions relating both to \n     the protection of confidential commercial information and for \n     the public disclosure of the ingredients of tobacco products.\n       Such regulations will grant the Secretary the authority to \n     issue regulations to assess and manage the risks presented by \n     nicotine and reduce or eliminate constituents of tobacco \n     products, or to ban tobacco products after the Secretary \n     considers relevant factors. These factors include: reduction \n     of public health risks; capacity of the health care system to \n     provide effective and accessible treatments to current \n     consumers of tobacco products; the potential creation of a \n     significant market for contraband tobacco products; and, the \n     technological feasibility of manufacturers to modify existing \n     products. Secretarial actions to ban tobacco products will \n     require a joint resolution of approval from both chambers of \n     the United States Congress.\n       Sec. 903. Good Manufacturing Practice Standards for Tobacco \n     Products. The Secretary shall issue regulations that specify \n     the good manufacturing practices (GMP) for tobacco products. \n     Such regulations will prescribe the methods used in, and the \n     facilities and management controls used for, the \n     manufacturing of tobacco products. The GMP regulations will \n     contain requirements for registration and inspection of the \n     tobacco product manufacturing establishments.\n       The GMP regulations promulgated by the Secretary shall \n     contain provisions relating to pesticide residue levels and \n     will provide for an advisory committee to recommend to the \n     Secretary whether to approve, consistent with the \n     public health, petitions for variances to the established \n     residue level standards. The GMP requirements established \n     by the Secretary shall include record keeping and \n     reporting standards for tobacco products.\n       Sec. 904. Tobacco Product Labeling, Warning, and Packaging \n     Standards. Section 904 stipulates new warning statements for \n     both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Section 904 \n     provides format and type-size requirements and stipulates \n     rotation schedules for tobacco product labels. Section 904 \n     grants the Secretary the authority to issue regulations to \n     revise tobacco product labeling statements and exempts \n     tobacco product exports from these labeling requirements.\n       Sec. 905. Reduced Risk Tobacco Products. This section \n     requires the Secretary to issue regulations that create \n     incentives for the development and commercial distribution of \n     reduced risks tobacco products. Under section 905 \n     manufacturers of new technologies that reduce the negative \n     health effects of using tobacco products notify, in \n     confidence, the Secretary of such technology. Upon a \n     determination that an innovation reduces the health risks of \n     tobacco products and is technologically feasible, the \n     Secretary may require that such risk reduction innovations be \n     incorporated, through a licensing program, into other tobacco \n     products.\n       Section 906. Tobacco Product Marketing Restrictions. \n     Section 906 prohibits the sale of tobacco products to persons \n     under 18 years of age and generally requires retailers to \n     conduct sales in a face-to-face manner and to verify the age \n     of tobacco purchasers. Under this section, cigarettes must be \n     sold in packages with no fewer than twenty cigarettes; no \n     free samples may be distributed; the vending machine sales \n     must be eliminated except in certain limited adult \n     facilities; and mail order sales must be accompanied by age \n     verification procedures.\n       Section 907. Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory \n     Committee. This requires the Secretary to establish a Tobacco \n     Products Scientific Review Committee to assist in the \n     development and in an on-going assessment of the \n     effectiveness of the tobacco product health risk management \n     standards required by section 902, the tobacco product good \n     manufacturing standards required by section 903, the tobacco \n     product labeling, warning, and packaging standards required \n     by section 904, the reduced risk tobacco product provisions \n     of section 905, and the tobacco product marketing \n     restrictions required by section 906. This committee will \n     primarily consist of experts in science, medicine, and public \n     health but will also include experts in law and ethics and \n     include representatives of both pro-, and anti- tobacco use \n     groups.\n       Section 908. Report to Congress. Section 908 requires the \n     Secretary to report to Congress biennially on the \n     effectiveness of new Chapter IX and the other relevant \n     provisions of the PROTECT Act, and other relevant laws and \n     policies that relate to the nation's effort to reduce use of, \n     and the health risks associated with, tobacco products. Such \n     report will contain information on current use patterns and \n     health effects of tobacco products with a particular emphasis \n     on use of these products by those under 18 years of age. The \n     Secretary shall also report to the Congress on recommended \n     changes in legislation that will increase the effectiveness.\n       Section 909. Judicial Review Standards. This new section \n     makes clear that in any judicial proceeding involving the \n     regulations issued under Chapter IX, the courts will use \n     procedures, apply standards of review, and grant the degree \n     of deference that it normally accords the Secretary under the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n       Section 910. Preemption. This section permits state and \n     local governments to enact requirements with respect to \n     tobacco products so long as the state or local requirement \n     does not conflict with a requirement of section 902, 903, \n     904, or 905.\n       Section 402. Repeals. This section repeals the Federal \n     Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and the Comprehensive \n     Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act.\n\n\n         TITLE V--PAYMENTS TO STATES AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS\n\n                     Subtitle A--Payments to States\n\n       Section 501. Reimbursement for State Expenditures. The \n     Trustees will make available to the states one-half of the \n     Trust Fund amounts each year (after payments have been \n     allocated for tobacco farmers, Native Americans, and certain \n     combined asbestos/tobacco plaintiffs), apportioned state-by-\n     state according to a table listed in the Act which is based \n     on the State Attorney Generals' agreement. The funds will be \n     utilized by the States under two sets of conditions. \n     Utilizing the Medicaid matching percentage rates, the portion \n     of the funds which would have been attributable to the state \n     matching share shall be used by the State for any purpose it \n     deems appropriate. Federal subrogation is waived, and the \n     amount that otherwise would have been returned to the Federal \n     government will be retained by the State, but may only be \n     used for certain specified anti-tobacco-related purposes as \n     outlined in section 502.\n       Section 502. Requirements for States' Use of Certain Funds. \n     As a condition of receiving funds which otherwise would have \n     been returned to the Federal government, a state must submit \n     to the Trustees a plan that describes the anti-tobacco \n     programs for which the funds will be used, the measurable \n     objectives that will be used to evaluate the program outcome, \n     the procedures which will be\n\n[[Page S12589]]\n\n     used for outreach, and efforts which are made to \n     coordinate the new programs with existing Federal and \n     State programs. The state must also collect necessary data \n     and maintain records to allow the Trustees to evaluate the \n     plan and its effectiveness. State plans and amendments \n     thereto are deemed to be approved unless disapproved by \n     the Trustee within 90 days of submission. Each year, the \n     State must provide the Trustees with an assessment of the \n     plan, including the effectiveness of the plan in reducing \n     the number of children and adults who use tobacco \n     products. In addition, the Trustees will provide an annual \n     report on operations of the plan.\n       In order to retain the otherwise-Federal share, States must \n     use the funds for anti-tobacco programs in coordination with \n     existing Federal public health and social services programs, \n     including child nutrition programs, maternal and child \n     health, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, Head \n     Start, school lunch, Indian Health Service, Community Health \n     Centers, Ryan White, and social services block grant. States \n     may also use these funds for smoking cessation programs that \n     reimburse for medications or other therapeutic techniques, \n     and anti-tobacco products public education programs, \n     including counter-advertising campaigns.\n\n\n                   Subtitle B--Public Health Programs\n\n       Section 521. National Institutes of Health Trust Fund for \n     Health Research. A National Institutes of Health Trust Fund \n     for Health Research is established which reflects the \n     settlement of punitive damages for past reprehensible \n     behavior of the tobacco industry. This punitive damages fund \n     will be funded from the National Settlement Trust Fund, and \n     overall funding will amount to $95 billion over the first 25 \n     years. In year 5 and thereafter, a total of $4 billion \n     annually will be available under this section, subject to any \n     required adjustments due to inflation, sales volume \n     adjustments, and look-back penalties.\n       Section 521(e) requires the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health, in consultation with leading experts, \n     to devise a National Tobacco and Other Abused Sustances \n     Research Agenda. Funds provided under this section are \n     expended as follows: NIH Director's Discretionary Fund, 2%; \n     Research Facilities, 2%; health information communications, \n     1%; national cancer research and demonstration centers under \n     section 414 of the Public Health Service Act, 10%; and, the \n     remaining 85% shall be allocated to the established \n     Institutes, Centers, and Divisions of NIH in the same \n     proportion as the annual appropriations bill for NIH. \n     Eligible research are stipulated in section 521(d)(2) and \n     include diseases associated with tobacco use including \n     cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke.\n       Section 522. National Anti-Tobacco Product Consumption and \n     Tobacco Product Cessation Public Health Program. Under this \n     section, with the funds specified in section 101(c)(3)(C) of \n     Title I of this Act, the Secretary shall establish and \n     implement a national anti-tobacco product consumption and \n     tobacco product cessation program. This program will be \n     coordinated by the Office of Smoking and Health of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In year 6 and \n     thereafter, a total of $4 billion annually will be available \n     under this section, subject to any required adjustments due \n     to inflation, sales volume adjustments, and look-back \n     penalties.\n       The Secretary may use funds under this section to offset \n     HHS' administrative costs in carrying out the public health \n     components of the PROTECT Act, including the additional costs \n     attributable to the new regulatory responsibilities placed on \n     the Food and Drug Administration under this Act. In carrying \n     out this section, the Secretary may act under the general \n     authorities provided under section 301 of the Public Health \n     Service Act. In carrying out this program the Secretary must \n     act in concert with state and local public health officials \n     and non-governmental organizations and will consider, as \n     appropriate, the public health recommendations made by the \n     Castano class action plaintiffs.\n       This section requires the Secretary to undertake a \n     substantial public education program, including the \n     development and dissemination of materials that alert, in the \n     most appropriate and effective fashion, the public to the \n     risks of tobacco use, with a special emphasis on materials \n     and techniques that are targeted to young Americans. The \n     Secretary is also directed to make a special effort to inform \n     current adult users of tobacco products of the health \n     benefits of ceasing use of these products. Among the public \n     education and information techniques authorized by this \n     section is a publicly financed nationally directed counter-\n     advertising campaign. The Secretary is also directed to \n     develop and make available a model state anti-tobacco use and \n     tobacco cessation program.\n       Section 522 directs the Secretary to make available at \n     least one half the funds available under this section through \n     section 101(c)(3)(C) to states in the form of vountary anti-\n     tobacco use and tobacco cessation program block grants. \n     Eligible activities for this block grant will be the same as \n     those specified under 502(e). To the extent possible, the \n     Secretary will harmonize the program management requirements \n     under sections 502 and 522. The formula for the block grant \n     will be devised by the Secretary but shall include such \n     relevant factors as the number of children residing in each \n     participating state.\n\n\n  TITLE VI - STANDARDS TO REDUCE INVOLUNTARY EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO SMOKE\n\n       Section 601. DEFINITIONS. Defines pertinent terms used in \n     this section.\n       Section 602. SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENT POLICY. Requires a \n     public facility to implement a smoke-free environment policy, \n     which prohibits tobacco use within the facility and on \n     facility property within the immediate vicinity of the \n     facility's entrance. Requires the policy to be posted in a \n     clear and prominent manner. Exceptions are granted to \n     facilities which meets the requirements of a Specially \n     Designated Smoking Area. No exception would be granted for \n     restaurants, prisons, and congressional office buildings \n     and the Capitol Building. There are special rules for \n     schools and other facilities serving children.\n       Section 603. PREEMPTION. Precludes preemption of any other \n     Federal, State, or local law in this area.\n       Section 604. REGULATIONS.

Sets an effective date of 6 \n     months after the date the rules are promulgated, or 1 year \n     after date of Act's enactment, whichever is later.\n\n\n            TITLE VII--PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH RESEARCH\n\n       Section 701. PURPOSE. Sets the purpose of this title to \n     disclose previously nonpublic or confidential documents by \n     tobacco product manufacturers.\n       Section 702. NATIONAL TOBACCO DOCUMENT DEPOSITORY. \n     Establishes a National Tobacco Document Depository which will \n     be used as a resource for litigants, public health groups, \n     and other interested parties and which will contain documents \n     described in the statute. The section also creates a Tobacco \n     Documents Dispute Resolution Panel, to be composed of 3 \n     Federal Judges appointed by the Congress, and outlines the \n     Panel's structure, including its basis for determining a \n     dispute, its final decision rule, and its assessment of fees \n     policy. Provides for the Panel to establish a procedure for \n     accelerated review and for a Special Masters.\n       Section 703. ENFORCEMENT. Allows the Attorney General to \n     bring a proceeding before the Tobacco Documents Dispute \n     Resolution Panel with appropriate notice requirements and \n     civil penalty levels.\n\n\n             TITLE VIII--AGRICULTURAL TRANSITION PROVISIONS\n\n       Section 801. SHORT TITLE: ``Tobacco Transition Act.''\n       Section 802. PURPOSES. Terminates the federal tobacco \n     program while making compensation to quota owners and tobacco \n     farmers. Provides economic assistance to affected counties \n     through block grants to affected states.\n       Section 803. DEFINITIONS. Defines pertinent terms used in \n     Title VIII.\n\n\n               Subtitle A--Tobacco Production Transition\n\n                CHAPTER 1--TOBACCO TRANSITION CONTRACTS\n\n       Section 811. TOBACCO TRANSITION ACCOUNT. Establishes the \n     Tobacco Transition Account within the Trust Fund. Through \n     this account, compensation will be made to quota owners and \n     tobacco farmers. Economic assistance block grants to affected \n     states will also be provided through the Transition Account.\n       Section 812. OFFER AND TERMS OF TOBACCO TRANSITION \n     CONTRACTS. The Secretary of Agriculture shall offer to buy \n     tobacco quotas from owners through a three-year payment \n     period. All restrictions on the production and marketing of \n     tobacco will be lifted in 1998, ending the tobacco quota \n     program.\n       Section 813. ELEMENTS OF CONTRACTS. Within 90 days of \n     enactment of this legislation, the Secretary to offer \n     contracts to quota owners until June 31, 1999. Buyout \n     payments and transition payments shall start at the beginning \n     of the 1999 marketing year and end at the end of the 2001 \n     marketing year.\n       Section 814. BUYOUT PAYMENTS TO OWNERS. During the three-\n     year phaseout period, buyout payments will be made to quota \n     owners as a compensation for the lost value they experience \n     associated with the ending of the quota program. The payments \n     will be determined by multiplying $8.00 by the average annual \n     quantity of quota owned during the 1995-1997 crop years.\n       Section 815. TRANSITION PAYMENTS TO PRODUCERS. Provides \n     assistance to farmers who do not own quotas but who leased \n     from quota owners during three of the last four years. \n     Transition payments only apply to the leased portion of the \n     recipient's crop and will constitute a compensation to the \n     producer for lost revenue caused by this act. The payments \n     shall be determined by multiplying 40 cents by the average \n     quantity of tobacco produced during the three years of the \n     transition period.\n       Section 816. TOBACCO WORKER TRANSITION PROGRAM. Establishes \n     a retraining program for displaced tobacco workers involved \n     in the manufacture, processing or warehousing of tobacco or \n     tobacco products. Patterned after the NAFTA Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance program, the Governor and then the Secretary of \n     Labor shall determine a group's eligibility for the program. \n     The total amount of payments for the Tobacco Worker \n     Transition Program is capped at $50,000,000 for any fiscal \n     year, and after ten years the program will be terminated. Any \n     individual receiving tobacco quota buyout payments are \n     ineligible for this program.\n\n[[Page S12590]]\n\n       Section 817. FARMER OPPORTUNITY GRANTS. Amends the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 to establish a grant payment for \n     tobacco farmers and their families to pay for higher \n     education. Grants will be made in the amount of $1,700 per \n     year, rising to $2,900 annually by 2019. Academic eligibility \n     requirements will mirror the standards regulating Pell \n     Grants. Receipt of a Farmer Opportunity Grant will not affect \n     a student's eligibility to receive other income-based \n     assistance.\n\n\n           CHAPTER 2--RURAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE BLOCK GRANTS\n\n       Section 821. Rural Economic Assistance Block Grants. For \n     each of the three years of the transition period, 1999 \n     through 2001, the Secretary shall provide block grants to \n     tobacco growing states to assist areas that are largely \n     dependent on tobacco production. The grants will total $100 \n     million for each of the three years, with a total cost of \n     $300 million. The amount of each state's block grant will be \n     based on (1) the number of counties within the state \n     dependent on tobacco production and (2) the extent to which \n     the counties are dependent on tobacco production. The \n     Governor shall use a similar formula to apportion the state's \n     grant to the counties. Use of the grants by the counties \n     shall be approved by the Governor.\n\n\n  Subtitle B--Tobacco Price Support and Production Adjustment Programs\n\n                CHAPTER 1--TOBACCO PRICE SUPPORT PROGRAM\n\n       Section 831. INTERIM REFORM OF TOBACCO PRICE SUPPORT \n     PROGRAM. Amends Section 106 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 \n     to phase out the tobacco price support program over the four \n     years following the enactment of this act. In 1999, the price \n     supports will decline by 25% and then by 10% in 2000 and in \n     2001, after which the price support program will be \n     terminated.\n       Section 832. TERMINATION OF TOBACCO PRICE SUPPORT PROGRAM. \n     Amends Section 101 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 to repeal \n     the tobacco price support program after 2001.\n\n\n           CHAPTER 2--TOBACCO PRODUCTION ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMS\n\n       Section 835. TERMINATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTION ADJUSTMENT \n     PROGRAMS. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to \n     exclude tobacco from the provisions of the Act, effectively \n     ending the Tobacco Production Adjustment Program.\n\n\n                          Subtitle C--Funding\n\n       Section 841. TRUST FUND. Provides for the transfer of funds \n     from Tobacco Transition Account (in the Trust Fund) to the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).\n       Section 842. COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION. Allows the \n     Secretary to use the CCC in carrying out the provisions of \n     this title.\n\n\n                   TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n       Section 901. PROVISIONS RELATING TO NATIVE AMERICANS. \n     Provides that the requirements of this Act relating to the \n     manufacturer, distribution and sale of tobacco products will \n     apply on Indian lands as defined in section 1151 of title 18 \n     of the U.S. Code. Any federal tax or fee imposed on the \n     manufacture, distribution or sale of tobacco products will be \n     paid by any Indian tribe engaged in such activities, or by \n     persons engaged in such activities on such Indian lands, to \n     the same extent such tax applies to other entities.\n       The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the \n     Interior, is authorized to treat Indian tribes as a state for \n     purposes of this Act. The Secretary is authorized to provide \n     any such tribe grant assistance to carry out the licensing \n     and enforcement functions in accordance with a plan submitted \n     and approved by the Secretary as in compliance with the Act.\n       A participating tobacco manufacturer shall not engage in \n     any activity within Indian country that is prohibited under \n     the Protocol. A state may not impose obligations or \n     requirements relating to the application of this Act to \n     Indian tribes and organizations.\n       Recognizing that tobacco use remains a significant risk \n     factor for Indians and that cigarette smoking is more than \n     twofold for Indian men and more than fourfold for Indian \n     women over non-Indians, a supplemental fund is established \n     for the Indian Health Service to raise the health status of \n     Indians. The fund is established at $5 billion to be allotted \n     to IHS at increments of $200 million annually for 25 years.\n       Section 902. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. A tobacco \n     manufacturer or distributor may not retaliate against an \n     employee for disclosing a substantial violation of law \n     related to this Act to the Secretary, the Department of \n     Justice, or any State or local authority. Said employee may \n     file a civil action in federal court if he believes such \n     retaliation has occurred (within two years of the \n     retaliation). The court may order reinstatement of the \n     employee, order compensatory damages, or other appropriate \n     remedies. Employees who deliberately participate in the \n     violation or knowingly provide false information are excluded \n     from this section.\n       Section 903. LIMITED ANTITRUST EXEMPTION. Federal and state \n     antitrust laws shall not apply to certain actions by \n     manufacturers, which are taken pursuant to this Act, \n     including entering into the Protocol or consent decree, \n     refusing to deal with non-complying distributors, or other \n     actions meant to comply with plans or programs to reduce the \n     use of tobacco by children. In order for the exemption to \n     apply, such plans or programs must be approved by the \n     Attorney General pursuant to a process set forth in this \n     section.\n       Section 904. EFFECTIVE DATE. The effective date will be the \n     date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1533. A bill to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to clarify \nrestrictions under that act of baiting, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  The Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from the State of Mississippi, Senator \nCochran, in introducing the Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act. I believe \nit is legislation all of our colleagues should support.\n  As members of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Senator \nCochran and I recognize the importance of protecting and conserving \nmigratory bird populations and habitat.\n  Eighty years ago, Congress enacted the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, \nwhich implemented the 1916 Convention for the Protection of Migratory \nBirds between Great Britain, for Canada, and the United States. Since \nthen, the United States, Mexico, and the former Soviet Union have \nsigned similar agreements. The Convention and the Act are designed to \nprotect and manage migratory birds and regulate the taking of that \nrenewable resource. They have had a positive impact, and we have \nmaintained viable migratory bird populations despite the loss of \nnatural habitat because of human activities.\n  Since passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and development of the \nregulatory program, several issues have been raised and resolved. One \nhas not--the issue concerning the hunting of migratory birds ``[b]y the \naid of baiting, or on or over any baited area.''\n  A doctrine has developed in the federal courts by which the intent or \nknowledge of a person hunting migratory birds on a baited field is not \nan issue. If bait is present, and the hunter is there, he is guilty \nunder the doctrine of strict liability. It is not relevant that the \nhunter did not know or could not have known bait was present. I \nquestion the basic fairness of this rule.\n  Mr. President, I do not want anyone to misunderstand me. I strongly \nsupport the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We must protect our migratory \nbird resources from overexploitation. I would not weaken the Act's \nprotections.\n  The fundamental goal of the Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act is to \naddress the baiting issue. It is the result of months of negotiation by \nthe International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies' Ad Hoc \nCommittee on Baiting. The Committee has representatives from each of \nthe migratory flyways, Ducks Unlimited, the National Wildlife \nFederation, and the North American Wildlife Enforcement Officers \nAssociation.\n  Under this legislation, no person may take migratory birds by the aid \nof bait, or on or over bait, where that person knew or should have \nknown the bait was present. It removes the strict liability \ninterpretation presently followed by federal courts. In its stead, it \nestablishes a standard that permits a determination of the actual guilt \nof the defendant. If the facts show the hunter knew or should have \nknown of the bait, liability, which includes fines and possible \nincarceration, would be imposed. However, if the facts show the hunter \ncould not have reasonably known bait was present, the court would not \nimpose liability or assess penalties. This is a question of fact \ndetermined by the court based on the evidence presented.\n  This legislation would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \npublish, in the Federal Register, a notice for public comment defining \nwhat is a normal agricultural operation for that geographic area. The \nService would make this determination after consultation with state and \nfederal agencies and an opportunity for public comment. The purpose of \nthis provision is to provide guidance for landowners, farmers, wildlife \nmanagers, law enforcement officials, and hunters so they know what a \nnormal agricultural operation is for their region.\n  The goal of the Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act is to provide \nguidance to landowners, farmers, wildlife managers, hunters, law \nenforcement officials, and the courts on the restrictions\n\n[[Page S12591]]\n\non the taking of migratory birds. It accomplishes that without \nweakening the intent of current restrictions on the method and manner \nof taking migratory birds; nor do the proposed provisions weaken \nprotection of the resource.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nimportant legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1533\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Migratory Bird Treaty Reform \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Migratory Bird Treaty Act was enacted in 1918 to \n     implement the 1916 Convention for the Protection of Migratory \n     Birds between the United States and Great Britain (for \n     Canada). The Act was later amended to reflect similar \n     agreements with Mexico, Japan, and the former Soviet Union.\n       (2) Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the \n     Secretary of the Interior is authorized to promulgate \n     regulations specifying when, how, and whether migratory birds \n     may be hunted.\n       (3) Contained within these regulations are prohibitions on \n     certain methods of hunting migratory game birds to better \n     manage and conserve this resource. These prohibitions, many \n     of which were recommended by sportsmen, have been in place \n     for over 60 years and have received broad acceptance among \n     the hunting community with one principal exception relating \n     to the application and interpretation of the prohibitions on \n     the hunting of migratory game birds by the aid of baiting, or \n     on or over any baited area.\n       (4) The prohibitions regarding the hunting of migratory \n     game birds by the aid of bait, or on or over bait, have been \n     fraught with interpretive difficulties on the part of law \n     enforcement, the hunting community, and courts of law. \n     Hunters who desire to comply with applicable regulations have \n     been subject to citation for violations of the regulations \n     due to the lack of clarity, inconsistent interpretations, and \n     enforcement. The baiting regulations have been the subject of \n     multiple congressional hearings and a law enforcement \n     advisory commission.\n       (5) Restrictions on the hunting of migratory game birds by \n     the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, must be \n     clarified in a manner that recognizes the national and \n     international importance of protecting the migratory bird \n     resource while ensuring consistency and appropriate \n     enforcement including the principles of ``fair chase''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFYING HUNTING PROHIBITIONS.\n\n       Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 704) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a)'' after ``Sec. 3.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b)(1) No person shall--\n       ``(A) take any migratory game bird by the aid of baiting, \n     or on or over any baited area, where the person knows or \n     reasonably should have known that the area is a baited area; \n     or\n       ``(B) place or direct the placement of bait on or adjacent \n     to an area for the purpose of causing, inducing, or allowing \n     any person to take or attempt to take any migratory game bird \n     by the aid of baiting or on or over the baited area.\n       ``(2) Nothing in this subsection prohibits any of the \n     following:\n       ``(A) The taking of any migratory game bird, including \n     waterfowl, from a blind or other place of concealment \n     camouflaged with natural vegetation.\n       ``(B) The taking of any migratory game bird, including \n     waterfowl, on or over--\n       ``(i) standing crops, flooded standing crops (including \n     aquatics), flooded harvested croplands, grain crops properly \n     shocked on the field where grown;

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to delay \nthe commencement of the student loan repayment period for certain \nstudents called to active duty in the Armed Forces; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n[[Page S12592]]\n\n            the veterans' student loan deferment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nVeterans' Student Loan Deferment Act of 1997. This important \nlegislation will amend the Higher Education Act to preserve the 6-month \ngrace period for repayment of federal student loans for reservists who \nhave been called into active duty.\n  Throughout my career as a public official, I have always supported \nthe brave men and women who serve our nation in the Reserve Components. \nThese forces represent all 50 States and four territories, and truly \nembody our forefathers' vision of the American citizen-soldier. \nReservists are active participants in the full spectrum of U.S. \nmilitary operations, from the smallest of contingencies to full-scale \ntheater war, and no major operation can be successful without them.\n  However, under current law, students who receive orders to serve with \nour military in places like Bosnia are returning home to discover that \nthey have lost the six month grace period on their federal student \nloans and must begin making repayments immediately. I believe it is \npatently unfair and inconsistent with our increased reliance on the \nReserve Forces to call up these students to serve in harm's way and, at \nthe same time, to keep the clock running on the six month grace period \nfor paying-back student loans. Enactment of my legislation would \neliminate this serious inequity confronting students in the Reserves.\n  Mr. President, hundreds upon hundreds of New Jerseyans have been \ninvolved in Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia to date. Many of these \ncourageous individuals had to withdraw from classes in order to serve \ntheir nation in uniform. Although the Department of Education can grant \ndeferments to these students, federal law prohibits reinstating their \ngrace period, so interest continues to accrue on their loans whenever \nthey are not attending classes. It is important to note that this \nlegislation will not provide these veterans with any special treatment \nor benefit. My legislation will simply guarantee that the repayment \nstatus on their student loans will be the same when they return home as \nwhen they left for service.\n  I feel very strongly that students should not be punished for serving \nin the Reserves, and believe that when they are called to serve our \ncountry, their focus should be on the mission, not on the status of \ntheir student loans. I am proud to offer this legislation on behalf of \nthe hundreds of thousands of Reservists in the United States, and look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure its passage. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DELAY IN COMMENCEMENT OF REPAYMENT PERIOD.\n\n       (a) Federal Stafford Loans and Federal Direct Stafford/Ford \n     Loans.--Section 428(b)(7) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1078(b)(7)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(D) There shall be excluded from the 6 month period that \n     begins on the date on which a student ceases to carry at \n     least one-half the normal full-time academic workload as \n     described in subparagraph (A)(i) any period not to exceed 3 \n     years during which a borrower who is a member of a reserve \n     component of the Armed Forces named in section 10101 of title \n     10, United States Code, is called or ordered to active duty \n     for a period of more than 30 days (as defined in section \n     101(d)(2) of such title).''.\n       (b) Federal Perkins Loans.--Section 464(c) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087dd(c)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) There shall be excluded from the 9 month period that \n     begins on the date on which a student ceases to carry at \n     least one-half the normal full-time academic workload as \n     described in paragraph (1)(A) any period not to exceed 3 \n     years during which a borrower who is a member of a reserve \n     component of the Armed Forces named in section 10101 of title \n     10, United States Code, is called or ordered to active duty \n     for a period of more than 30 days (as defined in section \n     101(d)(2) of such title).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr, SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Coats, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1535. A bill to provide marketing quotas and a market transition \nprogram for the 1997 through 2001 crops of quota and additional \npeanuts, to terminate marketing quotas for the 2002 and subsequent \ncrops of peanuts, and to make nonrecourse loans available to peanut \nproducers for the 2002 and subsequent crops of peanuts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               the peanut program improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill phase out the peanut quota program over 6 years, with the quota \nsystem being eliminated beginning in crop year 2002. I am joined in \nthis effort by my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, as well as \nother original cosponsors.\n  Under our legislation, the price support for peanuts grown for edible \nconsumption is gradually reduced each year from the current support \nprice of $610 per ton to $445 per ton by 2001. In the year 2002 and \nensuing years, there would be no quotas on peanuts and the Secretary of \nAgriculture would be required to make non-recourse loans available to \nall peanut farmers at 85 percent of their estimated market value, \nconsistent with the non-recourse loan program available for other \nagricultural commodities. In year 2002, and thereafter, the non-\nrecourse loan is capped at the current world price of $350 per ton.\n  In determining quotas for the crop years 1998 through 2001, the \nSecretary would be required to consult with representatives of the \nentire industry. The Secretary would also be required to consider \nstocks in Commodity Credit Corporation's inventory at the beginning of \nthe new crop year as well as a reasonable carryover to permit orderly \nmarketing at the end of the crop year.\n  The bill also authorizes the complete sale, lease or transfer of \npoundage quotas across county and state lines. It abolishes the current \nlimitation that now restricts sales, leases, and transfers to no more \nthan 40 percent of the total poundage quota in the county within a \nstate.\n  Under current law, additional peanuts (those produced in excess of \nthe farmers' poundage quota) may only be sold for export or crushing. \nThe bill would permit additional peanuts to also be used for sale to \nthe Department of Defense, as well as to other federal, state or local \ngovernment agencies, including for use in the school lunch program.\n  Mr. President, the federal peanut program is an anachronism. Born in \nthe 1930's during an era of massive change and dislocation in \nagriculture, the program is sorely out of place in today's vibrant \nagricultural sector. While other farm commodities are seeking new \nexport opportunities abroad, building new markets and helping to \nimprove our national balance of trade; the peanut industry is building \nnew barriers to protect its rapidly diminishing industry. Certainly \nimports are a factor, but the true threat to America's peanut farmer is \nthe very quota system that he so stubbornly protects. Industry \nstatistics show that the quota program is causing the demand for \npeanuts to fall sharply. The quota system stifles freedom for farmers, \nand it fosters a set of economic expectations that cannot be sustained \nwithout continued government intervention. Moreover, failure to reform \nthis program costs consumers $500 million annually, and adds to the \ncost of feeding programs for low-income Americans.\n  This program must be changed. As sponsors of this measure, however, \nmy colleagues and I recognize that the peanut program cannot be \nrepealed overnight. That is why we are proposing a fair transition \nperiod to enable farmers and lenders to adjust their expectations to \nthe marketplace. Following completion of the phase-out period, the \npeanut program will operate like most other agricultural commodities.\n  I am pleased that Senators DeWine, Chafee, Coats, Gregg, and Feingold \nhave joined Senator Lautenberg and I as original sponsors of this \nmeasure, and I encourage my colleagues to support swift enactment of \nthis important legislation.\n\n[[Page S12593]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Ms. Snowe)\n  S. 1536. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require that group and \nindividual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide \ncoverage for qualified individuals for bone mass measurement (bone \ndensity testing) to prevent fractures associated with osteoporosis and \nto help women make informed choices about their reproductive and post-\nmenopausal health care, and to otherwise provide for research and \ninformation concerning osteopor-\nosis and other related bone diseases; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n  the early detection and prevention of osteoporosis and related bone \n                          diseases act of 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early \nDetection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act \nof 1997 along with my colleague from Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  Osteoporosis and other related bone diseases pose a major public \nhealth threat. More than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are \nwomen, suffer from, or are at risk for, osteoporosis. Between three and \nfour million Americans suffer from related bone diseases like Paget's \ndisease or osteogenesis imperfecta. Today, in the United States, 10 \nmillion individuals already have osteoporosis and 18 million more have \nlow bone mass, placing them at increased risk.\n  Osteoporosis is often called the ``silent disease'' because bone loss \noccurs without symptoms. People often do not know they have \nosteoporosis until their bones become so weak that a sudden bump or \nfall causes a fracture or a vertebra to collapse. Every year, there are \n1.5 million bone fractures caused by osteoporosis. Half of all women, \nand one-eighth of all men, age 50 or older, will suffer a bone fracture \ndue to osteoporosis.\n  Osteoporosis is a progressive condition that has no known cure; thus, \nprevention and treatment are key. The Early Detection and Prevention of \nOsteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 1997 seeks to combat \nosteoporosis, and related bone diseases like Paget's disease and \nosteogenesis imperfecta, in two ways.\n  First, the bill requires private health plans to cover bone mass \nmeasurement tests for qualified individuals who are at risk for \ndeveloping osteoporosis. Bone mass measurement is the only reliable \nmethod of detecting osteoporosis in its early stages. The test is non-\ninvasive and painless and is as predictive of future fractures as high \ncholesterol or high blood pressure is of heart disease or stroke. This \nprovision is similar to a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nthat requires Medicare coverage of bone mass measurements.\n  Second, the Early Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and \nRelated Bone Diseases Act authorizes $1,000,000 to fund an information \nclearinghouse and $50,000,000 in each fiscal year 1999 through 2001 for \nthe National Institutes of Health to expand and intensify its effort to \ncombat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases.\n  Funding for research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases is \nseverely constrained at key research institutes like the National \nInstitute on Aging. Further research is needed to improve prevention \nand treatment of these devastating diseases.\n  Money spent now on prevention and treatment will help defray the \nenormous costs of these diseases in the future. Currently, osteoporosis \ncosts the United States $13,000,000,000 every year. The average cost of \nrepairing a hip fracture, a common effect of osteoporosis, is $32,000.\n  Because osteoporosis is a progressive condition and affects primarily \naging individuals, reductions in the incidence or severity of \nosteoporosis will likely significantly reduce osteoporosis-related \ncosts under the Medicare program.\n  Medical experts agree that osteoporosis and related bone diseases are \nhighly preventable. However, if the toll of these diseases is to be \nreduced, the commitment to prevention and treatment must be \nsignificantly increased. With increased research and access to \npreventive testing, the future for definitive treatment and prevention \nis bright.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Early \n     Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone \n     Diseases Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nature of osteoporosis.--\n       (A) Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone \n     mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue leading to \n     bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures of \n     the hip, spine, and wrist.\n       (B) Osteoporosis has no symptoms and typically remains \n     undiagnosed until a fracture occurs.\n       (C) Once a fracture occurs, the condition has usually \n     advanced to the stage where the likelihood is high that \n     another fracture will occur.\n       (D) There is no cure for osteoporosis, but drug therapy has \n     been shown to reduce new hip and spine fractures by 50 \n     percent and other treatments, such as nutrition therapy, have \n     also proven effective.\n       (2) Incidence of osteoporosis and related bone diseases.--\n       (A) 28 million Americans have (or are at risk for) \n     osteoporosis, 80 percent of which are women.\n       (B) Osteoporosis is responsible for 1.5 million bone \n     fractures annually, including more than 300,000 hip \n     fractures, 700,000 vertebral fractures and 200,000 fractures \n     of the wrists.\n       (C) Half of all women, and one-eighth of all men, age 50 or \n     older will have a bone fracture due to osteoporosis;\n       (D) Between 3 and 4 million Americans have Paget's disease, \n     osteogenesis imperfecta, hyperparathyroidism, and other \n     related metabolic bone diseases.\n       (3) Impact of osteoporosis.--The cost of treating \n     osteoporosis is significant:\n       (A) The annual cost of osteoporosis in the United States is \n     $13.8 billion and is expected to increase precipitously \n     because the proportion of the population comprised of older \n     persons is expanding and each generation of older persons \n     tends to have a higher incidence of osteoporosis than \n     preceding generations.\n       (B) The average cost in the United States of repairing a \n     hip fracture due to osteoporosis is $32,000.\n       (C) Fractures due to osteoporosis frequently result in \n     disability and institutionalization of individuals.\n       (D) Because osteoporosis is a progressive condition and \n     affects primarily aging individuals, reductions in the \n     incidence or severity of osteoporosis, particularly for post \n     menopausal women before they become eligible for medicare, \n     has a significant potential of reducing osteoporosis-related \n     costs under the medicare program.\n       (4) Use of bone mass measurement.--\n       (A) Bone mass measurement is the only reliable method of \n     detecting osteoporosis at an early stage.\n       (B) Low bone mass is as predictive of future fractures as \n     is high cholesterol or high blood pressure of heart disease \n     or stroke.\n       (C) Bone mass measurement is a non-invasive, painless, and \n     reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis before costly fractures \n     occur.\n       (D) Under section 4106 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     Medicare will provide coverage, effective July 1, 1998, for \n     bone mass measurement for qualified individuals who are at \n     risk of developing osteoporosis.\n       (5) Research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases.--\n       (A) Technology now exists, and new technology is \n     developing, that will permit the early diagnosis and \n     prevention of osteoporosis and related bone diseases as well \n     as management of these conditions once they

Mr. President, I rise to offer a measure to revise the \nHoney Research, Promotion and Consumer Information Act, the statute \nunder which the National Honey Board is organized.\n  Briefly, my bill would impose a penny per pound assessment on \nhandlers and importers of honey. This will increase the research budget \nof the Honey Board by approximately $500,000; and enable the industry \nto fund research programs aimed at addressing the serious problems \ncaused by viruses, parasitic mites, and Africanized bees.\n  The bill also changes the constitution of the National Honey Board to \nimprove packer representation on the board to reflect the imposition of \na new assessment on honey handlers. Under my amendments, packers would \nhave a total of four seats versus the current two. Producer and \nimporter representation on the board will not change.\n  In developing my legislation, I worked the American Beekeeping \nFederation, which represents more than 1,400 honey producers \nnationwide. The amendments have the support of a broad coalition \nincluding producers, packers, and importers, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort by approving this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE:\n  S. 1537.

Mr. President, today I am introducing 13 bills to suspend \nthe duty on the importation of certain products that are used by \nmanufacturers in my home state of Rhode Island.\n  The products in question are organic replacements for colorants that \nuse heavy metals--such as lead, molybdenum, chrome, and cadmium--in the \nplastics and coatings industries. Heavy metal colorants traditionally \nhave been used in the coloration of plastics and coatings, especially \nwhere the applications are subjected to high heat, or where high \nweatherfastness or lightfastness are required. Until recently, finding \nsubstitutes for these heavy metal-based products was difficult. \nHowever, thanks to new formulations, a number of organic products have \nproved themselves to be satisfactory substitutes.\n  Reducing our reliance on heavy metal colorants makes sense \nenvironmentally. However, none of the organic substitutes in question \nare produced in the United States. Thus, our producers have no choice \nbut to import the substitutes and pay the requisite import taxes, which \nrange from 6.6 to 14.6 percent. The total price tag associated with \nthese duties, while relatively small in the context of our federal \nbudget, translates into a considerable business cost to the importing \nmanufacturers. The added cost hurts their ability to compete, and thus \ntheir ability to maintain their workforce. Yet, given that there is no \ndomestic industry producing these substitutes, the duties serve little \npurpose.\n  The package of bills I am introducing today would remedy this \nsituation by suspending the duty on these thirteen products. As I say, \nnone of these organic substitutes are produced in the United States, \nand therefore lifting the current duties will not result in harm to any \ndomestic industry. Rather, suspending the duties will allow our \ndomestic manufacturers to reduce costs, thus maintaining U.S. \ncompetitiveness and safeguarding Rhode Island jobs.\n  This is a critical point. I feel strongly that we in Rhode Island \nshould do all we can to keep the state's economy going by creating \njobs, encouraging business activity, and spurring new growth. These \nbills will help contribute to a productive manufacturing sector in \nRhode Island, and aid our employers in keeping their costs down and \ntheir sales--and employment--up.\n  It is my hope that by introducing this package of legislation now, \nthere will be ample time for review and comment on each bill, and that \nas a result, should the Senate take up comprehensive duty suspension \nlegislation next year, these provisions will be ready for inclusion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1552. A bill to provide for the conveyance of an unused Air Force \nhousing facility in La Junta, Colorado, to the city of La Junta; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n           the la junta air base land conveyance act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, by way of legislation, I offer my \nsupport to the city of La Junta, Colorado, for its innovative and \nimpressive response to the challenges facing the Lower Arkansas Valley. \nCity officials have seized a unique opportunity to alleviate La Junta's \nhousing crisis, expand the local Head Start program and increase access \nto child care, and solve Otero Junior College's dormitory problems.\n  The city of La Junta, in conjunction with Otero Junior College, has \nproposed to take over the recently closed La Junta Air Base family \nhousing site. Until one year ago, when it was farmed out to a civilian \ndefense contractor, the Air Force's test range for its bomber pilots \nwas housed in La Junta. Since then, several federal agencies have \nexpressed interest in the site, but none has asserted their formal \ndesire to reuse the facility.\n  Further, taxpayers are spending nearly $100,000 annually to maintain \nan empty facility, while the city and residents of La Junta are losing \nout on a significant supplement to the local tax\n\n[[Page S12597]]\n\nbase. The reuse plan I am endorsing provides for a self-sustaining and \nrevenue generating housing and local services site, which is a well \ndeveloped and cooperative solution to some very real local concerns.\n  Given the lack of any formal initiative on the part of a federal \nagency, which would be given priority consideration, I support the \nefforts of the city. Our college, Congressman Bob Schaffer, \nrepresenting Colorado's 4th congressional district, has introduced \nlegislation in the House of Representatives to convey the unused Air \nForce housing facility to the city of La Junta. Today, I am introducing \na companion measure in the Senate.\n  It is my hope that this bill will be referred to the appropriate \ncommittee and receive expedited consideration through next year's \nauthorizing and appropriations process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1553. A bill to amend the Marine Protection, Research, and \nSanctuaries Act of 1972 with respect to the dumping of dredged material \nin Long Island Sound, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n         the long island sound preservation and protection act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nalong with my friend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, that will help \nguarantee that one of our Nation's most important estuaries is no \nlonger used as a dumping ground for polluted dredged material. Long \nIsland Sound is a spectacular body of water located between Long \nIsland, New York and the State of Connecticut. Unfortunately, past \ndumping of dredged material of questionable environmental impact has \noccurred in the sound. It is high time that Congress put an end to any \nfuture, willful pollution of the sound.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will prevent any \nindividual of any government agency from randomly dumping sediments \ninto the ecologically sensitive sound. Specifically, the legislation \nprevents all sediments that contain any constituents prohibited as \nother than trace contaminants, as defined by federal regulations, from \nbeing dumped into either Long Island Sound or Block Island Sound. \nExceptions to the act can be made only in circumstances where the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the \nmaterial will not cause undesirable effects to the environment of \nmarine life.\n  In the fall of 1995, the U.S. Navy dumped over 1 million cubic yards \nof dredged material from the Thames River into the New London dump site \nlocated in the sound. Independent tests of that sediment indicated that \ncontaminants were present in that dredged material that now lies at the \nbottom of the sound's New London dump site--contaminants such as \ndioxin, cadmium, pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PCB's, and \nmercury. Right now, there is a question as to the long-term impact this \nmaterial will have on the aquatic life and the environment in that area \nof the ocean. Such concerns should not have to occur. It has taken \nyears to come as far as we have in cleaning up Long Island Sound--we \nshould not jeopardize those gains by routinely allowing the dumping of \npolluted sediments in these waters.\n\n  Vast amounts of federal, state, and local funds have been spent in \nthe State of New York in the last quarter century combating pollution \nin the sound. However, at times over the last 25 years, we have looked \nthe other way when it comes to dumping in the sound. Such actions are \ncounter-productive in our efforts to restore the sound for recreational \nactivities such as swimming and boating as well as the economic \nbenefits of sportfishing and the shellfish industry--all of which bring \nmore than $5.5 billion to the region each year.\n  New Yorkers realize the importance of the sound and are stepping up \ntheir efforts to make sure it is cleaned up. New York voters approved \nan environmental bond initiative that, among other things, commits $200 \nmillion for sewage treatment plant upgrades, habitat restoration, and \nnonpoint source pollution controls on Long Island Sound. New York is \ndoing its part; it is time now to get the support of the federal \ngovernment. With the actions taken by New York, and with the passage of \nthe legislation Senator Moynihan and I are introducing, I am confident \nthat Long Island Sound will move steadily forward on the road to \nrecovery. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this bill, \nand I encourage its swift passage in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1553\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Long Island Sound \n     Preservation and Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DUMPING OF DREDGED MATERIALS IN LONG ISLAND SOUND.\n\n       Section 106 of the Marine Protection, Research, and \n     Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1416) is amended by \n     striking subsection (f) and inserting the following:\n       ``(f) Dumping of Dredged Material in Long Island Sound.--\n       ``(1) Prohibition.--No dredged material from any Federal or \n     non-Federal project in a quantity exceeding 25,000 cubic \n     yards that contains any of the constituents prohibited as \n     other than trace contaminants (as defined by the Federal \n     ocean dumping criteria set forth in section 227.6 of title \n     40, Code of Federal Regulations) may be dumped in Long Island \n     Sound (including Fishers Island Sound) or Block Island Sound, \n     except in a case in which it is demonstrated to the \n     Administrator, and the Administrator certifies by publication \n     in the Federal Register, that the dumping of the dredged \n     material containing the constituents will not cause \n     significant undesirable effects, including the threat \n     associated with bioaccumulation of the constituents in marine \n     organisms.\n       ``(2) Compliance with other requirements.--In addition to \n     other provisions of law and notwithstanding the specific \n     exclusion relating to dredged material of the first sentence \n     in section 102(a), any dumping of dredged material in Long \n     Island Sound (including Fishers Island Sound) or Block Island \n     Sound from a Federal project pursuant to Federal \n     authorization, or from a dredging project by a non-Federal \n     applicant, in a quantity exceeding 25,000 cubic yards, shall \n     comply with the requirements of this Act, including the \n     criteria established under the second sentence of section \n     102(a) relating to the effects of dumping.\n       ``(3) Relation to other law.--Subsection (d) shall not \n     apply to this subsection.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1554. A bill to provide for relief from excessive punitive damage \nawards in cases involving primarily financial loss by establishing \nrules for proportionality between the amount of punitive damages and \nthe amount of economic loss; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              The Fairness in Punitive Damages Awards Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Lieberman, the Fairness in Punitive Damages Awards Act. In \ngeneral, this bill limits the amount of punitive damages that may be \nawarded in certain civil actions, primarily financial injury lawsuits, \nto three times the amount awarded to the claimant for economic loss or \n$250,000, whichever is greater.\n  These are cases where the claims essentially arise from breach of \ncontract or insurance ``bad-faith'' or fraud injuries. The punitive \ndamages limitation provision also excludes awards in cases where death, \nloss of limb, bodily harm, or physical injury occur. It generally does \nnot encompass products liability and physical harm tort cases--cases \nwhere supporters of punitive damage awards contend that exemplary \ndamages are needed to deter reckless behavior.\n  Thus, what sets this bill apart from previous measures is that it has \nbeen narrowly tailored to address concerns raised by the Administration \nand opponents of punitive damages limitations bills. We hope to attract \nbipartisan support because of the narrow scope of the bill, and, more \nsignificantly, because the bill addresses a major impediment to \neconomic growth--runaway punitive damage awards, particularly in \nfinancial injury cases.\n  It is beyond doubt that our civil justice system is being plagued by \nan epidemic of punitive damage awards. In recent testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee, former Assistant Attorney General Theodore Olson \nnoted that throughout the 19th until the mid-20th century, punitive \ndamages were quite rare. ``For example, the highest punitive damages \naward affirmed on appeal\n\n[[Page S12598]]\n\nin California through the 1950's was $10,000. But the punitive damage \nlandscape began to change dramatically in the 1960's. California's \nrecord for punitive damage awards affirmed on appeal soared to $15 \nmillion in the 1980's, an increase of 1,500 fold in just 30 years.'' In \nAlabama, according to Olson, an aggregate of only $409,000 in punitive \ndamages had been affirmed on appeal during the period 1974-1978. The \ncomparable total just 15 years later skyrocketed to $90 million.\n  Indeed, punitive damage lawyers have largely succeeded in taking over \nthe civil justice compensation system. In 1960, according to a Rand \nstudy, punitive damages accounted for just 2% of total damages in civil \ncases in San Francisco, California. Thirty years later, according to \nRand, punitive damages accounted for an amazing 59% of all damages in \nfinancial injury cases, and an even more amazing 80% in Alabama.\n  And the size of these awards is staggering and, I must add, \nirrational. Take the recent CSX Railroad case. Even though a federal \nprobe found the railroad blameless in a tank car explosion on CSX owned \ntracks which caused relatively minor harm to some 20 plaintiffs in \nLouisiana, a state jury awarded $2.3 million in compensatory and $2.5 \nbillion in punitive damages against CSX. Although the Louisiana Supreme \nCourt at least temporarily barred this irrational verdict--because \nunder Louisiana law no verdict for damages may be made until all the \nunderlying claims are decided--a far more common practice is for courts \nto halve or reduce the punitive portion of the award. Of course, half \nof $2.5 billion is still a staggering amount to pay for any private \nentity. From coffee spills at McDonald's to medical malpractice, in the \nwords of Morton Kondracke in a recent article in Roll Call, ``trial \nlawyers reap exorbitant profits by trolling for clients and convincing \njuries to sock it to supposedly deep-pocketed defendants. Consumers pay \nthe bill as companies pass on their massive insurance premiums through \nhigher prices.''\n\n  Indeed, the very efficiency of the American market has been weakened \nby these trends. Certainly, increased litigation and unnecessarily \nlarge punitive damage awards have increased the price of doing \nbusiness. Undoubtedly, these costs have been passed on to consumers and \nhave led to a decrease in productivity and a rise in unemployment. This \nis supported by a fairly recent study done by Representative and law \nprofessor Tom Campbell and other scholars, under the aegis of Stanford \nUniversity, which demonstrated that in jurisdictions that reform the \ncivil liability process--including placing caps on punitive damages--\nproductivity and employment rise.\n  Furthermore, untenable jury verdicts create what Rand calls a \n``shadow effect'' whereby verdicts totaling tens of billions of dollars \nsend signals as to what other juries might do. Thousands of cases are \nsettled, regardless of their merits, for fear of irrational verdicts. \nAs a result of the shadow effect, consumers nationwide have been \nadversely affected through the withdrawal of products, producers, \nservices, and service providers from the marketplace, and from \nexcessive liability costs passed on to consumers through higher prices.\n  But the worst cost to our society is the delegitimization of the \njudicial process as a means of dispute resolution. Litigation today is \noften seen as an unpredictable ``crap shoot,'' where awards are \nrendered--not upon justice--but upon envy (who has the ``deep \npockets'') or upon blatant emotionalism. So why not sue? Why not spin \nthe wheel? Passage of this bill will help to ameliorate this \nmisconception and restore faith in our civil justice system--which I \nbelieve is fundamentally sound.\n  Another reason for bipartisan support for this bill, one that I \nanticipate will attract many of our colleagues to the bill, is that we \nhave addressed specific concerns which the Administration has expressed \nabout previous bills. You may recall that last year when President \nClinton vetoed the products liability bill, he claimed that the bill \nwould protect drunk drivers and terrorists. Our bill will not apply to \nany case where the injury was caused by a person who was committing a \ncrime of violence, an act of terrorism, a hate crime, a felony sexual \noffense, or that occurred when the defendant was under the influence of \nalcohol or drugs. These exceptions, combined with the bill's \nqualification that excludes cases where an individual has suffered a \npermanent physical injury or impairment, will ensure that this bill \nwill not limit punitive damages in cases where such egregious conduct \nhas occurred or where a serious injury has been inflicted.\n  Finally, we have included in the bill a provision specifically \ndesigned to protect small businesses, which form the backbone of Utah's \nand our country's economy. Excessive, unpredictable, and often \narbitrary punitive damage awards jeopardize the financial well-being of \nmany individuals and companies, particularly the Nation's small \nbusinesses. Under this bill, if the claim for damages is against an \nindividual whose net worth is less than $500,000 or against a business \nwith less than 25 full-time employees, then punitive damages are \nlimited to the lesser of 3 times the economic loss or $250,000.\n  Establishing a rule of proportionality between the amount of punitive \ndamages awarded and the amount of economic damages would be fair to \nboth plaintiffs and defendants. In addition, we will take a step \ntowards resolving the constitutional objection, raised by the United \nStates Supreme Court last year in BMW of North America v. Gore, to \npunitive damages that are grossly excessive in relation to the harm \nsuffered.\n  Mr. President, we must restore rationality, certainty, and fairness \nto the award of punitive damages. This bill is an important step in \nthat direction. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation and encourage the Senate to act expeditiously on this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nbill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1554\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness in Punitive Damage \n     Awards Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) punitive damage awards in jury verdicts in financial \n     injury cases are a serious and growing problem, and according \n     to a Rand Institute for Civil Justice study in 1997 of \n     punitive damage verdicts from calendar years 1985 through \n     1994 in States that represent 25 percent of the United States \n     population--\n       (A) nearly 50 percent of all punitive damage awards are \n     made in financial injury cases (those in which the plaintiff \n     is alleging a financial injury only and is not alleging \n     injuries to either person or property);\n       (B) punitive damages are awarded in 1 in every 7 financial \n     injury verdicts overall and 1 in every 5 financial injury \n     cases in the State of California;\n       (C) between calendar years 1985 through 1989 and calendar \n     years 1990 through 1994, the average punitive damage verdict \n     in financial injury cases increased from $3,400,000 to \n     $7,600,000;\n       (D) between calendar years 1985 through 1989 and calendar \n     years 1990 through 1994, the award of such damages at the \n     90th percentile increased from $3,900,000 to $12,100,000;\n       (E) between calendar years 1985 through 1989 and calendar \n     years 1990 through 1994, the total amount of punitive damages \n     awarded increased from $1,200,000,000 to $2,300,000,000, for \n     a 10-year total of $3,500,000,000;\n       (F) punitive damages represent a very large percentage of \n     total damages awarded in all financial injury verdicts, \n     increasing from 44 percent to 59 percent during the period \n     analyzed; and\n       (G) in the State of Alabama, punitive damages represent 82 \n     percent of all damages awarded in financial injury cases;\n       (2)(A) punitive damage verdicts are only the tip of the \n     iceberg because only a small percentage of all complaints \n     filed (1.6 percent according to a Department of Justice study \n     in 1995) result in a jury verdict; and\n       (B) the Rand Institute of Civil Justice calls the impact of \n     these verdicts on settlements the ``shadow effect'' of \n     punitive damages;\n       (3) excessive, unpredictable, and often arbitrary punitive \n     damage awards have a direct and undesirable effect on \n     interstate commerce by increasing the cost and decreasing the \n     availability of goods and services;\n       (4) as a result of excessive, unpredictable, and often \n     arbitrary punitive damage awards, consumers have been \n     adversely affected through the withdrawal of products, \n     producers, services, and service providers from the \n     marketplace, and from excessive liability costs passed on to \n     consumers through higher prices;\n       (5) excessive, unpredictable, and often arbitrary punitive \n     damage awards jeopardize the financial well-being of many \n     individuals and companies, particularly the Nation's small \n     businesses, and adversely affect government and taxpayers;\n\n[[Page S12599]]\n\n       (6) individual State legislatures can create only a partial \n     remedy to address these problems because each State lacks the \n     power to control the imposition of punitive damages in other \n     States;\n       (7) it is the constitutional role of the national \n     Government to remove barriers to interstate commerce and to \n     protect due process rights;\n       (8) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and \n     fairness to the award of punitive damages in order to protect \n     against excessive, arbitrary, and uncertain awards;\n       (9) establishing a rule of proportionality, in cases that \n     primarily involve financial injury, between the amount of \n     punitive damages awarded and the amount of compensatory \n     damages, as 15 States have established, would--\n       (A) be fair to both plaintiffs and defendants; and\n       (B) address the constitutional objection of the United \n     States Supreme Court in BMW of North America v. Gore 116 S. \n     Ct. 1589 (1996) to punitive damages that are grossly \n     excessive in relation to the harm suffered; and\n       (10) permitting a maximum for each claimant recovery for \n     punitive damages of the greater of 3 times the amount of \n     economic loss or $250,000 is a balanced solution that would \n     reduce grossly excessive punitive damage awards by as much as \n     40 percent, according to the Rand Institute for Civil \n     Justice.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in Article \n     I, section 8, clause 3 and section 5 of the 14th amendment of \n     the United States Constitution, the purposes of this Act are \n     to--\n       (1) promote the free flow of goods and services and to \n     lessen burdens on interstate commerce; and\n       (2) uphold constitutionally protected due process rights by \n     placing reasonable limits on damages over and above the \n     actual damages suffered by a claimant.\n\n     SEC. 3.

APPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--\n       (1) Civil actions covered.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (b), this Act applies to any civil action brought \n     in any Federal or State court where such action affects \n     interstate commerce, charitable or religious activities, or \n     implicates rights or interests that may be protected by \n     Congress under section 5 of the 14th amendment of the United \n     States Constitution and where the claimant seeks to recover \n     punitive damages under any theory for harm that did not \n     result in death, serious and permanent physical scarring or \n     disfigurement, loss of a limb or organ, or serious and \n     permanent physical impairment of an important bodily \n     function. Punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by \n     applicable State law, be awarded against a person in such a \n     case only if the claimant establishes that the harm that is \n     the subject of the action was proximately caused by such \n     person. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable \n     State law, be awarded against a qualified charity only if the \n     claimant established by clear and convincing evidence that \n     the harm that is the subject of the action was proximately \n     caused by an intentionally tortious act of such qualified \n     charity.\n       (2) Question of law.--What constitutes death, serious and \n     permanent physical scarring or disfigurement, loss of a limb \n     or organ, or serious and permanent physical impairment of an \n     important bodily function shall be a question of law for the \n     court.\n       (b) Exceptions.--\n       (1) In general.--The provisions of this Act shall not apply \n     to any person in a civil action described in subsection \n     (a)(1) if the misconduct for which punitive damages are \n     awarded against that person--\n       (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n     defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) for \n     which the defendant has been convicted in any court;\n       (B) constitutes an act of terrorism for which the defendant \n     has been convicted in any court;\n       (C) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n     Hate Crime Statistics Act, Public Law 101-275; 104 Stat. 140; \n     28 U.S.C. 534 note) for which the defendant has been \n     convicted in any court;\n       (D) occurred at a time when the defendant was under the \n     influence (as determined pursuant to applicable State law) of \n     intoxicating alcohol or any drug that may not lawfully be \n     sold without a prescription and had been taken by the \n     defendant other than in accordance with the terms of a lawful \n     prescription; or\n       (E) constitutes a felony sexual offense, as defined by \n     applicable Federal or State law, for which the defendant has \n     been convicted in any court.\n       (2) Question of law.--The applicability of this subsection \n     shall be a question of law for determination by the court. \n     The liability of any other person in such an action shall be \n     determined in accordance with this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act applies to any civil action described in section 4 \n     that is commenced on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, without regard to whether the harm that is the subject \n     of the action or the conduct that caused the harm occurred \n     before such date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 1555. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nrestructure and reform the Internal Revenue Service, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  the internal revenue service oversight, restructuring and tax code \n                        elimination act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 1555, the \n``Internal Revenue Service Oversight, Restructuring and Tax Code \nElimination Act of 1997.'' This legislation establishes an oversight \nboard composed of private citizens to review the policies and practices \nof our nation's tax collection agency. The measure also eliminates the \nexisting tax code by December 31, 2000, and eliminates the Internal \nRevenue Service by the end of the Year 2000 fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, the American people have been telling this Congress \nthat all\n\n[[Page S12600]]\n\nis not right at the Internal Revenue Service, and it is time for the \nCongress to do something about it. Of course, no one enjoys paying \ntheir taxes, but the American people voluntarily comply with the tax \ncode to a degree that is the envy of governments around the world. They \ndo so because they want to do what is right. They deserve to be treated \nfairly, and they deserve a tax system that supports working families, \nnot one that punishes them.\n  This past September, the Senate Committee on Finance held hearings in \nwhich taxpayers described the many abuses they have suffered at the \nhands of the Internal Revenue Service. The general theme of those \nhearings was an agency which has become arrogant and unresponsive to \nthe American people, ruining businesses and causing considerable \nsuffering to the men and women who were unlucky enough to be the focus \nof IRS scrutiny. For most Americans, those hearings were an all too \nfamiliar reflection of a painful episode in their own lives.\n  Mr. President, something must be done about the Internal Revenue \nService and the massive Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Our tax code is \nincomprehensible to all but a few tax attorneys who make their living \noff of the current chaos created by our tax laws. What is worse, the \nagency charged with enforcing our tax laws has developed procedures to \ntarget their auditing efforts at middle class taxpayers.\n  The time has come to get rid of the I.R.S., get rid of our \nnightmarish tax code, and create an oversight board composed entirely \nof citizens from outside of the I.R.S. to keep watch over that agency \nuntil the date when it ceases to exist.\n  To carry out those objectives, I have introduced S. 1555, the \nInternal Revenue Service Oversight, Restructuring and Tax Code \nElimination Act of 1997. This legislation establishes an oversight \nboard composed of nine members, each of whom are from the private \nsector, and at least one of whom must be an owner or manager of a small \nbusiness. This oversight board will be responsible for reviewing the \npolicies and practices of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Among the specific areas the board will oversee are the agency's \nauditing procedures and collections practices, as well as the agency's \nprocurement policies for information technology. Procurement at the \nI.R.S. has resulted in outrageous waste and misuse of taxpayer funds, \nsuch as the decision to spend nearly $4 billion to develop a new \ncomputer system, which officials now concede has been a complete \nfailure.\n  Creating an oversight board to rein in the IRS is just the first \nstep. S. 1555 also calls for the tax code to be terminated as of \nDecember 31, 2000, with exceptions for Social Security and Railroad \nRetirement.\n\n  My bill sets out several guidelines for the structure of a new tax \ncode. The new code should apply a low rate to all Americans; require a \nsupermajority of both Houses of Congress to raise taxes; provide tax \nrelief for working Americans; protect the rights of taxpayers and \nreduce tax collection abuses; eliminate the bias against savings and \ninvestment; promote economic growth and job creation; encourage rather \nthan penalize marriage and families; protect the integrity of Social \nSecurity and Medicare; and provide for a taxpayer-friendly collections \nprocess to replace the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, it is time to get rid of the I.R.S. and the massive \nand incomprehensible tax code in favor of a fairer, simpler system. I \nfirmly believe that we will never be rid of our tax code until Congress \nsets out a specific deadline for its elimination. That is what my bill \ndoes. We should begin the national debate now over the form a new tax \ncode should take. I have laid out a series of guidelines in this \nlegislation for the new tax code. Without the current tax code, there \nis no need for the I.R.S., and it is my view that this agency is too \nentrenched in its bureaucratic ways to be reformed. It should simply be \neliminated. Until the I.R.S. is gone, an oversight board is badly \nneeded to protect the interests of the taxpayers, and act as a watchdog \nover this unaccountable agency. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1556. A bill to improve child nutrition programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  the child nutrition initiatives act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the nutrition \nsubcommittee, I want to make very clear that I am looking forward to \nworking with the chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee, Senator Lugar, with the ranking member, Senator Harkin, and \nwith the chairman of the nutrition subcommittee, Senator McConnell, on \nthe child nutrition reauthorization bill next year.\n\n  When I was chairman of that committee, and continuing under the helm \nof Senator Lugar, the Agriculture Committee worked together in a \nbipartisan fashion on nutrition legislation.\n  I am proud of all the members of that committee who over the years \nworked together on improving nutrition programs for children. I also \nhad the privilege of working with the former majority leader--Senator \nBob Dole--on many child nutrition matters.\n  The bill that I am introducing today does not represent my effort on \na reauthorization bill--I will work on that bill with members of the \ncommittee, including the three leadership Members mentioned above.\n  Rather, this bill indicates changes that should be enacted into law \nregardless of other actions the Congress might take regarding child \nnutrition reauthorization.\n  It includes child nutrition provisions that were included, with some \nmodifications, in the Senate-passed research bill--which passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent.\n  Over the recess I intend to consult with nutrition leaders in \nVermont, the Under Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, Shirley \nWatkins, Secretary Glickman, national nutrition advocates and local \nprogram directors to gather information for the reauthorization effort.\n  Also, I urge the President to include sufficient funding in his \nbudget proposals to fund this bill as well as other nutrition \ninitiatives which the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Food and \nConsumer Services are working to develop.\n  I must compliment Under Secretary Shirley Watkins for the great job \nshe has done so far. She has taken strong command of an agency that was \nadrift. Also, I continue to appreciate Secretary Dan Glickman's \nleadership role in the administration regarding nutrition programs and \nthe strong support of his chief of staff, Greg Frazier.\n  I note also that Senator Tim Johnson has introduced a school lunch \nprogram bill. I will carefully study that bill over the recess. I will \nalso look at the study conducted by the Minnesota Department of \nChildren, Families and Learning called Energizing the Classroom.\n  Over the years many Vermonters have provided me with outstanding \nadvice and guidance on child nutrition issues.\n  I intend to work with Jo Busha who heads the Child Nutrition Programs \nfor the Vermont Department of Education. She has done a remarkable job \nin promoting school-based nutrition programs and was recently commended \nby the Food Research and Action Center for her accomplishments. I was \nvery pleased to work with the committee on a bill that set up the \nschool breakfast startup grant program which has worked extremely well \nin Vermont. It provided thousands of dollars to Vermont schools to \ncover the one-time costs of setting up a breakfast program.\n  I look forward to receiving advice from Mary Carlson, president of \nthe National Association of Farmers' Markets Nutrition Programs, on the \nWIC-Farmer's Market Program known as the Farm-to-Family program in \nVermont.\n  This program has helped in greatly expanding the number of \nfarmers markets in Vermont and helped low-income families provide their \nchildren with healthy foods.\n\n  My bill would assure funding for this program and permit other States \nto participate in the program, or to increase their participation \nlevels.\n  The bill provides assured funding for programs like the Vermont \nCommon Roots program of Food Works, a nonprofit educational \norganization in Vermont which has been praised by educators and \nadministrators as an effective educational tool.\n\n[[Page S12601]]\n\n  Robert Dostis has done an outstanding job as the executive director \nof the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger. He also deserves a \ngreat deal of credit regarding the effort to get more schools on the \nschool breakfast program. He has recently written a ``Report on \nChildhood Hunger in Vermont: A Handbook for Action.''\n  He cites some startling statistics in this report. For example, he \nnotes that about 8,000 Vermont children are receiving food from local \nVermont food shelves--which is double the figure for 1990.\n  In addition, nearly 222,000 meals are being served yearly at two \ndozen community kitchens in Vermont--that is 21 percent more than in \n1994.\n  I will be also working with Donna Bister, as I have for years, on \nissues related to the WIC program and with Alison Gardner who is the \nPublic Health Nutrition Chief, for the Vermont Department of Health.\n  I want to extend a special thanks to Dr. Richard Narkewicz of Vermont \nwho is a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He \nrecently visited me with his grandson Corey.\n  Most of all I want to thank the hundreds of volunteers who run \nVermont's Food Shelves and Community Kitchens, and all of those helping \nout at Vermont's Community Action Agencies.\n  For many years I have watched the tremendous contributions made by \nthe Vermont FoodBank in the fight against hunger. They have been a \nfirst line of defense against child hunger in Vermont and I look \nforward to working with their director, Deborah Flateman.\n  All of these Vermonters, and hundreds more who I have not mentioned, \ncarry out the true Vermont tradition of extending a helping hand to \nneighbors in need.\n  My bill incorporates many ideas from Vermonters. I have often \ndesigned nutrition legislation based on ideas from State and local \nofficials from around the Nation.\n  Since this bill is not a full reauthorization bill--which I will \ncosponsor at a later date with other members of the Committee--I have \nnot automatically extended each expiration date in current law. I will \ncertainly support such extensions as appropriate at a later date and \nwill support many other improvements to the bill.\n  Section 101 is based on an idea provided to me by Joseph Keifer of \nthe Vermont Food Works program. It provides modest Federal funding to \nhelp integrate food and nutrition projects with elementary school \ncurricula for a few pilot tests of this provision.\n  Section 102 increases the reimbursement rates for the summer food \nservice program to a level that should encourage strong participation. \nAt the recommendation of the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger \nthe bill also provides special funding to help defray the costs of \ntransporting children to the food service locations. This additional \nfinancial support--of 75 cents per day for each child transported to \nand from school--is only applicable in very rural areas, as defined by \nUSDA.\n  Vermont child care sponsors strongly recommended that I support \nfunding for an additional meal supplement for children who are in \na child care center for 8 hours or more. Section 103 of the bill does \njust that and thus helps working parents.\n\n  The bill provides for the eligibility of additional schools for the \nafter school care meals program and expands funding for a program that \nprovides meals to homeless preschool children in emergency shelters.\n  Title II of the bill creates a grant program to assist schools and \nothers to establish or expand a school breakfast program, or a summer \nfood service program. $5 million, per year, in mandatory funding would \nbe made available for this effort.\n  The school breakfast start up program in Vermont, before it was \nterminated by Congress, was a remarkable success in part due to the \nhard work of Jo Busha, Bob Dostis, the Vermont School Food Service \nAssociation, and many others.\n  Also under Title II of the bill, the WIC Farmers' Market Program is \nprovided guaranteed funding. I have worked on this program for a number \nof years with Mary Carlson of Vermont. Mary is now the president of the \nassociation that represents State farmers' market nutrition programs \nsuch as the WIC Farmers' Market Program. Making this tremendous program \nmandatory will assure funding and avoid any appearance of being in \ncompetition with the WIC program for appropriated funds.\n  The bill also sets forth a sense of the Congress that the WIC program \nshould be fully funded, now and forever, for all eligible applicants \nnationwide. I know that reaching this goal has taken a long time. I \nappreciate all the help that Donna Bister, the Vermont WIC Director, \nand many other Vermonters, as well as Bread for the World at the \nnational level, have provided on the WIC program. David Beckmann and \nBarbara Howell of Bread for the World have worked for years toward this \ngoal.\n  Finally, I have heard from Alison Gardner about the problems she is \nhaving with funding for the Nutrition, Education and Training Program. \nCongress made that program mandatory but then changed its status back \nto a program subject to appropriations. My bill will provide $10 \nmillion a year for that program and provide a State minimum grant of \n$85,000 per year.\n  I want to emphasize again that my bill represents some important \nchild nutrition initiatives. I hope they will all be included in the \nreauthorization bill. I look forward to working with Senators Lugar, \nHarkin, McConnell and all the other members of the Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry Committee on this effort just as we worked \ntogether on the child nutrition provisions in the Senate-passed \nresearch bill.\n  I also look forward to working with all the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives Education and the Workforce Committee. I know they have \na keen interest in protecting children and I have enjoyed working in \nthe past with Chairman Goodling and with the ranking minority member \nMr. Bill Clay.\n  The last reauthorization bill passed both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives by unanimous consent. This shows how well the Congress \ncan work together when the interests of children are at stake.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 1556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to end the use of steel jaw leghold traps on animals \nin the United States; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 the steel jaw leghold trap act of 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators, Akaka, Feinstein, \nKerry, and I rise to introduce legislation to end the use of the steel \njaw leghold trap. I rise to draw this country's attention to the many \nliabilities of this outdated device and ask for my colleagues support \nin ending its use.\n  This important and timely issue now takes on added importance as the \nEuropean Union proposes to ban the importation of U.S. fur caught with \nthis class of trap. By ending the use of the leghold trap within our \nborders, we will effectively set a humane standard for trapping, as \nwell as protect the U.S. fur industry by keeping Europe's doors open to \nU.S. fur.\n  While this bill does not prohibit trapping, it does outlaw a \nparticularly savage method of trapping by prohibiting the import or \nexport of, and the interstate shipment of steel jaw leghold traps and \narticles of fur from animals caught in such traps.\n  The steel jaw leghold trap is a cruel and antiquated device for which \nmany alternatives exist. The American Veterinary Medical Association \nand the American Animal Hospital Association have condemned leghold \ntraps as inhumane and the majority of Americans oppose the use of this \nclass of trap. Currently, 89 nations have banned these cruel devices, \nand have done so with broad-based public support. In addition, Colorado \nand Massachusetts have joined Rhode Island, Florida and my home State \nof New Jersey in banning the trap.\n  One quarter of all U.S. fur exports, $44 million, go to the European \nmarket. Of this $44 million, $21 million would be eliminated by the \nban. This would clearly cause considerable economic damage to the U.S. \nfur industry, an important source of employment for many Americans. \nSince many Americans rely on trapping for their livelihood, it is \nimperative to find a solution which prevents the considerable damage \nthat this ban would cause to our fur industry. It is important to note \nthat since the steel-jaw leghold trap has been banned in Europe, \nalternatives have been provided to protect and maintain the European \nfur industry.\n  Our Nation would be far better served by ending the use of the \narchaic and inhumane steel jaw leghold trap. By doing so, we are not \nonly setting a long-overdue humane standard for trapping, we are \nensuring that the European market remains open to all American fur \nexports.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1557\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to end the needless \n     maiming and suffering inflicted upon animals through the use \n     of steel jaw leghold traps by prohibiting the import or \n     export of, and the shipment in interstate commerce of, such \n     traps and of articles of fur from animals that were trapped \n     in such traps.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates with respect to shadow mask steel; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n THE SHADOW MASK STEEL HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE AMENDMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States with respect \nto shadow mask steel. Shadow mask steel, a vital component of color \ntelevision picture tubes and computer video monitors, is used to \nproduce ``shadow masks'' which prevent image distortion on the viewing \nscreens of televisions and computer video monitors. Unfortunately, \nneither shadow mask steel, nor any viable substitute, is produced \nwithin the United States. Therefore, United States shadow mask \nproducers must import this product from steel producers in Japan and \nGermany.\n  Domestic shadow mask production faces a difficult challenge to stay \ncompetitive in today's shadow mask market. Competition from foreign \nshadow masks is increasing as foreign manufacturers aggressively pursue \nthe U.S. market. In addition, color picture tube and computer video \nmonitor manufacturers are increasing their efforts to reduce production \ncosts due to increased competition in the television and computer \nmarkets.\n  These factors reinforce the vital need for competitively-priced \ncomponent materials, such as shadow masks. Eliminating the duty on \nshadow mask steel, a product that is already subject to a gradual \ntariff elimination schedule, would be an important step toward enabling \ndomestic manufacturers to remain competitive in the global market.\n  Major U.S. television picture tube and computer video monitor \nmanufacturers that employ thousands of workers throughout the United \nStates rely on a consistent supply of domestically-produced shadow \nmasks. If such companies were unable to count on such a supply, we run \nthe risk of supplanting domestic production of this product with \nimported shadow masks from foreign competitors, resulting in higher \ncosts and delivery uncertainties associated with purchasing shadow mask \nimports.\n  Such increased costs and uncertainty would certainly result in \nreduced competitiveness of U.S. television picture tube and computer \nvideo monitor manufacturers vis--vis foreign manufacturers. Reduced \ncompetitiveness could lead to the transfer of existing U.S. \nmanufacturing operations abroad, and/or the closing of U.S. facilities, \nresulting in the loss of thousands of actual and potential U.S. jobs in \nthe television and computer manufacturing industries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 1560. A bill to require the Federal banking agencies to make \ncertain certifications to Congress regarding new accounting standards \nfor derivatives before they become effective; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n      the accurate accounting standards certification act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, several times during this session, the \nSecurities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee has held \nhearings on the issue of the Financial Accounting Standards Board \n(FASB) accounting standards for derivatives and other instruments.\n\n  The hearings have demonstrated that there is great concern in the \nbanking industry, and virtually every industry, about the FASB \nstandards as they are presently written.\n  In particular, there are concerns that the FASB will finalize these \nstandards\n\n[[Page S12605]]\n\nby the end of this year, without re-exposing its draft for further \npublic comment. FASB has received hundreds of comment letters \nexpressing concern about the new standards. Yet, the comments appear to \ngo unheeded. In particular, there is concern in the banking industry \nthat the standards are not taking into account the unique nature of \nbanks. Even Alan Greenspan has taken the unusual step of expressing his \nconcern to the FASB.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors said in his \nletter that ``FASB's planned approach would not improve the financial \nreporting of derivatives activities and would constrain prudent risk \nmanagement practices.''\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of Generally Accepted \nAccounting Princples. I strongly believe that these standards should be \nset by the private sector. I am concerned, however, that the FASB, a \nprivate organization, is working too closely with the SEC, and \ntherefore, is ignoring the concerns raised by bank regulators. In \neffect, this is not so much a dispute of a private body defying the \nwishes of an industry--but it is a dispute between two parts of our \nGovernment over how best to proceed on accounting for risk on the \nbalance sheet. The FASB appears to be ignoring the concerns of the bank \nregulators, and by doing so, needlessly complicating disclosure to \ninvestors. Investors and analysts right now are fully capable of \nreviewing the balance sheets of depository institutions and determining \nwho is well run and who is not.\n  The Securities Subcommittee issued a report this year in which it \nstated that ``by focusing on derivatives risk exposure in isolation \nfrom the risk faced by companies, (the FASB proposals) are prone to \npresent investors a distorted and misleading picture of company \nconditions and activities.''\n  In my view, the new standards will throw a wrench into the present \naccounting rules that will only serve to confuse investors. It is \nhighly ironic that financial institutions, the principal users of \naccounting information in order to make credit decisions, find the new \nstandards confusing and cumbersome.\n  For this reason I feel compelled to introduce legislation that would \nprovide the banking regulatory agencies with the authority to reject \nthe standards if they find that the new standards will not accurately \nreflect assets, liabilities and earnings. Further, the regulators could \nrefuse to adopt the standards if the new rules would serve to diminish \nthe use of the risk management techniques, thus, actually reducing \nsafety and soundness in the operation of an insured depository \ninstitution.\n  I think this is an appropriate solution to this problem. I have great \nfaith that the banking regulators, the primary users of financial \ninformation from banks, can make the best determination if these \nstandards are appropriate. Thank you Mr. President.\n       By Mr. WARNER:\n       S. 1561. A bill to reform the conduct of Federal elections; \n     to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n        THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND EFFECTIVE REFORM OF CAMPAIGNS ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Constitutional and \nEffective Reform of Campaigns Act, or ``CERCA''. This legislation is \nthe product of 2 years of hearings in the Rules Committee, discussions \nwith numerous experts, party officials, and candidates, and nearly two \ndecades of participating in campaigns and campaign finance debates in \nthe Senate. Many of the proposals in this bill have been made in some \nform by several of my Senate colleagues and by Members of the House, \nand I readily acknowledge drawing on their expertise. Most \nparticularly, the important discussions during the meetings of this \nyear's task force headed by Senator Nickles, at the request of Majority \nLeader Lott, were invaluable.\n  This legislation offers an opportunity for bipartisan support. It is \na good faith effort to strike a middle ground between those who believe \npublic financing of campaigns is the solution, and those who believe \nthe solution is to remove current regulations. It offers a package of \nproposals which realistically can be achieved with bipartisan support \nand meet the desire of the majority of Americans who believe that our \npresent system can be reformed. In my judgment, we will not succeed \nwith any measure of campaign reform in this complicated field without a \nbipartisan consensus.\n  In drafting this legislation, I began with four premises. First, all \nprovisions had to be consistent with the First Amendment: Congress \nwould be acting in bad faith to adopt provisions which have a \nlikelihood of being struck down by the federal courts. Second, I oppose \npublic financing and mandating ``free'' or reduced-cost media time \nwhich in my mind is neither free nor a good policy idea. Why should \nseekers of federal office get free time, while candidates for state \noffice or local office--from governors to local sheriffs--do not \nreceive comparable free benefits? Such an inequity and imbalance will \nbreed friction between federal and state office seekers. Third, I \nbelieve we should try to increase the role of citizens and the \npolitical parties. Fourth, any framework of campaign reform legislation \nmust respect and protect the constitutional right of individuals, \ngroups, and organizations to participate in advocacy concerning \npolitical issues.\n  This bill is designed to be a ``bilateral disarmament'' on the tough \nissues of soft money and union dues: each side must give up equivalent \nground. The Republicans should give ground by placing a cap on soft \nmoney which has tended to favor our side. And Democrats should give \nground by allowing union members to decide voluntarily for themselves \nwhether to contribute the portion of dues which goes to political \ncontributions or activities.\n  Specifically, on the issue of soft money, no reform can be considered \ntrue reform without placing limits on the corporate and union donations \nto the national political parties. This bill places a $100,000 cap on \nsuch donations. While this provision addresses the public's legitimate \nconcern over the propriety of these large donations, it allows the \npolitical parties sufficient funds to maintain their headquarters and \nconduct their grassroots efforts. In addition, the current limits on \n``hard'' contributions must be updated. The ability of citizens to \ncontribute voluntarily to a wide range of candidates and to their \nparties is fundamental.\n  At the same time, the practice of mandatory union dues going to \npartisan politics without union members' consent must end: it is \ncounter to all the political freedoms that make America a true \ndemocracy. The concept of ``paycheck protection'' must be included in \nany campaign finance reform, so that these deductions are voluntary, \nwhether these dues fund direct contributions to candidates or parties, \nor pay for undisclosed spending on phone banks, get-out-the-vote \nefforts, literature, and television ads.\n  Under this legislation, unions would be required to obtain advance, \nwritten consent before deducting money for political activities from \nunion members' paychecks. The present state of the law requires most \nunion workers to give up their rights to participate in the union if \nthey seek refunds of that portion of dues going to politics. In \naddition, this section would strengthen the reporting requirements for \nunions engaged in political activities and enhance an aggrieved union \nmember's right to challenge a union's determination of the portion of \ndues going to political activities.\n  In the Senate debates thus far, there has been much discussion about \nwhether corporations should be required to obtain shareholder approval \nto make political contributions. This is an issue which warrants \nconsideration. My proposal not only limits these corporate and union \ncontributions to $100,000, it also includes a requirement that \ncompanies disclose their donations to federal political parties in \ntheir annual reports. And under current policies of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, shareholders have the same rights to make \nrecommendations to boards of directors on the propriety of political \ndonations as they do on any business issue related to the company.\n  In addition, the SEC is in the process of making it easier for \nshareholders to raise questions related to social policy matters at \nannual meetings. I am monitoring how these changes are implemented: if \nthey are insufficient to guarantee adequate rights to shareholders, I \nwill consider amending my bill to protect these rights.\n  As an aside, I reject the notion that the status of union members is \nsimilar to those who belong to groups such as the National Rifle \nAssociation or the\n\n[[Page S12606]]\n\nSierra Club. Nobody is compelled to join these types of organizations, \nand those that do, know or should know that their dues are going in \npart to political causes.\n  Furthermore, I considered including in this bill a narrowly-tailored \ndisclosure requirement for individuals and groups spending large sums \non public advertising affecting the public image of candidates during \nelection seasons. However, in keeping with my first basic premise that \nreforms must pass the federal court test of constitutionality, I \nconcluded that such a provision, in view of a long line of Supreme \nCourt cases, likely would be declared unconstitutional, and thus I did \nnot include the provision.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill was thoroughly debated in the Senate, and \nany objective observor of the Senate would agree that we are genuinely \ndeadlocked. This body needs to move beyond the debate of McCain-\nFeingold. I hope that all Members will review my bill as an objective \nand pragmatic approach to current problems with our campaign system. I \nencourage other Members to come forward, as I have, with proposals \nwhich objectively represent pragmatic approaches to what can be \nachieved. I do not claim to have the only solution: those with other \nideas should come forward.\n  In addition to the issues of soft money and union dues discussed \nabove, nine other fundamental problems--all of which can be solved in a \nconstitutional manner--are the most pressing. Here are these problems, \nin no particular order, and my proposed solutions:\n  Problem 1: Politicians spend too much time fundraising, at the \nexpense of their legislative duties for incumbents, and, for both \nincumbents and challengers, at the expense of debating the issues with \nvoters.\n  Solution: The current individual contribution limit of $1,000 has not \nbeen raised, or even indexed for inflation, for over 20 years. This \nfact requires that candidates must spend more and more time seeking \nmore and more donors. The limit should be doubled, as well as indexed \nfor inflation.\n  Problem 2: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished \nby the activities of political action committees and interest groups.\n  Solutions: I propose a $100 tax credit for contributions made by \ncitizens, with incomes under specified levels, to Senate and House \ncandidates in their states: this credit should spark an influx of small \ndollar contributions to balance the greater ability of citizens with \nhigher incomes to participate.\n  In addition, the increased individual contribution limit should \nbalance the activities of political action committees.\n  Problem 3: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished \nby contributions from those not eligible to vote.\n  Solution: If you are not eligible to vote, you should not contribute \nto campaigns. My bill would prohibit contributions by those ineligible \nto vote, including non-citizens, children, and persons under felony \nconvictions. It also codifies current regulations concerning political \ndonations by domestic subsidiaries of foreign companies.\n  Problem 4: Compared to incumbents, challengers face greater \ndifficulties raising funds and communicating with voters, particularly \nat the outset of a campaign.\n  Solutions: This legislation will allow candidates to receive ``seed \nmoney'' contributions of up to $10,000 from individuals and political \naction committees. This provision should help get candidacies off the \nground. The total amount of these ``seed money'' contributions could \nnot exceed $100,000 for House candidates or $300,000 for Senate \ncandidates. To meet the constitutional test, this provision would apply \nto both challengers and incumbents alike, but in the case of an \nincumbent with money carried over from a prior cycle, those funds would \ncount against the seed money limit.\n  Second, Senate incumbents would be barred from using the franking \nprivilege to send out mass mailings during the election year, rather \nthan the sixty day ban in current law.\n  Problem 5: Candidates with personal wealth have a distinct advantage \nthrough their constitutional right to spend their own funds.\n  Solution: If a candidate spends more than $25,000 of his or her own \nmoney, the individual contribution limits would be raised to $10,000 so \nthat candidates could raise money to counter that personal spending. \nAgain, to meet constitutional review, this provision would apply to all \ncandidates.\n  Problem 6: Current laws prohibiting fundraising activities on federal \nproperty are weak and insufficient.\n  Solution: The current ban on fundraising on federal property was \nwritten before the law created such terms as ``hard'' and ``soft'' \nmoney. This bill updates this law to require that no fundraising take \nplace on federal property.\n  Problem 7: Reporting requirements and public access to disclosure \nstatements are weak and inadequate.\n  Solutions: Under this proposal, the FEC would be required to post \nreports on the Internet for all to see, and to require that candidates, \nand groups making independent expenditures, make faster and more \ncomplete reports. In addition, registered lobbyists would be required \nto report their campaign contributions and those of their employer on \ntheir lobbyist disclosure reports.\n  Problem 8: The Federal Election Commission is in need of procedural \nand substantive reform.\n  Solutions: This legislation contains a number of procedural and \nsubstantive reforms of the FEC, including term limits for \ncommissioners, and increases in penalties for serious violations.\n  Problem 9: The safeguards designed to protect the integrity of our \nelections are compromised by weak aspects of federal laws regulating \nvoter registration and voting.\n  Solutions: The investigations of contested elections in Louisiana and \nCalifornia have shown significant weaknesses in federal laws designed \nto safeguard the registration and voting processes. The requirement \nthat states allow registration by mail has undermined confidence that \nonly qualified voters are registering to vote and only registering \nonce: states should be allowed to decide whether to allow mail-in \nregistrations. In addition, states should be allowed to require proof \nof citizenship when registering and proof of identification when \nvoting: we require a photo ID to buy beer or cigarettes and can \ncertainly allow states to protect the voting process by requiring a \nphoto ID. Lastly, this bill would allow states to purge inactive voters \nand to allow state law to govern whether voters who move without \nreregistering should be allowed to vote.\n  These are the problems which I believe can be solved in a bipartisan \nfashion. Attached to this statement is a section by section review of \nthe legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nmeaningful campaign reform, by looking at reform beyond the usual \nsoundbites and addressing the real problems with our present system of \ncampaigns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nsummary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Constitutional and Effective Reform of Campaigns Act--Section-by-\n                                Section\n\n\n              title i--enhancement of citizen involvement\n\n       Section 101.--Prohibits those ineligible to vote (non-\n     citizens, minors, felons) from making contributions (``hard \n     money'') or donations (``soft money'').

A bill to authorize an exchange of land between the \nSecretary of Agriculture and Secretary of the Interior and Big Sky \nLumber Co; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        THE GALLATIN RANGE CONSOLIDATION COMPLETION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation for Montana. This bill is titled ``the Gallatin \nRange Consolidation Completion Act of 1997.''\n  Mr. President, this legislation is similar to a bill introduced \nearlier today by my colleague from Montana. While I am glad he has at \nlast staked out a public position in favor of this exchange, I believe \nhis approach is too little, too early. So I am introducing a bill which \nmore accurately reflects where discussions on this exchange have \nprogressed since Senator Burns' earlier involvement.\n  Completing the Gallatin Land Exchange is a top priority for me. The \nland considered in this legislation is key wildlife habitat and is \namong some of the most beautiful anywhere. When completed, this \nexchange will result in improved habitat and will improve recreation \nopportunities in the region. But, as with many land exchanges this will \nnot be a simple process.\n  The company involved, Big Sky Lumber has been pursuing this matter \nfor nearly 4 years. The Forest Service has collected public comment and \nhas worked to see that concerns of all parties affected, the recreation \ninterests, conservation groups, homeowners, and the business owners are \nall addressed. I have been working with these groups drafting \nlegislation with the help of the Forest Service.\n  I was surprised that Senator Burns introduced a draft bill today \nwithout notice. Contrary to an agreement among the State's \ncongressional delegation that no bill be introduced until we reached \nagreement among ourselves and with other interested groups. The bill I \nam introducing today is an updated version of the earlier draft I gave \nto Senator Burns for his review. I look forward to working with Senator \nBurns and all interested parties to get this process back on track so \nthat we can pass a fair and balanced bill soon after we convene the \nnext session of Congress.\n  Over the next 2 months, my staff and I will be meeting with people \nabout this exchange. My goal is to prepare a consensus bill that can be \nintroduced by the entire Montana delegation when Congress convenes come \nJanuary. Soon after the introduction of that consensus bill, I will \nhold public hearings in the state to hear what people think about our \nefforts. I am hopeful that in the future the entire Montana delegation \nwill work together to protect the Taylor Fork and other important \nMontana lands in the Gallatin.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gallatin Land Consolidation \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the land north of Yellowstone National Park possesses \n     outstanding natural characteristics and wildlife habitats \n     that would make the land a highly valuable addition to the \n     National Forest System;\n       (2) it is in the interest of the United States for the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to enter into an Option Agreement \n     for the acquisition of land owned by Big Sky Lumber Co.; and\n       (3) it is in the interest of the United States to--\n       (A) establish a logical and effective ownership pattern for \n     the Gallatin National Forest, substantially reducing long-\n     term costs for taxpayers; and\n       (B) consolidate the Gallatin National Forest in a manner \n     that will enable the public to have access to and enjoy the \n     many recreational uses of the land.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nestablish a 24-month pilot program permitting certain aliens to be \nadmitted into the United States to provide temporary or seasonal \nagricultural services pursuant to a labor condition attestation; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             THE TEMPORARY AGRICULTURAL WORKER ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nTemporary Agricultural Worker Act of 1997. I am joined by Senators \nCraig, Gorton, and Roberts. Our bill would create a streamlined guest \nworker pilot program which would allow for a reliable supply of legal, \ntemporary, agricultural immigrant workers.\n  Mr. President, we are facing a crisis in agriculture--a crisis born \nof an inadequate labor supply, bureaucratic red tape, and burdensome \nregulations. For many years, farmers and nurserymen\n\n[[Page S12609]]\n\nhave struggled to hire enough legal agricultural labor to harvest their \nproduce and plants. This issue is not new to Congress. In the past, \nCongress has introduced legislation to address this urgency, but no \nworkable solution has been implemented. The agriculture industry cannot \nsurvive without a reliable and legal supply of agricultural workers. \nThe labor pool is tight and shortages are developing because of the \nlimited domestic workers willing to work in agricultural fields.\n  The United States has historically been faced with a need to \nsupplement the domestic work force, especially during peak harvesting \nperiods. Since domestic workers prefer the security of full-time \nemployment in year-round agriculture-related jobs, the shorter term \nseasonal jobs are often left unfilled by domestic workers. These \ndomestic workers also prefer the working conditions involved in packing \nand processing jobs, which are generally performed indoors and do not \ninvolve the degree of strenuous physical labor associated with field \nwork.\n  Labor intensive agriculture is one of the most rapidly growing areas \nof agricultural production in this country. Its growth not only creates \nmany production and harvest jobs, but also creates many more jobs \noutside of agriculture. Approximately three off-farm jobs are directly \ndependent upon each on-farm job.\n  Currently, the H-2A program is the only legal temporary foreign \nagricultural worker program in the United States. This program is not \npracticable for the agriculture and horticulture industry because it is \nloaded with burdensome regulations, excessive paperwork, a bureaucratic \ncertification process, untimely and inconsistent decision-making by the \nU.S. Department of Labor, and costly housing requirements. The H-2A \nprogram has also been very small in relation to the total number of \nU.S. farm workers. It is estimated that out of the 2.5 million farm \nworkers in the United States, only 23,496 H-2A job certifications have \nbeen issued by the Department of Labor this year. In my State of \nOregon, only 12 sheepshearers and 62 sheepherders are currently using \nthe H-2A program.\n  It is time we address the shortfalls of current policy, and I believe \nthat our bill is a meaningful step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today would not replace or \ninterfere with the current H-2A program, but would supplement the H-2A \nprogram with a two-year pilot program that examines an alternative \napproach to recruiting agricultural workers. The pilot program will be \nlimited to 25,000 participants per fiscal year and would protect the \ndomestic workers' rights and living standards.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly summarize the provisions of our bill.\n  The bill would establish a procedure by which an agricultural \nemployer anticipating a shortage of temporary or seasonal agricultural \nworkers may file a labor condition statement, or attestation, with the \nstate employment security agency. The attestation would provide \nspecified terms and conditions of employment in the occupation in which \na shortage is anticipated. Employers would also be required to file a \njob order with the local job service and give preference to all \nqualified U.S. domestic workers.\n  The Department of Labor would enforce compliance with the labor \ncondition requirements of the program and could impose back pay, civil \nmonetary penalties, and debarment from the program for violators.\n  The alien guest workers are issued an identification card, which is \ncounterfeit- and tamper-resistant, with biometric identifiers to assure \nprogram integrity.\n  A portion of the alien guest workers' earnings would be paid into an \ninterest-bearing trust fund that would be rebated to the workers upon \nevidence of timely return to their home country. This would ensure that \nthe aliens return to their countries of origin after the temporary job \nis completed.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Oceans Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.\n\n        (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Covering more than two-thirds of the Earth's surface, \n     the oceans and Great Lakes play a critical role in the global \n     water cycle and in regulating climate, sustain a large part \n     of Earth's biodiversity, provide an important source of food \n     and a wealth of other natural products, act as a frontier to \n     scientific exploration, are critical to national security, \n     and provide a vital means of transportation. The coasts, \n     transition between land and open ocean, are regions of \n     remarkably high biological productivity, contribute more than \n     30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, and are of \n     considerable importance for recreation, waste disposal, and \n     mineral exploration.\n        (2) Ocean and coastal resources are susceptible to change \n     as a direct and indirect result of human activities, and such \n     changes can significantly impact the ability of the oceans \n     and Great Lakes to provide the benefits upon which the Nation \n     depends. Changes in ocean and coastal processes could affect \n     global climate patterns, marine productivity and \n     biodiversity, environmental quality, national security, \n     economic competitiveness, availability of energy, \n     vulnerability to natural hazards, and transportation safety \n     and efficiency.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are not infinite, and human \n     pressure on them is increasing. One half of the Nation's \n     population lives within 50 miles of the coast, ocean and \n     coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are now \n     threatened with depletion, and if population trends continue \n     as expected, pressure on and conflicting demands for ocean \n     and coastal resources will increase further as will \n     vulnerability to coastal hazards.\n       (4) Marine transportation is key to United States \n     participation in the global economy and to the wide range of \n     activities carried out in ocean and coastal regions. Inland \n     waterway and ports are the link between marine activities in \n     ocean and coastal regions and the supporting transportation \n     infrastructure ashore. International trade is expected to \n     triple by 2020. The increase has the potential to outgrow--\n       (A) the capabilities of the marine transportation system to \n     ensure safety; and\n       (B) the existing capacity of ports and waterways.\n       (5) Marine technologies hold tremendous promise for \n     expanding the range and increasing the utility of products \n     from the oceans and Great Lakes, improving the stewardship of \n     ocean and coastal resources, and contributing to business and \n     manufacturing innovations and the creation of new jobs.\n       (6) Research has uncovered the link between oceanic and \n     atmospheric processes and improved understanding of world \n     climate patterns and forecasts. Important new advances, \n     including availability of military technology, have made \n     feasible the exploration of large areas of the ocean which \n     were inaccessible several years ago. In designating 1998 as \n     ``The Year of the Ocean'', the United Nations highlights the \n     value of increasing our knowledge of the oceans.\n       (7) It has been 30 years since the Commission on Marine \n     Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the Stratton \n     Commission) conducted a comprehensive examination of\n\n[[Page S12626]]\n\n     ocean and coastal activities that led to enactment of major \n     legislation and the establishment of key oceanic and \n     atmospheric institutions.\n       (8) A review of existing activities is essential to respond \n     to the changes that have occurred over the past three decades \n     and to develop an effective new policy for the twenty-first \n     century to conserve and use, in a sustainable manner, ocean \n     and coastal resources, protect the marine environment, \n     explore ocean frontiers, protect human safety, and create \n     marine technologies and economic opportunities.\n       (9) Changes in United States laws and policies since the \n     Stratton Commission, such as the enactment of the Coastal \n     Zone Management Act, have increased the role of the States in \n     the management of ocean and coastal resources.\n       (10) While significant Federal and State ocean and coastal \n     programs are underway, those Federal programs would benefit \n     from a coherent national ocean and coastal policy that \n     reflects the need for cost-effective allocation of fiscal \n     resources, improved interagency coordination, and \n     strengthened partnerships with State, private, and \n     international entities engaged in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (b) Purpose and Objectives.--The purpose of this Act is to \n     develop and maintain, consistent with the obligations of the \n     United States under international law, a coordinated, \n     comprehensive, and long-range national policy with respect to \n     ocean and coastal activities that will assist the Nation in \n     meeting the following objectives:\n       (1) The protection of life and property against natural and \n     manmade hazards.\n       (2) Responsible stewardship, including use, of fishery \n     resources and other ocean and coastal resources.\n       (3) The protection of the marine environment and prevention \n     of marine pollution.\n       (4) The enhancement of marine-related commerce and \n     transportation, the resolution of conflicts among users of \n     the marine environment, and the engagement of the private \n     sector in innovative approaches for sustainable use of marine \n     resources.\n       (5) The expansion of human knowledge of the marine \n     environment including the role of the oceans in climate and \n     global environmental change and the advancement of education \n     and training in fields related to ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (6) The continued investment in and development and \n     improvement of the capabilities, performance, use, and \n     efficiency of technologies for use in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (7) Close cooperation among all government agencies and \n     departments to ensure--\n       (A) coherent regulation of ocean and coastal activities;\n       (B) availability and appropriate allocation of Federal \n     funding, personnel, facilities, and equipment for such \n     activities; and\n       (C) cost-effective and efficient operation of Federal \n     departments, agencies, and programs involved in ocean and \n     coastal activities.\n       (8) The enhancement of partnerships with State and local \n     governments with respect to oceans and coastal activities, \n     including the management of ocean and coastal resources and \n     identification of appropriate opportunities for policy-making \n     and decision-making at the State and local level.\n       (9) The preservation of the role of the United States as a \n     leader in ocean and coastal activities, and, when it is in \n     the national interest, the cooperation by the United States \n     with other nations and international organizations in ocean \n     and coastal activities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay deep respect and \ntribute to the men and women of the United States who have made \nsignificant sacrifices in the defense of the freedoms and democratic \nprinciples upon which our country was founded and to which we pledge \nour allegiance today. For every American, Veterans Day holds a special \nmeaning because it is a time to remember those veterans who have died, \nthank those who are living, and reflect on the honorable contributions \nthat each has made to our country. People of all ages and backgrounds \nmarched in parades across the United States on November 11 honoring \nveterans whom often they have never met, nor seen, nor heard about--and \nwho too often have received little or no recognition for their \nunwavering devotion to our country.\n  As a veteran of the Vietnam war, I share a memory with many others \nwho have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and ascribe a special meaning \nto this day. We remember the faces of those who served with us and the \nexperiences of those who served beside us. History will remember the \ncause, but we will remember the people.\n  I am proud to have served my country and feel blessed that I was \nlucky enough to return to my family and friends. To those brave men and \nwomen who gave their lives for our country or who have survived but \npaid in human suffering, we collectively owe a great debt and \nappropriate recognition and respect. We must never forget their \nservice, or their sacrifice, nor must we forget their \nsignificance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12628-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HELP FOR LOCALITIES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, one of the final items to be \napproved by the Senate for inclusion in the fiscal year 1998 Senate \nInterior appropriations bill was my amendment to raise the level of \nfunding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, or PILT. I want to \nthank the Interior appropriations chairman, Senator Gorton, for his \nassistance and consideration of this important amendment. I also wish \nto thank my cosponsors, Senators Levin, Hatch, Campbell, Smith, and \nDominici. In particular, I am most appreciative of Senator Levin, his \nhard work and cooperation in securing the support of the subcommittee's \nranking member was crucial.\n  Every year, Mr. President, the Federal Government increases the \nacreage it owns, particularly in the form of national parks. This \nprovides increased opportunities for Americans to enjoy the great \noutdoors. At the same time, however, it also increases costs for law \nenforcement, search and rescue and fire departments for literally \nthousands of small towns throughout our Nation.\n  Federal land purchases often permanently remove a critical source of \nincome from local communities. PILT payments, or ``Payments in Lieu of \nTaxes,'' are made to counties and local communities which contain \ncertain federally owned lands that cannot be taxed or, in many cases, \ndeveloped by the local governments. PILT moneys are often the only \nmeans that counties have to pay for police protection and garbage \ncollection and storage as well as funding for one time capital \ninvestments for new schools, hospitals, and jails. They also are vital \nfor offsetting costs incurred by counties for services provided users \nof public lands.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, and despite the very real benefits \nlocal communities provide, every year more Federal lands are taken off \nof county tax rolls, while PILT payments remain stagnant and well below \nthe level authorized by Congress.\n  That is why my colleagues and I took action to reverse this trend, \nand why I am so pleased that the Senate has agreed to raise PILT \npayments to $124 million. I believe this increase has significance \nbeyond the amount approved because it demonstrates that the Congress is \nbeginning to understand the dilemma faced by a significant number of \nour localities, struggling as they are with increasing costs and a \nshrinking tax base.\n  During the conference of the House and Senate, Members agreed to a \ncompromise funding level of $20 million. I suspect that the increased \nSenate amount was partially responsible for the conferees agreeing to \nan amount $7 million above the House level. These extra funds will \nprovide crucial help to local communities strapped for funds as they \nseek to tend to their own citizens' needs. It has been a long time \ncoming and I applaud the Senate for agreeing to support this critical \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12628-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12628-S12629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFIRMATION OF RODNEY W.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate 11 \norganizations, companies, and municipalities in my home State of \nConnecticut for being named to the honor roll of the Women's Bureau of \nthe U.S. Department of Labor. This honor roll recognizes entities \nacross the country that have made a commitment to working women and to \na family-friendly workplace. Most Americans go to work each day worried \nabout their health care, affordable and reliable child care, living \nwages, and job protection in times of family crisis. These \norganizations are trying to help alleviate some of these worries and \nshould be applauded for their efforts.\n  The 11 honorees from Connecticut are: Aetna Inc., the city of New \nBritain, the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, DCC/The \nDependent Care Connection Inc., the Entrepreneurial Center at Hartford \nCollege for Women, GTE Service Corp., ITT Hartford, Phoenix Home Life \nMutual Insurance Co., United Illuminating Co., United Technologies \nCorp., and the Urban League of southwestern Connecticut.\n  These entities are helping working women to achieve better pay and \nbenefits, to strike a better balance of work and family \nresponsibilities, and to gain more respect and opportunity on the job. \nFor example, flexible work schedules and interactive retirement \nplanning software allow more women to pick up a sick child from school \nor help plan for their and their families' financial future. Other \nprograms instituted by these family-friendly Connecticut organizations \ninclude discounted on-site day care, at-home offices, extensive \nprenatal care, and seminars to assist families with college planning.\n  The American work force is changing. When The Department of Labor \nWomen's Bureau was created by Congress in 1920, there were only 8.25 \nmillion working women--less than 20 percent of our Nation's work force. \nToday, nearly 60 million women work for pay --almost 50 percent of our \nNation's work force. Not only are more women working, but more women \nmust work to make ends meet for their families. America's work force \nand families are facing new challenges and it is organizations like \nthese 11 that deserve to be applauded for making innovative and \nconstructive efforts to make their workplaces more family-friendly.\n  As we applaud these honor roll members we must also remember that \nthere are challenges that still need to be addressed in our changing \nworkplace. By and large, American working women still have difficulty \nfinding affordable child care, paid sick leave, and unpaid family leave \nduring an extended family crisis. And let us not forget that women \ncontinue to face discrimination in hiring and promotion, as well as \nunderpayment in comparisons to men with the same or similar \ncredentials.\n\n[[Page S12630]]\n\n  Though we have made some progress, such as passing the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, it is obvious we still have challenges to overcome. \nSo, let's applaud the companies, organizations, and municipalities on \nthe Labor Department's honor roll for working women. And let's continue \nto struggle toward solutions to make every workplace a family-friendly \nworkplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12629-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, introduced by my colleague, Senator \nLugar. I do this because I believe greater trade and economic \ndevelopment is in the interest of sub-Saharan Africa, and in the \ninterest of the United States.\n  For too long, Mr. President, our policy toward the nations of sub-\nSaharan Africa has been based largely on a series of bilateral donor-\nrecipient aid relationships. While this policy has produced some \nnotable successes in terms of staving off starvation, it also has \nspawned an inappropriate vision of the United States as patron to \nliterally dozens of independent nations, while fostering a debilitating \ndependence on foreign assistance. As a consequence, this policy has in \nfact stood in the way of economic growth, self-reliance and political \nstability for the vast majority of people in this region.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act will establish a new \nrelationship between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan \nAfrica. It will promote economic growth through private sector activity \nand trade incentives, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship and \nencouraging economic and political reforms in the interests of the \npeoples of sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The bill directs the President to develop a plan to establish a \nUnited States-Sub-Saharan Africa Free-Trade Area to stimulate trade. It \nalso eliminates quotas on textiles and apparel from Kenya and \nMauritius, contingent on these countries' adopting a visa system to \nguard against transshipment.\n  In addition, this legislation would establish an economic forum to \nfacilitate trade discussions and work with the private sector to \ndevelop an investment agenda. USAID moneys would not be effected in any \nway. However, OPIC would be instructed to create a privately funded, \n$150 million equity fund and a $500 million infrastructure fund for \nAfrica. Finally, the bill mandates that one member of the board of \ndirectors of the Export-Import Bank and OPIC have extensive private \ninvestment sector experience in Africa.\n  Benefits from these initiatives would be available to any nation in \nthe sub-Saharan region instituting serious economic and political \nreforms.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of this legislation in effect would \ncreate a free-trade zone in sub-Saharan Africa. They would promote \nincreased trade, increased privatization, increased democracy, and \nincreased prosperity for the people of the region. By ending the \ncurrent patron-client relationship, and substituting for it an equal \npartnership among independent nations, we can benefit everyone \ninvolved.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important, forward-looking \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12630-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KATHY LACEY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nKathy Lacey, my deputy legislative director, who I regret will retire \nat the end of December after serving California for 27 years as a staff \nmember in the U.S. Senate.\n  Kathy came to Washington, DC 27 years ago having studied at Vassar \nCollege and after graduate work at the University of Southern \nCalifornia. Her graduate work at USC was in Asian studies and Chinese \nlanguage. She knew other friends who had used their studies by going to \nwork for the Federal Government and she thought she would find similar \nopportunities. Instead, former Senator Alan Cranston hired Kathy and \nshe went to work using her love and knowledge of California.\n  When Kathy describes her service in the U.S. Senate to younger staff \njust starting their careers, she says that her effort was always on \nbehalf of the people of California. Her work ranged from trying to \nassist farmers with export of their crops, to helping cities get their \nfunds to build sewage treatment plants, to fixing levees or to \nanalyzing the science of radioactive waste, pests, and pesticides, or \nendangered species.\n  But what gives Kathy the most satisfaction is the work which she has \ndone, both with me and with Alan Cranston, to protect California's \nspecial places. Legislation she has worked on over her 27-year career \nhas protected almost 12 million acres of wilderness in California. More \nthan half of that acreage was part of the Desert Protection Act. I \ncould not have successfully gotten that bill passed without Kathy's \nknowledge and continuous work.\n  But Kathy was also involved in the creation of the Santa Monica \nMountains National Recreation Area, establishment of Channel Island \nNational Park, expansion of Redwood National Park, protection of \nMineral King through its addition to Sequoia National Park, \nestablishment of the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area, \npreservation of the Tuolumne River, enactment of the Smith River bill \nwhich protected watersheds and old growth in the Six Rivers National \nForest, and designation of almost all of the wilderness in California \nincluding the 1.8-million-acre California wilderness bill.\n  Kathy grew up in Pasadena. Her parents had come to California as \nteenagers. Her mother and brother still live there. Because Kathy chose \nto come to Washington, DC, and work for California, she has made a \nlasting contribution to her State.\n  Kathy plans to leave the Congress and have new adventures with her \nhusband, Cal, who has also recently retired. On behalf of everyone in \nCalifornia, I thank Kathy for her professional spirit which was \nimportant to me from my first days in the U.S. Senate and I thank her \nfor her dedicated example which has proved so significant to \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12630-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12630-S12631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes today in order to lay out my reasons for voting against the \nFiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, when I was running for the Senate last year, there \nwere two campaign promises that I made to the people of the great State \nof Alabama. First, I promised that I would work to reign in wasteful \nWashington spending and secondly, that I would work to bring Alabama \nvalues into the Washington public-policy debate. It was for these two \nsimple reasons that I felt compelled to cast my vote against the Labor, \nHHS appropriations bill.\n  The fiscal year 1998 Labor, HHS appropriations bill contained roughly \n$80 billion in spending for Washington social programs. This is an \nincrease of roughly $6.2 billion from fiscal year 1997's bill. Now Mr. \nPresident, the average Alabamian, if they're lucky, sees a cost-of-\nliving increase in their paycheck each year of around 2.8 percent. \nThat's it, 2.8 percent. However, this bill increases Washington social \nspending by over 8 percent. That's an increase of almost three times \nthe average Alabamian's yearly cost-of-living increase. That to me is \nunacceptable.\n  I have spent many long hours looking through the merits of many of \nthese programs. We have many good programs, with a proven track record, \nthat need to be funded and supported. But Mr. President, the Labor, HHS \nappropriations bill we voted on also contained many social programs \nthat are unproven or just too costly. The taxpayers of America deserve \nto know that their hard earned tax dollars are spent wisely. If we \ncontinue to raise spending faster than our economic growth--faster than \nthe cost of living--then we are in danger of returning to the old tax \nand spend mentality that has nearly bankrupted this country. With great \nreluctance, I must vote ``no.''\n  There were several other provisions missing from this bill which also \ncompelled me to vote against it. First, my tobacco amendment, added to \nthe bill by the Senate on September 10, which would have limited any \ntobacco attorney's fees and required that all such fees be made public \nfor inspection prior to the passage of any global settlement, was \nstripped during negotiations\n\n[[Page S12631]]\n\nbetween the Senate and House of Representatives conference committee. \nThese fees, in many cases, will be the largest fees in history and will \nbe windfalls for these attorneys. These moneys would be better spent on \nhealth care for children.\n  Second, an education provision, which I strongly supported, authored \nby my good friend from Washington, Senator Slade Gorton, was also \nstripped during the House-Senate conference negotiations. This \namendment would have required the Secretary of Education to award \ncertain funds appropriated for the Department of Education for \nkindergarten through grade 12 programs and activities directly to the \nlocal education agencies. This will allow them to use the funds for \ntheir greatest needs and reduce paperwork. I supported this amendment \nbecause I believe it is time to take control of our schools out of the \nhands of the well-intentioned individuals in Washington and instead put \nthe control into the hands of the real experts--the teachers, \nprincipals, parents and the students of Alabama. Mr. President, this is \nanother example of Government putting Washington values ahead of \nAlabama's values. The fundamental question is this: Will our children \nbenefit more if Washington is in charge of their education or if their \nelected representatives are? Alabama values would support the local \ncontrol of our schools while Washington values support the bureaucratic \nheavy handed federal control of our education system.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me say plainly I support many of the \nprograms and services found in this bill.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a matter of \nutmost importance to our Nation--granting the President fast-track \nauthority for global trade agreements for the next 5 years.\n  I have long opposed extending fast-track authority to the executive \nbranch on the grounds that it removes all possibility of perfecting \ntrade agreements which have wide-ranging impacts on many sectors of our \neconomy. And nothing I have seen in recent history has changed my mind.\n  We are being asked to rubber stamp not just one agreement, but any \ntrade agreement that may come along, whether in South America, Asia, or \nanywhere else in the world. We are contemplating letting bureaucrats \nand other unelected interests negotiate America's future in the new \nglobal economy. And if history is any indication, we would be making a \ngrievous mistake.\n  Experience is a wonderful teacher--just look at NAFTA. What I have \nlearned is that NAFTA has not been the job boon it was advertised to \nbe; that the trade deficit has continued to explode under NAFTA, that \ntoo many good paying jobs have already been sacrificed on the altar of \nso-called fair trade, and that we have serious difficulties in \nenforcing the agreements we've already made.\n  That is not a particularly encouraging track record--certainly not \none that should inspire us to hand over the trade agreement keys to the \nWhite House. To the contrary, it raises grave concerns as to where the \nadministration wants to take the country in the new world of \nglobalization.\n  That is why I believe the President is obliged to do more than just \nsay that he needs fast-track authority. The gap between what he said \nwould happen under NAFTA and what has actually happened makes it even \nmore essential that he explain to us precisely how he would address the \nproblems that already exist, and what his vision is for the future \nshould he be granted such sweeping authority. Because frankly, the \nadministration has not spelled out why it needs this authority, nor \nwhat it will mean for the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, I can venture a fairly good guess as to what it will \nmean, based on history. The chart behind me represents the U.S. \ninternational merchandise trade from 1947 until last year. For 25 out \nof the 27 years preceding fast-track authority in 1974, the United \nStates ran a trade surplus. Then, after 1975, the bottom started \nfalling out.\n  This sea of red ink behind me not only represents millions of dollars \nin deficit--over $190 billion last year ($191.2 billion)--but lost jobs \nand shattered lives. For each billion dollars in trade deficit, another \n20,000 people are displaced from their jobs--according to the Foreign \nTrade Division of the Census Bureau, that number is approaching 3.8 \nmillion. Every $50,000 in trade deficit is one lost job.\n  We hear time and time again that enormous opportunities will be \ncreated for the American people through trade agreements the President \ncan negotiate if he has fast-track authority. But if the agreements \nalready negotiated are any indication, it's time to put the brakes on, \nnot hit the accelerator. Because working Americans can't afford any \nmore ``opportunities'' like this.\n  Right now, each week, the United States borrows from abroad or sells \nassets worth $3 billion to pay for our trade losses. All across the \ncountry, workers are taking cuts in pay--or worse, taking home pink \nslips. And we are left to wonder how trade agreements that had promised \nso much have delivered so little. Just look at the lessons of NAFTA.\n  NAFTA, we were told, would improve our trade deficit with Canada and \nMexico. So what's the reality? Before NAFTA in 1993, we had a $1.7 \nbillion surplus with Mexico. As of last year, it's now a $16.2 billion \ndeficit. Before NAFTA we had a $10 billion trade deficit with Canada. \nAfter only 3 years of NAFTA, we had a $23 billion deficit. And during \nthose 3 years under NAFTA, our combined merchandise trade deficits with \nCanada and Mexico have grown 433 percent, as indicated by this chart \nshowing the tremendous downward turn taken after NAFTA.\n  We all know that, with trade agreements, there are winners and there \nare losers. But a quick review of the current NAFTA standings shows \nthat, in sports terms, we are well below .500. The White House has \nclaimed credit for 90,000 to 160,000 American jobs from NAFTA. Yet the \nEconomic Policy Institute has issued a report that there are jobs \nlosses in all 50 States because of NAFTA, more than 390,000 jobs \neliminated since NAFTA took effect in 1994.\n  Considering our experience prior to 1994, we can ill afford these \nkind of results. An October EPI briefing paper states that in the 15 \nyears preceding NAFTA the U.S. goods and services trade deficit \neliminated a total of 2.4 million job opportunities, 2.2 million in the \nmanufacturing sector alone. That means 83 percent of the total job \ndecline was in the manufacturing sector.\n  For example, in my home State of Maine, between 1980 and the \ninception of NAFTA the Maine footwear industry--the largest in the \nNation--lost over 9,000 jobs to countries like Mexico because our \nGovernment sat on its hands in spite of recommended action by the \nInternational Trade Commission. And in the past three years alone, \nthere have been significant losses in the textile and shoe industries--\nover 8,000 people have lost their jobs. I have already witnessed too \nmany hardworking people lose their livelihood for me to risk more \nAmerican jobs.\n  I am unwilling to trade well-paying jobs with benefits for lower \npaying ones--but that's precisely what's happened under our ill-\nconceived trade agreements. As the trade deficit and globalization of \nU.S. industries have grown, more quality jobs have been lost to imports \nthan have been gained in the lower paying sectors that are experiencing \nrapid export growth. Increased import shares have displaced almost \ntwice as many high-paying, high-skill jobs than increased exports have \ncreated.\n  Of course, NAFTA has created some good jobs. But the fact that \nincreased imports have caused a large trade deficit tell us that more \nhigh-paying jobs were lost than gained in the push for more trade.\n  Those deficits--and the path the United States is going down--are \nwell illustrated by this chart which shows three roads that have \ndiverged under the previous reign of fast-track authority, first \ninstituted in 1974. Up to that point, Japanese, German, and United \nStates merchandise trade was humming along essentially in balance.\n\n[[Page S12632]]\n\n  Beginning almost at the start of 1975, however, we clearly see the \nUnited States plunging into deficit, while Germany and Japan both enjoy \na trade surplus. To paraphrase Robert Frost, the road less traveled \ncertainly has made all the difference--in this case, not for the \nbetter. In other words, under NAFTA as well as other previous trade \nagreements, there have been many more losers than winners.\n  So we must ask the President: How do you explain the job losses? How \ndo you explain the trade deficit explosion? And what is it going to \nmean for the future of the country? The affect of NAFTA on these issues \nwas seriously miscalculated--what assurances do we have that the \nadministration's record will be better in the next 5 years, after \nmultiple agreements?\n  We also need assurances that agreements negotiated will be agreements \nfulfilled. Unfortunately, after we have negotiated past trade \nagreements, I do not believe that the United States has aggressively \npursued enforcement of the elimination of trade barriers with other \ncountries, whether they are tariff or nontariff barriers. Why then \nwould we grant this authority on a broad basis for whatever agreements \nmay be negotiated by the administration?\n  The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan summed it up best in a \nstudy earlier this year concluding that ``it has often been more \nimportant for the two governments to reach agreements and declare \nvictory than to undertake the difficult task of monitoring the \nagreements to ensure their implementation produces results.''\n  The bottom line is, long after the signing ceremonies and handshakes \nare forgotten, these trade agreements continue to affect lives on a \ndaily basis. We must remember that our responsibilities don't end with \nthe ratification of our trade agreements--they are just beginning.\n  Unfortunately, I can only assume from my personal experience that \nthis is a lesson not yet learned by the administration. What other \nconclusion is there when the NAFTA clean-up plan for the United States-\nMexico border has generated only 1 percent of the promised funding? \nWhat other conclusion is there when other countries continue to violate \nour laws by dumping goods in the United States below cost and because \nof extensive subsidies?\n  The Atlantic salmon farmers of Maine are a case in point. While we \ndebate giving the President greater authority to close more trade \ndeals, they have a case pending with the Department of Commerce because \nsubsidized, low-priced Atlantic salmon from Chile--which provides at \nleast 25 different subsidies to its producers, I might add--are being \ndumped in the United States. And while this situation remains \nunresolved, we have lost more than 50 percent of our salmon aquaculture \nindustry in Maine, while Chile's imports into the United States have \nrisen 75 percent and United States salmon prices have dropped by 30 \npercent.\n  So forgive me if I am at a complete loss as to how bringing Chile \ninto NAFTA will create more and better jobs, and a higher standard of \nliving for the hard working people of Maine.\n  And I could not talk about empty trade promises without mentioning \nMaine's potato industry. For years I have been raising the issue of an \nunfair trade barrier with Canada on bulk shipments of potatoes exported \nto Canada, a trade barrier that is in violation of the National \nTreatment Principle of article III, paragraph 4 of the GATT, to be \nspecific. This provision requires that GATT/WTO member countries treat \nimported products the same as goods of local origin with respect to all \nlaws, regulations, and requirements that affect the sale, purchase, \ntransportation, distribution, and use of the goods.\n  In December of 1994, USTR's then Trade Representative Micky Kantor \nsaid he would be filing a trade case with the GATT-WTO to overturn \nCanada's policy of bulk easements. So what has happened so far? \nNothing.\n  Almost 2 years later, in September of 1996, I wrote to President \nClinton to express my belief that we had waited long enough, to urge \nhim to live up to the USTR commitment, and to proceed with a trade case \non bulk easements. One week later, USTR's Charlene Barshefsky called me \nto let me know that serious bilateral consultations on Canadian trade \npractices would begin.\n  These talks lead nowhere--in fact, the USTR then actually backtracked \non filing a trade case. Two months later, the ITC was asked to \ninvestigate. They did, and in July of this year, issued a report, which \nstated, and I quote: ``Canadian regulations restrict imports of bulk \nshipments of fresh potatoes for processing or repacking.'' The report \nalso stated, ``the United States maintains no such restrictions.''\n  So where are we today? Well, this past week, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative once again promised that bilateral talks on bulk \neasements will begin no later than March 1998. It looks to me, as Yogi \nBerra once said, like deja vu all over again. Is this how the \nadministration plans to handle enforcement for future trade agreements? \nLast week, the President asked the American people to give him the \nbenefit of the doubt on fast track. I believe we need the benefit of \nenforcement of existing agreements first.\n  Where are our strict and mandatory enforcement provisions when our \ntrading partners bring injury to our domestic workers? We need to \nprovide the enforcement to ensure full reciprocity in market access and \nreduction of export subsidies--enforcement and oversight which, up \nuntil now, has been lacking.\n  Yet, we are told that specific concerns should be weighed against the \nbroader economic, political and social aspects of NAFTA expansion. We \nare told that, overall, no major negative impact is expected if we \nexpand the trade agreement with Chile--except of course for industries \nlike fish, forestry, and fruit, all of which are important to the \neconomic stability of my home State of Maine.\n  That is why I am not prepared to give up the right to seek assurances \nthat these industries won't be decimated by a flawed trade agreement. \nThe stakes are far too high for Congress to abrogate its \nresponsibilities to the bureaucrats and special interests.\n  Free trade, as we have seen, doesn't work unless we have agreements \nthat also provide for fair trade, and Congress must have the right to \nexercise its responsibility to ensure fair trade in each and every \nagreement that comes down the road. The Senate must be more than just a \ndebating society for global trade issues that affect each and every one \nof us.\n  Our country negotiated trade agreements for nearly 200 years before \nfast-track authority was first granted in 1974, when trade was carved \nout for an exception unlike any other kind of treaty. We continue to \nnegotiate treaties and agreements on everything from chemical weapons \nto extradition to tuna-dolphin without fast-track authority. And I have \nheard no rational explanation of why trade should be treated \ndifferently.\n  I certainly do not believe Congress should approve fast-track \nauthority on the basis of fear that the United States will not have a \nseat at the trade bargaining table. There is no question we are living \nin an era dominated by global economics and trade, but at the same time \nwe are an economic super power with an 8.3 trillion dollar economy and \n203 million willing buyers--an attractive market to say the least.\n  I believe it would continue to be in the best interests of nations \nacross the globe to negotiate with the United States--and those of us \nin Congress are committed to crafting mutually beneficial trade \nagreements. I think all of us in Congress understand full well the \nrealities of trade as we approach the new millennium. We must also \nunderstand, however, that our trade record under fast track mandates \nthat Congress have a strong voice in the process.\n  Mr. President, we are elected to deliberate and vote on the major \nissues of our day. Well, what could be more important than trade \nagreements that will directly affect hard working Americans and their \nfamilies?\n  It is imperative that we not relinquish our right to have a voice in \nthese agreements. I don't want to see a repeat of what happened during \nthe summer of 1993 during negotiations on NAFTA side agreements, when \nUnited States negotiators, clearly under tremendous pressure to reach \nagreement on the outstanding issues and conclude the pact in time for a \nJanuary vote, let Canada and Mexico off the hook on a number of \ndifferent issues. We need better oversight, more discussion and debate, \nnot less, because we stand at a very important juncture.\n\n[[Page S12633]]\n\n  A poignant story out of New England illustrates where we are at the \nend of the 20th century, and points up the failures of past agreements.\n  Two years ago, Malden Mills, a textile mill in Massachusetts, burned \nto the ground, leaving thousands unemployed and putting 300 more jobs \nin jeopardy at the Bridgton Knitting Mills in Maine. In the wake of the \nfire, the mill's owner, Aaron Feuerstein, had several attractive \nchoices, including rebuilding in another state or country with lower \nwages, anywhere from Texas to Thailand. Or he simply could have retired \nafter four decades of running Malden Mills, founded by his grandfather \nmore than 90 years ago.\n  Instead, last month, Mr. Feurstein opened a new, state-of-the-art \ntextile mill, and brought 2,630 very grateful Americans back to work. \nAnd the rebuilding of the plant has become a symbol of loyalty to \nemployees and to an entire community. Mr. Feuerstein's actions are \nadmirable and all of America rightfully extended their appreciation to \na man who chose the difficult path over the easy, and perhaps more \nprofitable.\n  But let's step back for a moment and ask ourselves why this story \nbecame a national sensation. The sad fact is, it stood out so glaringly \nbecause it is the exception to the rule. The idea that American textile \njobs would be kept in the United States when they could easily be \nshipped overseas is news because it hardly ever happens that way \nanymore.\n  Mr. President, I don't want to continue down this path, but I fear we \nwill if we don't retain our congressional right to speak out against \ntrade agreements that aren't in our best interest.\n  We have an obligation to all those who have already lost good jobs to \nbad trade agreements, and to all those who are in danger of becoming \ndisplaced in the future, to take the time to do it right. And the \nPresident has an obligation to fully explain how the wrongs of the past \nwill be fixed, and why the future will be different. This he simply has \nnot done.\n  We stand poised to begin a new era of prosperity in the global \nmarketplace, but I do not believe that fast track is the way to get us \nthere, I do not believe the President has made his case for this broad \nauthority, and I urge my colleagues to defeat this fast-track \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12631-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12633-S12634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ITALIAN HOSPITAL SOCIETY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nnote that the Italian Hospital Society is celebrating its 60th \nanniversary with a dinner and awards presentation on Sunday, November \n16th. It is a most notable organization guided by compassion and \nphilanthropy to assist the hospital and health services of Italian \ncommunities in New York.\n  This year's ceremonies will salute four eminent Italian-Americans who \nhave brought the hopes of the Italian Hospital Society closer to \nreality. I am especially gratified that the committee honors a doctor, \na businessman, a union leader, and the principle inspiration of my \nlife, my mamma.\n  I can speak with particular knowledge and delight about Mamma, known \nto the public as Antoinette Cioffari D'Amato. She was born and grew up \nin Brooklyn, the daughter of Italian-American parents. In growing up as \nher child, I was able to see the qualities, character and enthusiasm \nfor life and for family which the society salutes in her public life. \nIt was she who inspired confidence, exercised discipline and demanded \nthe pursuit of education. It was she who was the foundation for \nresponsibility to the community and for civic involvement.\n  In her marriage of 61 years to my father, Armand, a teacher and son \nof Italian-American parents, she was a prototypical ``mamma''--cooking, \ncleaning, exhorting, reprimanding and loving her three children, \nAlfonse, Armand, and Joanne. During World War II, while my father was \nin the Army, she worked in a defense plant. As part of the emigration \nfrom Brooklyn to Long Island, the D'Amato family moved to Island Park \nwhere she and Dad continue to reside. Both still work in the insurance \nbrokerage which has been the family business for over 60 years.\n  It was my political campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1980 that brought \nMamma and her many talents to a wider audience. The advertisements she \nmade for my campaign made me a winner. Ever since she has been \nunstinting as an active and enthusiastic citizen of New York. She has \nhad a special interest in affordable housing services for older \ncitizens through her membership on the board of the New York Foundation \nfor Senior Citizens Inc. She is a television celebrity and the author \nof her own cookbook--``Cooking and Canning with Mamma D'Amato.''\n  I commend the Italian Hospital Society for the honor they give my \nmother for her public participation; but, for all the lessons and love \nof the private Antoinette Cioffari D'Amato, only a hug and a kiss are \nthe proper awards.\n\n\n                             Ernesto Jofre\n\n  Ernesto Jofre, a native of Chile, came to the United States as a \npolitical refugee in 1976. He had spent the 3 previous years as a \npolitical prisoner of the Pinochet dictatorship. He joined Local 169 of \nthe Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers' Union [ACTWU] as an \nauditor. Subsequently, he served Local 169 as an organizer, business \nagent, assistant manager, and then became manager and secretary-\ntreasurer in 1993. He then became manager and secretary-treasurer of \nthe Amalgamated Northeast Regional Joint Board of the Union of \nNeedletrades, Industrial & Textile Employees [UNITE!] in 1994.\n  He is a vice president of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council, \nMember of the boards of directors of the Amalgamated Bank, the Jewish \nLabor Committee, and Americans for Democratic Action. He is plan \nadministrator of the health and welfare funds and pension funds of \nLocal 169, UNITE.\n\n\n                         Mario Spagnuolo, M.D.\n\n  Dr. Mario Spagnuolo was born in Naples in 1930; he graduated cum \nlaude from the School of Medicine of the University of Naples. He \ntrained in New York City at St. Claire's Hospital, the Irvington House \nInstitute for Rheumatic Diseases and Bellevue Hospital. He was the \ndirector of the Irvington House Institute and associate professor of \nmedicine at New York University Medical School.\n  He has written about 60 research papers in rheumatic diseases and \nseveral articles for textbooks. An editorial in the New England Journal \nof Medicine accompanying one of his papers, in January 1968, defined \nthe paper as an extraordinary clinical investigation. The Journal \nreprinted one of his articles in 1996, 25 years after its publication \nin 1966, as a ``Classic in Medicine.''\n  He has practiced internal medicine in Yonkers for the last 25 years. \nHe has been president of the Westchester Health Services Network. He \npractices at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers, where he was \ndirector of medicine and is now chief of the medical staff and a member \nof the board of trustees.\n  He is married to Kathryn Birchall Spagnuolo. They have four \nchildren--Mario, Sandra, Peter, and Eugene, a daughter-in-law--Linda, \nand three grandchildren--JoAnne, Matthew, and Stephanie.\n\n\n                           Vincent Zuccarelli\n\n  Vincent Zuccarelli was born in Mongrassano, a small town in Calabria, \nItaly. He started his education in the seminary and continued through \nthe ``Liceo Classico.'' He was a private tutor of classical languages, \nLatin and Greek, for the students of the Middle and High Gymnasium \nSchool and was head of electoral office in his jurisdiction for 5 \nyears.\n  Vincent came to the United States in 1958. In 1959, with his \nbrothers, he engaged in and formed the food business in Mount Vernon, \nNY and Florida known as the Zuccarelli Brothers.\n  He has been married for 43 years to his wife Nella and has three \nsons: Mario, Fiore, and Joseph. Vincent and Nella also have six \ngrandchildren: Vincent, Nelli, Marie, Juliana, Joey, and Danielle. He \nand his wife reside in Bronxville, NY.\n  He joined the Calabria Society in 1985, and has become an active and \nproud member. He is the first dinner-dance chairman of the Casa Dei \nBambini Italiani Di New York. Mr. Zuccarelli is a member of the Council \nof the National Italian-American Foundation of Washington, DC, \npromoting education for the Italian-American values and traditions, and \npresently he is the NIAF Westchester County Coordinator.\n\n[[Page S12634]]\n\n  The society continues the work of so many who came to this country as \nimmigrants seeking freedom and a new life in America. But the bonds of \nkinship and of nationality were often the only protections in a society \nwhere intolerance and discrimination was the more likely welcome.\n  Having done so much over the past 60 years, the Italian Hospital \nSociety has embarked on a new mission to create an Italian Home for the \nAged as an independent assisted living facility where Italian-Americans \nand all elderly and infirm can receive the finest assistance. As they \nnote in their mission statement: ``Unfortunately many of our own \nparents and grandparents have suffered isolation, depression and \nfeelings of frustration due to cultural and language barriers. It is \nthe mission of the Italian Hospital Society to ameliorate this \ndifficult situation by providing a supervised facility that would be \ncomforting and familiar to our aged community while providing for the \nphysical as well as psychological welfare of these individuals.''\n  Mr. President, I ask to share with our colleagues the joy I have as \nson of one of the society's honorees and thank them for all the work \nthat they do as a society and for the honors and respect they show \ntoward their four honorees.

GREENE, JR., AS ASSOCIATE JUDGE, U.S. \n                       COURT OF VETERANS APPEALS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to express my enormous \ndelight that Judge William P. Greene, Jr., was recently confirmed for \nthe position of associate judge for the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals. \nJudge Greene brings to this job a lifetime of experience in the armed \nservices and the law, and I believe President Clinton made an excellent \nchoice in nominating him for this position.\n  Bill is extremely qualified to serve on the court. After graduating \nfrom Howard University School of Law in 1968, he joined the U.S. Army, \nwhere he proudly served for 25 years. Bill was an officer in the U.S. \nArmy Judge Advocates Group Corps, and earned the Legion of Merit, \nMeritorious Service Medal, and Army Commendation Medal more than once.\n  Since 1993, Bill has served as an immigration judge for the \nDepartment of Justice in Baltimore. His leadership skills and ability \nto make clear, decisive, and just decisions have been well tried--and \nwell proven.\n  In addition to his many other fine attributes, Bill has another that \nmakes me especially proud of him--he is a native West Virginian. Bill \nwas born in Bluefield, WV, and lived there until he was 10. He grew up \nin a military family and although they moved around to many different \nplaces, Bill always considered West Virginia home, and returned to West \nVirginia to attend West Virginia State College.\n  Bill's father was a veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, and \nwas awarded the Silver Star for valor. So it is no surprise to me that \nBill possesses an enormous sense of patriotism and pride in his \ncountry. The learning experience of growing up in a military family, \ncombined with the experience of his own military career, will be \nenormously helpful to him in the job that lies ahead.\n  Everyone who has worked with me on the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs knows that I have long been a supporter of the court, so you \ncan be sure that the quality of those who serve there is important to \nme. I am confident that Judge Greene will bring to the court the \nwisdom, judgment, and sensitivity so necessary for the court's vital \nwork. In doing so, he will serve both our country and his fellow \nveterans well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12634-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12634-S12635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMMUNITY OPERATION ON TEMPORARY SHELTER\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on September 11, 1997, the \nCommunity on Temporary Shelter [COTS] held its annual meeting in \nBurlington, VT. The keynote speaker was Rita Markley, the director of \nCOTS. Through her hard work and dedication to the needs of the homeless \nin Vermont stands as a glowing example of the value of community \nservice. Her efforts have made a tremendous difference in the fight to \nend homelessness. It gives me great pleasure to submit, for the Record, \nthe text of her remarks.\n  The text of the remarks follows:\n\n                            [Sept. 11, 1997]\n\n    Committee on Temporary Shelter Annual Meeting--Where Are We Now\n\n                           (By Rita Markley)\n\n       Good morning and welcome to our annual meeting and \n     volunteer recognition. This is the day when we thank all of \n     you for giving your support to COTS. It's the time when we \n     reflect on what that contribution means and why it matters.\n       I think it's too easy these days to forget that there was a \n     time in this country, just 20-25 years ago, when being poor \n     did not mean being homeless. There was a time when retail \n     clerks, gas station attendants, waitresses could afford to \n     pay for their rent and their groceries. Sometimes they even \n     had enough left over for a Saturday afternoon movie. There \n     was a time when the mentally ill were not left to wander \n     America's streets without housing or services. And there was \n     a time, just 15 years ago, when this community did not need a \n     place like COTS because homelessness was something that only \n     happened in big cities.\n       There have been enormous economic and social changes during \n     the past 20 years that have displaced and uprooted millions \n     of lives. Across the country and here in Vermont, the number \n     of families and individuals without housing has increased \n     tenfold during the past decade. Not since the Great \n     Depression have there been so many homeless Americans. During \n     the 1980's more than half a million units of low income \n     housing were lost every year to condo conversion, arson and \n     demolition. That rate of loss has been even higher during the \n     1990's. In Chittenden County, rents increased twice as fast \n     as average income during the 80's. Not surprisingly, we now \n     live in a time when homelessness has become so pervasive, so \n     endemic, that we've all but forgotten that it was not always \n     this way. One of my greatest fears is that we will come to \n     accept that this is the way it must be.\n       It seems impossible that it was less than 20 years ago that \n     we first began to see vast numbers of families all over this \n     country sleeping in abandoned buildings or huddled in \n     doorways because they couldn't afford a home. Back then, we \n     were deeply shaken by the image of small children doing their \n     homework by flashlight in the backseat of cars, the idea of \n     anyone sleeping under cardboard boxes in public parks was \n     astonishing. Our hearts were broken by newspaper stories of \n     entire families scouring through trash dumpsters for scraps \n     of food.\n       In 1997 the problem of homelessness in America remains one \n     of our greatest challenges and yet we hear little or nothing \n     about this issue in the national media. It's as if seeing \n     those anguished images year after year has become so routine \n     that we no longer see them at all. A few months ago my own \n     sister told me that she was tired of seeing the homeless \n     everywhere she went, that she couldn't look at their faces \n     anymore because there were just too many of them, and it made \n     her feel too sad. Either she forgot what I do every day or \n     she wanted me to remind her that turning away from her own \n     compassion means turning away from her humanity. My sister's \n     reaction, though, is not uncommon. The homeless are \n     increasingly invisible, untouchable. And they know it, they \n     feel the distancing every time someone passes them by on the \n     street without looking into their eyes. Even children living \n     in desperate poverty know that they are regarded differently \n     than cleaner, better dressed children. Here's a quote from a \n     15 year old girl that describes their experience poignantly:\n       ``It's not like being in jail. It's more like being hidden. \n     It's as if you have been put in a garage somewhere, where, if \n     they don't have room for something but aren't sure if they \n     should throw it out, they put it there in the garage where \n     they don't need to think of it again. That's what it's \n     like.'' (Kozol interview tapes)\n       Since the mid-1980's there has been a growing inclination \n     to ignore, conceal and even punish those without homes. Many \n     people in this country have moved from pity to impatience to \n     outright contempt for the homeless.\n       In Fort Lauderdale, FL a city councilor proposed spraying \n     trash containers with rat poison to discourage foraging by \n     homeless families. ``The way to get rid of vermin,'' he said, \n     ``is to cut off their food supply.'' (1986) In Santa Barbara, \n     California grocers have sprinkled bleach on food discarded in \n     their dumpsters.\n       In Chicago a homeless man was set ablaze while sleeping on \n     a bench early one December morning. Rush hour commuters \n     passed his charred body and possessions for four hours before \n     anyone called the police.\n       In the first four months of 1992, 26 homeless people were \n     set on fire while they were sleeping in New York City.\n       Who are these faceless, forsaken people that they would \n     provoke such hateful acts? They are the poorest and most \n     vulnerable members of our society: they are the elderly and \n     families with children, they are Korean and Vietnam war \n     veterans, they are the mentally ill who were left to fend for \n     themselves on city streets, they are women and children \n     fleeing from violence. I wonder\n\n[[Page S12635]]\n\n     what kind of outcry there would have been if these acts of \n     violence were inflicted on any other group but the most \n     dispossessed.\n       I'd like to read a few letters by some Vermonters who lost \n     their homes this year. They wrote these last April during the \n     HUD crisis when many of our services would have been wiped \n     out by unexpected cuts in funding.\n       ``Dear ---- I'd never been homeless before this winter. I \n     was out of work suddenly, lost my apartment and had to find a \n     place to stay. . . I was at the Waystation. . . where I met \n     some people who took care of each other, no matter our \n     differences in lifestyles, skills, education or so called \n     sanity. I have a college degree, many skills and I want to \n     work and to give to the community. What I'm saying is that \n     almost anyone could become homeless after some unexpected \n     misfortune. Whether they can work or not they still need food \n     and clothing, safe shelter, and people who care about them. . \n     . I started to work again last week and my home will be open \n     for anyone who needs a place to stay. I won't forget.''\n       ``I lost the comfort of my affordable apartment when the \n     building I lived in was closed because of fire. Also, 49 \n     other families were displaced. The renovation of his building \n     will take 18 to 24 months according to the owner. I have not \n     had comfortable housing since that fire on September 7, 1996. \n     My address was 127 St. Paul street where Vermont Transit was \n     located. In the meantime, I'm number 1030 on the Burlington \n     Housing Authority waiting list. What I miss most about my \n     apartment was the peace of mind it gave me. Sincerely, Arlen \n     D.''\n       I'm not sure if Arlen knows yet that only 5 of the \n     renovated units will be rented at a rate anywhere near what \n     he can afford.\n       We hear a lot these days about building strong communities, \n     and God knows, we've heard no end of how it takes a village \n     to raise a child. But what's missing in all of those \n     discussions is the primacy, the importance and the function \n     of home within any community or village. Think about what \n     home means for all of us. It's the place we gather with \n     family, it's where we sleep and dream and let down our guard \n     at the end of the day. Home is where we keep and cherish what \n     we love: our family, our books and music, whatever it is that \n     we hold dear. It's the place we store all of the things we \n     can't bear to part with: our high school graduation photos, \n     our grandmother's wedding ring, a fifth grade award for \n     spelling. Home is the one place where we can create a safe \n     world within a larger more threatening world.\n       Losing a home means that you only keep what you can carry \n     in your hands and on your back. It means leaving behind many \n     of the belongings that remind you what has mattered in your \n     life. It means losing connection with your own history. For \n     children, not having a home is devastating; it means losing \n     their pets, their storybooks and their favorite toys.\n       I cannot imagine the damage done when a child is torn from \n     her home, when she sees her family's belongings piled up on \n     the sidewalk, when she has no idea where she will sleep at \n     night. I cannot imagine the pain a seven year old feels when \n     he's called ``shelter trash'' by the other children in his \n     school. What I do know is that without the foundation of \n     home, any efforts to build meaningful community will fail. \n     It's untenable to think a village can raise healthy children \n     when its children are sleeping in emergency shelters and on \n     the streets. I remember what a local businessman said to me \n     once, a pretty conservative guy. He'd written a very large \n     check for COTS. I asked him if he wanted his gift targeted to \n     our job program which is popular with many of our business \n     supporters. He said no, the shelters. He was surprised that I \n     was surprised by his answer. If these folks don't have a \n     place to sleep at night, he explained, a place to take a \n     shower, they're not going to get a job or an apartment no \n     matter what kind of training they have. They'll be trapped. \n     First things first, he said.\n       This past year we helped put first things first for more \n     that a thousand homeless families and individuals. They came \n     to COTS because they had no place left to turn. They came \n     from Burlington, Essex, Colchester, Shelburne, Ferrisburgh, \n     Williston, Milton, Westford, Underhill, South Burlington and \n     Jericho. And for every one of them COTS offered not just a \n     refuge but a chance to reclaim their own lives. We provided \n     voc counseling, job placement services, budgeting assistance, \n     unremitting encouragement, and workshops on everything from \n     nutrition to conflict resolution. For the children, we made \n     certain that every child at our shelter had a brand new \n     backpack, fresh notebooks and pencils for school.\n       None of the work we did, none of the achievements, would be \n     possible without all of you gathered here today. You \n     volunteer for our phonathon, and donate expert legal, \n     financial and human resource advise to COTS. You answer the \n     phones, spend time with the children at our shelter, and \n     repair our computers. You provide us with graphics and design \n     work that we could never otherwise afford. And you bring us \n     brownies and cookies and flowers because you know the work we \n     do is sometimes heartbreaking.\n       During the HUD crisis this spring, you came forward with \n     calls, letters, and connections. I want especially to thank \n     Gretchen Morse who was my shrewd political advisor and moral \n     support during the worst days I've ever had in the 5 years \n     I've worked at COTS. I am deeply grateful to Lucy Samara who \n     traveled to Montpelier, alerted the entire religious \n     community about the crisis, and then worked the phones every \n     night like a seasoned politician. She was extraordinary. It \n     terrifies me to think what could have happened without her \n     leadership and initiative. I'd like to thank Barbara Snelling \n     for her eloquent support at the statehouse. And thank you to \n     Doug Racine and the entire Chittenden delegation with special \n     thanks to Jan Backus and Helen Reihle. I am also very \n     grateful to Con Hogan for his advocacy within the Dean \n     Administration. And most of all, I want to thank Senator \n     Leahy for standing up to HUD. I deeply appreciate all of the \n     business owners, the religious leaders, our friends up at UVM \n     who called or wrote on our behalf. Finally, I want to thank \n     those of you without homes who had the courage to put your \n     stories on paper.\n       Someone from Senator Leahy's staff told me that it was \n     astounding what a diverse range of people called to voice \n     their concerns about COTS. She said it was the most unlikely \n     array of people she could possibly imagine. I told her to \n     come to a COTS walkathon if she wanted to see unlikely \n     combinations of people. This year we had Trey Anastasio from \n     the band Phish walking beside a big deal lawyer from Green \n     Mountain Power and they were walking just a few feet ahead of \n     4 Sisters of Mercy, one of whom was chatting with a liberal \n     progressive or maybe and anarchist who was walking just in \n     front of a conservative businessman who was strolling along \n     with a recovering alcoholic who stayed at COTS Waystation 5 \n     years ago. Heading up the rear was former governor Tom Salmon \n     and leading the walk were Barbara Snelling and Patrick Leahy. \n     How is this possible?\n       I believe that when you give your time and support to COTS, \n     you are doing far more than writing a check or working on \n     whatever task is at hand. I believe that what you are really \n     doing is taking a stand, a stand against indifference. When \n     you support COTS you are holding firm with us in the \n     unwavering conviction that every human being has value; and \n     that no one should be discarded or left behind (or set on \n     fire) just because they are poor. When you give your time to \n     COTS, when you help ensure that there is shelter and support \n     for those who have nothing, you reaffirm humanity. That's a \n     tremendous gift to give. And I thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12634-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12635-S12636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR. DAVID SATCHER\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I deeply regret that we have been \nunable to vote on the nomination of Dr. David Satcher as the Surgeon \nGeneral and the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Public Health Service.\n  As a graduate of Ohio's medical school system, Dr. Satcher is truly a \ncommendable choice for our next Surgeon General. The expediency of his \nnomination process gives an overwhelming indication of the impressive \nand extensive reach of his medical career. It is a career in which Dr. \nSatcher has placed considerable emphasis on the medically impoverished. \nHe has demonstrated an unrelenting compassion for those less fortunate, \nand to quote Dr. Frist, ``allowed science to drive his decision \nmaking'' throughout his brilliant career.\n  Born in rural Alabama his interest in medicine grew after a near-\nfatal bout with whooping cough at the age of 2. Even though his parents \nhad only the benefit of elementary educations, they instilled in him \nthe passion and drive to pursue his dreams. He received his B.S. from \nMorehouse College and became the first African-American to earn both an \nMD and a Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University, while being \nelected to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society\n  After excelling in medical school, Dr. Satcher began his career at \nthe Martin Luther King Jr. Medical Center in Los Angeles. There he \ndeveloped and chaired King-Drew's Department of Family Medicine and \nserved as the interim dean of the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical \nSchool. As interim dean, he directed the King-Drew Sickle Cell Center \nfor 6 years and negotiated the agreement with the UCLA School of \nMedicine and the Board of Regents.\n  Before being appointed to his current position of Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Dr. Satcher returned \nto Atlanta to chair the Community Medicine Department at Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine, where he received the Watts Grassroots Award for \nCommunity Service in 1979. He then served as the president of Meharry \nMedical College in Nashville for the following decade. While at \nMeharry, he was the recipient of the National Conference of Christians \nand Jews Human Relations Award was elected to the Institute of Medicine \nof the National Academy of Sciences, and was appointed to the Council \non Graduate Medical Education.\n\n[[Page S12636]]\n\n  In November 1993, Dr. Satcher was appointed as the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. With policies he \ninitiated, he has been credited with increasing child immunization \nrates from 52 percent to a record 78 percent in 1996, and improving the \nNation's capacity to respond to emerging infectious diseases. During \nhis tenure, the CDC has placed considerable emphasis on prevention \nprograms as its breast and cervical cancer programs have now been \nexpanded to all 50 States. In his current position, Dr. Satcher has \ngarnered even more awards, including Ebony magazine's American Black \nAchievement Award in Business and the Professions, the Breslow Award \nfor Excellence in Public Health, and recently the Dr. Nathan B. Davis \nAward for outstanding public service to advance the public health and \nthe John Stearns Award for Lifetime Achievement in Medicine from the \nNew York Academy of Medicine.\n  I believe HHS Secretary Dr. Donna Shalala described Dr. Satcher in \nthe best manner, when she said that he brings ``world-class stature, \nmanagement skill, integrity, and preventive health care experience'' to \nany office or title he may hold. President Clinton has stated that Dr. \nSatcher should concentrate heavily on reducing smoking, particularly \namong children. As an advocate for preventive health in family \nmedicine, Dr. Satcher has worked to heighten awareness about all \nAmerican's health and will continue to do so.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Dr. Satcher will bring the same \nprofessionalism, dedication, skill, and most of all character to this \nnew position that he has shown throughout his professional career. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support his nomination to the post of \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12635-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my \ngratitude to the diligent work of our leaders in the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee especially the chairman, Senator Chafee and \nranking member, Senator Baucus along with the chairman of the \nTransportation Subcommittee, Senator Warner in crafting a \ncomprehensive, 6 year transportation bill. The bill unanimously passed \nby the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee makes progress \ntowards building a more equitable formula for distributing Federal \ntransportation funds to the States. It is unfortunate Congress did not \nhave the opportunity to debate this bill during this session of \nCongress although I look forward to building upon progress made by the \ncommittee when the Senate reconvenes in January.\n  The law which authorizes our Federal transportation program expired \non September 30 of this year. Thanks to the competent work of Gov. Fob \nJames, and Jimmy Butts, the director at the Alabama Department of \nTransportation, and Don Vaughn, Assistant Transportation Director, I \nwas alerted early on that if Congress failed to act on passing a \ntransportation bill, critical transportation programs such as \nInterstate Maintenance, the National Highway System, and needed bridge \nrepair throughout Alabama would cease by December. In addition, the \nFederal Department of Transportation would have been forced to shut its \ndoors and transportation contractors would have been forced to lay off \nworkers as Alabama and many other States curtailed or ceased awarding \nof transportation maintenance and construction contracts. To avoid this \ncrisis, the Senate has enacted a short term solution to allow \ntransportation projects to continue by providing additional funding and \nincreased flexibility of Federal transportation funds to States.\n  The temporary transportation resolution passed by the Senate on \nTuesday will allow Alabama access to $174,469,000 for critical highway \nprograms. This amount represents half the amount of Federal highway \nfunds Alabama was able to spend in fiscal year 1997. In addition, the \nAlabama Department of Transportation will have the flexibility to \ntransfer funds between various transportation programs so that \nplanning, maintenance and expansion can continue as a comprehensive, \nlong-term transportation bill is passed by Congress early next year. \nOnce a new long-term transportation bill is passed, the Secretary of \nTransportation will offset each State's fiscal year 1998 funding to \nreflect the funds used by each State as a result of this extension.\n  Again, I would like to personally thank and congratulate Senator Bond \nfor putting this package together with our leaders of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, Warner, and Baucus. While \nmany of my colleagues and myself would have preferred a long-term \nsolution to our transportation needs, this short-term extension will \nallow Alabama and all States to continue their transportation planning, \nmaintenance, and construction until a new, long-term bill is negotiated \nand passed hopefully early next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12636-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12636-S12637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            YEAR 2000 PROBLEM STILL LOOMING, REQUIRES ACTION\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we approach the end of the 1st \nsession of the 105th Congress, I would like to implore the Senate for \none final time to consider the urgency of the year 2000 crisis. This \nmatter has been much discussed and reported, but little action has \ntaken place. In fact, the General Accounting Office last week released \na report that the Social Security Administration, once thought to be at \nthe fore of the solution, faces a possible crash of several crucial \nsystems dealing with disability determination services.\n  This report is indicative of the enormity of the problem facing the \ncomputer systems of the Federal Government. I introduced S. 22 on the \nfirst day of this session to establish a bipartisan national commission \nto handle this problem--as a civil defense task force would. Try as \nthey might, officials at the Office of Management and Budget simply \ncannot address the enormity of the task at hand.\n  Every few days I have attempted to keep my colleagues informed of the \nlatest facets of the problem. On this last day of the first session let \nme add but one more twist to the immense but manageable problem. If \nonly we would act. In the latest U.S. News and World Report, John Marks \nreports on the troublesome coincidence of converting to the new \nEuropean currency at the time of the turn of the century. He writes:\n\n       Even before it is introduced on January 1, 1999, the long \n     awaited euro threatens to cost American business $30 billion \n     or more to buy new software and recode old programs, as \n     companies with interests on the other side of the Atlantic \n     attempt to adapt to the new currency . . . the two problems \n     would seem to be unrelated. But the coincidence in timing--\n     the millennium bug and the currency change arrive within a \n     year of each other--has transformed them into a larger single \n     crisis for many companies.\n\n  Thus, international companies are forced to deal with two conversions \nin the next 2 years; and not surprisingly, experts predict there will \nbe a drought in the supply of consultants who know how to do both.\n  Again, U.S. News:\n\n       Last year, after dire warnings of a technological disaster \n     at the dawn of the new century, companies rushed to hire \n     programmers to save the day. In doing so, they created a \n     labor shortage at a critical moment. Work on both the \n     millennium bug and the euro transition requires knowledge of \n     outdated COBOL computer systems. So all of a sudden, most of \n     the programmers who might be deployed to manage the \n     transition to the euro already have day jobs.\n\n  As I have mentioned before on this floor, we must also consider the \nconversion to the Euro and the labor shortage created over the next few \nyears when we consider the size of the problem at hand.\n  The year 2000 problem is now fairly well known; the need for action \nplainly clear. With the legislative year coming to a close, I am \nhopeful my colleagues will realize this fact in the restful period \nbetween now and January 27 and be eager to take action on my bill--S. \n22 with 18 copsonsors--in the year to come.\n  I ask that the article ``Latest Software Nightmare'' from the \nNovember 17, 1997, issue of U.S. News and World Report and ``Social \nSecurity Gets Year 2000 Warning'' from the November 5 Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S12637]]\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, Nov. 17, 1997]\n\n  Latest Software Nightmare--The Currency Change in Europe Could Cost \n                          U.S. Firms Billions\n\n                            (By John Marks)\n\n       For the past year or so, American businesses have been \n     forced to grapple with the ``millennium bug,'' a computer \n     programming glitch that threatens to wipe out bank accounts, \n     financial statements, and databases when the year 1999 \n     becomes the year 2000. Now, companies must brace themselves \n     for another daunting--very expensive--software-related \n     problem, this one involving the new European currency known \n     as the euro.\n       Even before it is introduced on Jan. 1, 1999, the long-\n     awaited euro threatens to cost American business $30 billion \n     or more to buy new software and recode old programs, as \n     companies with interests on the other side of the Atlantic \n     attempt to adapt to the new currency. No later than Dec. 31, \n     1998, people doing business in Europe will have to rewrite \n     their computer software to handle three different base \n     currencies at once. The value of the euro will have to be \n     determined on a daily basis by its relationship to both the \n     dollar and other European currencies. In other words, every \n     bill, every financial statement, and every stock price in the \n     nine countries set to join what is known as the European \n     Monetary Union will have to be ``triangulated.'' So far, says \n     Sarwar Kashmeri, a corporate consultant specializing in the \n     issue, no commercial software exists to make that \n     calculation. ``We have been focusing very hard on the year-\n     2000 problem, but we've been missing the euro,'' says Gary \n     Johnson, an American attorney specializing in European \n     securities markets.\n       The two problems would seem to be unrelated. But the \n     coincidence in timing--the millennium bug and the currency \n     change arrive within a year of each other--has transformed \n     them into a larger, single crisis for many companies. The \n     well-publicized millennium-bug problem was unwittinly created \n     by computer programmers in the 1960s. In an effort to \n     maximize scarce computer memory, programmers left the first \n     two digits out of the year designation, so that 1997 reads \n     merely ``97.'' Theoretically, when the year 2000 arrives, 90 \n     percent of the world's computers will ``think'' it is 1900, \n     creating all kinds of chaos. According to the cost \n     conservative estimates, fixing the millennium bug will cost \n     American business between $50 billion and $150 billion.\n\n\n                               Bug zapper\n\n       Last year, after dire warnings of a technological disaster \n     at the dawn of the new century, companies rushed to hire \n     programmers to save the day. In doing so, they created a \n     labor shortage at a critical moment. Work on both the \n     millennium bug and the euro transition requires knowledge of \n     outdated COBOL computer systems. So all of a sudden, most of \n     the programmers who might be deployed to manage the \n     transition to the euro already have day jobs. ``There is a \n     tremendous shortage of those kinds of skill sets,'' confirms \n     Chris Fell, an executive at International Data corp.\n       Though the euro will be introduced in January 1999, it will \n     not become the sole currency in Europe until July 1, 2002. On \n     that date, all other currencies will be taken out of \n     circulation. While a large part of the U.S. business \n     community remains skeptical that Europe will pull off this \n     monetary feat, many companies have begun to accept that it \n     will. A few have begun to accept that it will. A few have \n     begun to take steps. DuPont, which has a significant presence \n     in Europe, has put together a team to prepare for the \n     introduction of the currency. United Parcel Service has done \n     the same. Both firms are looking into how to adapt their \n     computer systems.\n       The change to the euro will affect some companies more than \n     others. For example, Bloomberg Financial Markets, the world's \n     largest provider of financial information, will have to add \n     the euro to 10 year's worth of records--everything from \n     trading prices to financial statements. In a recent \n     Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Alliance Gaming \n     Corp. announced that it would probably have to ``redesign new \n     and, possibly, existing'' slot machines to accept new \n     currencies.\n       While the initial changeover to the euro may be a financial \n     headache, the vast new market created by the currency is \n     expected to be lucrative for American companies. And no \n     matter what it costs businesses on this side of the Atlantic \n     to adjust their information technologies, they can rest \n     assured that their European counterparts will be out even \n     more: The most recent estimate puts the price of converting \n     to the euro at $70 billion for European businesses.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 5, 1997]\n\nSocial Security Gets Year 2000 Warning--More Work Needed on Glitch, GAO \n                                  Says\n\n                       (By Rajiv Chandrasekaran)\n\n       The General Accounting Office today will warn that the \n     Social Security Administration (SSA) faces a possible \n     computer crash in the year 2000 because the agency has not \n     started analyzing or fixing several crucial systems affected \n     by the year 2000 software glitch.\n       Among the systems not yet analyzed are most of the 54 \n     computer systems that operate state disability determination \n     services, according to the GAO, the watchdog arm of Congress.\n       Those systems, which are operated by individual states but \n     funded by the federal government, process applicants for \n     Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability \n     Insurance, programs that currently assist 12.5 million \n     people.\n       ``Disruptions to this service due to incomplete Year 2000 \n     conversions will prevent or delay SSA's assistance to \n     millions of individuals across the country,'' Joel \n     Willemssen, the GAO's director of information resources \n     management, wrote in a report to be released today by Sen. \n     Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.).\n       The GAO also said the Social Security Administration has \n     not developed adequate contingency plans in case its \n     computers are not fixed in time.\n       The report, however, did not call into the question the \n     agency's ability to issue standard monthly Social Security \n     checks in 2000 and beyond.\n       The SSA has long been touted as the federal agency that is \n     most keenly aware of the year 2000 problem. The agency, whose \n     ``mission critical'' systems collectively had been thought to \n     have about 34 million lines of computer code, began making \n     year 2000 repairs almost a decade ago.\n       As a result, SSA officials have been asked to hold seminars \n     for other federal agencies about the issue and have been \n     singled out for praise by Congress in the past. The new \n     findings, congressional officials said, could create a new \n     round of uncertainty about the federal government's year 2000 \n     preparedness.\n       ``If Social Security, which we've thought had everything \n     under control, really doesn't, that raises new questions \n     about other agencies,'' said a congressional staffer.\n       The year 2000 problem exists because most large computer \n     systems have used a two-digit dating system that assumes that \n     1 and 9 are the first two digits of the year.\n       Without specialized reprogramming, the systems will think \n     the year 2000--or 00--is 1900, a glitch that could cause them \n     to go haywire.\n       According to the GAO, private contractors hired by the SSA \n     to fix the year 2000 glitch on 42 of the 54 state disability \n     determination services computers discovered 33 million \n     additional lines of code that need to be tested and, where \n     necessary, fixed.\n       The SSA did not include the state disability determination \n     systems in its initial assessment of the date glitch, but now \n     acknowledges that the systems are ``mission critical'' \n     because of their importance in determining whether a person \n     is medically eligible to receive disability payments, the GAO \n     report said.\n       Analyzing and fixing the problem likely will be a massive \n     undertaking. In just one office, the GAO said it found \n     600,000 lines of code in 400 programs that operate the \n     disability system.\n       Without a full understanding of the scope of the problem on \n     the state disability systems, ``SSA increases the risk that \n     benefits and services will be disrupted,'' the GAO wrote.\n       Kathleen M. Adams, SSA's chief information officer, said \n     the agency has recently received reports from all 50 states \n     detailing their plans to fix the disability systems.\n       ``They will be tested and implemented by December 1998, \n     like the rest of Social Security,'' Adams said. ``I am very \n     comfortable [the disability systems] will be ready.''\n       Adams said five states already have finished the conversion \n     work for the disability systems.\n       The GAO also said the SSA faces a significant challenge in \n     ensuring data that it exchanges with other federal and state \n     agencies will be year 2000 compliant.\n       ``Because SSA must rely on the hundreds of federal and \n     state agencies and the thousands of businesses with which it \n     exchanges files to make their systems compliant, SSA faces a \n     definite risk that inaccurate data will be introduced into \n     its databases,'' the GAO wrote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12636-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12637-S12640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OMNIBUS PATENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr President, Congress has the ``power to promote \nthe progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited times \nto Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective \nWritings and Discoveries.'' If that phrase sounds familiar to my \ncolleagues, it is because I lifted it straight from the Constitution. \nArticle 1, section 8, known to many as the inventors clause.\n  This section of the Constitution is the result of the foresight that \nour Founding Fathers had to cut a deal with the creative minds of a \nfledgling country. The deal was rather simple, in exchange for sharing \ntheir ingenuity and their creations with the citizens of this new \ncountry, the Congress would grant these inventors temporary monopolies \non their products and permit them to enjoy the proceeds of their \ninvention for a period of time, with the weight of the law of the land \nto ensure those rights were protected.\n  This was a carefully thought out concept by rather brilliant \nindividuals with unquestioned foresight. In my opinion, this compromise \nhas been a smashing success. In the past 220 years,\n\n[[Page S12638]]\n\nthe United States has become an economic, industrial, and intellectual \nsuperpower. The creative product of the U.S. is unmatched the world \nover and I believe that the United States patent system has played a \ncentral role in this success.\n  Why am I sharing these thoughts with my colleagues, because it is \njust like the Federal Government to take a good idea and turn it on its \nhead. There is legislation pending on the Senate Calender, with the \nstrong backing of the Clinton administration, that would gut the \nprotection and the incentives offered inventors by our patent and \ntrademark laws. This country's inventors have been an indispensable \nforce in the success of which I have spoken. But this legislation would \ntip the balance of protection offered by patent laws away from these \ninventors and thinkers and open them to the hostile environment of \nintellectual property piracy and idea predators--commonplace in other \nparts of the world. Our inventors will be jerked from a protective \nenvironment, known for nurturing creativity and advancing practical \nknowledge, and be cast into a far harsher arena where it will be \neminently more difficult for inventors to secure their rights and enjoy \nthe rewards of their creativity and entrepreneurship--and possibly be \ndriven from their work all together.\n  I am hear to speak out on behalf of the inventors and the small guys \nof this country. People with ideas. I would suspect that scattered \nthroughout the bill there may be some good ideas that may improve the \nefficiency of the Patent and Trademark Office, but taken as a whole the \nchanges proposed would stifle rather than promote the sciences and the \nuseful arts. I believe the legislation is ill-conceived and I will \nfight it should it see Senate debate.\n  The past couple of weeks, the Senate has been debating the state of \nmanufacturing in the United States. Many of my colleagues have \nregistered their concern that much of our manufacturing base has left \nthe country and they fear that this trend will continue. I believe that \nthere is a future for manufacturing and industry in this country. I am \nvery encouraged by the number of small businesses and startup companies \npresently thriving in the United States. Much of our future lies with \nthese startup businesses and small business people that are creating \nnew technology, starting companies, and expanding employment \nopportunities. But I believe we need to seize the opportunity and \ncontinue to encourage it.\n  This is where the patent comes into the equation. A great idea can \ncome to anyone, regardless of his or her capital or financial \nresources. This is the point at which the magnificence of our system \nbecomes clear to me. Should a person be the first with an idea and \nsuccessfully document that idea, that person can be granted a patent. \nThe patent secures a monopoly and if it is a good idea it can be \nshopped around the venture capital markets. Should the financial \nassistance be secured, the inventor can build a prototype, start a \nbusiness, hire people, and perhaps even build a successful company and \nmake money.\n  I believe that strong patent protection is central to that equation. \nFirst, those with capital are not inclined to fork over some money \nbecause it is the nice thing to do, they want assurances of return. The \nlegally protected monopoly provides that assurance. The fact that our \npatent laws offer the strongest possible protection also contributes to \nthat assurance. The inventor's idea is held in secret at the patent \noffice until it is granted, which by the way prevents theft. The law \nalso grants a legal right upon which an inventor can bring a civil \naction for damages should that idea be infringed upon. Strong patent \nprotection lends value and certainty to this temporary monopoly.\n  Without the patent protection, ideas that are not backed by financial \nresources may never see the light of day or else they may be gobbled up \nby a large company for pennies on the dollar. If one does not hold a \nrealistic belief that they can make a go of it with their own idea, I \nbelieve that stifles important incentives present in America to pursue \nan idea or invent. But even more so, I do not believe this is the \nAmerican way. This is a great country because anyone with an idea and \nthe fortitude to pursue that idea can make a go it. This country is \nfull of companies that began under just such circumstances.\n  This country needs its entrepreneurs, they are essential if we are to \ncontinue to enjoy economic growth. Think about the role of \nentrepreneurs and startup companies in our economy. They come up with \nnew ideas, they promote competition, they shake up old establishments, \nthey force competitors to be smart and competitive, they inject vigor \nand dynamism into our capitalistic system. They create manufacturing \njobs right here in the United States. They create secure and well-\npaying jobs for Americans. And they give you, me, and our children new \ntechnology and news ideas for all our use. This force is essential to \nour strength and continued growth and the patent laws are essential to \nallowing these start-ups to begin and then thrive.\n  Many of those that are pushing for this bill are large companies with \nvast financial resources. Before they put forward their arguments in \nfavor of the legislation, I must challenge them to ask themselves some \nimportant questions. Did not their companies begin with a single person \nwith an idea? Did they not seize the opportunities offered in this \ncountry to grow and flourish? Did not the patent offer protection \nneeded to pursuing that idea? Pulling the ladder up once you have made \nit to the top is not the American way, but that agenda is underlying \nmuch of this legislation.\n  I support the inventors who are fighting these changes. I believe \nthey are correct and courageous in their stance. Unfortunately, they \nhave been ridiculed and vilified in the press by the Commissioner of \nthe PTO, the individual running the agency responsible for licensing \nbillions of dollars in intellectual property rights here in the United \nStates. In fact, I read that he said that the opponents of this bill, \nthat would include myself, reside on the lunatic fringe. He also \ncompared our sanity to that of Timothy McVeigh--on behalf of the \nhardworking inventors of this country, I find such comments outrageous \nand demeaning. But rather than dignifying those ridiculous comments by \nresponding on the merits, I will share with my colleagues a sampling of \nthose that Mr. Lehman is saying reside on the lunatic fringe.\n  First, I have been contacted by countless inventors registering their \nopposition, their creations include medical devices, drugs, machinery, \nelectronic technology, computer technology, and agricultural products--\nto mention a few. They share a fear that this will open them up to \nlitigation, theft, and harassment while closing down their \nopportunities to continue their work. I have also been contacted by men \nand women of science, economists, doctors, and professors. The most \nnotable group of objectors is a group of over 20 Nobel Laureates in \nscience and economics who have signed an open letter to the U.S. Senate \nopposing the bill. These great minds all agree that this legislation \ncould result in ``lasting harm to the United States and to the world.'' \nThey also concur with the concerns I am advancing today that this bill \nwill be very harmful to small inventors and ``discourage the flow of \nnew inventions that have contributed so much to America's superior \nperformance in the advancement of science and technology.'' Finally, \nthese great scientists and economists have expressed concern that this \nbill will create a disincentive to rely on the limited life of a patent \nto share their creations with the public, an occurrence which will sap \nthe spirit of the inventors clause.\n  I think that opposition should be enough to convince just about \nanyone. But respected others, including the New York Times, have spoken \nout. The Times editorial page has concluded that this bill will \n``dampen the innovative spirit that helps sustain the American \neconomy.'' The Times also correctly notes that the American patent \nsystem generates more and better patent applications than any other \ncountry's, but that this bill terribly threatens the incentives present \nin our system that stimulates that creativity.\n\n  I have also been contacted by Ross Perot, who has expressed in no \nuncertain terms his absolute objection to this legislation. As Mr. \nPerot reminded me, patents are a constitutionally guaranteed right \nwhich have been essential to countless Americans in their\n\n[[Page S12639]]\n\nfulfillment of the American dream. But rather than celebrate this \nsuccess story unique to America, we are proposing selling our inventors \ndown the river. Mr. Perot has called upon the Members of Congress to \nask themselves a simple question when considering this bill, is it \nright or is it wrong? We both agree it is wrong. And we are ready for a \nfight. Mr. Perot, whose dedication to America and success as a \nbusinessman cannot be questioned, has said, in the words of Isaac Hull, \n``If that fellow wants a fight, we won't disappoint him.''\n  There are other well-respected groups, small business groups and \ngroups of concerned citizens that believe this legislation is bad \npolicy and are lining up for a fight.\n  I will take the collective contribution of those that oppose this \nbill and stack them up against Mr. Lehman's arguments any day. The \ninventors of this country should derive confidence because they have \nthe Constitution and many great minds of science on their side and \nrhetoric on the other.\n  For those reviewing the bill, I would like to point out some issues.\n  First, the proponents of the bill want to create an infringement \ndefense, known as a prior user right. The prior user right is a bad \nidea for many reasons. Foremost, it starts down a road that changes our \n``first to invent'' system and overturns 200 years of U.S. patent \npolicy. The defense would not only permit inventors to keep their ideas \nsecret, but it encourages them to keep them secret. Our first to invent \nsystem protects small inventors. If they document their invention, they \nwill not have to engage in a race to the patent office. They will have \ntime to tinker and perfect their inventions without being forced to \nfile early and then file for all perfections, a costly process for a \nsmall inventor.\n  The defense will hurt small inventors in the capital markets because \nit will undermine the certainty of the patent. As I said this certainty \nis important to attracting capital and the capital is important for \nunderfunded inventors to take their products to market. Should one have \nan invention that requires expensive testing, the idea can not be \nperfected without finances. Capital is essential for inventors to role \nout their own ideas. This section poses many problems about which I \ncould speak for quite some time, but I will refrain. The reasons will \nbe aired fully in time.\n  Many proponents want to force all inventors to publish their ideas \nafter 18 months, regardless of whether the patent review process is \ncompleted. Some changes have been made to scale this back, but many are \nlaying in wait to see this implemented. I believe this would open our \ninventors to theft. Small inventors would have to go to court to recoup \ntheir just rewards and would have to depend on costly litigation. Many \nsay, ``We won't steal ideas,'' I hope not, but this is the business \nworld. I am unwilling to put small inventors at this sort of a risk.\n  Proponents are looking for changes in the system for challenges to \npatents, this may open small inventors to unnecessary expense and \nlitigation. Taken as a whole, there are profound changes proposed. The \ncollective weight, I believe, will hurt our small inventors.\n  A quick word about an argument forwarded by the bill's proponents. \nThey will come to your office saying that this bill is necessary \nbecause there is a pariah lurking in the world of intellectual \nproperty. He uses what is called a submarine patent to manipulate the \npatent review process to reap unjustified rewards from honest, hard-\nworking men and women. His greed and treachery could potentially \ndestroy thousands of businesses and deal a crushing blow to our \neconomy.\n  To that I respond--hogwash. Let's engage in an honest debate. When we \nin Congress agreed to the implementing language in the GATT agreement, \nwe agreed to change the U.S. patent term from a guaranteed 17 years to \n20 years from the date of filing. Supposedly, that was done to get at \nsubmarine patents. It does take away most if not all of the incentive \nfor an inventor to game the system and should drive a stake into the \nheart of wrongdoers.\n  In the process we made a tremendous sacrifice that will cost many of \nour inventors patent protection. Today, for each day beyond 3 years \nthat a patent lingers in the patent office, our inventors will lose a \nday of patent protection. Should someone invent a better potato peeler \nor candy wrapper, it probable won't be in the office today. But the \nchange could have a significant affect on those attempting to get a \npatent on breakthrough technology. Such technology can often stay under \nreview in the office for years and subsequently our inventors have lost \nyears of protection compared with what they enjoyed before the change. \nOur inventors have made a great sacrifice to root out the wrongdoers in \nthe system. But the proponents of this bill want more.\n  They do have more. The PTO has a computer system designed to track \npatent applications that appear to be those of one attempting to game \nthe system. The Commissioner also has the power to order that the \napplication of one attempting to game the system is published, further \ncurtailing the possibility of the submarine patents. Finally, the \nCommissioner himself has said that only 1 percent of 1 percent of \npatent applications could be considered submarine patents.\n  The Commissioner has plenty of tools at his disposal to curb this \nproblem if it in fact exists. If the problem is out of control, then I \nbelieve the problem lies with the Commissioner and those with \ncomplaints would be better served leveling their concerns at the other \nend of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I will conclude by saying that brilliant minds have been drawn to \nthis country and the brilliant minds native to this country have \nflourished. I do not believe it is an accident. We in America have \nchosen our own path. The goal of our patent system is to protect and \nreward entrepreneurs and innovative businesses, to encourage invention \nand advancement of practical knowledge. The goal of many of our \ncompetitor systems is to share technology immediately, not to protect \nit. That results in preserving the corporate hierarchy without giving \ninnovators the opportunity to compete.\n  In other countries thoughts and ideas do not receive the level of \nreward that they do here. The system works, let us not destroy it. If \nwe want to improve the Patent Office, let's get on with it. But let us \nnot organize a systematic assault on the very system that has \ncontributed so much to this country becoming the greatest Nation on \nEarth.\n  I ask that two letters and an op-ed be printed in the Record.\n                                               September 11, 1997.\n     An Open Letter To the U.S. Senate:\n       We urge the Senate to oppose the passage of the pending \n     U.S. Senate Bill S. 507. We hold that Congress, before \n     embarking on a revision of our time tested patent system, \n     should hold extensive hearings on whether there are serious \n     flaws in the present system that need to be addressed and if \n     so, how best to deal with them. This is especially important \n     considering that a delicate structure such as the patent \n     system, with all its ramifications, should not be subject to \n     frequent modifications. We believe that S. 507 could result \n     in lasting harm to the United States and the world.\n       First, it will prove very damaging to American small \n     inventors and thereby discourage the flow of new inventions \n     that have contributed so much to America's superior \n     performance in the advancement of Science and technology. It \n     will do so by curtailing the protection they obtain through \n     patents relative to the large multi-national corporations.\n       Second, the principle of prior user rights saps the very \n     spirit of that wonderful institution that is represented by \n     the American patent system established in the Constitution in \n     1787, which is based on the principle that the inventor is \n     given complete protection but for a limited length of time, \n     after which the patent, fully disclosed in the application \n     and published at the time of issue, becomes in the public \n     domain, and can be used by anyone, under competitive \n     conditions for the benefit of all final users. It will do so \n     by giving further protection to trade secrets which can be \n     kept secret forever, while reducing the incentive to rely on \n     limited life patents.\n     Nobel Laureates in support of the letter to congress, re: \n         Senate Bill 507\n       Franco Modigliani, (1985, Economics) MIT.\n       Robert Solow, (1987, Economics) MIT.\n       Mario Molina, (1995, Chemistry) MIT.\n       Roald Hoffman, (1981, Chemistry) Cornell.\n       Milton Friedman, (1976, Economics) University of Chicago.\n       Richard Smalley, (1996, Chemistry) Rice.\n       Clifford Shull, (1994, Physics) MIT.\n       Herbert A.

Christopher S. Bond,\n     Russell Building, Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I want to thank you personally for \n     having the courage and integrity to oppose the Patent Bill \n     now pending before Congress--Senate Bill 507. This Bill will \n     destroy our patent system and remove all incentives for \n     people to create revolutionary new products.\n       In addition, I would like to thank Senate Majority Leader \n     Trent Lott for standing on principle and refusing to allow \n     this bill to be sneaked through the Senate without hearings \n     or debate.\n       Obviously, some members of the Senate feel that the owners \n     of the country--the people--have no right to know what \n     Congress is doing.\n       Under this law, inventors' new products still pending \n     approval, will be made available to all nations, with many \n     countries shamelessly mass-producing these products and \n     ignoring the inventors' rights.\n       The only recourse for the inventor is to petition the newly \n     created World Trade Organization, where our country only has \n     one unweighted--and believe it or not, the inventor has no \n     recourse in the United States court system. Does anybody \n     really think that this complies with our Constitution?\n       Granting patent rights to inventors is a Constitutional \n     right--clearly spelled out in our Constitution in Article I, \n     Section 8.\n       Please remind every member of Congress that it is illegal \n     to amend the Constitution by passing laws.\n       The only way the Constitution can be amended is through the \n     amendment process. Isn't this a whole lot better than leaving \n     it up to the lobbyists, foreign governments, and \n     corporations? The framers of the Constitution knew what they \n     were doing. Let's follow the rules.\n       Congress has no business even thinking about circumventing \n     the Constitution with a combination of federal law and \n     international trade agreements.\n       What would our country and the world be like today if \n     Robert Fulton has not invented the steam engine, Thomas \n     Edison had not invented the electric light, Alexander Graham \n     Bell had not invented the telephone and made instant \n     worldwide communication possible, The Wright brothers had not \n     invented the airplane, Edwin Armstrong had not harnessed the \n     airways and made radio and television possible, Jack Kilby \n     and Robert Noyce had not invented the integrated circuit, \n     just to mention a few.\n       A few years ago two young men, Ralph Lagergren and Mark \n     Underwood, from Kansas had revolutionary ideas about how to \n     improve the combine used to harvest grain. They had great \n     ideas, but no money.\n       Using their brains, wits, and creativity as a substitute \n     for money, they successfully created this new product and now \n     hold over 25 patents.\n       John Deere purchased the technologies and patent rights for \n     several million dollars.\n       I had the privilege of showing 4,000 Future Farmers of \n     America a videotape of their great work. These teenagers were \n     electrified, because Ralph's and Mark's success made these \n     young people realize that it is still possible to dream great \n     dreams in America and make those dreams come true.\n       Can't we agree that inventors should not have their \n     Constitutional rights violated and they should be paid for \n     their creative ideas and inventions?\n       Patent rights and the creativity and ingenuity of United \n     States inventors have been instrumental in giving the United \n     States our world leadership.\n       Why is this happening? Because our large corporations, \n     foreign governments, and foreign companies who contributed \n     millions of dollars to the 1996 political campaigns want to \n     steal our inventors' new patents. If you question this \n     statement, get a list of the companies working to lobby this \n     change through Congress.\n       Patents are property rights under U.S. Law. It is immoral \n     and inexcusable for large corporations to band together and \n     spend a fortune trying to lobby this Bill secretly through \n     Congress, so that the creative ideas of United States \n     inventors can literally be stolen.\n       Why don't these people admit that what they are trying to \n     get done is no better than robbing a bank. In fact, it is \n     even worse to steal an individual's inventions so that \n     companies can increase corporate profits.\n       If this is such a good idea, why has this whole process \n     been carried out behind closed doors in Congress, with people \n     supporting this Bill doing everything they can to avoid \n     public debates on the floor of the House and Senate?\n       The answer it is cannot stand the harsh light of public \n     scrutiny.\n       I want to thank you and every member of the House and \n     Senate who have stood up to the tremendous pressure you are \n     subjected to. I know that many of you have been threatened \n     about what the special interests will do to you in the next \n     election. You are living Commodore Maury's words--``When \n     principle is involved, be deaf to expediency.''\n       Just let these people know that all the special interest \n     money in the world is not worth one penny unless it will buy \n     the votes of the American people. I, and millions of other \n     Americans who share your concerns over Constitutional rights \n     and protecting our inventors' great new ideas, will be \n     working night and day to see that people who have the \n     character and integrity to stand up to this tremendous \n     pressure are overwhelmingly re-elected.\n       I challenge the people supporting this Bill to come out of \n     the closet, face the American people, and have an open debate \n     on this issue, but I won't hold my breath waiting for them to \n     do it. That is not the way they operate, and they will all be \n     embarrassed if they attempt to do it.\n       I will pay for the television time to allow a national \n     debate on this issue. The only problem we will have is that \n     the people who are for this Bill will not show up, because it \n     cannot withstand the light of public scrutiny, and they will \n     pressure the television networks not to sell the time.\n       If this Bill passes, A Constitutional lawsuit will be filed \n     immediately. Foreign nations and corporations will know that \n     the 21st Century pirates for hire reside in the U.S. \n     Congress. Those who vote for it will be paid off handsomely. \n     The people who voted for it will be forced to defend their \n     actions in their 1998 campaigns. It will be a major \n     Constitutional violation issue in the 2000 campaigns.\n       Isn't it time for our elected officials to stop debating \n     whether their actions are legal or illegal, and ask only one \n     question, ``Is it right or wrong?''\n       Finally, before voting for this Bill, ask every member of \n     the House and Senate who plan to vote for this Bill, to read \n     the words of Isaac Hull, Captain of the U.S.S. Constitution, \n     Old Ironsides--``If that fellow wants a fight, we won't \n     disappoint him.''\n       Again, thank you for your leadership--thank you for your \n     courage--thank you for standing on principle.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ross Perot.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 17, 1997]\n\n                           A Bad Patent Bill\n\n       The Senate is considering a misguided bill to recast the \n     patent laws in ways that would threaten small inventors and \n     dampen the innovative spirit that helps sustain America's \n     economy. The bill is so mischievous that it has attracted an \n     unusual coalition of opponents--including the icon of of \n     liberal economists, Paul Samuelson, the icon of conservative \n     economists, Milton Friedman, and 26 other Nobel Prize-winning \n     scientists and economists.\n       Patent laws currently require inventors to disclose their \n     secrets in return for the exclusive right to market their \n     product for up to 20 years. Early disclosure helps the \n     economy by putting new ideas immediately into the hands of \n     people who, for a fee to the patent holder, find novel and \n     commercially applicable uses for these ideas. Extended \n     protection, meanwhile, provides a huge incentive for \n     inventors to keep inventing. The American system generates \n     more and better patent applications than any other country's.\n       The Senate bill would weaken patent protection for small \n     inventors by requiring inventors who file for both American \n     and foreign patents to publish their secrets 18 months after \n     filing rather than when the patent is issued. Small inventors \n     say that premature publication gives away their secret if \n     their application fails. It would also allow large \n     corporations with the financial muscle to fend off subsequent \n     legal challenges to maneuver around the patent even if it is \n     later issued.\n       Worse, the bills would encourage corporations to avoid the \n     patent process altogether. Under current law, companies that \n     rely on unpatented trade secrets run the risk that someone \n     else will patent their invention and charge them royalties. \n     The Senate bill would permit companies whose trade secrets \n     are later patented by someone else to continue to market \n     their products without paying royalties. Encouraging \n     corporations to hide secrets is the opposite of what an \n     economy that relies on information needs.\n       Pesky patent holders do in fact get in the way of large \n     corporations. But the economy thrives on independent \n     initiative. Small inventors need ironclad patent protection \n     so that they are not forced into a legal scrum with financial \n     giants. The House of Representatives and the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee approved the patent bill without hearing the \n     country's leading economists and scientists make their case. \n     Senate sponsors now say they will try. Congress needs to hear \n     the critics out before proceeding to any more votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12637-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12640-S12641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONNECTICUT TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer congratulations \nto an\n\n[[Page S12641]]\n\noutstanding mathematics teacher, Marianne Roche Cavanaugh, who has been \nnamed the 1998 Connecticut Teacher of the Year. Mrs. Cavanaugh has \ndemonstrated a lifetime of dedication to the students of Glastonbury's \nPublic Schools, and she has set a standard of excellence for both her \nstudents and other educators. I want to express my gratitude and \nadmiration for the commitment that she has displayed over her 22 years \nin teaching.\n  Mrs. Cavanaugh has had a distinguished career marked with various \nawards and achievements. She single-handedly created the Gideon Wells \nMarathon--an academic and community involvement program for 7th and 8th \ngraders. Since 1994, students have raised more than $20,000 by securing \npledges for each math problem they solve in 1 hour during the Marathon. \nThe accumulated funds have been donated to charities chosen by the \nstudents. In addition, Mrs. Cavanaugh has directed district-wide \nprofessional development, and has co-developed a problem solving math \ncurriculum, which emphasizes writing, calculator use, problem solving, \nand interdisciplinary activities. Imaginative and productive ideas such \nas these have earned Mrs. Cavanaugh the distinction of being a finalist \nfor the prestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics \nand Science Teaching in both 1986 and 1998, as well as being the winner \nof the Celebration of Excellence Award in 1986.\n  The purpose of the Connecticut Teacher of the Year Program is to \nidentify, from among many outstanding teachers, one teacher to serve as \na visible and vocal representative of what is best in the profession. \nThrough her innovative ideas, dedication to the institutional \ndevelopment of mathematics, and love for her profession and her \nstudents, Mrs. Cavanaugh has clearly earned this prestigious honor.\n  While I commend Mrs. Cavanaugh for her display of excellence in \nteaching, I want also to mention that her work is representative of the \nwork of many educators that too often remain unrecognized. A survey \ndone by the National Center for Education Statistics in 1995 found that \nonly 54 percent of all teachers feel respected by society in their \nprofession. Teachers fill an enormously important role in shaping the \ndevelopmental experiences of children during the impressionable ages of \nchildhood and adolescence. They serve not only to educate, but to \nmentor, motivate, influence, and inspire our children. Thanks to Mrs. \nCavanaugh and other quality teachers like her throughout the State and \nthe Nation, we have a brighter future ahead of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12640-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12641-S12642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GREAT LAKES WATER QUALITY AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this year marks the 25th anniversary \nof the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which has united Canada and \nthe United States in their dedication to protecting the biological, \nchemical, and physical integrity of the Great Lakes. The commitment of \nboth countries to manage water quality on an ecosystem basis has been \nso successful that other regions often praise our accomplishments and \nstrive to achieve the same high quality of management. I applaud the \nefforts of both countries in the last 25 years to achieve the goals set \nforth in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and urge that they \ncontinue to work cooperatively to maintain and improve Great Lakes \nwater quality during the next 25 years.\n  On April 15, 1972, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was signed \nby President Richard Nixon and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as a \nbinational pledge to reduce and prevent pollution in the Great Lakes. \nThe impetus for this agreement was the deteriorated quality of the \nGreat Lakes into which we discharged our untreated wastes. In fact, \nLake Erie was declared dead because of its poor quality and the \nCuyahoga River had even caught fire. Lake Erie and Lake Ontario \nsuffered from high phosphorus loadings which caused excessive amounts \nof algae to grow and deplete the water of oxygen. Low oxygen levels in \nthe lakes caused fish to die. Other contaminants discharged into the \nwater entered the food chain and caused deformities in the fish and \nwildlife of the region.\n  The initial agreement concentrated on reducing phosphorus and \npollutants entering our lakes through municipal and industrial \ndischarges. As a result of the 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality \nAgreement, phosphorus levels significantly decreased in the Great \nLakes. In Lake Erie and Ontario, phosphorus loadings have been reduced \nby almost 80 percent. The United States and Canada achieved this \nbinational goal through improvements in sewage treatment, lowering the \nlevels of phosphorus in detergents, and reducing agricultural runoff.\n  While significant improvements were being made in controlling \nphosphorus and other wastewater discharges, researchers showed that \ntoxic substances were a major concern. Persistent toxic substances, \nsuch as DDT, DDE, mercury, and PCB's, bioaccumulate in organisms and \nincrease in concentration up the food chain. Some substances have been \nshown to cause birth defects in wildlife and adverse health effects in \nhumans.\n  As a result, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was revised in \n1978 to meet the challenge of controlling toxics and included an \necosystem approach to managing the water quality of the Great Lakes \nbasin. The two countries committed themselves to achieving zero \ndischarge of toxic substances in toxic amounts and the virtual \nelimination of persistent toxic substances.\n  Due to the United States and Canadian commitment to reduce toxic \nsubstance releases, some major strides have been accomplished. The \ncormorant population in the Great Lakes region has significantly \nincreased from 1950's to 1970's levels when the number of nesting pairs \nof cormorants dropped by 86 percent. Between 1971 and 1989, \nconcentrations of DDE and PCB's decreased in cormorant eggs by more \nthan 80 percent.\n  An additional refinement of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement \noccurred with the 1987 protocol which reinforced the 1978 commitments \nof the two countries and highlighted the importance of human and \naquatic ecosystem health. Provisions were added to clean up 42 local \nareas of concern in the Great Lakes and included the development and \nimplementation of remedial action plans [RAP's] and lakewide management \nplans.\n  A challenge to controlling pollutants entering the Great Lakes exists \nsince toxics and other pollutants enter the system in numerous ways. \nTherefore, the 1987 protocol also focused on nonpoint source pollution, \ncontaminated sediments, airborne toxic substances, and contaminated \ngroundwater.\n  Since the 1987 protocol, accomplishments have been made in the areas \nof concern. In 1994, Collingwood Harbour, ON, attained its restoration \ngoals. The community worked together to insure that the contaminated \nsediments and deteriorated fish and wildlife habitats were dealt with \nin an innovative and cost-effective manner. On our side of the border, \na fish consumption advisory was lifted for the first time in two \ndecades at Waukegan Harbor, IL, in February of this year. The harbor is \nan area of concern which has been undergoing remediation efforts to \nclean up the largest known-concentration of PCB's and PCB contaminated \nsediments.\n  Though toxic substances continue to pollute the Great Lakes and \nthreaten the health of humans and wildlife, there also have been \naccomplishments in controlling some toxics. For instance, \nconcentrations of poly-chlorinated compounds, such as dioxins and \nfurans which are used in the bleaching process of pulp and paper mills, \nhave decreased in the Great Lakes by 90 percent since the late 1980's.\n  While improvements in Great Lakes water quality are evident, they \nhave not come quickly enough nor have they addressed all facets of the \nproblem. Moreover, the most difficult challenge laid out by the Great \nLakes Water Quality Agreement is still before us--the virtual \nelimination of persistent toxic substances. Much more work needs to be \ndone in this arena. Fortunately, the Great Lakes Water Quality \nAgreement is precisely the vehicle which will enable us to rise to the \nchallenge of virtually eliminating persistent toxic substances in the \nGreat Lakes. Though crafted 25 years ago, the agreement and its \namendments remain, in its current form, a vital road\n\n[[Page S12642]]\n\nmap for the restoration and protection of the Great Lakes. I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in respecting this agreement so that future \ngenerations will be able to enjoy a thriving Great Lakes ecosystem. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12641-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS\n\n Mr. WARNER.

  TRIBUTE TO MICHELE JOHNSON\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of \ncommending the efforts of Michele Johnson, a legislative assistant on \nmy staff who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this session. \nMichele's conscientiousness and exceptional work will be missed.\n  Michele Johnson, a native of rural Michigan, ND, and graduate of the \nUniversity of North Dakota, has served on my staff for almost 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. Michele has distinguished herself by her meticulous attention to \ndetail and her ability to tackle a wide range of issues critical to our \nState. She has been of great help in our work to bring change to the \nNation's agricultural credit system in order to help farmers who are \nstruggling financially. She has also played an instrumental role in \nefforts we have undertaken to bring much needed economic and rural \ndevelopment to every corner of North Dakota. Her accomplishments in \nthese areas will have a positive impact for years to come.\n  A lawyer by training, Michele has most recently tackled a very \ndifficult assignment. In the wake of this year's millennium flood, she \nvolunteered to go to Grand Forks to assist in the Red River Valley's \ndisaster recovery efforts. Even before the floodwaters had receded, \nMichele had packed her bags and arrived in Grand Forks to be a part of \nthe onsite assistance team.\n  While in Grand Forks Michele brought a local perspective to the \nFederal disaster response and her firsthand experience was enormously \nhelpful in our efforts to lay the groundwork for North Dakota's long-\nterm recovery. In her work, she earned high praise and recognition from \ncommunity leaders up and down the Red River Valley.\n  We will miss Michele's contributions to the office, including her \ncheerful presence and enthusiasm. Thanks, Michele, for a job well done. \nWe wish you well as you move on to your next assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12642-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12642-S12643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to discuss one important \nhealth care initiative in New York State. This worthy project is the \nMontefiore Medical Center and it is located in the Bronx section of New \nYork City.\n  The Montefiore Medical Center system, established over 100 years ago, \nis an integrated health delivery system with two acute care hospitals \nproviding access to over 1,000 beds, 30 community-based primary care \ncenters, and a range of other outreach services operating in the Bronx \nand the surrounding communities. Through its extensive network, \nincluding comprehensive-care sites in some of the Nation's most \neconomically deprived areas, Montefiore provides care to medically \nunderserved residents. The Montefiore system provides nearly 20 percent \nof all inpatient acute care, and nearly 40 percent of all tertiary care \nrequired by Bronx residents, including over $50 million in \nuncompensated charity care annually. In addition, in partnership with \nthe Children's Health Fund, Montefiore administers the Nation's largest \nmedical program for homeless children.\n  The Bronx is home to 400,000 children under age 21. In 1995, \nMontefiore conducted an extensive review of the health status of Bronx \nchildren and concluded that the overwhelming majority are at serious \nhealth risk, for reasons such as abuse, pediatric AIDS, lead poisoning, \nand asthma. In particular, asthma is the most serious health risk to \nBronx children. Nearly one-third of births in the borough are to \nteenage mothers who receive no pre-natal care. As a result, the child \nhospitalization rate is 50 percent above the national average.\n  Montefiore's study also demonstrated that a fundamental restructuring \nof its pediatric health care delivery system should be necessary to \nmeet the growing challenge of providing services to these extremely at-\nrisk children. Managed care is rapidly transforming how health care \nservices are delivered in underserved communities. To remain viable in \nthe evolving health care marketplace, Montefiore's child health \ntreatment, prevention, and education services must be organized and \nefficiently coordinated.\n\n[[Page S12643]]\n\n  Montefiore has long been recognized as one of the Nation's premier \npediatric research and training institutions, having trained a \nsignificant percentage of the country's pediatricians. In recent years, \nMontefiore has lost substantial numbers of pediatric specialists to \nmore traditional children's hospitals which could have a dramatic \nimpact on the numbers of physicians who practice in inner-city \ncommunities. To ease the competitive disadvantage and ensure its \ncapacity to retain critically needed pediatric resources for the Bronx, \nMontefiore must consolidate pediatric specialists and specialty care in \none location, a children's hospital.\n  To meet the enormous challenge of providing high-quality, \ncomprehensive services for Bronx children, Montefiore will develop the \nMontefiore Medical Center Child Health Network [CHN], an integrated \nsystem of family-centered care for families of all socio-economic \nlevels. The CHN, organized around the core principal of providing \nenhanced access to high quality primary care, will offer a full \ncomplement of child health services.\n  As the central institution of the CHN, the Montefiore Children's \nHospital will feature 106 beds in age-appropriate units, state-of-the-\nart pediatric emergency and intensive care units, a full spectrum of \ntertiary subspecialties, including environmental sciences and \nbehavioral pediatrics, a short-stay day hospital, support facilities \nand services for children and their families, including playrooms, \nschool facilities, and a family resource center, and lastly, innovative \ncommunications technologies including a telemedicine consultation \nservice and on-line teaching and tele-conferencing capabilities.\n  Montefiore Medical Center has provided community services and \ncommunity-based health care programs for over a century. It is uniquely \nqualified to implement an initiative as innovative and far reaching as \nthe child health network. This initiative will strengthen and extend \nMontefiore's commitment to the Bronx community as a whole, and the \nchildren of the Bronx in particular. Through the centralization of its \ndiverse services in this borough of New York City, the new Children's \nHospital and its satellites will elevate the quality, scope, and \naccessibility of primary and specialty health care services available \nto children and their families.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services \nSubcommittee on Appropriations includes a reference to this initiative \nin its report. The language is as follows:\n\n       The health status of children living in the Bronx section \n     of New York City is particularly worrisome with \n     sociodemographic and health status indicators which \n     underscore a need for improved health care services. The \n     Committee is aware of plans to establish a state-of-the-art \n     children's hospital in the Bronx to address the critical \n     needs of its pediatric population. To enhance current Federal \n     child health care programs in the area, the Committee \n     encourages the Department to assist in the planning of this \n     new facility and its potential programs.\n\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the administration, the \nCongress, and the medical center on developing a Federal partnership \nfor this initiative. This initiative could serve as a national model of \nhow complete health systems can adapt and respond to the very unique \nand challenging health needs of children in medically underserved urban \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12642-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFIRMATION OF CHARLES R.

Mr. President, I stand today to recognize the \nachievements and progress of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in \nPaducah, KY. On October 20, 1997, Industry Week Magazine named the \nPaducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant one of America's top 10 plants. This \nwould be a greater honor for any manufacturer, but I feel that it is \nparticularly remarkable for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. When \nproducing a potentially dangerous material like enriched uranium, \nextensive safety precautions have to be their first priority. The \nuranium they produce is shipped not only throughout the United States, \nbut worldwide as well, to be used in the nuclear fuel cycle.\n  The 275 plants nominated for this honor were judged in 14 areas \nincluding productivity, quality of product, employee involvement, cost \nreduction, and customer focus. The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant is \nimpressive in all of these areas, and their performance has improved \nimmensely over the past 5 years. In 1993, analysts predicted that the \nplant would have to close in the early 21st century, but continuous \nimprovements have put an end to this speculation. There has been a 65-\npercent reduction in injuries over the past 5 years, a reduction in \nenvironmental concerns, and an impressive 100-percent on-time \nproduction delivery rate.\n  The 1,800 workers of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, most of \nwhich are Kentuckians, are truly to be commended. These workers and \ntheir management team have visited other quality plants for innovative \nideas about how to improve their own production. They have formed over \n30 problem-solving teams, solicited and acted on advice from employees, \nand engaged in extensive and continual annual training. The positive \nlabor-management relationship has successfully turned the\n\n[[Page S12644]]\n\n750-acre facility into thriving, cost-controlled, internationally \ncompetitive business. They have worked remarkably well on a daily basis \nwith inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as with \nofficials from the U.S. Enrichment Corp. The U.S. Enrichment Corp., \nwhich manages both the Paducah and the Pikeville, OH, plants, supplies \n80 percent of the nuclear fuel for nuclear plants in the United States, \nand maintains 44 percent of the world enrichment market.\n  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations and thanks to the \nemployees of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The plant's \nappropriate slogan is ``Survive and Thrive,'' and they have done just \nthat. The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant not only provides jobs and \nbenefits to western Kentuckians, but it helps the United States remain \nself-reliant for our nuclear fuel production.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12643-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HENRI TERMEER WINS MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR'S NEW AMERICAN APPRECIATION \n                                 AWARD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to take this \nopportunity to commend Henri Termeer of Massachusetts on receiving the \nGovernor's New American Appreciation Award from Governor Weld earlier \nthis year.\n  Henri Termeer is well known to many of us in Congress. He is the \nchief executive officer and president of Genzyme Corp., the largest \nbiotechnology company in Massachusetts and the fourth largest in the \nworld. When Henri joined Genzyme in 1983, the company had only 35 \nemployees. Under his leadership, Genzyme has grown to over 3,500 \nemployees, including 2,100 in Massachusetts.\n  Henri was born in the Netherlands and grew up expecting that he would \neventually join his father's shoe business. As a young man, he worked \nin the shoe industry in England, intending to gain training and \nexperience there before returning to work for his father. When he left \nEngland, however, he decided to come to America instead of returning to \nthe Netherlands.\n  After earning a masters degree in business administration at the \nUniversity of Virginia, Henri joined a pharmaceutical company and spent \nthe next 10 years working in Germany and the United States in various \nmanagement positions. He left that company in 1983 to become president \nof Genzyme Corp. and later became the company's chief executive officer \nas well.\n  In working with Henri Termeer over the years, I have come to know him \nas an impressive businessman and as an outstanding leader for the \nbiotechnology industry. He is highly respected in the industry for his \nknowledge, vision, and commitment, and he has won numerous awards from \nhis peers. As a member of Governor Weld's Council on Economic Growth \nand Technology and chairman of the Subcommittee on Biotechnology and \nPharmaceutical Development, Henri's leadership was responsible for the \nadoption of a number of broad initiatives that have made Massachusetts \nan excellent business environment for the biotechnology industry. At \nthe present time, biotechnology is a $1.7 billion industry in \nMassachusetts that employs over 17,000 people.\n  Henri was selected to receive the Governor's New American \nAppreciation Award for his charitable and community activities as well \nas his business leadership. Among his most important civic \naccomplishments are his efforts to expand learning opportunities for \nmentally challenged children, to improve science education for minority \nstudents, and to train workers displaced from other industries for new \ncareers in biotechnology.\n  I congratulate Henri Termeer on this well-deserved award. His success \nin this country is a brilliant new chapter in America's distinguished \nimmigrant heritage and history. He is a modern symbol that the American \nDream is alive and well in our own day and generation. The United \nStates needs more New Americans like Henri Termeer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12644-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12644-S12645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REGARDING: FEDERAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a Senator, I am afforded a unique \nopportunity to see a broad cross section of our Nation. From that \nperspective, I have had a chance to reflect upon why our country \ncontinues to be the envy of the world. Some might say that we are \nblessed with abundant natural resources. That is true enough, but in \nthe final analysis, it is the American people that have made, and will \ncontinue to make, this country great.\n  We are a nation drawn from diverse backgrounds and ideas. Still, \nthere is a thread that unites us. Our forefathers, who came to this \nland to build a new life, created in turn a nation of builders. We \nbuild homes, we build businesses and factories, but most of all we \nbuild futures; we build hope. And, as a people, we rise to meet a \nchallenge. At no time was that more apparent than during World War II. \nThat crisis forced our Nation to make drastic sacrifices in order to \nsurvive. The legacy of those choices has driven our economy and our \npolicies ever since. It is one of those legacies, the Federal \ninvestment in science and technology, that concerns me today.\n  Science and technology have shaped our world. It is very easy to see \nthe big things: putting a man on the moon, breakthroughs in genetic \nresearch, and the burgeoning world of the Internet. In today's world \ntechnology surrounds us: the computer that makes our cars run, lets us \ntalk on the telephone, runs the stoplights, runs the grocery store \ncheckout, and controls the microwave. Our world runs on technology and \nthe American Federal investment in research and development has played \na significant part in creating it. Much of our economy runs on \ntechnology as well. One-third to one-half of all U.S. economic growth \nis the result of technical progress. Technology contributes to the \ncreation of new goods and services, new jobs and new capital. It is the \nprincipal driving force behind the long-term economic growth and \nincreased standards of living of most of the world's modern industrial \nsocieties.\n  The history of the last five decades has shown us that there is a \nFederal role in the creation and nurturing of science and technology. \nBut the last three decades have shown us something else: fiscal \nreality. The simple truth is that we just don't have enough money to do \neverything we'd like. It took some time for us to realize that and by \nthe time we did, we found ourselves in a fiscal situation that is only \nnow being addressed. As a result, discretionary spending is under \nimmense fiscal pressure.\n  One only has to look back over the last 30 years to illustrate this \ntrend. In 1965, mandatory spending--entitlements and interest on the \ndebt--accounted for 30 percent of our budget, while 70 percent was \ndiscretionary. That meant that 70 percent of the budget could be used \nfor roads, education, medical research, parks, and national defense. \nToday, just 30 years later, the ratio of discretionary to mandatory \nspending has reversed. Sixty-seven percent of our budget is spent on \nmandatory programs, leaving 33 percent of our budget for discretionary \nspending. Current estimates paint an even grimmer future. By 2012, \nmandatory spending, the combination of interest and entitlement \nprograms, will consume all taxpayer revenues, leaving nothing for \nparks, education, roads, or the Federal investment in science and \ntechnology. Clearly we as a nation, cannot afford to let this happen.\n  We have both a long-term problem--addressing the ever increasing \nlevel of mandatory spending--and a near-term challenge--apportioning a \ndwindling amount of discretionary funding. This confluence of increased \ndependency on technology and decreased fiscal flexibility has created a \nproblem of national significance. Not all deserving programs can be \nfunded. Not all authorized programs can be fully implemented. The \nluxury of fully funding programs across the board has passed. We must \nset priorities. By using a set of first or guiding principles, we can \nconsistently ask the right questions about each competing technology \nprogram. The answers will help us focus on a particular program's \neffectiveness and appropriateness for Federal research and development \nfunding. This is the information needed to make the hard choices about \nwhich programs deserve support and which do not. Through the \napplication of these First Principles, we can ensure that the limited \nresources the Federal Government has for science and technology are \ninvested wisely.\n\n[[Page S12645]]\n\n  There are four First Principles:\n  First, good science. Our Federal research and development programs \nmust be focused, peer and merit reviewed, and not duplicative; the \nprogram must solve the right problem, in the right way.\n  Second, fiscal accountability. We must exercise oversight to ensure \nthat programs funded with scarce Federal dollars are managed well. We \ncannot tolerate the waste of money by inefficient management \ntechniques, by government agencies, by contractors, or by Congress \nitself. A move to multi-year budgeting is a step in the right \ndirection. It will work to provide more stable funding levels and give \nCongress the opportunity to exercise its much needed oversight \nresponsibility.\n  Third, measurable results. We need to make sure that Government \nprograms achieve their goals. We need to make sure that as we craft \nlegislation that affects science and technology, it includes a process \nwhich allows us to gauge the program's effectiveness. As we undertake \nthis, we must be careful to select the correct criteria. We cannot get \ncaught up in the trap of measuring the effectiveness of a research and \ndevelopment program by passing judgment on individual research \nprojects.\n  Fourth, the Government should be viewed as the funder of last resort. \nGovernment programs should not displace private investment, whether \nfrom corporations or venture capitalists. It is not the Federal \nGovernment's role to invest in technology that has matured enough to \nmake it to the marketplace. When the Government provides funding for \nany technology investment program, it must take reasonable steps to \nensure that the potential benefits derived from the program will accrue \nbroadly and not, for instance, to a single company.\n  Accompanying the four First Principles, are four corollaries:\n  First, flow of technology. This year's Science, Technology and Space \nSubcommittee hearing have provided ample proof that the process of \ncreating technology involves many steps. The present Federal research \nand development structure reinforces the increasingly artificial \ndistinctions across the spectrum of research and development \nactivities. The result is a set of discrete programs which each support \na narrow phase of research and development and are not coordinated with \none another. The Government should maximize its investment by \nencouraging the progression of a technology from the earliest stages of \nresearch up to commercialization, through funding agencies and vehicles \nappropriate for each stage. This creates a flow of technology, subject \nto merit at each stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a \nbureaucratic maze.\n\n  Second, excellence in the American research infrastructure. Federal \ninvestment in research and development programs must foster a close \nrelationship between research and education. Investment in research at \nthe university level creates more than simply world class research. It \ncreates world class researchers as well. The Federal strategy must \ncontinue to reflect this commitment to a strong research \ninfrastructure. We must find ways to extend the excellence of our \nuniversity system to primary and secondary educational institutions.\n  Third, commitment to a broad range of research initiatives. An \nincreasingly common theme has emerged from the Science, Technology and \nSpace Subcommittee hearings this year: Revolutionary innovation is \ntaking place at the overlap of research disciplines. We must continue \nto encourage this by providing opportunities for interdisciplinary \nprojects and fostering collaboration across fields of research.\n  Fourth, partnerships among industry, universities, and Federal \nlaboratories. Each has special talents and abilities that complement \nthe other. Our Federal dollar is wisely spent facilitating the creation \nof partnerships, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its \nparts.\n  The principles and corollaries that I have outlined form a framework \nthat can be used to guide the creation of new, federally funded \nresearch and development programs and to validate existing ones. An \nobjective framework derived from First Principles is a powerful method \nto elevate the debate on technology initiatives. It increases our \nability to focus on the important issues, and decreases the likelihood \nthat we will get sidetracked on politically charged technicalities. It \nalso serves as a mechanism to ensure that Federal research and \ndevelopment programs are consistent and effective.\n  The four principles and four corollaries serve different purposes: \nThe First Principles help us evaluate an implementation of a research \nand development program.\n  First, good science.\n  Second, fiscal accountability.\n  Third, measurable results.\n  Fourth, Government as funder of last resort.\n  The corollaries help us establish a consistent set of national \ngoals--the vision of an overall research and development program.\n  First, creation of a flow of technology.\n  Second, excellence in the American research infrastructure.\n  Third, commitment to a broad range of research initiatives.\n  Fourth, partnerships among industry, university, and federal \nlaboratories.\n  Mr. President, Congress continues to face a monumental budgetary \nchallenge. Despite our accomplishment this year of passing the first \nbalanced budget since 1969, we have yet to face the most daunting \nchallenge: bringing entitlements under control at a time of huge \ndemographic shifts toward increasing numbers of recipients. Even as we \nwork toward this difficult goal, we cannot lose sight of the near-term \nmanagement challenge in making the most of our limited discretionary \nfunds. The Federal investment in research and development has paid \nhandsome dividends in raising our standard of living. It is an \ninvestment we cannot afford to pass up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12644-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12645-S12646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ARAB-AMERICAN AND CHALDEAN COUNCIL 1997 ANNUAL CIVIC AND HUMANITARIAN \n                             AWARDS BANQUET\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, last week I submitted a statement \nfor the record discussing my views on the situation in Iraq and the \nneed for the United States to remain resolute in its dealings with the \nregime of Saddam Hussein.\n  Today, I would like to submit a paper on the subject written by Tony \nCordesman, currently at the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies and formerly a member of my staff. Tony's paper offers an \nexcellent summation of Iraqi intentions and capabilities as well as \nproviding expert analysis of what is at stake for the United States and \nits interests in the Middle East as a result of this most recent crisis \ninvolving Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate and the House to read this \npaper carefully. It offers insightful commentary on the potential \nramifications of various policy alternatives that the United States and \nthe United Nations may select in responding to Saddam's latest \nprovocation. Toward that end, I respectfully request that Dr. \nCordesman's paper be included in the Record, as well as this statement.\n  The paper follows:\n\n What Is At Stake in the Crisis with Iraq--The Threat of Iraqi Weapons \n             of Mass Destruction and U.S. Military Options\n\n                       (By Anthony H. Cordesman)\n\n       Iraq's process of proliferation is so complex that it is \n     sometimes difficult to determine just how serious the \n     violations that UNSCOM has discovered really are, or to put \n     these violations in perspective relative to what UNSCOM has \n     already accomplished. Attachment One provides a short summary \n     of UNSCOM's most recent conclusions relating to Iraq's \n     efforts to cheat the UN. Attachment Two describes Iraq \n     programs before and during the Gulf War, what UNSCOM has \n     accomplished in the seven years that have followed, and what \n     remains unknown.\n\n\n                 iraq's clandestine breakout capability\n\n       These attachments show that the issue is not one of \n     sweeping up the details, but rather one of dealing with \n     massive violations, some of which occurred as recently as \n     August, 1997. At the same time, it is important to understand \n     that many UNSCOM and US experts believe Iran has started \n     completely separate new programs since the Gulf War, which \n     are so secret and dispersed that they are almost impossible \n     to detect. These programs may be largely at the research and \n     development level, but they may give Iraq a major ``break \n     out'' capability to rapidly produce and redeploy weapons of \n     mass destruction the moment that sanctions are lifted.\n       Major possibilities that could be accomplished in small \n     research facilities and which could be rapidly moved or \n     dispersed include:\n       UNSCOM and the IAEA's success have created new priorities \n     for Iraqi proliferation. The UN's success in destroying the \n     large facilities Iraq needs to produce fissile materials \n     already may well have led Iraq to focus on covert cell-like \n     activities to manufacture highly lethal biological weapons as \n     a substitute for nuclear weapons.\n       All of the biological agents Iraq had at the time of the \n     Gulf War seem to have been ``wet'' agents with limited \n     storage life and limited operational lethality. Iraq may have \n     clandestinely carried out all of the research necessarily to \n     develop a production capability for dry, storage micro-power \n     weapons which would be far easier to clandestinely stockpile, \n     and have much more operational lethality.\n       Iraq did not have advanced binary chemical weapons and most \n     of its chemical weapons used unstable ingredients. Iraq has \n     illegally imported specialized glassware since the Gulf War, \n     and may well have developed advanced binary weapons and \n     tested them in small numbers. It may be able to use a \n     wider range of precursors and have developed plans to \n     produce precursors in Iraq. It may have improved its \n     technology for the production of VX gas.\n       Iraq is likely to covertly exploit Western analyses and \n     critiques of its pre-war proliferation efforts to correct \n     many of the problems in the organization of its proliferation \n     efforts, its weapons design, and its organization for their \n     use.\n       Iraq bombs and warheads were relatively crude designs which \n     did not store chemical and biological agents well and which \n     did a poor job of dispersing them. Fusing and detonation \n     systems did a poor job of ensuring detonation at the right \n     height and Iraq made little use of remote sensors and weather \n     models for long-range targeting and strike planning. Iraq \n     could clandestinely design and test greatly improve shells, \n     bombs, and warheads. The key tests could be conducted using \n     towers, simulated agents, and even indoors. Improved \n     targeting, weather sensors, and other aids to strike planning \n     are dual-use or civil technologies that are not controlled by \n     UNSCOM. The net impact would be weapons that could be 5-10 \n     times more effective than the relatively crude designs Iraq \n     had rushed into service under the pressure of the Iran-Iraq \n     War.\n       UNSCOM and the IAEA's success give Iraq an equally high \n     priority to explore ways of obtaining fissile material from \n     the FSU or other potential supplier country and prepare for a \n     major purchase effort the moment sanctions and inspections \n     are lifted and Iraq has the hard currency to buy its way into \n     the nuclear club. Iraq could probably clandestinely assemble \n     all of the components of a large nuclear device except the \n     fissile material, hoping to find some illegal source of such \n     material.\n       The components for cruise missiles are becoming steadily \n     more available on the commercial market, and Iraq has every \n     incentive to create a covert program to examine the \n     possibility of manufacturing or assembling cruise missiles in \n     Iraq.\n       UN inspections and sanctions may also drive Iraq to adopt \n     new delivery methods ranging from clandestine delivery and \n     the use of proxies to sheltered launch-on-warning \n     capabilities designed to counter the U.S. advantage in \n     airpower.\n       Iraq can legally maintain and test missiles with ranges up \n     to 150 kilometers. This allows for exoatmospheric reentry \n     testing and some testing of improved guidance systems. \n     Computer simulation, wind tunnel models, and production \n     engineering tests can all be carried out clandestinely under \n     the present inspection regime. It is possible that Iraq could \n     develop dummy or operational high explosive warheads with \n     shapes and weight distribution of a kind that would allow it \n     to test concepts for improving its warheads for weapons of \n     mass destruction. The testing of improved bombs using \n     simulated agents would be almost impossible to detect as \n     would the testing of improved spray systems for biological \n     warfare.\n       Iraq has had half a decade in which to improve its decoys, \n     dispersal concepts, dedicated command and control links, \n     targeting methods, and strike plans. This kind of passive \n     warfare planning is impossible to forbid and monitor, but \n     ultimately is as important and lethal as any improvement in \n     hardware.\n       There is no evidence that Iraq made an effort to develop \n     specialized chemical and biological devices for covert \n     operations, proxy\n\n[[Page S12647]]\n\n     warfare, or terrorist use. It would be simple to do so \n     clandestinely and they would be simple to manufacture.\n       The key point is that only effective UNSCOM operations can \n     deter Iraq from rapidly rebuilding its wartime capabilities, \n     and sparking a new arms race that is certain to lead Iran to \n     reply in kind and present major new problems for U.S. forces \n     in the region and our Southern Gulf allies.\n\n\n                         U.S. military options\n\n       The U.S. must be careful to try to preserve as much \n     international consensus as it can in support of the UNSCOM \n     effort. It must be careful to avoid using threat or force in \n     a way that could further split the U.N. Security Council, or \n     win this round and lose the war. We need to be sensitive to \n     humanitarian concerns about punishing the Iraqi people in \n     ways that do not really punish Saddam. We also need to be \n     careful about the kind of threats and token strikes that have \n     no real effect on what Saddam holds vital, and which end in \n     convincing him that he can win a war of sanctions against the \n     U.S., and allowing Saddam to show that he can defy the U.N. \n     and U.S. with impunity.\n       We also need to understand that UNSCOM and sanctions are \n     not a failure. Iraq imported over $80 billion worth of arms \n     during the Iran-Iraq War. It was importing around $3 billion \n     worth of arms a year at the time of the Gulf War. It needs a \n     minimum of about $1.5 billion a year worth of imports simply \n     to keep its military machine alive. Iraq, however, has had no \n     significant military imports since 1990, and has had no \n     successes in mass producing a single advanced weapon in Iraq. \n     It has a $20 billion deficit in arms imports, and it has not \n     been able to import a single new weapon or technology to \n     react to the devastating lessons of the Gulf War. It has less \n     than half the tanks and half the combat aircraft it did at \n     the time of the Gulf War.\n       UNSCOM is not perfect, but it is the most successful arms \n     control regime in history. It has destroyed virtually all of \n     Iraq major facilities for producing missiles, and chemical, \n     biological, and nuclear weapons. Virtually all of these \n     facilities survived the Gulf War. It has supervised the \n     destruction of nearly 100,000 chemical and biological weapons \n     and/or major components and manufacturing devices for such \n     weapons, and thousands of tons of precursors for making \n     chemical weapons.\n       It was UNSCOM that discovered Iraq's massive biological \n     weapons and VX nerve gas programs, and it did so in 1995, \n     four years after the war was over. In the six years since the \n     cease-fire, there has never been a six month reporting period \n     in which UNSCOM has not made another major discovery, \n     including the period between April and October, 1997. It is \n     UNSCOM intrusive monitoring program which limits Iraq's \n     unceasing clandestine efforts and prevents Iraq from rapidly \n     manufacturing large numbers of advanced biological and \n     chemical weapons.\n       Keeping UNSCOM alive and effective is far more important \n     than forcing a military showdown with Saddam. If threats and \n     negotiation can work, they should be allowed to do so. \n     Unilateral U.S. military action, or action with a limited or \n     forced international consensus, should be a last resort \n     because making Saddam back down this time might come at the \n     cost of undermining or ending support for sanctions.\n       At the same time, force and no inaction must be the last \n     resort. Preventing Iraq from proliferating and a new and \n     totally destabilizing arms race between Iran and Iraq is a \n     vital national security interest. So is the defense of our \n     Arab allies and Israel, and the protection of our own power \n     projection forces. Our economy is dependent on the global \n     price and availability of oil, and the Persian Gulf is the \n     key to energy security.\n       Fortunately, the US does have military options that it can \n     execute with and without allied support. They also go far \n     beyond the kind of pointlessly expensive slap on the wrist \n     that the US has used in firing cruise missiles against \n     targets Saddam does not really value like an intelligence \n     headquarters, or military targets with cruise missiles could \n     not destroy.\n       Some of these options do not require immediate US military \n     action. The US can shift the burden of triggering military \n     action to Saddam. These include ``halt or shoot'' options \n     like forbidding all Iraqi military flights. This could \n     include only combat fixed wing aircraft, or all aircraft \n     including helicopters and transports. A nation-wide no-fly \n     zone would paralyze and weaken critical Iraqi military \n     capabilities. Another step would be a demand for a nation-\n     wide halt to all armored movements larger than battalion \n     sized units. This would destroy the Iraqi army's ability to \n     train and exercise. A third such option would be to attack \n     and destroy any facility where UNSCOM is denied timely \n     access. A fourth option would be to destroy any military \n     facility or production plant where new construction or \n     manufacturing activity began. A fifth option would be to \n     destroy any facility where Iraq has interfered with the UN \n     monitoring equipment or tags. None of these options would \n     hurt the Iraq people. All would threaten the ``crown jewels'' \n     of Saddam's regime.\n       There are other ``crown jewels'' that the US could attack \n     without waiting and which would not hurt the Iraqi people. \n     These include the airbases with Saddam's remaining MiG-29s, \n     Su-24s, and Mirage F-1s: The only aircraft he has left that \n     really matter. The US does not have to destroy the entire \n     Iraqi Air Force. Few in Iraq would mourn the destruction of \n     the Special Republican Guards, and this force is critical to \n     Saddam's security. The US could expand these attacks to cover \n     all critical Iraqi security facilities, and this time the \n     attacks should be designed to kill as many occupants as \n     possible and should be sustained until Saddam completely \n     backs down. Destroying Iraq's remaining military production \n     facilities on a step-by-step basis would confront Saddam with \n     the risk of losing his conventional military capabilities. \n     Ordinary Iraqis are also unlikely to mourn the destruction of \n     Saddam's new palaces, and this gives us at least 17 targets \n     that were built or rebuilt after UN sanctions began.\n       In short, we do have good options if we are forced to use \n     them and if we have the will to escalate beyond military \n     tokenism. Further, these options will exist long after the \n     current crisis is over. They can be made part of a clear \n     declaratory doctrine regarding Iraq, and such a doctrine is \n     clearly needed. It should be made unambiguously clear to the \n     world that the US will enforce the terms of the UN Cease-fire \n     until Iraq's capabilities to produce weapons of mass \n     destruction are destroyed and will not allow Iraqi to \n     rebuild. The US should not telegraph its punches by \n     specifying a given action for a given violation, but it \n     should make it clear to the world as well as Saddam that the \n     US will always act. The US should also make it clear that it \n     will raise the cost to Saddam each time he provokes another \n     crisis and that he will force escalation if other incidents \n     follow. We should not be trigger happy, but we must not let \n     ``sanctions fatigue'' lead to ``proliferation fatigue'' and a \n     horrifying new arms race in the Gulf.\n                                  ____\n\n\nIraq's ``Clandestine Break Out Capability:'' Covert Programs Iraq Could \n Have Undertaken Since the Cease-Fire That UNSCOM Might Not Detect or \n                                Prevent\n\n                       (By Anthony H. Cordesman)\n\n       UNSCOM and IAEA's success have created new priorities for \n     Iraqi proliferation. The UN's success in destroying the large \n     facilities Iraq needs to produce fissile materials already \n     may well have led Iraq to focus on covert cell-like \n     activities to manufacture highly lethal biological weapons as \n     a substitute for nuclear weapons.\n       All of the biological agents Iraq had at the time of the \n     Gulf War seem to have been ``wet'' agents with limited \n     storage life and limited operational lethality. Iraq may have \n     clandestinely carried out all of the research necessarily to \n     develop a production capacity for dry, storage micro-power \n     weapons which would be far easier to clandestinely stockpile, \n     and have much more operational lethality.\n       Iraq did not have advanced binary chemical weapons and most \n     of its chemical weapons used unstable ingredients. Iraq has \n     illegally imported specialized glassware since the Gulf War, \n     and may well have developed advanced binary weapons and \n     tested them in small numbers. It may be able to use a wider \n     range of precurors and have developed plans to produce \n     precursors in Iraq. It may have improved its technology for \n     the production of VX gas.\n       Iraq is likely to covertly exploit Western analyses and \n     critiques of its pre-war proliferation efforts to correct \n     many of the problems in the organization of its proliferation \n     efforts, its weapons design, and its organization of their \n     use.\n       Iraq bombs and warheads were relatively crude designs which \n     did not store chemical and biological agents well and which \n     did a poor job of dispersing them. Fusing and detonation \n     systems did a poor job of ensuring detonation at the right \n     height and Iraq made little use of remote sensors and weather \n     models for long-range targeting and strike planning. Iraq \n     could clandestinely design and test greatly improve shells, \n     bombs, and warheads. The key tests could be conducted using \n     towers, simulated agents, and even indoors. Improved \n     targeting, weather senors, and other aids to strike planning \n     are dual-use or civil technologies that are not controlled by \n     UNSCOM. The net impact would be weapons that could be 5-10 \n     times more effective than the relatively crude designs Iraq \n     had rushed into service under the pressure of the Iran-Iraq \n     War.\n       UNSCOM and the IAEA's success give Iraq an equally high \n     priority to explore ways of obtaining fissile material from \n     the FSU or other potential supplier country and prepare for a \n     major purchase effort the moment sanctions and inspections \n     are lifted and Iraq has the hard currency to buy its way into \n     the nuclear club. Iraq could probably clandestinely assemble \n     all of the components of a large nuclear device except that \n     fissile material, hoping to find some illegal source of such \n     material.\n       The components for cruise missiles are becoming steadily \n     more available on the commercial market, and Iraq has every \n     incentive to create a covert program to examine the \n     possibility of manufacturing or assembling cruise missiles in \n     Iraq.\n       UN inspections and sanctions may also drive Iraq to adopt \n     new delivery methods ranging from clandestine delivery and \n     the use of proxies to sheltered launch-on-warning \n     capabilities designed to counter the US advantage in \n     airpower.\n       Iraq can legally maintain and test missiles with ranges up \n     to 150 kilometers. This allows for exoatmospheric reentry \n     testing and some\n\n[[Page S12648]]\n\n     testing of improved guidance systems. Computer simulation, \n     wind tunnel models, and production engineering tests can all \n     be carried out clandestinely under the present inspection \n     regime. It is possible that Iraq could develop dummy or \n     operational high explosive warheads with shapes and weight \n     distribution of a kind that would allow it to test concepts \n     for improving its warheads for weapons of mass destruction. \n     The testing of improved bombs using simulated agents would be \n     almost impossible to detect as would be testing of improved \n     spray systems for biological warfare.\n       Iraq has had half a decade in which to improve its decoys, \n     dispersal concepts, dedicated command and control links, \n     targeting methods, and strike plans.

Mr. President, the Internet is transforming every \naspect of how a university performs research, teaches its students and \nreaches out to the public. In Hawaii and Alaska, the importance of the \nInternet is multiplied even more by the vast distances that separates \nus from the other 48 states, as well as the unique internal geography \nof our states which separate our citizens from each other by water, \nmountains or long distances.\n  In October 1996, the Clinton Administration unveiled its Next \nGeneration Internet (NGI) initiative, emphasizing that the Internet is \nthe biggest change in human communication since the printing press. The \ninitiative proposed a $100 million per year federal program to create \nthe foundation for the networks of the 21st century. Approximately $95 \nmillion is being appropriated this year for the NGI.\n  One of the initial NGI project goals is to connect at least 100 \nuniversities and national labs at speeds 100 to 1,000 times faster than \ntoday's Internet. The University of Hawaii and University of Alaska, \nalong with many other institutions, have joined the Internet2 \ninitiative which shares this objective.\n  Unfortunately, high-speed connectiv- ity comparable to what the NGI \nproject is bringing to research universities throughout the country is \nnot even available, much less affordable, for the universities of our \nmost remote states of Alaska and Hawaii. These are the states where \ntelecommunications is most needed to counteract the isolation that is \nimposed by our remoteness.\n  It must be noted first and foremost that our public universities in \nAlaska and Hawaii have already dug deep to pay their own fair share to \nobtain Internet connectivity. These two institutions already allocate \nmore internal funding for Internet connections than any other \nuniversity, yet they receive far less capacity for their dollars \nimportance on the Internet, these universities are faced with urgent \nneeds that cannot be reasonably accommodated through the commercial \nmarketplace or federal grant mechanisms currently in place.\n  For example, as part of the Internet2 project, major research \nuniversities are now planning increases in speed from 45 Mbps (million \nbits per second) to 150 Mbps and even 600 Mbps. According to the \nfounding project director for Internet2, the expected cost for a 150 \nMbps connection will average about $300,000 per year for mainland \nresearch universities.\n  The University of Hawaii already pays much more than this--$448,000 \nper year--and this buys only a 6 Mbps connection from Hawaii to the \nmainland. The University of Alaska now pays $324,000 per year for a 4.5 \nMbps connection. In other words, compared to the average that other \nuniversities are expected to pay for their NGI-capable connections, \nHawaii is already paying 50 percent more for \\1/25\\ of the capacity, \nand Alaska is paying nearly 10 percent more for \\1/33\\ of the capacity.\n  The rural states on the mainland found that their connection costs \nwere higher than in urban areas and appealed for assistance. The \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) recognized that the maximum $350,000 \n3-year grant to assist in establishing connections to its Very High \nSpeed Backbone Network Service was not adequate to meet the costs in \nthese rural states. In response, the NSF agreed to make 18 rural \nstates, not including Alaska and Hawaii, eligible for special \nsupplements of up to $200,000 over and above the $350,000 maximum \ngrant.\n  These rural mainland universities can obtain 45 Mbps connections for \nprices in the range of $150,000 to $360,000 per year. In comparison, \nthe quoted prices for these connections to Alaska and Hawaii are $2.8 \nmillion and $2.5 million respectively, escalating to $6 million or more \na year to meet future requirements. Further, even if funds were \navailable within the states to pay these costs on an ongoing basis, the \ncapacity is not readily available or even in place on an ongoing basis, \nthe capacity is not readily available or even in place on the existing \nsaturated fiber optic systems that connect Hawaii and Alaska to the \nrest of the country.\n  Our research universities in Alaska and Hawaii need the same level of \nconnectivity as their counterparts in California, Massachusetts, North \nDakota and Colorado. Our remote universities are already paying much \nmore and getting much less for their limited internal funding.\n  This is not just a problem for our universities, but is fundamental \nto the overall economic development of our states. Ensuring high-speed \nInternet access to the only public institutions of higher education in \nHawaii and Alaska also supports K-12 education, state government, and \nmany other education, research and public sector organizations to which \nour universities provide technological leadership, support and services \nas the intellectual cornerstones of our communities.\n  It is imperative that the federal government ensure fair access \nacross the nation to the Internet and to our own federal initiatives \nsuch as the NGI. Just as a 32-cent stamp provides the same service \nanywhere in the country, so too must we consider ways to equalize \naccess to the information superhighway. Further, we must solve this \nstructural problem not just for the short term, but on a permanent \nbasis.\n  We urge the federal agencies which are receiving $95 million for the \nNGI this year, and which are planning on additional funding in the \nyears to come, to take upon themselves the responsibility to ensure \nthat the NGI reaches not just to those places that can be reached \ncheaply and easily, but to all fifty states. Technical staff at each \nuniversity have been working long and hard to identify any possible \nmeans of achieving affordable high speed connectivity for their state. \nWe ask that, as a nation, we reach out to find a stable and lasting \nsolution to this urgent problem.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I concur with Senator Inouye that this is \na critical problem for Alaska and Hawaii. I would suggest that it is in \nthe interest of all States to ensure that no State is left behind as we \nenter the digital age.\n  Researchers in Alaska and Hawaii must have the same access to \nresources that their colleagues in other areas of the country have--\nwithout compatible access our universities will be left behind in the \nrace to secure research funding and they will not be able to compete \nwhen it comes to attracting top researchers and professors.\n  There is another side to the problem. Just as our universities will \nbe cut off from their colleagues--universities in the continental \nUnited States will be cut off from the expertise and resources that are \nhoused in the universities of Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Senator Inouye laid out our concerns with respect to participation in \nthe next generation Internet project, I would like to take what he said \none step further.\n  The technology--the high speed access to the Internet that is the \ngoal of the next generation Internet project--is currently being slated \nto be developed on top of the existing Internet infrastructure.\n  The existing Internet infrastructure can be visualized as a series of \npipes, of varying capacity. The main conduit of the pipe system \nconnects the West Coast to the East Coast--essentially through the \nmiddle of the United States.\n  Those States that host the main conduit are fortunate--they have low \ncost access to relatively high capacity. Those States that are not \nclose to the main conduit face increasing costs the further they are \nfrom the main conduits.\n\n[[Page S12649]]\n\n  The NGI project has agreed to include some States--like Montana that \nface challenges connecting to the main conduits. However, our States--\nAlaska and Hawaii--have been essentially written off.\n  This isn't just a question of our universities being left behind. It \nis a question of our entire states being left behind as we enter the \nnew millennium when high speed connectivity will be essential to every \naspect of life.\n  We are already witnessing mass scale technological convergence. From \nmy computer here in the Senate I can make telephone calls, I can listen \nto the radio, I can watch television--all over the Internet. This is \nnot possible from most of Alaska and Hawaii--the connections are simply \ntoo poor.\n  Currently data traffic is growing at a much faster pace than \ntelephone traffic--if this continues, early in the next century data \ntraffic will surpass telephone traffic. Where will that leave Alaska \nand Hawaii if we don't have the infrastructure in place to send data?\n  Right now many villages in rural Alaska can only access the Internet \nby dialing a 1-800 number which connects them to an Internet service \nprovider in Anchorage. They are connected to the Internet at speeds of \naround 1200 BAUD. Not only is this access slow--considering that most \nAmericans now normally connect at at least 28,800 BAUD--but it is also \ncostly.\n  I join Senator Inouye in asking that those universities and agencies \nwho receive part of the $95 million that we have provided for the next \ngeneration Internet project use the funds in a manner that will advance \nthe interests of our country as a whole.\n  I also ask for the assistance of private industry in helping us to \nsolve the technical problems that our States face in obtaining \nconnectivity levels that are comparable to the rest of the country. As \none of the witnesses said earlier this week at the NGI hearing before \nthe Science, Technology, and Transportation Subcommittee, it will take \nan innovative solution to provide Alaska with good connectivity.\n  Conventional solutions, such as laying high capacity fiber to every \nvillage are simply not feasible economically at this time.\n  I am committed to finding a solution to these problems--I know that \nSenator Inouye is too--I hope that our colleagues will join us and that \nthis will be viewed as a national problem and not just as a competition \nfor Federal research funds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12648-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            J.

Mr. President, December 6 marks the 50th birthday \nof one of the Nation's finest labor leaders. Gary Sauter has been a \nmember of the United Food and Commercial Workers and its predecessor, \nthe Retail Clerks International Association, for over 30 years, and he \nhas done an outstanding job.\n  Gary comes from a hard-working union family. His father and mother \nwere both members of the Retail Clerks Union in Baltimore. In fact, \nthey became engaged after a labor dispute.\n  Following in their footsteps, Gary joined the Retail Clerks in 1965, \nas a cashier for Safeway Stores while he was attending the Baltimore \nCollege of Commerce. The union quickly recognized his ability and, in \n1969, Gary became a department store organizer. He worked effectively \nto organize workers at the Hoschschilds Kohn department store in \nBaltimore, and went on to become regional coordinator for the Retail \nClerks' Southeastern Division.\n  Later, Gary became organizing director for Local 400 of the Retail \nClerks in Landover, MD. In large part because of Gary's efforts, the \nlocal grew to one of the largest and most effective local unions in the \nWashington, DC area.\n  In 1988, after the Retail Clerks merged with the Amalgamated Meat \nCutters to form the United Food and Commercial Workers' Union, Gary \njoined the new international as special assistant to the president. He \ncontinued to be a leader and, in 1994, was elected international vice \npresident of the union. Later that year he was chosen to serve as \ndirector of the union's Legislative and Political Affairs Department, a \nposition he holds today.\n  Throughout his distinguished career Gary has done a brilliant job for \nthe workers he represents. He has never lost sight of the importance of \ntheir needs, and he has worked skillfully and tirelessly to improve the \nwages and working conditions of all Americans.\n  It is an honor to pay tribute to this impressive leader. I extend my \nbest wishes to Gary, his wife Pat, and his children, Christopher and \nAmy, on this auspicious milestone. Well done, Gary, and keep up the \ngreat work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12649-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WOODROW WOODY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Through his tireless \ndedication to his community and the many organizations to which he \ngives much of his time, he has and continues to touch the lives of many \nin the State of Michigan.\n  On this momentous day, I say thank you to Woodrow. He has inspired me \nand served as a second father to me throughout the years. His wisdom \nand integrity continue to motivate me and countless others. Again, I am \nhonored to recognize Woodrow on the occasion of his 90th birthday in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12649-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12649-S12651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OECD SHIPBUILDING AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of S. \n1216, legislation to implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement. S. 1216 \nwas favorably reported out of both the Senate Finance and Commerce \nCommittees.\n  The issue of unfair foreign shipbuilding practices is very important \nto my State. Louisiana is one of the premier shipbuilding states in the \ncountry. Over 27,000 Louisiana jobs are impacted by constructing or \nrepairing ships. We have almost every conceivable type and size \nshipyard, from a huge primarily defense oriented yard to smaller and \nmedium sized strictly commercial yards. My interest in this issue spans \nthe entire range of shipbuilding.\n  I believe it's important to state again for the record the historical \ncontext that surrounds the OECD Shipbuilding agreement and this \nimplementing legislation. If nothing else, we should learn from \nhistory. 1974-1987, saw worldwide overall demand for ocean going \nvessels decline 71%. United States merchant vessel construction went \nfrom an average of 72 ships/year in the 1970's to an average of 21 \nships/year in the 1980's. During this period, governments in all the \nshipbuilding nations, with the exception of the United States, \ndramatically stepped up aid to their shipyards with massive levels of \nsubsidies in virtually every form.\n  In 1981, the U.S. government unilaterally terminated commercial \nconstruction subsidies to U.S. yards. At\n\n[[Page S12650]]\n\nthe same time, U.S. defense shipbuilding increased in an effort to \nreach a 600 ship Navy. U.S. defense shipbuilding construction went from \nan average of 79 ships/year in the 1970's to an average of 95 ships/\nyear in the 1980's. U.S. international commercial shipbuilding, on the \nother hand, was virtually abandoned to subsidized foreign yards.\n  The end of the 1980's and the end of the ``Cold War'' saw a \nDepartment of Defense reevaluation of the need for a 600 ship Navy. The \nU.S. shipbuilding industry was consequently forced to reevaluate its \nneed to secure commercial ship construction orders in order to stay in \nbusiness. In June of 1989, the U.S. shipbuilding industry, represented \nat that time by the ``Shipbuilders Council of America'', filed a \nsection 301 claim against the major shipbuilding countries of the world \nfor unfair subsidies and practices that were injuring the U.S. \nindustry.\n  Later that year, however, U.S. Trade Ambassador Carla Hills, \nconvinced the industry that a better, more effective way to eliminate \nthe unfair foreign subsidies and practices was through multilateral \nnegotiations. The industry decided to give international negotiations a \nchance and therefore withdrew its Section 301 claim. The U.S. then \nencouraged the responsible trading partners to enter into negotiations \nand the five year OECD quest to negotiate the elimination of trade \ndistorting shipbuilding practices had begun.\n  From late 1989 to late 1994, the OECD negotiations were on and off \nagain. During 1993, when the talks had seemingly collapsed, I \nintroduced a bill in the Senate (S. 990) and then Congressman Sam \nGibbons introduced a bill in the House (H.R. 1402), that would have \nunilaterally triggered significant sanctions against ships constructed \nin foreign subsidized yards when those ships called upon the United \nStates. Despite prompting a flood of domestic opposition from those \nfearing the bills would start a trade war, the introduction of these \nbills did help re-ignite the stalled OECD talks.\n  From June 1989 until the present agreement was signed on December 21, \n1994, the U.S. objective and the U.S. industry's urgent request \nappeared to be simple: ``Eliminate subsidies and we can compete.'' When \nthe Clinton administration came into office, to its credit, it proposed \na ``Shipyard Revitalization Plan.'' A main feature of this plan was new \nTitle XI financing for commercial export orders.\n  In a Senate Finance Committee, Trade Subcommittee hearing on November \n18, 1993, a year before the agreement was signed, Assistant U.S.T.R. \nDon Phillips described the plan and its relationship to the OECD \nAgreement as follows:\n\n       Finally, this five-point program is a transitional program, \n     consistent with federal assistance to other industries \n     seeking to convert from defense to civilian markets. In \n     addition, it seeks to support, not undercut, the negotiations \n     that are currently underway in the OECD. In this regard, we \n     have made clear our intention to modify this program, as \n     appropriate, so that it would be consistent with the \n     provision of a multilateral agreement---if and when such an \n     agreement enters into force. (emphasis added).\n\n  In all the comments I have heard to date about this agreement, I have \nyet to hear of a scenario whereby U.S. industry is better off fighting \nunfair shipbuilding practices without the agreement than it is with the \nagreement. The ``loopholes'' referred to by opponents will become the \nrule rather than limited and temporary exceptions. The Congress is not \nprepared in this time of fiscal restraint to match their subsidies with \nours.\n  Concerns about the agreement putting the Jones Act domestic build \nrequirement at risk are contradicted by the fact that the largest \n``Jones Act'' carriers in the country, who avidly support this \nagreement. They say this implementing bill strengthens the Jones Act. \nIf that protection were not enough, we added language providing for an \nexpedited procedure for U.S. withdrawal from the agreement if the Jones \nAct were perceived to be undermined.\n  Opponents argue that new export orders associated with the current \nU.S. title XI export financing program will be lost under the \nagreement. These orders exist, however, because a title XI financing \nadvantage is in place due to the standstill clause in the OECD \nagreement. If we reject the agreement, we lose the standstill \nclause, and consequently we lose our current title XI advantage. \nConsidering the European Union routinely provides billions of dollars \nof direct shipyard aid each year and absent this agreement will soon \nredirect and increase this aid, matching our U.S. financing program \nwill require minimal EU effort and change.\n\n  If this debate is really about competing for international export \norders, and unless we are prepared to enter into a subsidies race with \nour competitors, I don't see how we can reject this agreement. Not only \nis Congress continually faced with dire budgetary decisions, such as \ncutting Medicare and Medicaid, but the Department of Defense has \nindicated that it is reluctant and unwilling to fund commercial \nshipbuilding subsidies through its DOD accounts.\n  Greater competition from our trading partners due to increasing world \nshipbuilding capacity and the inevitable decrease in demand for new \noceangoing vessels, will lead us to the same untenable situation that \nconfronted our industry in 1981 if we do not approve this agreement. We \nwon't have adequate trade laws to protect our industry and we won't \nhave enough subsidies to successfully compete for international orders.\n  Last year, the full House of Representatives considered implementing \nlegislation for the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement. A substitute amendment \noffered by Congressman Herb Bateman passed the Chamber, but was \ninconsistent with the agreement. The Senate failed to consider an \nimplementing bill before adjournment though we made relentless efforts \nto address the concerns of opponents and engage them in constructive \ndialog.\n  Every time opponents have raised an objection, we have tried to \naddress it in a manner consistent with the agreement.\n  First, when they said they needed explicit clarification that the \nUnited States would not under any circumstances change its Jones Act, \nwe did it and more.\n  Second, when they said they needed explicit clarification that our \nnational security interests would be protected and that the definitions \nof ``defense features'' and ``military reserve vessels'' would be \ndecided by the Secretary of Defense, we did it and more.\n  Third, when they said they needed 30 additional months of current \nTitle XI financing terms to cover projects close to having their \napplications in, we did it and more.\n  In fact, S. 1216, as amended by Senator Lott and myself, meets every \nlegitimate concern raised by opponents. I am including a detailed \ncomparison of this bill with the issues raised in the Bateman \namendment.\n  This agreement is not perfect because there is no such thing as a \nperfect agreement. To overlook its significant features, such as \nelimination of foreign subsidies while ensuring that the U.S. is the \nonly country of all the signatories able to reserve its domestic market \nfrom foreign competition, provides an inaccurate view at best.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, there are no opponents to the U.S. \nshipbuilding and broader maritime industry in this debate today. We \nsimply have different members with different constituencies and \ndifferent priorities. We must decide as a Senate, however, if we want \nto provide our own U.S. commercial shipyards the right and ability to \ncompete on a level playing field for international work.\n  I join Senator Lott in promoting the entire U.S. shipbuilding \nindustry. America needs both a competitive U.S. commercial shipbuilding \nindustry as well as a strong defense shipbuilding industry. We can have \nboth if we enact the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement legislation. I look \nforward to a vote on this agreement in the U.S. Senate before March 1, \n1998.\n  The material follows:\n\n  How S. 1216 (as amended by Senate Finance and Commerce Committees) \n       compares to H.R. 2754 (as amended by Congressman Bateman)\n\n\n                                Title XI\n\n       S. 1216 includes Title XI transition language more \n     favorable than the Bateman Amendment. Under S. 1216, the U.S. \n     would be able to keep its current (25-year/87.5% of the \n     project cost) Title XI financing through January 1, 2001. The \n     Bateman Amendment extended such terms through January 1, \n     1999.\n       S. 1216, like the Bateman Amendment, provides a full three-\n     year delivery ``grace period'' for ships that receive 25-year \n     Title XI\n\n[[Page S12651]]\n\n     financing. Therefore under S. 1216, such ships would have to \n     be delivered no later than January 1, 2004. S. 1216, like the \n     Bateman Amendment, allows for further extending the delivery \n     date in the case of ``unusual circumstances'' (defined the \n     same as the Bateman Amendment).\n       S. 1216 includes a provision not in the Bateman Amendment \n     that allows the U.S. to make the current favorable terms of \n     the Title XI program available to U. S shipyards when \n     competing against bids of subsidized yards in countries that \n     are not signatories to the OECD Agreement. This provision: \n     (1) provides an incentive for such nations to join the OECD \n     Shipbuilding Agreement and, (2) protects U.S. shipyards from \n     unfair competition from subsidized yards in nations that fail \n     to join the Agreement.\n\n\n                               Jones Act\n\n       S. 1216 provides extraordinary protections for the Jones \n     Act that fully meet the objectives of the Bateman Amendment.\n       S. 1216 states unequivocally that US coastwise laws are \n     completely unaffected by this Agreement. This provision is \n     virtually identical to the Bateman Amendment.\n       S. 1216 states that nothing in this Agreement shall \n     undermine ``the operation or administration of our coastwise \n     laws''. This provision provides a stronger statement of \n     protection for the Jones Act than the Bateman Amendment.\n       S. 1216 provides a legislative procedure (Joint Resolution) \n     for Congress to initiate US withdrawal from the Agreement if, \n     ``responsive measures'' to U.S. Jones Act construction are \n     taken. This process provides an equivalent alternative to the \n     Bateman Amendment prohibition against counter-measures being \n     filed against the US and which is consistent with the \n     agreement.\n       Responsive countermeasures against the Jones Act are \n     a highly theoretical event. Under the agreement, \n     responsive countermeasures are authorized only when \n     relevant Jones Act construction ``significantly upsets the \n     balance of rights and obligations of the agreement.'' Even \n     the most optimistic projections indicate that relevant \n     U.S. Jones Act construction will represent only a fraction \n     of 1% of the global shipbuilding market. Furthermore, the \n     withdrawal provision in S. 1216 provides a disincentive \n     for a nation to pursue a countermeasure against the U.S. \n     since a successful action would result in U.S. withdrawal \n     from the Agreement. U.S withdrawal from the Agreement \n     would not only moot the countermeasure, it would terminate \n     the Agreement altogether.\n       Finally in a worst case scenario, even if a Jones Act \n     countermeasure were to be authorized and for some reason the \n     US did not withdraw from the agreement, there would still be \n     no real consequence to the U.S. Jones Act shipbuilding \n     industry. Under the agreement, the only countermeasure \n     allowable without the consent of the US would be to offset an \n     equivalent portion of the complaining party's ``Jones Act'' \n     market from US bidding. Because the global market is so vast \n     (2000 commercial ship starts annually), providing so many \n     alternative contracts to U.S. yards, the relatively tiny \n     number of contracts that might be restricted by a \n     countermeasure would not significantly affect U.S. yards. \n     Additionally, the bill would prevent any countermeasures from \n     being taken against other WTO sectors.\n\n\n               protection of national security interests\n\n       S. 1216 provides virtually identical language to that in \n     the Bateman Amendment for the purposes of protecting our \n     essential security interests.\n       S. 1216 preserves the prerogatives of the Secretary of \n     Defense to exempt from the Agreement--``military vessels'', \n     ``military reserve vessels'' and anything he deems to be in \n     the ``essential security interests'' of the United States.\n       S. 1216 allows the Secretary of Defense to exempt all or \n     part of a ship on which National Defense Features are \n     installed, on a case by case basis.\n       The bill would not enable other OECD party nations to \n     question U.S. authority to protect its essential security \n     interests.\n       In a May 29, 1996, letter to the Chairman of the House \n     Committee on National Security, the Department of Defense \n     stated definitively; ``The Agreement will not adversely \n     effect our national security.''\n\n\n                            other provisions\n\n       S. 1216 includes the same conditions for US withdrawal from \n     the Agreement, and the same provisions for the snap-back of \n     US laws changed by this legislation, as the Bateman \n     Amendment.\n       Just like the Bateman Amendment, S. 1216 provides an \n     effective mechanism for ``third party'' dumping petitions. \n     The provision in S. 1216 conforms to the existing US anti-\n     dumping code. S.1216 requires that anti-dumping actions be \n     ``consistent with the terms of the Shipbuilding Agreement''.\n       S. 1216 includes several provisions that would \n     substantially strengthen our monitoring and enforcement \n     capabilities under the Agreement. USTR would be directed to \n     establish a comprehensive interagency compliance monitoring \n     program in conjunction with the U.S. shipbuilding industry \n     and the maritime labor community, and to report to Congress \n     annually.\n       S. 1216 further directs the US Government to vigorously \n     pursue enforcement against noncompliance by other nations. \n     These improvements are beyond the scope of the Bateman \n     Amendment.\n       S. 1216 includes provisions that substantially enhance our \n     ability to secure the accession to the Agreement of other \n     shipbuilding countries including, specifically, Australia, \n     Brazil, India, the Peoples Republic of China, Poland, \n     Romania, Singapore the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. This \n     improvement goes beyond the scope of the Bateman \n     Amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12649-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12651-S12652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONFERENCE REPORT ACCOMPANYING H.R. 2107, THE INTERIOR AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 1998\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to address the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 2107, the fiscal year 1998 Interior and \nRelated Agencies appropriations bill.\n  The conference report was adopted by the Senate on October 28. At the \ntime the bill was called up, the Budget Committee had not received \nCBO's scoring of the final bill. This was due to the significant \nchanges to the bill made by the conferees. I have received CBO's \ninformation and now address the budgetary scoring of the bill.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement provides $13.8 billion in new \nbudget authority and $9.1 billion in new outlays to fund the programs \nof the Department of Interior, the Forest Service of the Department of \nAgriculture, the Energy Conservation and Fossil Energy Research and \nDevelopment Programs of the Department of Energy, the Indian Health \nService, and arts-related agencies.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill provides a total of $13.9 \nbillion in budget authority and $13.8 billion in outlays for these \nprograms for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. President, final action on the conference agreement necessitated \na reallocation of funding authority for this bill. I regret that this \nreallocation was necessary because it was avoidable.\n  Section 205 of the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution provided for \nthe allocation of $700 million in budget authority for Federal land \nacquisition and to finalize priority land exchanges upon the reporting \nof a bill that included such funding.\n\n  The distinguished chairman of the Senate Interior Subcommittee \nincluded these funds in title V of the bill as originally reported. As \nChairman of the Budget Committee, I allocated these funds to the \nAppropriations Committee, which in turn provided them to the Interior \nSubcommittee.\n  If the conferees had adopted the Senate language, I would not have \nbeen in the position of withdrawing this funding allocation. However, \nthe conferees modified the Senate language to provide only $699 million \nfor land acquisition, and to expand the use of these funds for \nadditional purposes: Critical maintenance activities are added as an \nallowable activity under this title V funding; $10 million is provided \nfor a payment to Humboldt County, CA, as part of the headwaters land \nacquisition; and $12 million is provided for the repair and maintenance \nof the Beartooth Highway as part of the Crown Butte/New World Mine Land \nacquisition.\n  I was a conferee on the bill. The Senate Budget Committee provided \nclarifying language to the conferees on the Interior appropriations \nbill during their meeting on September 30. This language simply \nrestated that moneys provided in title V, when combined with moneys \nprovided by other titles of the bill for Federal land acquisition, \nshall provide at least $700 million for Federal land acquisition and to \nfinalize priority land exchanges.\n  This language, which I urged be included throughout the 2-week period \nwhen final language was drafted, would have ensured that the section \n205 allocation remained in place for this bill.\n  However, the Chairman decided not to incorporate the Senate language, \nand in fact, included language which attempts to trigger the additional \n$700 million by amending the budget resolution. The language in the \nconference report is directed scorekeeping, which causes a violation \nunder section 306 of the Budget Act because it affects matters within \nthe jurisdiction of the Budge Committee that were not reported by the \nBudget Committee.\n  Mr. President, I object to the inclusion of this directed \nscorekeeping language in this bill, or any other bill. If the Senate \ntook language amending the budget resolution into account for \ndetermining budgetary levels, the\n\n[[Page S12652]]\n\nbudget resolution levels and our efforts to enforce a balanced budget \nplan would become meaningless.\n  Instead of making the choices necessary to live within the budget \nresolution levels, committees could simply rely on a precedent to \nassert, or ``Deem,'' that they had complied with the budgetary limits, \neven though they hadn't.\n  Such action would undermine the budget discipline of the Senate.\n  Since the directed scorekeeping language will not become effective \nuntil the bill is signed into law, and the conferees did not clarify \nthat $700 million is included in the bill for land acquisition and \npriority land exchanges, I had no choice but to withdraw the additional \nallocation of funding provided in section 205 of the budget resolution \nfor land acquisition and exchanges.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a table displaying the Budget Committee's \nscoring of the conference agreement accompanying the Interior and \nRelated Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 be placed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has filed a revised 302(b) \nallocation to reduce the Interior Subcommittee by the amounts \nwithdrawn.\n  The final bill is therefore $698 million in budget authority and $235 \nmillion in outlays above the subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation \nas filed by the Appropriations Committee.\n  The table follows:\n\n                H.R. 2107, INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory   Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,798   .......        55    13,853\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,707   .......        50    13,757\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,100   .......        55    13,155\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,472   .......        50    13,522\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,747   .......        55    13,802\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,771   .......        50    13,821\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     12,980   .......        55    13,035\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,382   .......        50    13,432\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,699   .......        55    13,754\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,687   .......        50    13,737\n \nCONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......        698   .......  .........      698\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......        235   .......  .........      235\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......         51   .......  .........       51\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......        -64   .......  .........      -64\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......        818   .......  .........      818\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......        325   .......  .........      325\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......         99   .......  .........       99\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......         20   .......  .........       20\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements and accomplishments of my fellow Montanans and good \nfriends, Dennis and Phyllis Washington.\n  Dennis was born July 27, 1934, in Missoula, Montana. As a young boy, \nhe moved to Bremerton, Washington, where he shined shoes and sold \nnewspapers to supplement the family income. At the tender age of 8, he \nwas diagnosed with polio and given little chance of survival. \nMiraculously, he survived and went back to Missoula to recover and live \nwith his grandmother. From this point on in his life, Dennis has fought \nand struggled against all odds to survive and succeed. Years later, \nthis struggle and dedication has become Washington Corp., which, \naccording to a recent article in USA Today, ``consists of 15 \nbusinesses, employs 14,000, and generates $2.5 billion a year in \nrevenue.''\n  However, Dennis has never forgotten where he came from. Dennis and \nPhyllis have strived to make Montana a better place. They have been \ninstrumental in ensuring that the university of Montana maintains its \n``tradition of excellence.'' In her position as chairperson of the \nUniversity's capital campaign, Phyllis led the 5-year effort to a \nrecord level of $71 million, over $7 million of which came from her own \npocket. That will mean a higher quality of education for our students \nhelping more of our children to find good jobs in Montana.\n  From his humble beginnings in a house next to the railroad tracks to \nhis present good fortune, the drive to help others has characterized \nDennis Washington's life. He is a model for America, personifying the \nAmerican dream that someone with big dreams can make those dreams a \nreality with a little intelligence and a lot of hard work.\n  I have great respect and admiration for Dennis. He is a Montana \noriginal whose story provides inspiration to me and many other \nMontanans. He has overcome tremendous adversity to become one of the \nmost successful businessmen in America. However, the one thing \nsurpassing his business acumen is his generosity to his fellow man. \nDennis and Phyllis Washington are true philanthropists that are \ndeserving of our recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12652-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12652-S12653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL RICHARD AUGUSTUS EDWARDS, JR.\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this week our nation bowed in \nhumble appreciation and respect to all who have worn the uniforms of \nthe U.S. military in recognition of Veterans' Day.\n  Today, family and friends gathered in Arlington Cemetery to give our \nfinal salute to one of those veterans--Brigadier General Richard \nAugustus Edwards, Jr.\n  Brigadier General Edwards was born in Smithfield, Virginia and \ngraduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1939. He joined the \nArmy in 1940 and during World War II served in Burma, India and China \nwith a mule-drawn artillery unit. He became an expert horseman, and \ncompeted for the Army in stadium jumping and polo.\n  After the war, he attended the Field Artillery School, the Command \nand General Staff College, and the National War College. He served in \nvarious assignments in Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle \nEast. His final combat command was the First Field Force Artillery in \nVietnam in 1968 and 1969. He retired from military service in 1972 \nafter serving in the Pentagon as head of officer assignments in the \nArmy's Office of Personnel Operations.\n  His honors included the Distinguished Service Medal, three Legion of \nMerit awards and the Bronze Star. I was honored to call him my friend.\n  At the Virginia Military Institute, which he loved as dearly as his \nfamily, there is an archway through which he passed daily in his \nformative years as a cadet. It bears this quote attributed to General \nStonewall Jackson, C.S.A.: ``You may be whatever you resolve to be.''\n  General Gus Edwards resolved to be his very best for his country, and \nhis life showed that he achieved that goal. How proud the General would \nhave been today of his son Richard Augustus Edwards, III as he was at \nhis very best and delivered these stirring, heartfelt remarks at his \nfather's funeral.\n  ``I confess I was taken aback when Dad asked me to say a few words at \nhis funeral. His funeral wasn't something we talked about very much. He \nwasn't particularly enthused by the topic. But I think his request had \nsomething to do with the fact that he was unable to attend his own \nfather's funeral. At the time my grandfather died, we were steaming \nacross the Atlantic to an assignment in Europe. Dad felt he never \nreally got to say goodbye, and I believe it was something that haunted \nhim; something that he didn't want me to experience. But for my part, I \nwas--and am--daunted by his request, especially in this company. What \ncan I possibly say that will be adequate to encompass or define our \nfifty-two year relationship? How can a son try to impart, in any \nconsequential way, the meaning of a father's lifetime of lessons and \nlove in just a few short minutes?\n  I've concluded that, for now, the best thing is to be brief. I will \nsay that my father was a man of many parts; like all of us, simple and \ncomplex at once. I think he showed us his simple side most of the time. \nBy simple, I mean unfettered, unaffected and straightforward.\n  He had a simple faith. He believed deeply and unequivocally in his \nGod.\n  He maintained a strong and simple belief in the rightness of truth \nand honor.\n  He placed a premium on fidelity, and insisted that loyalty is a two-\nway street.\n  He lived always by the VMI Honor Code, never to lie, cheat, or steal \nnor countenance those who do.\n  He despised expedience and had no patience with the cynicism of \nmodern deconstructionists.\n  There were not many gray areas in his life.\n\n[[Page S12653]]\n\n  He loved his country. He loved his home state of Virginia and he took \nreasonable pride in his roots, which reached back to Jamestown.\n  And most of all, he loved his family. Family was everything to him. \nHe adored and revered his parents. His brothers, their wives and \nchildren; my mother's sisters, their husbands and children, all were \nsources of endless interest, enjoyment and satisfaction to him. He \nshared forty-eight years with my mother, and they were totally devoted \nto one another.\n  And how he loved his girls: Augusta, who he was so proud to have bear \nhis name; Christine, in whom he took such delight as his first \ngrandchild; Annie, the only woman I know who he genuinely didn't mind \nlosing arguments to, and Babs, who gave so much of herself to him, \nespecially over the last few months. He was one lucky guy. And now he's \ncome full circle. As a newly minted second lieutenant in 1940, he \narrived here at Fort Meyer, his first duty station. He lived just a few \nsteps away from this chapel at Quarters 201-A, and he buried old \nsoldiers. Now the time has come to return the honor.\n  God bless you, Old Soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12652-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO WASHINGTON STATE CITIZEN DOUG SCOTT, 1997 RECIPIENT OF THE \n                      SIERRA CLUB JOHN MUIR AWARD\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished citizen of the great state of Washington, Mr. Doug Scott. \nDoug was recently recognized by the Sierra Club with the 105-year-old \norganization's highest award, the John Muir Award. The Sierra Club \npresents this award to honor individuals with a ``distinguished record \nof leadership--such as to continue John Muir's work of preservation and \nestablishment of parks and wilderness.''\n  Doug Scott has certainly perpetuated the vision and leadership of \nJohn Muir throughout his years of commitment to the environment. \nBeginning his career of dedication to the environment in 1967 by \njoining the Sierra Club, Doug moved from his first involvement in the \npublic policy process to be one of the original founders of Earth Day. \nFrom 1973 to 1977 Doug was the Sierra Club's Northwest field \nrepresentative. In 1980, Doug became the National Conservation Director \nof the Sierra Club and in 1988, the organization's Associate Executive \nDirector. In 1990, Doug left the Sierra Club for the beautiful San Juan \nIslands in my state of Washington to direct the San Juan Community \nTheater in Friday Harbor. Doug is now the Executive Director of a \nlocal, grass-roots environmental organization, Friends of the San \nJuans.\n  It is in this most recent capacity that I have come to most \nappreciate Doug's skills and abilities. Doug is an essential member of \nthe Northwest Straits Citizen's Advisory Commission that I convened \nwith Congressman Metcalf. This local citizen's advisory commission is \ndesigned to assess the resource protections needs and values of the \nNorthwest Straits marine environment and to explore the best ways to \nprovide protections for this exquisite natural area. Doug's \nparticipation in this process has been invaluable. His deep commitment \nto protection of the marine environment combined with his thoughtful, \ninnovative, and pragmatic approach has provided real progress for the \nCommission as it works through its mandate. Doug's ability to work with \nindividuals with differing idealogies and perspectives in a cooperative \nand productive manner is a true asset to the Commission, and to the \nNorthwest Straits as well.\n  In Doug's remarks at the Annual Awards Dinner, he said:\n\n       Much as this award is personally gratifying. I prefer to \n     think of it as recognition for an era in the growth and \n     growing effectiveness of the Sierra Club and the citizen \n     environmental movement. Each achievement during that era was \n     the work of many hands. This award is for all of the Sierra \n     Club volunteers and other activists that have proven that in \n     this democracy, working together, an engaged citizenry can \n     make a tremendous difference. I discovered the power of \n     citizen activism over 25 years ago in the Sierra Club and now \n     I see its impact every day in my work in the San Juan \n     Islands.\n\n  The Sierra Club has chosen well in awarding Doug Scott the John Muir \nAward. I applaud their decision and I applaud Doug Scott. I thank him \nfor his commitment to the environment of the San Juan Islands, the \nNorthwest Straits, Washington state, and the United States. Great work, \nDoug. Congratulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the nominating statement for Doug Scott by \nBruce Hamilton, Conservation Director of the Sierra Club be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n         Doug Scott Receives the Sierra club's John Muir Award\n\n\n nominating statement by Bruce Hamilton, conservation director, sierra \n                                  club\n\n       Doug has been a mentor and an inspiration to an entire \n     generation of environmental leaders, myself included. I feel \n     so lucky to have learned my skills at the side of this \n     master.\n       Doug had a way of turning dreams and visions into reality. \n     Ed Wayburn had the vision for an Alaska Lands Act, but it was \n     Doug Scott who pulled together and directed the 8 year \n     campaign that passed the largest land protection bill in \n     history. Rupert Cutler may have conceived of the RARE II \n     wilderness review, but it was Doug Scott who marshalled the \n     resources and provided the leadership to steer dozens of RARE \n     II wilderness bills through the Congress. When states like \n     Utah couldn't even boast a single wilderness area in the \n     entire state, Doug packaged a group of areas together into \n     the Endangered American Wilderness Act and mobilized a \n     national campaign to pass it. Doug also developed the \n     strategy that enabled us to pass the Superfund (remember the \n     Superactivist we mailed out of SF every Friday?), the Clean \n     Air Act Amendments (remember the Vento-Green medals?), and \n     other anti-pollution campaigns. He was the inspiration and \n     strategist for the California Desert Protection Act even \n     though it did not pass until after he had left the Club.\n       Doug was also the most inspirational and motivational \n     speaker within the Club, flying tens of thousands of miles \n     every year to appear at Chapter annual meetings and retreats \n     to preach about the power of the grassroots and the \n     importance of combating apathy and cynicism. He was also one \n     of the funniest leaders the Club has known, the source and \n     subject of jokes and follies songs. He was the spark behind \n     the national conservation work of the Club for 15 years.\n       The Club has been blessed with a series of powerful, \n     inspirational, smart, and articulate leaders that exemplify \n     the best traits of our founder, John Muir. From the late \n     1970's to the early 1990's Doug Scott lead the Club in the \n     spirit of John Muir. He deserves the Club's highest \n     conservation honor for his service, accomplishments, and \n     inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12653-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12653-S12656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on November 9 the Senate adopted \nConference Report 105-399, that accompanied S. 830, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization Act of 1997. This legislation puts into \nplace long-needed reforms in FDA's regulatory procedures and also \nreauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 [PDUFA] for an \nadditional 5 years.\n  The original PDUFA has brought faster reviews of drug applications. \nBy all accounts the success is due to the underlying collaboration and \npartnership between FDA and the developers of innovative new medicines \nin using the fees paid by industry to bring the necessary review \nresources to bear on applications for new drugs. The 1992 act did not \nset the performance goals for activities funded by user fees into the \nlaw. Rather, these performance goals were set forth in a side-letter \nfrom the administration to the chairs and ranking members of the House \nCommerce and Senate Labor and Human Resources committees. These \nperformance goals in the side-letter have stood the test of time--FDA \nhas honored and met these goals as if they were in statute. Based on \nthat experience, the Congress has agreed to use this approach again in \nestablishing the performance goals for drug reviews funded by user fees \nover the next 5 years.\n  Today, I am submitting for the Record a letter addressed to me and \nsigned by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, \ndated November 12, 1997. This letter specifies the performance goals \nfor the use of PDUFA fees for fiscal years 1998 through 2002. These \ngoals, which were agreed to at the conclusion of negotiations between \nFDA officials and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry \nrepresentatives, are those referred to in section 101(4) of the Food \nand Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the next 5 years will see \nreductions in the drug development time, as well as further reductions \nin the time taken to actual review an applications.\n\n[[Page S12654]]\n\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  The Secretary of\n\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 1997.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you are aware, the Prescription Drug \n     User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) expired at the end of Fiscal \n     Year 1997. Under PDUFA, the additional revenues generated \n     from fees paid by the pharmaceutical and biological \n     prescription drug industries have been used to expedite the \n     prescription drug review and approval process, in accordance \n     with performance goals that were developed by the Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA) in consultation with the \n     industries. To date, FDA has met or exceeded the review \n     performance goals agreed to in 1992, and is reviewing over 90 \n     percent of priority drug applications in 6 months and \n     standard drug applications in 12 months.\n       FDA has worked with representatives of the pharmaceutical \n     and biological prescription drug industries, and the staff of \n     your Committee, to develop a reauthorization proposal for \n     PDUFA that would build upon and enhance the success of the \n     original program. Title I, Subtitle A of the Food and Drug \n     Administration Modernization Act of 1997, S. 830, as passed \n     by the House and Senate on November 9, 1997, reflects the fee \n     mechanisms developed in these discussions. The performance \n     goals referenced in Section 101(4) are specified in the \n     enclosure of this letter, entitled ``PDUFA Reauthorization \n     Performance Goals and Procedures.'' I believe they represent \n     a realistic projection of what FDA can accomplish with \n     industry cooperation and the additional resources identified \n     in the bill.\n       This letter and the enclosed goals document pertain only to \n     Title I, Subtitle A (Fees Related to Drugs) of S. 830, the \n     Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997.\n       OMB has advised that there is no objection to the \n     presentation of these views from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program.\n       We appreciate the support of you and your staff, the \n     assistance of other Members of the Committee, and that of the \n     Appropriations Committees, in the reauthorization of this \n     vital program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n       Enclosure.\n\n         PDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures\n\n       The performance goals and procedures of the FDA Center for \n     Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for \n     Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), as agreed to under \n     the reauthorization of the prescription drug user fee program \n     in the ``Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of \n     1997,'' are summarized as follows:\n\n\n                 I. five-year review performance goals\n\n                            Fiscal year 1998\n\n       1.

NEW MOLECULAR ENTITY (NME) PERFORMANCE GOALS\n\n       The performance goals for standard and priority original \n     NMEs in each submission cohort will be the same as for all of \n     he original NDAs (including NMEs) in each submission cohort \n     but shall be reported separately.\n       For biological products, for purposes of this performance \n     goal, all original BLAs/PLAs will be considered to be NMEs.\n\n\n                     iii. meeting management goals\n\n                    A. Responses to Meeting Requests\n\n       1. Procedure: Within 14 calendar days of the Agency's \n     receipt of a request from industry for a formal meeting \n     (i.e., a scheduled face-to-face, teleconference, or video \n     conference) CBER and CDER should notify the requester in \n     writing (letter or fax) of the date, time, and place for the \n     meeting, as well as expected Center participants.\n       2. Performance Goal: FDA will provide this notification \n     within 14 days for 70% of requests (based on request receipt \n     cohort year) starting in FY 1999; 80% in FY 2000; and 90% in \n     subsequent fiscal years.\n\n                         B. Scheduling meetings\n\n       1. Procedure: The meeting date should reflect the next \n     available date on which all applicable Center personnel are \n     available to attend, consistent with the component's other \n     business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent \n     with the type of meeting requested. If the requested date for \n     any of these types of meetings is greater than 30, 60, or 75 \n     calendar days (as appropriate) from the date the request is \n     received by the Agency, the meeting date should be within 14 \n     calendar days of the date requested.\n       Type A Meetings should occur within 30 calendar days of the \n     Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       Type B Meetings should occur within 60 calendar days of the \n     Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       Type C Meetings should occur within 75 calendar days of the \n     Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       2. Performance goal: 70% of meetings are held within the \n     time frame (based on cohort year of request) starting in FY \n     1999; 80% in FY 2000; and 90% in subsequent fiscal years.\n\n                           C. Meeting minutes\n\n       1. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes which will be \n     available to the sponsor 30 calendar days after the meeting. \n     The minutes will clearly outline the important agreements, \n     disagreements, issues for further discussion, and action \n     items from the meeting in bulleted form and need not be in \n     great detail.\n       2. Performance goal: 70% of minutes are issued within 30 \n     calendar days of date of meeting (based on cohort year of \n     meeting) starting in FY 1999; 89% in FY 2000; and 90% in \n     subsequent fiscal years.\n\n                             D. Conditions\n\n       For a meeting to qualify for these performance goals:\n       1. A written request (letter or fax) should be submitted to \n     the review division; and\n       2. The letter should provide: a. A brief statement of the \n     purpose of the meeting; b. a listing of the specific \n     objectives/outcomes the requester expects from the meeting; \n     c. a proposed agenda, including estimated times needed for \n     each agenda item; d. a listing of planned external attendees; \n     e. a listing of requested participants/disciplines \n     representative(s) from the Center; f. the approximate time \n     that supporting documentation (i.e., the ``backgrounder'') \n     for the meeting will be sent to the Center (i.e., ``x'' weeks \n     prior to the meeting, but should be received by the Center at \n     least 2 weeks in advance of the scheduled meeting for Type A \n     or C meetings and at least 1 month in advance of the \n     scheduled meeting for Type B meetings); and\n       3. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful \n     purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary). \n     However, requests for a ``Type B'' meeting will be honored \n     except in the most unusual circumstances.\n\n\n                           iv. clinical holds\n\n                              A. Procedure\n\n       The Center should respond to a sponsor's complete response \n     to a clinical hold within 30 days of the Agency's receipt of \n     the submission of such sponsor response.\n\n                          B. Performance goal\n\n       75% of such responses are provided within 30 calendar days \n     of the Agency's receipt of the sponsor's response starting in \n     FY 98 (cohort of date of receipt) and 90% in subsequent \n     fiscal years.\n\n\n                      v. major dispute resolution\n\n                              A. Procedure\n\n       For procedural or scientific matters involving the review \n     of human drug applications and supplements (as defined in \n     PDUFA) that cannot be resolved at the divisional level \n     (including a request for reconsideration by the Division \n     after reviewing any materials that are planned to be \n     forwarded with an appeal to the next level), the response to \n     appeals of decisions will occur within 30 calendar days of \n     the Center's receipt of the written appeal.\n\n                          B. Performance goal\n\n       70% of such answers are provided within 30 calendar days of \n     the Center's receipt of the written appeal starting in FY \n     1999; 80% in FY 2000; and 90% in subsequent fiscal years.\n\n                             C. Conditions\n\n       1. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or \n     scientific issue at the Division level. If it cannot be \n     resolved at that level, it should be appealed to the Office \n     Director level (with a copy to the Division Director) and \n     then, if necessary, to the Deputy Center Director or Center \n     Director (with a copy to the Office Director).\n       2. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written \n     confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal \n     notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either \n     deny or grant the appeal.\n       3. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response \n     should include reasons for the denial and any actions the \n     sponsor might take in order to persuade the Agency to reverse \n     its decision.\n       4. In some cases, further data or further input from others \n     might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these \n     cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that \n     information (e.g., requesting further information from the \n     sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling \n     the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available \n     advisory committee).\n       5. In these cases, once the required information is \n     received by the Agency (including any advice from an advisory \n     committee), the person to whom the appeal was made, again has \n     30 calendar days from the receipt of the required information \n     in which to either deny or grant the appeal.\n       6. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the \n     response should include the reasons for the denial and any \n     actions the sponsor might take in order to persuade the \n     Agency to reverse its decision.\n       7. N.B. If the Agency decides to present the issue to any \n     advisory committee and there are not 30 days before the next \n     scheduled advisory committee, the issue will be presented at \n     the following scheduled committee meeting in order to allow \n     conformance with advisory committee administrative \n     procedures.\n\n\n         VI. SPECIAL PROTOCOL QUESTION ASSESSMENT AND AGREEMENT\n\n                              A. Procedure\n\n       Upon specific request by a sponsor (including specific \n     questions that the sponsor desires to be answered), the \n     agency will evaluate certain protocols and issues to assess \n     whether the design is adequate to meet scientific and \n     regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.\n       1. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific \n     questions about the protocol design and scientific and \n     regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement \n     (e.g., is the dose range in the carcinogenicity study \n     adequate, considering the intended clinical dosage; are the \n     clinical endpoints adequate to support a specific efficacy \n     claim).\n       2. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and \n     specific questions, the Agency will provide a written \n     response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment \n     of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the \n     sponsor. If the agency does not agree that the protocol \n     design, execution plans, data analyses are adequate to \n     achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the \n     disagreement will be explained in the response.\n       3. Protocols that qualify for this program include: \n     carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3 \n     protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary \n     basis of an efficacy claim. (For such Phase 3 protocols to \n     qualify for this comprehensive protocol assessment, the \n     sponsor must have had an end of Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meeting \n     with the review division so that the division is aware of the \n     developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed \n     and the questions being answered.)\n       4. N.B. For products that will be using Subpart E or \n     Subpart H development schemes, the Phase 3 protocols \n     mentioned in this paragraph should be construed to mean those \n     protocols for trails that will form the primary basis of an \n     efficacy claim no matter what phase of drug development in \n     which they happen to be conducted.\n       5. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outline \n     above and agreement with the Agency is reached on design, \n     execution, and analyses and if the results of the trial \n     conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of \n     the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the \n     protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for \n     approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is \n     that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses \n     proposed in protocols reviewed under this process the Agency \n     will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design, \n     execution, or analyses unless public health concerns \n     unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this \n     process are evident.\n\n                          B. Performance goal\n\n       60% of special protocols assessments and agreement requests \n     completed and returned to sponsor within time frames (based \n     on cohort year of request) starting in FY 1999; 70% in FY \n     2000; 80% in FY 2001; and 90% in FY 2002.\n\n\n              vii. electronic applications and submissions\n\n       The Agency shall develop and update its information \n     management infrastructure to allow, by fiscal year 2002, the \n     paperless receipt and processing of INDs and human drug \n     applications, as defined in PDUFA, and related submissions.\n\n[[Page S12656]]\n\n                      viii. additional procedures\n\n                  A. Simplification of action letters\n\n       To simplify regulatory procedures, the CBER and CDER intend \n     to amend their regulations and processes to provide for the \n     issuance of either an ``approval'' (AP) or a ``complete \n     response'' (CR) action letter at the completion of a review \n     cycle for a marketing application.\n\n   B. Timing of sponsor notification of deficiencies in applications\n\n       To help expedite the development of drug and biologic \n     products, CBER and CDER intend to submit deficiencies to \n     sponsors in form of an ``information request'' (IR) letter \n     when each discipline has finished its initial review of its \n     section of the pending application.\n\n\n                ix. definitions and explanation of terms\n\n       A. The term ``review and act on'' is understood to mean the \n     issuance of a complete action letter after the complete \n     review of a filed complete application. The action letter, if \n     it is not an approval, will set forth in detail the specific \n     deficiencies and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to \n     place the application in condition for approval.\n       B. A major amendment to an original application submitted \n     within three months of the goal date extends the goal date by \n     three months.\n       C. A resubmitted original application is a complete \n     response to an action letter addressing all identified \n     deficiencies.\n       D. Class 1 resubmitted applications are applications \n     resubmitted after a complete response letter (or a not \n     approvable or approvable letter) that include the following \n     items only (or combinations of these items):\n       1. Final printed labeling;\n       2. Draft labeling;\n       3. Safety updates submitted in the same format, including \n     tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data \n     and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new \n     information including important new adverse experiences not \n     previously reported with the product are presented in the \n     resubmission);\n       4. Stability updates to support provisional or final dating \n     periods;\n       5. Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including \n     proposals for such studies;\n       6. Assay validation data;\n       7. Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots to support \n     approval;\n       8. A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the \n     application (determined by the agency as fitting the Class 1 \n     category);\n       9. Other minor clarifying information (determined by the \n     Agency as fitting the Class 1 category); and\n       10. Other specific items may be added later as the Agency \n     gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via \n     guidance documents to industry.\n       E. Class 2 resubmissions are resubmissions that include any \n     other items, including any item that would require \n     presentation to an advisory committee.\n       F. A Type A Meeting is a meeting which is necessary for an \n     otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed (a \n     ``critical path'' meeting).\n       G. A Type B Meeting is a (1) pre-IND, (2) end of Phase 1 \n     (for Subpart E or Subpart H or similar products) or end of \n     Phase 2/pre-Phase 3, or (3) a pre-NDA/PLA/BLA meeting. Each \n     requestor should usually only request 1 each of these Type B \n     meetings for each potential application (NDA/PLA/BLA) (or \n     combination of closely related products, i.e., same active \n     ingredient but different dosage forms being developed \n     concurrently).\n       H. A Type C Meeting is any other type of meeting.\n       I. The performance goals and procedures also apply to \n     original applications and supplements for human drugs \n     initially marketed on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis through \n     an NDA or switched from prescription to OTC status through an \n     NDA or supplement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12653-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM D. MOORE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize \nthe work of one of my constituents--William D. Moore of Old Saybrook, \nConnecticut. Bill left his post as Executive Director of the \nSoutheastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce this month and his work in \nthat post deserves special recognition.\n  Bill has been at the helm of so many economic and development \ninitiatives in the Southern portion of our state that it is hard to \nlist all of them in this brief statement. But without a doubt, it is \nBill's leadership through some of the most difficult economic times in \nour state that really stand out in my mind.\n  When the very first round of base closures were being proposed in the \nPentagon in 1989, it was Bill Moore who literally marshaled the forces \nin Southern Connecticut. He recruited some of the most dynamic and \nbrilliant minds in our state to come together and review every single \ndocument, every single calculation, and even the very computer model \nused to analyze the various Groton-New London regional facilities under \nthe Defense Department's review. Bill created one of the most cohesive \nand effective team strategies ever presented to address the economic \nimpact issues which clearly were not being assessed by the Pentagon.\n  Although not all of our efforts were successful, it was Bill's \nforesight and commanding presence that eventually led our team to \nvictory in the fight to remove the New London Submarine Base from the \nBase Closure list in 1993. As a measure of credit, the Base Closure \nCommission belatedly admitted that the Navy's assumptions used to \nevaluate New London were flawed. Bill Moore was the man who first \npresented that information to the commission.\n  However, Bill's efforts have gone far beyond that monumental task. He \nhas been the usher at the door of an entire new economic era for \nSoutheastern Connecticut. Just as the defense down-sizing efforts were \ntaking their ravenous toll on our state and New London County in \nparticular, Bill encouraged and fostered new development for our state \nand helped bring about a more level-headed transition for our heavily \ndefense weighted economy. For example, he assisted in the appropriation \nof funds to rebuild the Connecticut State Pier and helped with the \nprivate-public partnerships that have rebuilt downtown New London. That \nwas no small task.\n  During Bill's tenure, the membership of the Southeastern Chamber has \nmore than doubled. Clearly, the contributions of those members have \nmade New London County what it is today.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention Bill's contributions \nduring the creation and expansion of two of the most successful Indian \ngaming facilities in the hemisphere. Bill's unique skills and \nperseverence made this transition for our region a positive and \ninclusive process.\n  In closing, let me just add my personal thanks and congratulations to \nBill and his family. I wish Bill and Maureen every success in their new \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12656-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12656-S12657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES STUDY ON IMMIGRATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nNational Academy of Sciences study on immigration that has received so \nmuch attention in the past year. This is a study the Senate Immigration \nSubcommittee held a hearing on this September featuring two of the \nprincipal authors of the report.\n  In releasing the study, the Academy stated quite clearly that \n``Immigration benefits the U.S. economy overall and has little negative \neffect on the income and job opportunities of most native-born \nAmericans.'' Moreover, the recent hearing showed that the study's \nfindings were actually more positive than the initial press reports \nindicated.\n  Ronald Lee, a professor of demography and economics at the University \nof California at Berkeley who performed the key fiscal analysis for the \nAcademy study, testified at the hearing that ``[The NAS] Panel asked \nhow the arrival of an additional immigrant today would affect U.S. \ntaxpayers. According to the report, over the long run an additional \nimmigrant and all descendants would actually save the taxpayers \n$80,000.'' Lee notes that immigrant taxes ``help pay for government \nactivities such as defense for which they impose no additional costs.'' \nImmigrants also ``contribute to servicing the national debt'' and are \nbig net contributors to Social Security.\n  Critics of immigration cite only the study's figures on the annual \ncosts immigrant households are said to impose on natives. However, Lee \ntestified that ``These numbers do not best represent the Panel's \nfindings, and should not be used for assessing the consequences of \nimmigration policies.'' This is a pretty clear statement that citing \nthe household cost figures to urge cuts in legal immigration is an \nimproper use of the study's data.\n  The problem, Lee found, was that calculating annual numbers requires \nusing an older model that counts the native-born children of immigrants \nas ``costs'' created by immigrant households when those children are in \nschool, but fails to include the taxes paid by those children of \nimmigrants once they complete their schooling, enter the work force, \nand become big tax contributors. The key fiscal analysis in the report, \nperformed in Chapter\n\n[[Page S12657]]\n\n7, corrects the flaws in the annual figures by using a dynamic model \nthat factors in the descendants of immigrants.\n  In response to a question from the subcommittee, Ronald Lee noted \nthat, with the necessary assumptions, a dynamic analysis would likely \nshow at least 49 of the 50 States come out ahead fiscally from legal \nimmigration, with California a close call.\n  Jim Smith, chairman of the NAS study, testified that ``Due to the \nimmigrants who arrived since 1980, total Gross National Product is \nabout $200 billion higher each year.'' In other words, recent \nimmigrants will add approximately $2 trillion to the nation's GNP over \nthe course of the 1990s.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a recent Wall Street Journal \narticle that goes into greater detail on the Academy study.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 1997]\n\n                      Immigrants Bring Prosperity\n\n                          (By Spencer Abraham)\n\n       Critics of America's immigration policy are attempting to \n     reignite the heated debate that almost produced laws severely \n     restricting legal immigration. Ironically, they are using as \n     their vehicle a National Academy of Sciences study, released \n     earlier this year, that was highly favorable toward \n     immigration. Anti-immigrant writers and advocacy groups have \n     engaged in a concerted effort to put a negative spin on the \n     report. ``The study highlights significant problems with \n     regard to immigration,'' crows the Center for Immigration \n     Studies.\n       That just won't wash. A recent hearing before the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Immigration found that the study's findings \n     were even more positive than initial press reports indicated.\n       The most important finding of the NAS report is that an \n     additional immigrant to the U.S. and all his descendants \n     would actually save taxpayers $80,000 over the long run. \n     Ronald Lee of the University of California, who was the \n     report's key fiscal analyst, notes that immigrant taxes \n     ``help pay for government activities such as defense for \n     which they impose no additional costs.'' Immigrants also \n     ``contribute to servicing the national debt'' and are big net \n     contributors to Social Security.\n       Critics of immigration cite only the study's figures on the \n     annual costs immigrant households are said to impose on \n     natives. However, Mr. Lee testified that ``these numbers do \n     not best represent the panel's findings, and should not be \n     used for assessing the consequences of immigration \n     policies.'' The problem, Mr. Lee found, was that calculating \n     annual numbers requires using an older model that counts the \n     native-born children of immigrants as ``costs'' created by \n     immigrant households when those children are in school, but \n     fails to include the taxes those children pay once they enter \n     the work force. The $80,000 figure was arrived at using a \n     dynamic model that factors in the descendants of immigrants. \n     As for the fiscal impact on states of legal immigration. Mr. \n     Lee said, with the necessary assumptions, a dynamic analysis \n     would likely show 49 of them coming out ahead, with \n     California a close call.\n       The benefits of legal immigration don't end there. Mr. Lee \n     said that the net present value to the nation of the \n     immigrants who will enter the U.S. during the 1990s is over \n     $500 billion. Jim Smith, chairman of the NAS study and a RAND \n     economist, testified that ``due to the immigrants who arrived \n     since 1980, total gross national product is about $200 \n     billion higher each year.'' In other words, recent immigrants \n     will add approximately $2 trillion to the nation's GNP over \n     the course of the 1990s.\n       Opponents of immigration also would like Americans to \n     believe that nearly everyone's wages are significantly lower \n     because of competition from immigrants. That is far from the \n     truth. The NAS study estimates that only two groups have seen \n     their wages affected by immigration: those who immigrated a \n     few years earlier, and native-born Americans who did not \n     finish high school. Wages for these groups are about 5% lower \n     than they would have been without immigration--a figure that \n     drops to 3% if only legal immigrants are counted, according \n     to Mr. Smith. Cutting legal immigration would have a ``quite \n     limited'' effect even on this group's wages, he said. \n     ``Fortunately,'' he noted, ``90% of Americans are not high \n     school dropouts, an the percent of high school dropouts has \n     been declining rapidly.'' Indeed, Mr. Smith added that \n     competition from immigrants sends wage signals that encourage \n     native-born Americans to stay in school.\n       ``The competition from immigration for even some native-\n     born workers can be easily exaggerated,'' testified Mr. \n     Smith. ``To the extent immigrants do work different than that \n     of native-born workers, immigration benefits all native-\n     Americans who gain in their other role as consumers of these \n     now less-expensive goods and services.''\n       In short, the NAS study confirms what most Americans have \n     known all along: Our tradition of welcoming immigrants pays \n     off--for the immigrants and for the rest of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12656-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12657-S12658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXTENDING CERTAIN PROGRAMS UNDER THE ENERGY POLICY AND CONSERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the situation in which we find \nourselves on this bill is a disgrace. The daily newspapers have been \nfilled recently with stories of our developing political confrontation \nwith Saddam Hussein. Just today, Saddam Hussein has ordered all \nAmerican arms inspectors to leave Iraq immediately, escalating Iraq's \ncrisis with the United Nations and heightening the possibility of a \nmilitary confrontation. We may well see military action in the Persian \nGulf before Congress convenes next year. We all know what that could do \nto oil markets. Prices might well spike up, right in the middle of the \nwinter heating season. The most effective antidote to such damaging \nprice fluctuations is close communication among the major oil \nconsumption nations, and joint action to calm oil markets through the \nInternational Energy Agency [IEA]. Yet the bill before us, once again, \nfails to make the legal changes that are needed for the United States \nto continue to participate meaningfully in the IEA.\n  The United States took the lead in forming the IEA after the Arab oil \nembargo of 1973, so that we would never again have to experience the \nmarket chaos that reigned at that time. At that time, it seemed that \nthe best way to avoid a repeat of gas lines around the world was \nthrough mandatory allocations of world oil supplies. This was basically \na command-and-control approach to the problem. This mandatory \nallocation mechanism was enshrined in our basic law on oil emergencies, \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 [EPCA], which also \nauthorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and which this bill would \nextend. But the world has changed since the 1970's. Oil markets have \nchanged dramatically since then. And the mandatory allocation scheme \ncontained in the original EPCA is a dinosaur.\n  The United States has taken the lead in designing a flexible \ninternational response mechanism to oil supply disruptions that \nrespects market forces. Our domestic oil industry played a key role in \nthe planning process and has endorsed it. We convinced all of the other \ncountries in the IEA to adopt it. But without statutory changes to \nEPCA, the United States is placed in the absurd position of not being \nable to participate in the international oil emergency response system \nthat it designed. And all indications from the Persian Gulf are that we \ncould have another emergency sometime soon.\n  Why are we in such a predicament? It is not the fault of the \nadministration. They have been pressing for the adoption of the needed \nlegal changes for 3 years now. It is not the fault of this Body. We \nhave passed the requisite legal changes in both the last Congress and \nin this Congress, and have forwarded them to the other Body. There is \nno good answer to the question of why the other Body continues to \nrefuse to act on such clearly needed changes. These necessary changes \nhave apparently been made a hostage to other, non-related issues. So we \nmust pass the bill before us today, which is inadequate to our national \nsecurity needs, or the President will also be without clear legal \nauthorities to operate the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in case of an \noil supply emergency.\n  I will vote for this bill, Mr. President, with extreme reluctance. \nBut I hope that no one is under the illusion that it advances our \nenergy security. Quite the opposite. The bill sent to us by the other \nBody will likely reduce our energy security, by inflicting long-term \ndamage on the International Energy Agency. This is because failure of \nthe bill to allow IEA to work with U.S. oil companies threatens the \nfuture of the Agency. When there are severe supply shortages or market \ninstability, the IEA requires real-time information about the movement \nand location of oil stocks that only these oil companies can provide. \nIn such a case, this information is shared at the express request of \nthe U.S. Government. But the sharing of this information is normally \nforbidden under our antitrust laws, so an antitrust exemption of cover \ninformation-sharing undertaken at the U.S. Government's request is both \nneeded and justified.\n\n  What is U.S. industry to make of our refusal, for a third time now, \nto make\n\n[[Page S12658]]\n\nthe appropriate changes to EPCA? I believe that industry will see the \npassage of this legislation as a signal that the changes to U.S. law \nneeded for their continued participation in the IEA will not be \nforthcoming in this Congress, if ever. None of us should be surprised, \nthen, when these companies end their cooperation with the IEA and start \nto reassign the personnel who previously worked on the issues of \nemergency preparedness and coordination.\n  The refusal of the other Body to act on the needed antitrust \nexemption places the two most important parts of the program of the IEA \nfor 1998 in serious jeopardy. I would like to describe these planned \nactivities in a little detail, which will illustrate how our energy \nsecurity will be diminished by this bill, even if a crisis in the \nPersian Gulf does not occur while we are out of session. First, IEA was \nplanning to convene a global conference next year to discuss the \ncoordinated management of emergency oil stocks. For the first time, \nChina, India, and other Asian countries, which will be crucial players \nin any international oil emergency, would have been represented. This \nconference will be an important opportunity to convince them to develop \ntheir own emergency stockpiles, and will provide a venue for them to \nlearn the practicalities involved in doing so. The U.S. Government has \ncontributed $50,000 towards holding this conference. Without the \nnecessary antitrust exemption, though, the conference will likely be \ncanceled, since the key players with expertise in creating and managing \nemergency stocks, the oil companies that operate in the United States, \nare precluded from participating under current law. I don't see how \nthat serves our national interests. Second, the IEA was also planning \nto hold, in 1998, the first drill in 5 years to exercise its emergency \nmechanisms. This is important to the smooth functioning of IEA's \nmechanisms in an actual emergency. In the last 5 years, most of the \npersonnel with knowledge of what actually transpired during the Persian \nGulf war on world oil markets have left the scene. It is past time that \nwe have held an exercise to test our present capabilities to handle an \nemergency. Next year's exercise would also have been the first full \ntest of the revised procedures put in place since the Persian Gulf war. \nWithout the antitrust exemption, this exercise either cannot be held, \nor it must be limited to exercising only the obsolete IEA procedures \nfor mandatory supply allocation. Industry interest in doing the latter \nis minimal, so the exercise will in all likelihood be canceled. Such an \navoidable development is also not in our national interest.\n  If there were legitimate issues being raised by the other Body with \nrespect to the broader legislation that is needed, that would be one \nthing. Such issues could be worked out in conference. But the only \naction from the other Body to our requests for the legal changes needed \nto maintain our energy security, for the past 3 years now, has been to \nwait until the end of session, to pass a short bill extending the \nexpiration dates in current law, and to leave town. I believe that our \ncountry has been poorly served by this inattention to our national \nsecurity interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12657-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12658-S12660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on Sunday, November 10, 1997, \nthe Senate passed H.R. 2607, making Appropriations for the District of \nColumbia for fiscal year 1998. On November 10, 1997, under a unanimous-\nconsent agreement, Senators Stevens and Byrd were directed to file an \nexplanatory statement on the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, \n1998.\n  Earlier today, the Senate passed the appropriations bill for the \nDistrict of Columbia. Senators Stevens, Byrd, Boxer and I submit the \nattached bipartisan statement to accompany H.R. 2607, making \nappropriations for the District of Columbia for fiscal year 1998.\n       The statement follows:\n\n    Explanatory Statement of the Senate Committee on Appropriations\n\n       The Senate Committee on Appropriations submits the \n     following statement in explanation of the effect of the act \n     of the House and Senate on the accompanying bill (H.R. 2607), \n     which passed the House and the Senate.\n       The House- and Senate-passed bill on the District of \n     Columbia Appropriations Act, 1998, incorporates most of the \n     provisions of the Senate version of the bill and a number of \n     provisions of the House version of the bill. The language and \n     allocations set forth in Senate Report 105-75 should be \n     complied with unless specifically addressed to the contrary \n     in the accompanying bill and statement.\n       Senate Amendment: The Senate deleted the entire House bill \n     after the enacting clause and inserted the Senate bill. The \n     House amended the Senate bill, which was passed by the House \n     and Senate.\n\n\n                                title i\n\n       Management Reform--The bill provides $8,000,000 in federal \n     funds for a program of management reform for the District of \n     Columbia government. The Revitalization Act and the \n     Management Reform Act, which were enacted with the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997, have created an opportunity for the \n     District of Columbia to correct years of mismanagement \n     throughout the District government as documented by the \n     District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management \n     Assistance Authority (Authority) and numerous Congressional \n     hearings. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1998, \n     provides $8,000,000 to fund the hiring of management \n     consultants to conduct comprehensive reviews of nine major \n     agencies and four major citywide functions of the District \n     government. In addition, the appropriation funds the position \n     of a chief management officer [CMO], who will oversee the \n     responsibilities assigned the Authority under the Management \n     Reform Act. The Congress will closely monitor each step of \n     implementation of the Management Reform Act to ensure that \n     the District continues the task of returning the District to \n     a position of long-term financial responsibility.\n       Federal Contribution--The bill provides $190,000,000 for a \n     Federal contribution to the District of Columbia towards the \n     cost of operating the District government. The appropriation \n     represents the amount authorized by section 11402 of the \n     National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government \n     Improvement Act of 1997. The District is directed to use \n     $30,000,000 of the Federal contribution to repay the \n     accumulated general fund deficit.\n       Federal Payment to the District of Columbia Criminal \n     Justice System--The bill provides $108,000,000 for operation \n     of the District of Columbia Courts and the pension costs of \n     certain court employees. The bill further provides that the \n     Office of Management and Budget shall apportion quarterly \n     payments from this appropriation to the District government \n     for the courts' operations. In addition, payroll and \n     financial services are to be provided on a contractual basis \n     with the General Services Administration, which is directed \n     to provide monthly financial reports to the President and the \n     designated Congressional committees. The bill provides that, \n     of this appropriation, up to $750,000 is available for the \n     establishment and operations of the Truth in Sentencing \n     Commission authorized by the National Capital Revitalization \n     and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997.\n       The bill further directs $43,000,000 for payment to the \n     Offender Supervision Trustee for obligation by the Trustee as \n     follows: $26,855,000 for Parole, Adult Probation and Offender \n     Supervision; $9,000,000 to the Public Defender Service; \n     $6,345,000 to the Pretrial Services Agency; and $800,000 to \n     be transferred to the United States Parole Commission.\n       District of Columbia Public Schools--The Committee notes \n     with concern the delay in opening the District of Columbia \n     public schools [DCPS] for the 1997-98 academic year. In order \n     to ensure that the District's public schools do not \n     experience a similar delay for the 1998-99 academic year, the \n     Committee directs the Chief Executive Officer of the DCPS to \n     report to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and \n     the House, the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate, \n     and the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the \n     House by April 1, 1998, on all measures necessary and all \n     steps to be taken to ensure that the District's public \n     schools open pursuant to the DCPS schedule. The Committee \n     directs that the report to Congress include a description of \n     all building repairs needed to provide safe, habitable \n     schools, and a timetable to complete repairs prior to the \n     beginning of the 1998-99 academic year.\n       District of Columbia Charter Schools--The Committee is \n     concerned about the slow progress of public charter schools \n     in the District of Columbia. Since enactment of the District \n     of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995, which established \n     public charter school authority in the District, only three \n     public charter schools have been established to date. Public \n     charter schools are one of two opportunities to inject \n     competition among the educational choices available to \n     parents in the District and to make significant improvements \n     in the quality of education provided to children in the \n     District of Columbia. The Committee is hopeful that the \n     current charter school application process will produce more \n     public charter schools in the District. It is also the hope \n     of the Committee that the District of Columbia public charter \n     schools and the public charter school community will work \n     together on solutions for the capital needs of public charter \n     schools.\n       The bill provides $3,376,000 from local funds, not \n     including funds already made available for District of \n     Columbia public schools, for public charter schools. Of this\n\n[[Page S12659]]\n\n     amount, $400,000 shall be available for the District of \n     Columbia Public Charter School Board. The bill also \n     establishes a revolving loan fund for current or new public \n     charter schools. If any funds are not allocated by May 1, \n     1998, these funds shall be deposited in the revolving loan \n     fund. In addition, the bill requires the District of Columbia \n     public schools to report to Congress within 120 days of \n     enactment, on the capital needs of each public charter \n     schools.\n       The bill further provides that each public charter school \n     authority may grant up to 10 charters per school year and may \n     approve these charters before January 1 of the calendar year. \n     The bill increases the number of members on a charter \n     school's board of trustees from 7 to 15. The bill also allows \n     an increase in annual payments to charter schools that \n     provide room and board in a residential setting. Finally, the \n     Committee agrees to require increasing the annual payment to \n     charter schools to take into account leases or purchases of, \n     or improvements to, the building facility of the charter \n     school. The charter school must make its request for an \n     increase in its annual payment by April 1 of the fiscal year.\n       Deficit Reduction and Revitalization--The bill approves the \n     plan of the Mayor, District Council and Authority to allocate \n     $201,090,000 to the reduction of the District's accumulated \n     general fund deficit, capital expenditures, and management \n     and productivity improvements. The bill directs that not less \n     than $160,000,000 be used for reduction of the accumulated \n     general fund deficit. The Committee agrees to the deficit \n     reduction and revitalization plan proposed by the District \n     government and Authority in lieu of the House proposal for a \n     District of Columbia Taxpayer's Relief Fund and Deficit \n     Reduction Fund.\n       Medical Malpractice Reform--The Committee notes with \n     concern that the District of Columbia is one of the few \n     jurisdictions in the country that has failed to enact medical \n     malpractice reform. The continued increase in medical \n     litigation in the district drives up the cost and reduces the \n     availability of health care for all District residents and \n     others who receive health care resources. The Committee \n     directs the authority, in consultation with the District \n     government, to evaluate the issue of medical malpractice \n     reform and report to Congress by March 1, 1998, \n     recommendations on medical malpractice reform for the \n     District.\n       University of the District of Columbia School of Law--The \n     Committee is concerned that students enrolled at the \n     University of the District of Columbia School of Law (School) \n     are not receiving the quality education that is required to \n     prepare them for a successful career in the legal profession. \n     The Committee directs the Authority to report to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives, the Senate Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Reform and \n     Oversight by March 1, 1998, on the accreditation status of \n     the School. The Authority shall include in its report \n     recommendations on whether or not the School should continue \n     to: (1) operate and (2) receive funds from the District of \n     Columbia government.\n       Public Space Misconduct--The Committee is concerned about \n     the ongoing problem of loitering, panhandling, alcohol \n     consumption, verbal harassment, littering, and other improper \n     and illegal activities in parks and other public spaces in \n     the District. These activities discourage visitors to the \n     District, hamper economic and neighborhood development, and \n     facilitate serious criminal activity. The Committee directs \n     the Metropolitan Police Department [MPD], in consultation \n     with the Council, the Mayor, the Authority, and relevant \n     Federal law enforcement agencies, to develop and implement a \n     plan to end such activities and ensure that public spaces are \n     safe and attractive for families and others seeking \n     legitimate recreation. The Committee further directs the MPD \n     to adopt a zero tolerance enforcement strategy for public \n     space misconduct during fiscal year 1998.\n       Performance and Financial Accountability Requirements--The \n     bill includes the Senate provision amending the Federal \n     Payment Reauthorization Act of 1994 relating to performance \n     and financial accountability requirements for the District \n     government. Section 130 shifts responsibility for preparing \n     the performance accountability plans from the Mayor to the \n     Authority. Responsibility for the financial accountability \n     plan and report is shifted from the Mayor to the Chief \n     Financial Officer. In addition, the bill amends the dates for \n     submission of the plans and report to Congress.\n       Section 138. This section contains a new provision that \n     requires the Authority to submit to the Congressional \n     committees of jurisdiction quarterly reports that include an \n     itemized accounting of all non-appropriated funds obligated \n     or expended by the Authority for the quarter.\n       United States Park Police--The Committee agrees to the \n     House recommendation for a $12,000,000 appropriation for the \n     United States Park Police. The Committee intends that the \n     appropriation in section 141 is new Federal funding authority \n     and is not to be an offset against any existing \n     appropriations. The Committee intends this appropriation as a \n     separate appropriation to be available only for the United \n     States Park Police operations in the District of Columbia.\n       District of Columbia Homeless Services--Section 142 \n     provides that the District government maintain for fiscal \n     year 1998 the same funding levels for the District's homeless \n     services as were provided in fiscal year 1997.\n       Sections 144 and 145.--The bill includes two provisions \n     related to alcohol abuse, with a special emphasis on youth \n     alcohol use, in the District of Columbia. The Committee \n     recognizes that this is a serious problem in the District of \n     Columbia, as it is throughout the nation. The first provision \n     would increase the number of Alcoholic Beverage Commission \n     inspectors in the District to sixteen and increase the \n     emphasis placed on enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale \n     of alcoholic beverages to minors. Currently, the D.C. \n     Alcoholic Beverage Commission has just three inspectors in \n     the field in addition to their chief, who also performs \n     inspections of alcohol outlets. These four inspectors are \n     responsible for monitoring over 1,600 alcoholic beverage \n     outlets. In contrast, Baltimore employs 18 regular inspectors \n     in addition to a number of part-time inspectors. It is \n     illegal for persons under the age of twenty-one to purchase, \n     possess, or consume alcoholic beverages in the District. In \n     addition, the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is \n     prohibited. The Committee is concerned that these laws are \n     not being adequately enforced.\n       The second provision calls for the General Accounting \n     Office to conduct a study of the District's alcoholic \n     beverage excise taxes. The study should examine whether \n     increasing alcoholic beverage excise taxes would be useful in \n     reducing alcohol-related crime, violence, deaths, and youth \n     alcohol use. The study will also explore whether alcohol is \n     being sold in close proximity to schools and other areas \n     where children are likely to be and whether the creation of \n     alcohol free zones in areas frequented by children would be \n     useful in deterring underage alcohol consumption.\n       District of Columbia Day-care and Home-care Operation.--The \n     Committee is concerned that a significant number of District \n     of Columbia day-care and home-care operations have been \n     allowed to operate without proper licenses. The Committee is \n     also concerned that the District government is failing in its \n     mission to monitor effectively overall safety and quality \n     standards at these facilities. These problems have reached \n     crisis proportions, undermining welfare reform implementation \n     and resulting in an unacceptable risk of harm to the children \n     of the District. For these reasons, section 146 of the bill \n     allows the District to expend such funds as may be necessary \n     to hire additional monitors and inspectors at the appropriate \n     City agencies to promote quality child care in the District. \n     The Committee also expects this issue to be addressed in the \n     development and implementation of the management reforms \n     authorized by the District of Columbia Management Reform Act \n     of 1997.\n       Section 159. The bill includes a technical amendment to a \n     provision concerning the pay of officers and members of the \n     United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, recently \n     enacted in section 118 of Public Law 105-61, the Treasury and \n     General Government Appropriations Act, 1998. Due to a \n     drafting error, the world ``locality'' was substituted for \n     ``longevity''. The amendment is retroactive to the date of \n     enactment of Public Law 105-61.\n       Section 160. The bill provides $3,000,000 for a Medicare \n     Coordinated Care Demonstration Project in the District of \n     Columbia. This pilot program was authorized in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997, Public Law 105-33, section (e)(1)(A)(ii), \n     for the purpose of reducing Medicare costs. The pilot program \n     will establish specific Clinical Pathways for more cost-\n     effective treatment of patients in the high-volume, high-cost \n     Disease Related Group [DRG]. It is expected that this pilot \n     project will help develop improved diagnostic and therapeutic \n     procedures for treating the District's Medicare patients at \n     reduced costs and provide the basis for more cost-effective \n     national standards.\n       Section 161. This section provides that the Authority shall \n     have the responsibility for approving both reorganization \n     plans and any authorization for programs or functions for \n     which a reorganization plan is required.\n       Section 162. The bill includes a technical amendment to \n     correct drafting errors and to clarify statutory language to \n     reflect the intent of the conferees of the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997 with respect to the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program.\n       Section 163. This section provides the General Service \n     Administration with the authority to amend the use \n     restrictions which accompanied the conveyance of a land \n     parcel in 1956. The amended use restrict will allow the \n     construction of a previously approved veterans nursing home \n     on the grounds adjacent to an existing veterans family.\n       Section 165. This section directs the Authority to \n     appropriate $2,600,000 from local funds for a pay raise for \n     uniformed fire fighters of the District's Fire and Emergency \n     Medical Services Department. The purpose of the pay raise is \n     to make the District's compensation for fire fighters \n     comparable to fire fighters in surrounding jurisdictions. The \n     Committee intends that the Authority use its discretion \n     determine the source of the funds for the pay raise.\n       Section 166. This section provides a technical change to \n     allow the Office of Personnel Management to waive the \n     retirement annuity offset requirement for the Trustee for \n     Offender Supervision consistent with a similar provision \n     included in the National Capital Revitalization and Self-\n     Government Improvement Act of 1997 for the Trustee for \n     Corrections.\n\n[[Page S12660]]\n\n                                TITLE II\n\n       Section 201 sets out the short title of the Act.\n       Section 202 establishes a mechanism for certain Nicaraguans \n     and Cubans who have been present in the United States since \n     1995 to adjust to the status of lawful permanent resident.\n       Section 203 modifies certain transition rules established \n     by IIRIRA with regard to suspension of deportation and \n     cancellation of removal. The changes state that the ``stop \n     time'' rule established by that Act in section 240A of the \n     INA shall apply generally to individuals in deportation \n     proceedings before April 1, 1997, with certain exceptions. \n     They also state that the rule shall not apply to certain \n     applicants for suspension of deportation. The exception \n     includes certain Salvadorans and Guatemalans who were members \n     of the ABC class or applied for asylum by April 1, 1990 and \n     derivatives as specified in the statute, as well as \n     applicants from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe \n     who came here by December 31, 1990 and applied for asylum by \n     December 31, 1991 and derivatives as specified in the \n     statute. Section 203 also makes clear that in order to obtain \n     cancellation these individuals have to meet the standards \n     laid out in that section, rather than the ones laid out in \n     section 240A of the INA. Finally, the section provides for \n     temporary reductions in visas available under the \n     ``diversity'' and ``other workers'' immigration categories, \n     with the reduction in the latter to take effect after those \n     in the backlog have received visas.\n       Section 204 makes technical and clarifying changes to \n     certain provisions in section 240A(e) of the INA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12658-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HISTORIC TOWN HALL MEETING IN BILLINGS, MONTANA\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of one city in Montana in addressing the issues of \ngangs, violence and kids.\n  On September 29, 1997, a historic town hall meeting took place in \nBillings, Montana. This cooperative and coordinated effort involved the \nmedia, school officials, and community leaders. It also involved a \ncritical component: experts in addressing gang activity from Los \nAngeles. Together this effort created an hour-long video conference \ncalled ``Gangs, Violence and Kids'' and aired it on every major media \noutlet in the Billings area.\n  This presentation incorporated a panel and studio audience format \nwhich brought in a cross-section of the population, including \nteenagers, represented in the region. Concerns were raised, perceptions \nwere addressed, and issues were confronted in an honest and \nstraightforward manner.\n  By no means an end to itself, this town hall meeting has launched a \nseries of follow-up gatherings, a foundation, a mentoring connection \nand a pipeline of support for ongoing programs like the U.S. Department \nof Justice's Weed and Seed program for Billings and surrounding \ncommunities has been established.\n  Beginning last week, a series of 30-second public service \nannouncements were aired to address the issues raised in the town hall \nmeeting. This campaign will contribute to the community's understanding \nof how these important issues affect all our neighborhoods. I \nespecially appreciate the significant commitment by those who have \nagreed to continue in their role as advocates for change.\n  I am extremely proud of what Billings has accomplished and how its \nresidents strive to respond to important issues. I hope my colleagues \nwill agree that this successful effort in Billings is a model that can \nbe duplicated in their community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12660-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FUNDING FOR THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my \ndisappointment that--due to compromises made during negotiations over \nthree separate conference reports, the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill for FY 1998, the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations bill for FY 1998, and the State Department Authorization \nAct for FY 1998-99--conferees were forced to trade away authorization \nand appropriations that would have cleared existing U.S. debt to the \nUnited Nations. As the Senate adjourns for the holiday recess, only a \nfraction of the $900 million in arrears payments that was originally \nproposed by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on which I serve \nwas included in the CJS appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, what this means is that we will still be in \nsubstantial debt to the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, the United Nations is not a perfect organization. I \ncertainly have some real concerns about the size and extent of the UN \nbureaucracy, for example. Just as with any organization this big, we \nmust be on guard against possible mismanagement or abuse, and certainly \nthe U.N. system has had its share of both.\n  But at the same time, I think that U.S. participation in the United \nNations--with all the benefits and costs that membership implies--is an \nindispensable tool in this country's foreign policy bag. When it \noperates effectively, the United Nations provides a framework to serve \nU.S. interests at the same time that it achieves economies of scale.\n  Just this week, Mr. President, the United States is working within \nthe U.N. structure to assert a united front against the flagrant abuses \nof international law exercised by Iraq in recent weeks. Mr. President, \nif nothing else, the crisis in Iraq aptly demonstrates the value of the \nUnited Nations to our country.\n  I would make a similar point about the role the United Nations plays \nin peacekeeping operations. U.N. forces have participated in more than \n40 peacekeeping operations around the world since 1948. Members of this \nbody may have disagreements over whether or not each and every one of \nthose was necessary, but when you look at places where the U.N. has \nbeen instrumental in maintaining cease-fires or providing humanitarian \nrelief, it is clear that the United States can achieve its national \ninterest goals at a lower cost to U.S. taxpayers than would be possible \nif the United States tried to do it alone.\n  Mr. President, during the listening sessions that I conduct in the 72 \ncounties in the state of Wisconsin, I hear sympathetic words from my \nconstituents about the need for the involvement of the international \ncommunity in times of crisis. But they also express hesitation about \nsending their sons and daughters to fight in far-away conflicts.\n  The United Nations provides a mechanism through which the United \nStates can contribute to international security without having to send \nour own troops every time there is a problem.\n  The U.N. reform and funding package that was agreed to in the Foreign \nRelations Committee was a carefully crafted compromise between those \nthat would limit or eliminate U.S. participation in the United Nations \nand those that would like to see a fully funded and active United \nNations.\n  But, Mr. President, due to the intransigence of some of our \ncolleagues in the other body, it appears that the moral and legal \nobligations of the United States to pay its debts to the United Nations \nhave been sacrificed to serve an unrelated domestic interest.\n  The compromise package worked out in our Committee would have \ngradually decreased the amount of our assessed contribution to the \nUnited Nations from the current level of 25 percent, to 20 percent by \nfiscal year 2001. Assuming the budget for the United Nations remained \nconstant, the time line set forth in this package could have saved the \nUS taxpayer at least $375 million over the next four years from a \ncombination of savings from the assessments and from budget discipline. \nIt would have allowed us to continue our participation in the United \nNations, which I think is important, while at the same time achieving \nsome real cost savings for the taxpayer.\n  Now, with authorization of repayment of these arrears in jeopardy, it \nremains unclear how the United States will manage to clean the slate \nwith the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will be able to resolve this issue when the \nSenate returns for the 2d session of the 105th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12660-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12660-S12662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL D-DAY MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

William A. McIntosh, USA (Ret.)\n\n       The National D-Day Memorial Foundation's strength, both \n     institutionally and operationally, is closely tied to a \n     conscious and deliberate commitment to its mission, a \n     statement that bears repeating here: The purpose of the \n     National D-Day Memorial Foundation is to memorialize the \n     valor, fidelity,and sacrifices of the Allied Armed Forces on \n     D-Day, June 6, 1944. Its specific mission is to establish in \n     Bedford, Virginia, and maintain for the nation, a memorial \n     complex, consisting of a monument and education center, that \n     celebrates and preserves the legacy of D-Day. Its operational \n     objectives are to ensure the operation, integrity, and \n     security of the D-Day Memorial Complex; to sponsor innovative \n     commemorations, educational programs, projects, and exhibits, \n     that foster an awareness of D-Day's historical significance; \n     and to seek and provide educational opportunities that will \n     preserve, for present and future generations, the meaning and \n     lessons of D-Day.\n       Our immediate focus, to which today's ceremony bears \n     witness, is on construction of a monument. And so it should \n     be. But, as the mission statement explicitly indicates, the \n     long-term focus of this enterprise is education. It is \n     through education--ultimately, only through education--that a \n     memorial sustains its meaning, to say nothing whatever of its \n     immediacy.\n       The older generations know why they are here; those less \n     old feel they should be here but are perhaps less sure why; \n     most of the youngsters are here because someone brought or \n     compelled them. A few of those children will participate with \n     the assembled dignitaries in the actual groundbreaking. That \n     intergenerational participation, symbolic on one level, will \n     have been real enough by ceremony's end. And no one will \n     leave this place without knowing why this event has taken \n     place or, finally, why he or she came.\n       In warranting the National D-Day Memorial to rise up \n     outside Washington--to take root on the same heartland soil \n     that once held seed that flowered on D-Day and came to \n     harvest in a liberated Europe--the Congress of the United \n     States acted with noteworthy courage and vision. It will, \n     through its ongoing educational and interpretative programs, \n     memorialize, for present and future generations, the valor, \n     fidelity, and sacrifices of the Allied Forces on D-Day. Such \n     is its national duty--and its particular privilege.\n\n                          The Meaning of D-Day\n\n                    (By Col. Robert A. Doughty, USA)\n\n       During the twentieth century, American armed forces have \n     often used the generic term ``D-Day'' to indicate the date a \n     military operation would begin. By using the term D-Day \n     commanders and planners could orchestrate the logical, \n     sequential arrival of units and equipment. Planners could \n     anticipate, for example, on D+1 certain actions occurring or \n     specific units arriving. Using the term D-Day also permitted \n     military commanders to change the date of operations easily \n     without causing confusion or disrupting preparations. General \n     Dwight D. Eisenhower, for example, changed the date of the \n     landings in Normandy because of bad weather. Thus, American \n     planners in World War II often used the term D-Day to assist \n     in the planning and conduct of operations in the Pacific and \n     European theaters.\n       After June 6, 1944, however, the term D-Day became \n     synonymous with the landings on the Normandy beaches and the \n     beginning of what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the \n     ``mighty endeavor.'' The day marked the decisive coming to \n     grips with the Germans for which the Allies had been \n     preparing since the fall of France and the withdrawal of the \n     British from Dunkirk. D-Day marked a major step in winning a \n     victory over the Axis powers in Europe.\n       Many years after the invasion General Omar N. Bradley, who \n     commanded the American First Army in the operation, said, \n     ``Even now it brings pain to recall what happened there on \n     June 6, 1944. I have returned many times to honor the valiant \n     men who died on that beach. They should never be forgotten. \n     Nor should those who lived to carry the day by the slimmest \n     of margins.'' Bradley noted that every man who set foot on \n     those beaches that day was a ``hero.'' He later wrote, \n     ``Freedom is not a gift, and . . . democracy can extract both \n     stern and unequal payment from those who share its bounty. \n     Freedom is neither achieved nor retained without sacrifice by \n     individuals, often in unequal measure.''\n       A tragic part of that ``unequal measure'' was paid by the \n     people of Bedford, Virginia. On the morning of June 6, 1944, \n     D-Day, about sixty percent of A Company, 116th Regiment, 29th \n     Infantry Division, had come from Bedford. As part of the \n     first wave in the landings on Omaha Beach, A Company \n     confronted some of the strongest enemy resistance Allied \n     forces encountered that fateful day. In the short space of \n     only a few minutes, A Company lost 96% of its effective \n     strength. War always has been and always will be a terrible \n     thing, and it indeed was a terrible thing that morning for \n     the men of A Company, 116th Regiment.\n       To me, the final meaning--and perhaps the most important \n     meaning--of D-Day comes from the memory of those men who died \n     on the Normandy beaches or who sacrificed their health and \n     their futures in those desperate moments. Gathered from \n     across America, these young men knew the price of liberty was \n     high and willingly risked their lives to defend freedom. \n     Their sacrifice ensured that the term D-Day will always be \n     associated with only one day, the day the Allies landed at \n     Normandy, and will always represent a noble cause, a \n     courageous effort, and a gallant commitment to the highest \n     ideals of this nation.\n       Today, this memorial to D-Day commemorates the achievements \n     of June 6, 1944, but it also reminds us of the challenges of \n     defending liberty and the costs of remaining free. Let us \n     remember the importance of the landings on the coast of \n     France but let us never forget the young men who made that \n     operation a success, who charged forward despite fearful \n     losses. As the inscription in the Normandy memorial suggests, \n     let us always remember the glory of their spirit.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Remarks by Governor George Allen at the National D-Day Memorial \nGroundbreaking in Future Memorial Site, Bedford, Virginia, November 11, \n                                  1997\n\n       This certainly is an invigorating morning! It is good to \n     see United States Senators John Warner and Chuck Robb; \n     Representatives Bob Goodlatte and Virgil Goode; Members of \n     the General Assembly; Chairperson Lucille Boggess; Mayor \n     Michael Shelton; Josh Honan, President of the D-Day \n     Association of Ireland; John Slaughter, Chairman, and Members \n     of the National D-Day Memorial Foundation; Colonel Robert \n     Doughty; Colonel Smith; honored guests all; and most \n     especially veterans and their families. On behalf of the \n     people of Virginia, welcome!\n       Your presence honors our Commonwealth. We are grateful to \n     have you here to help break ground for the National D-Day \n     Memorial in Bedford County, Virginia.\n       This is an historically significant, commemorative occasion \n     for all Americans, indeed, for all freedom-loving people on \n     earth and in the heavens.\n       Veteran's Day is a time for respectful reflection as we \n     honor and remember all those brave men and women of the \n     United States Armed Forces who have served us to secure and \n     protect our nation's interests, including our God-given \n     rights and freedoms, as well as those rights and freedoms for \n     our fellow human beings everywhere.\n       From the cold, snow-covered fields at Valley Forge to the \n     hot, desert storms of the Persian Gulf and Kuwait, and even \n     today in Bosnia, Virginians and Americans have served nobly, \n     and with great distinction, whenever and wherever Duty's \n     clarion call has sounded.\n       We salute all of our veterans and their families who have \n     stood against tyranny in\n\n[[Page S12662]]\n\n     defense of liberty in times of war and peace. And on this \n     Veteran's Day, we honor those especially courageous patriots \n     who--on that gray, windy and fateful morning on the coast of \n     Normandy--valiantly began the eradication from Europe of the \n     hateful plague of Nazism, fascism and totalitarian \n     dictatorship.\n       It is highly appropriate that this National D-Day Memorial \n     should find its home here in Bedford, Virginia.\n       As vividly described by Colonel Doughty, United States and \n     Allied soldiers stormed Omaha Beach at dawn June 6, 1944. And \n     brave men from Bedford County spearheaded the first wave in \n     one of the greatest military feats in the annals of world \n     history.\n       Virginia remembers with pride the noble legacy of the 29th \n     Division, especially the citizen-soldiers of the imperishable \n     ``Stonewall Brigade'' who waded, scrambled, fought and \n     overcame entrenched forces on high, formidable bluffs.\n       While Time has washed away the blood of our fallen heroes \n     from the beaches and cliffs of Normandy, Time has not washed \n     away, and must not dim, our memories of those horrific and \n     heroic events--how they fought; how they died; and how they \n     won freedom for the people of Europe and the world.\n       Whether by hard-fought victory or through steadfast \n     vigilance, each generation passes on to the next lessons: \n     lessons in the sometimes high price of freedom.\n       This Memorial will be a thoughtful, magnificent tribute to \n     the Americans and Allies who began the liberation of the \n     European continent during that ``Longest Day.''\n       Right here in Bedford, Virginia, people from around the \n     world can--and will--come to visit, learn and pay their \n     respects to heroes of unselfish character and undaunted \n     courage.\n       This Memorial will add meaning to the strong, silent \n     testimony of those men who lost their own future in making \n     secure for others the responsibilities and opportunities that \n     come from freedom.\n       By breaking ground for this National D-Day Memorial, each \n     of us is helping to ensure that the eternal flame of freedom \n     will never be extinguished by force from without or by \n     neglect from within.\n       Through the hard work of so many, we are bequeathing to our \n     children a greater appreciation and respect for the many \n     blessings of liberty, and a better understanding of their \n     responsibility to nurture and protect it.\n       In closing, I pray God will continue to bless Virginia and \n     the United States with people of such honor and character as \n     those we remember this Veteran's Day, so that our United \n     States will always be a beacon of hope, opportunity and \n     freedom.\n       Veterans: we gratefully salute you in our minds and in our \n     hearts!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12660-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FRANCISCAN FRIARS AND SISTERS OF THE ATONEMENT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, December 15, 1997 will mark the \n100th anniversary of the Order of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of \nthe Atonement. The Order was founded by Father Lewis T. Watson and \nMother Lurana White in Garrison, New York with the goal of promoting \nChristian unity. The Friars and Sisters continue their mission work \nthrough the promotion of the Week of Christian Unity and the operation \nof ecumenical centers and libraries.\n  Through the years, the Friars and Sisters of the Atonement have \nremained in Garrison where they now operate the Graymoor Ecumenical and \nReligious Institute. At Graymoor they publish a monthly magazine, \nEcumenical Trends, and operate St. Christopher's Inn, a temporary \nshelter for homeless men, whom they refer to as ``Brothers \nChristopher'' or Christ Bearers.\n  The influence and the good work of the Friars and Sisters extends \nwell beyond the Hudson Highlands region of New York, reaching \nthroughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. They operate day \ncare centers, Retreat Houses, Head Start programs, and shelters for \nbattered wives and children. They minister to the poor, feed the \nhungry, and embrace the marginalized worldwide. Not only do they seek \nunity of the Christian community, but also unity of the human spirit \nand unity of the human community.\n  True to their cause of Christian unity, they have dedicated their \nlives to the hope ``that all may be one. . .that the world may \nbelieve.'' I commend their single-heartedness and congratulate them on \nthe occasion of their 100th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12662-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CHILD EXPLOITATION SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my \ndisappointment that in the final hours of this legislative session, a \npiece of legislation sponsored by my colleague, Senator DeWine and I, \nS. 900 has apparently been stopped from passing the Senate because of \nan objection from the other side of the aisle.\n  S. 900 is a bi-partisan effort to address the growing problem of \ncriminals using the Internet to contact and target young children that \nthey ultimately sexually abuse and exploit. This bill requires the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission to create a sentencing enhancement \nfor criminals who use the Internet to facilitate sexual crimes against \nyoung people. The legislation also increases penalties for repeat \nsexual offenders.\n  S. 900 has, on two occasions, received the unanimous support of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. It has passed the Committee as a free-\nstanding measure and was adopted as an amendment to juvenile justice \nlegislation considered by the Committee earlier this year. Yet, we are \nnow told that the bill has been held. I find it troubling that someone \nwould object to legislation designed to help protect young children \nfrom being sexual abused and molested and that such objection would be \nmade, without providing Senator DeWine or myself an opportunity to \naddress whatever concerns might exist.\n  Mr. President, the misuse of the Internet is a growing problem. FBI \nDirector Freeh has testified to this fact and the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children--which supports the DeWine/Feingold \nlegislation--agrees that the situation is a growing concern. S. 900 is \na straightforward, bipartisan effort to send the message that \npedophiles and child molesters will not be allowed to exploit the \nInternet to commit their illicit crimes against children. While I \nregret that someone has chosen to slow this effort to protect children, \nI fully intend to return to this issue next year and will continue to \npush for the adoption of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12662-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2267\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes at this \ntime to especially thank my staff, headed by Jim Morhard, and so many \nother members of the staff on both the Democratic and Republican side, \nwho have spent literally hours, including all the hours of last night \nand many other evenings, but the entire night, getting this bill into a \nposition where it could be passed. It is, as it appears to be, the last \nappropriations bill to be passed by the Senate and the House and, as \nsuch, it has had more than its fair share of issues attached to it. But \nas a result of the diligent and extraordinary work of the staff, both \nthe Democratic and Republican staff, it is now, I believe, close to \nsuccessful conclusion, and I anticipate that the House will soon be \npassing it, and it will be, as we have just agreed to here in the \nSenate, deemed passed.\n  The bill itself is a very strong piece of legislation. It makes an \nextraordinarily aggressive commitment to supporting and expanding our \nefforts in the area of law enforcement, in the area of trying to stop \nthe drugs that are flowing into this country, in protecting our borders \nand expanding our efforts to make sure that people who are convicted, \nespecially of violent crimes, are incarcerated and kept in prison.\n  It has a very strong commitment also to prevention activities in the \narea of our justice system. Special emphasis has been put on the \nviolence-against-women initiatives, which are funded at $270.7 million \nin this bill, an increase of almost 55 percent in this category since I \nbecame chairman in 1995.\n\n[[Page S12663]]\n\n  Also, we have put a special emphasis on attempting to address the \nproblems of the Internet relative to child pornography and, \nunfortunately, the fact that many pedophiles--people who wish to harm \nour children--are using the Internet for purposes of stalking children. \nWe have continued, supported, and expanded the FBI's initiatives in \nthings like ``Innocent Images'' which is a sting program to try to \ncatch pedophiles and child pornographers. We expanded it so that local \nand State law enforcement communities will have experience in this area \nand can take advantage of the protocols set up by the FBI.\n  Further, we recognize that juvenile crime is one of the greatest \nproblems in the country today, and we have attempted to address that \nthrough the expansion of the juvenile justice programs, especially the \npreventive programs. I see Senator Coats here on the floor, who has \nbeen a force of immense energy in the area of trying to address \njuvenile prevention programs, such as Big Sister/Big Brother, and Boys \nand Girls Clubs, which is funded under this program. We have also \ncreated a new block grant, the purpose of which will be to help local \ncommunities in the area of juvenile justice. This block grant is \naggressively funded with $250 million.\n  There is, in addition, a comprehensive effort--it is a continuing \neffort--to address terrorism activities and to pursue an aggressive \npolicy of counterterrorism. We all recognize, especially with the \nevents of the last few days that have occurred in Pakistan, that \nAmericans are at risk overseas. They are also, regrettably, at risk in \nour own country. We have seen two trials just recently completed, one \ninvolving the New York Trade Center, the other involving a shooting \noutside the CIA. Counterterrorism requires that we have a coordinated \neffort and that we have a strong law enforcement element in that \ncoordinated effort, and this bill pursues both those activities.\n\n  Senators who represent States along our border, our southern border \nespecially, have found very serious problems in the area of drug \nenforcement and in the area of illegal immigrants coming across the \nborder, so we are dramatically expanding the number of INS border \npatrols in this bill, increasing them by 1,000; including $250 million \nin new initiatives to try to restore the integrity of the \nnaturalization process, which unfortunately has fallen on hard times, \nto say the least. That may not be the best description of it, in fact, \nbecause the system has so collapsed. This bill puts the dollars \nnecessary to give adequate support to the INS, and also it dramatically \nexpands the Border Patrol efforts so that States like, especially, \nTexas and Arizona, which need additional border patrols, will be able \nto obtain them.\n  It significantly expands our efforts in the area of NOAA activities. \nThis is one of our premier national treasures in the area of research \nand technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It \nis an organization which has cutting-edge knowledge in a variety of \nareas, but especially in the prediction of our weather. We aggressively \npursue the expansion of our efforts in weather research and information \nareas.\n  We give our judges a cost-of-living increase, something they deserve. \nThis bill covers a lot of different jurisdictions, as is known by most \nof the Senators. One that doesn't get too much attention is the fact \nthat it covers the judicial branch of our Government. We are going to \ntry to help the Supreme Court out and renovate the Supreme Court \nbuilding, but at the same time we are going to give our judges a \nreasonable cost-of-living adjustment.\n  In the area of the State Department, we concentrate aggressively in \ntrying to get their physical house in order. It is really a national \ndisgrace, the type of equipment that some of our overseas personnel are \nasked to use. We still have dial phones in some embassies that we fund \naround the world. Many of our facilities are simply decrepit and \nrundown. We have made a major commitment to rehabilitate our facilities \nand to expand the communication and technology attributes of the State \nDepartment.\n  In addition, we are making a major commitment to the personnel of the \nState Department. I believe they and their families deserve our \nsupport, especially in the area of giving them adequate security. We \naggressively pursued that.\n  Other agencies, the Small Business Administration, FCC, FTC, all of \nwhich are covered by this bill, are also aggressively addressed. We do \nall this in the context of a bill that, although it spends a \nconsiderable amount of money, over $31 billion, spends less than what \nthe President requested and is clearly within the budget, which is a \nbalanced budget, I would note, as a result of the budget passed by this \nCongress.\n  So, again, I thank the staff for their extraordinary work in this \narea. I appreciate especially the assistance of the leader in allowing \nus to get this bill finally resolved. Without his intervention at a \nnumber of critical stages, it would not have been pulled together. I \nvery much thank him for his assistance in this effort.\n  I also especially want to thank my ranking member, Senator Hollings, \nwho is really a great fellow to work with. He has a tremendous \ninstitutional history of how this committee works, and where the \nfunding comes from, and what has happened in the past. His counsel has \nalways been extraordinarily useful to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I extend my congratulations to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for his work on this very important appropriations \nbill. I should note it is the 13th and final appropriations conference \nreport, the last one across the line, but a big one and an important \none--Commerce, State, and Justice and related agencies. It also became \na vehicle for a number of Senators to attempt to address problems, as \nit was the last conference report to go through the Congress. It was \nquite a struggle, but an important one. I commend the Senator from New \nHampshire for his good work. I should also note the cooperation he \nreceived from the ranking member, the Senator from South Carolina. I \nthank the Senator for his work. I am glad we had our colleagues from \nthe other side of the Capitol also work with us on this effort, which \nwas a very interesting experience.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I come to floor today to discuss the new \njuvenile justice grant program contained in the appropriations bill for \nthe Commerce, Justice, and State Departments. Of course, I would have \npreferred the appropriators to defer to the Judiciary Committee, which \nconsidered juvenile crime legislation for over a month and reported a \nbill to the Senate floor, so we could have a full debate and develop \neffective, comprehensive juvenile crime legislation.\n  That said, I am pleased that the conference report addresses one of \nmy primary concerns by relaxing the mandates contained in earlier \nproposals that would have required States to try more juveniles as \nadults to qualify for federal funding.\n  Recall that the juvenile crime bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last spring would have disqualified States from \nreceiving federal funds unless prosecutors had complete discretion to \ntry certain 15-year-olds as adults. Similarly, as originally \nintroduced, the Senate Republican's youth crime bill --S. 10--would \nhave required States to give prosecutors unfettered discretion to try \n14-year-olds as adults, even for minor crimes, to qualify for funding. \nS. 10 as passed by the Committee loosened this restriction \nsubstantially, by enabling States to qualify for funding so long as 14-\nyear-olds were eligible to be tried as adults for serious violent \ncrimes, which they already are in almost every State.\n  Similarly, the new program contained in the appropriations bill \npassed by Congress today does not require States to change their laws \non trying juveniles as adults. All a State must do to participate in \nthe new program is to certify that it is ``actively considering'' such \nchanges in policy. So, a State can say, ``we're going to think about \nit,'' introduce legislation but not enact it, or even reject \nlegislative changes and still qualify for the new federal youth crime \nfighting funds.\n  I support this relaxation from the earlier proposals because trying \nmore juveniles as adults is likely to be counterproductive. The \nresearch shows that juveniles tried in the adult system are\n\n[[Page S12664]]\n\nmore likely to be released on bail, less likely to be convicted, \npunished more slowly, and incarcerated less frequently than in the \njuvenile justice system. If we want to get tough on juvenile crime, \ntrying kids as adults is the wrong answer.\n  What is more, placing juveniles in adult jails--where they have \nexposure to hardened criminals--will only make them more likely to \ncommit crimes once they get out. So despite popular opinion, trying \nmore kids as adults may make our crime problem worse, not better.\n  Instead of imposing unproven, Washington-based solutions on the \nStates, the best thing the federal government can do is provide local \nlaw enforcement, prosecutors, juvenile courts, and community based \norganizations additional funds to develop creative, comprehensive \nstrategies to address juvenile crime. Such strategies are beginning to \nbear fruit across the country as juvenile crime has fallen \nsignificantly in the past two years.\n  The new juvenile crime block grant takes a partial step in the right \ndirection by providing $250 million for juvenile justice system \nimprovements. But this new program is deeply flawed by failing to \npermit State and localities to use any of these funds for juvenile \ncrime prevention programs. Police chiefs and prosecutors around the \ncountry are emphatic that to be effective in combating juvenile crime, \nwe have to combine tough enforcement with effective prevention \nprograms. The new block grant sends the wrong message to our States and \nlocalities by requiring that all the funds be spent on enforcement and \njuvenile justice system improvements.\n  I am also concerned that the new program will not result in \nsufficient funding for juvenile prosecutors. Past experience has shown \nthat block grants that flow through local governments do not result in \nvery much funding for prosecutors offices. In the Senate youth crime \nbill, we have established a grant program--albeit an underfunded one--\nthat would provide federal funding directly to prosecutors specifically \nfor juvenile crime fighting efforts. I will work to fix these and other \nflaws in the new program when we consider youth violence legislation \nnext year.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know that \ntucked in the hundreds of pages of provisions on appropriating federal \nfunds on existing programs in this conference report is legislative \nlanguage to create a new $250 million grant program, called the \n``Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant.'' This newly \nauthorized program is based on the block grant program in H.R. 3, the \n``Juvenile Crime Control Act of 1997,'' although that bill have not \npassed or even been considered by the Senate.\n  This new program sounds great until you look at the proverbial fine \nprint. Because of all the new requirements on the States this is just a \ntease--many States won't qualify for a penny of this money under H.R. 3 \nas passed by the House of Representatives on May 8, 1997.\n  For instance, H.R. 3 mandates that a state must set up a new system \nof record keeping relating to juveniles that is equivalent to the \nrecord keeping system for adults for similar conduct under state and \nFederal law to be eligible for this block grant. Many states would be \nforced to make considerable changes to their laws to comply with this \nmandate. And the cost of complying with this mandate, which would \nrequire capturing records for minor juvenile offenses too, is totally \nunknown.\n  My home state of Vermont, for example, would not qualify for the \nblock grant in H.R. 3, even though my State has some of the toughest \njuvenile crime laws in the country, and has the lowest juvenile violent \ncrime rates in the country. Massachusetts will not qualify either, even \nthough that State has made enormous progress in reducing its violent \ncrime problem. Our two States must be doing something right.\n  I ask why we are being forced to take up the ill-considered H.R. 3 \nblock grant on an appropriations bill. The answer is because the \nRepublican leadership says so. Otherwise, they might miss out on \nclaiming credit in connection with fighting juvenile crime before \nCongress adjourns. I guess in their minds nothing happens that does not \ninvolve their political agenda. Fighting juvenile crime should not be \nabout politics. Unfortunately, this heavy-handed effort is purely \npartisan. For a group that preaches states' rights, the Republican \nLeadership has no trouble trampling the hard work and insight of 50 \nstate legislatures who have enacted juvenile crime legislation. H.R. 3 \nis a presumptuous attempt to have the heavy hand of the federal \ngovernment dictate state criminal justice policy. This is the wrong way \nto craft serious legislation.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee spent eight mark-ups over two months \nearlier this year in crafting its juvenile crime bill, the ``Violent \nand Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1997,'' S. 10. Why did Chairman \nHatch and the other members of the Judiciary Committee work so hard to \ntry to craft a bill if the Republican leadership is just going to slip \nparts of the House bill into a spending bill at the last minute before \nCongress adjourns for the year? Every Member of the Judiciary Committee \nworked many hours to revise S. 10 before it was reported by the \nCommittee to the full Senate. This bill still has major problems, but \nis much improved because of that deliberative legislative process and \nmuch better than its House companion, H.R. 3. I am hopeful that S. 10 \ncan be further improved on the Senate floor.\n  This juvenile block grant approach is flawed and would benefit from \nattention through the normal legislative process of hearing, public \ncomment, review, Committee consideration, amendment and report, Senate \naction and House-Senate conference. Instead, the Republican leadership \nis trying to force this flawed block grant through the Senate.\n  Fortunately, we in the Senate have been able to modify the flawed \nblock grant program in H.R. 3 to make it tolerable before it was \nincluded in this appropriations bill. I want to thank the Ranking \nMember of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \nState and the Judiciary, Senator Hollings, and the Subcommittee's \nChairman, Senator Gregg, for working with me, Senator Biden, and other \nMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Our modifications make it clear that every state is eligible for the \njuvenile crime block grant program in this conference report. To \nqualify for the block grant program in this conference report, the \nGovernor of a State may certify to the Attorney General that the State \nwill consider legislation, policies and practices which if enacted \nwould qualify the State for a grant under H.R. 3. Governor Dean of my \nhome State has indicated to me that he is willing to make such a \ncertification for Vermont to be eligible for this block grant. We have \nalso limited this program to the 1998 Fiscal Year and made it subject \nto future authorization legislation.\n  Mr. President, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and in both houses of Congress to enact carefully \nconsidered legislation to reduce and prevent juvenile crime. But this \nhastily conceived block grant approach as part of this appropriations \nbill is the wrong way to achieve those goals.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join our Subcommittee \nChairman, Senator Gregg, in presenting this Fiscal Year 1998 Commerce, \nJustice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations \nConference Agreement to the Senate. This is a good agreement that has \nbeen worked out in a bipartisan fashion. It has taken us over six weeks \nof negotiations with the House to reach consensus. I should note that \nthe Senate passed our version of the bill back on July 29 by a vote of \n99 to 0.\n  In the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill we fund \nprograms ranging from the FBI to our State Department embassies \noverseas, to fisheries research and the National Weather Service, to \nthe Supreme Court and the Federal Communications Commission. It \nrequires a balancing act of the priorities of the Nation, of the \nsometimes shared and, as we have seen in this conference, more often \ncompeting interests of our colleagues here in the Congress, and the \npriorities of the Administration--all within the confines of our 302(b) \nallocation. I think Chairman Gregg and his able staff--Jim Morhard, \nKevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Dana Quam, Carl Truscott and Vasiliki\n\n[[Page S12665]]\n\nAlexopoulos--have done an outstanding job in balancing these interests \nin their work with our counterparts on the House Appropriations \nCommittee. In the face of a very involved House Republican leadership \nand an administration that tried to give away the store in an effort to \nbuy fast-track votes, we have held our own--and I fully support the \nagreement that we are considering today.\n  In total, this bill provides $31.777 billion in budget authority, \n$158 million more than the Senate-passed bill. We have $1.881 billion \nmore than was appropriated last year, and the bill is $275 million \nbelow the President's request.\n  Once again, the CJS appropriations bill makes it clear that Congress \nis intent on funding Justice and law enforcement as a top priority. \nThis bill provides appropriations totaling $17.5 billion for Justice--\nan increase of $1 billion above last year for the Justice Department. \nIncluding fees we provide the Department through appropriations action, \nthe total Justice Department budget is $19.5 billion.\n  Within the Justice Department, the FBI is provided $2.9 billion. \nIncluded in this is a large increase of $143 million for the FBI to \nenhance its counterterrorism activities. This amount includes $54 \nmillion to acquire counterterrorism readiness capabilities for \nresponding to and managing incidents involving improvised explosive \ndevices, chemical and biological agents, and cyber attacks. Also, $10 \nmillion is provided to stop child exploitation on the Internet, a new \nissue affecting our youth that this Committee held a special hearing on \nearlier this year. We have provided enhanced funding to reinvigorate \nour battle against organized crime and to combat the La Cosa Nostra's \nefforts to penetrate the securities industry. Finally, we have provided \n$44.5 million which will complete the new FBI laboratory at Quantico, \nVirginia.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration is funded at $1.1 billion. \nIncluded in this amount is $34 million for 60 new agents, $30 million \nfor counter-drug efforts along the Southwest border, $11 million \ntargeted for methamphetamine production and trafficking, and $10 \nmillion and 120 positions for efforts to reduce heroin trafficking--all \npriorities of the Senate.\n\n  Also in Justice, the bill enhances INS border control by recommending \n1,000 new Border Patrol agents, restoring the integrity of the \nnaturalization process, and expanding revocation, incarcerations, and \ndeportation activities. The INS is funded at $3.8 billion. A program \nthat most members have been hearing about from their constituents is \nthe extension of 245(i). The conferees have adopted a \n``grandfathering'' clause that would allow 245(i) processing for anyone \nwho has filed with the Attorney General or for labor certification with \nthe Department of Labor by January 14, 1998.\n  The CJS bill also provides funds to accelerate and expand efforts by \nU.S. Attorneys to collect the estimated $34 billion in unpaid child \nsupport. I'm especially pleased to note that an increase of $8.3 \nmillion is provided to activate the new National Advocacy Center in my \nhome state. This center will provide training in litigation and \nadvocacy to our Assistant U.S. Attorneys and State and Local \nProsecutors. It will be to the U.S. Attorneys what Quanitco is to the \nFBI and DEA. Finally, we have included $1 million for our U.S. Attorney \nRene Josey to continue his outstanding violent crime task force efforts \nwith our state and local law enforcement personnel.\n  The conference agreement provides $1.4 billion for the Community \nPolicy program and continues our commitment to put 100,000 cops on the \nbeat. I'm especially pleased to note that we have included $100 million \nfor an innovative program that addresses COPS retention issues in \nsmaller communities with populations below 50,000. In these small rural \ncommunities the COPS program has been especially effective. I've seen \nit first hand in communities across South Carolina, and I'm pleased \nthat the House and Senate conferees were willing to support my \ninitiative.\n  Additional programs to note with Justice include: $25 million for the \nRegional Information Sharing System [RISS]; $505 million for the Edward \nByrne Memorial Formula Grant Program and $523 for the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant Program; $30 million for Drug Courts; $238.6 \nmillion for juvenile justice prevention programs including $25 million \nto combat underage drinking of alcoholic beverages. This last program \nwas offered as an amendment to the bill by Senator Byrd, Senator Hatch \nand myself last summer. $271 million provided for Violence Against \nWomen Programs. $556 million is provided for State Prison or ``Truth in \nSentencing'' grants and $585 million is provided for the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program.\n  Finally, let me point out that this agreement includes $250 million \nfor a new Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant. I know that \nthere is some controversy among my colleagues because we have provided \nthis funding even though the House and Senate have not collectively \ncompleted action on an authorization bill. This program provides for \nsuch programs as: building, expanding or operating juvenile detention \nand corrections facilities; hiring additional juvenile judges, \nprobation officers and court appointed defenders; drug courts; and \nhiring prosecutors. We have provided that these funds are available to \nstates and local governments that consider the reforms provided for the \nHouse-passed bill. We have also provided that no state receive less \nthan .5 percent. Everyone should be clear, that we are providing this \nas a stop-gap measure until the Senate is able to pass a juvenile \njustice bill. The bill language in this conference agreement makes it \nclear that these conditions are only for fiscal year 1998, and will \ncease upon enactment of a new Juvenile Justice authorization bill.\n\n  In funding the Commerce Department, our bill provides $4.3 billion, \nan increase of $422 million over this year's enacted amounts. There are \na number of accounts in Commerce that are worth noting.\n  The International Trade Administration has been allocated $283 \nmillion this year, and it's four program activities are funded at the \nfollowing levels: Trade Development is at $59 million; Market Access \nand Compliance has a total of $17.3 million, which is an increase from \nlast year; the Import Administration ends up at $28.7 million; and the \nU.S. and Foreign Commercial Service is given $171 million, an increase \nof almost $8 million from last year.\n  The Bureau of Export Administration is given $43.9 million this year. \nOur agreement on BXA has some components that should be of no surprise \nto those familiar with this program. We've funded BXA to continue their \ncounterterrorism activities, to address their new export control \nresponsibilities that were transferred to them from the Department of \nState, and to begin activities related to their responsibilities under \nthe Chemical weapons Convention Treaty.\n  The Economic Development Administration, a favorite of many of my \ncolleagues, is at the higher house level of $340 million, including \n$178 million for Title I Public Works program, $30 million for Title IX \nEconomic Adjustment Assistance, $9.1 million for technical assistance, \nand $9.5 million for trade adjustment assistance.\n  The bill funded the largest account in the Department of Commerce, \nNOAA, at $2 billion, slightly below the higher Senate number. This \nincludes $241 million for the National Ocean Service, $346 million for \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service, $277 million for Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Research activities, and $520 million for the National \nWeather Service. One thing NOAA isn't lacking is in the number of \nprograms it funds. To mention a few, it should be noted that we've \nprovided NOAA with $3.5 million for pfiesteria and algal bloom \nresearch, a new problem that we became all to aware of over the last \nfew months here on the East Coast. We also gave the National Ocean \nService $44 million for mapping and charting so it can meet its long-\nterm mission requirements to examine ocean activities. The popular Sea \nGrant program has been continued at $56 million, funds have been \nallocated to study that omnipresent El Nino, and continued support is \ngiven to our National Weather satellites.\n  I am especially pleased that we have included $1 million for our new \nOcean Policy Commission, the first serious look at our ocean policy and \nNOAA since the Stratton Commission in the\n\n[[Page S12666]]\n\nlate 1960's. I've talked with Dr. Baker at NOAA, Admiral Watkins, and \nDr. Ballard--and we all believe that it is time to reinvigorate our \nocean programs and put the ``O back in NOAA.'' You know, we all spend \nso much time looking to space and a little mechanical robot on Mars, \nYet 75% of our planet is ocean, and our exploration of it is woefully \nlacking.\n  The hot topic of the Commerce Department this year and the political \nissue that consumed our bill, the Census Bureau, is provided with $550 \nmillion, which is an increase of $326 million. But funding wasn't the \nissue of controversy. Rather, we had a sticky situation to work out \nregarding the fate of the 2000 Decennial Census in terms of whether \nstatistical sampling could be used for the last 10 percent of the \npopulation. The Census language that was finally agreed upon over the \nlast few days is a compromise agreement between the White House and GOP \nleadership in the House which allows the Commerce Department to move \nforward with its efforts to plan for and conduct the year 2000 \ndecennial census. The agreement seeks to ensure that the Federal Courts \nwill rule on the constitutionality of using statistical sampling prior \nto the next census by creating expedited judicial review proceedings, \nand it establishes a Census Monitoring Board that will observe and \nmonitor all aspects of the preparation of the 2000 census, including \ndress rehearsals.\n\n  Now for the remaining programs in Commerce--the Patent and Trademark \nOffice was provided with $716 million, including fees; we have been \nhearing from the Inspector General of Commerce about poor management \nover there and we are going to take a close look at PTO programs next \nfiscal year. With respect to the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST, it is funded at $677 million, slightly lower than \nenacted levels; I'm pleased that Manufacturing Extension Centers are \nfunded at $113 million and the Advanced Technology Program [ATP] is \nfunded at $193 million. I'm pleased that we seem to finally be getting \nto a sane policy on our Commerce technology programs. They are out lead \nedge in the trade war. This year the rhetoric subsided, and we started \nto get back to normalcy and ``adult supervision'' around here, as \nSenator Dole would say. No one is seriously considering unilaterally \ndisarming in the trade war and disestablishing the Department of \nCommerce and our technology programs.\n  Now to discuss the Judiciary--the total Judiciary account is funded \nat $3.463 billion, $200 million above enacted levels. We have provided \nthe Federal Judges with a cost of living adjustment. And, with respect \nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, we have agreed on a Commission \nto study judicial organization. So we have avoided a veto issue and \nwill look to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to pick qualified, \nfair experts to review the situation.\n  In the State Department and international programs title, we have \nincluded $4 billion for the Department of State and have supported the \nconsolidation of our international affairs agencies. Within this amount \nwe've provided $91 million to State and USIA to accelerate the \nreplacement of obsolete computers and communications gear, and $19.6 \nmillion to renovate projects worldwide such as our facilities in \nBeijing, China. $9.5 million is provided for architectural and \nengineering work necessary to move our Embassy to Jerusalem, the \ncapital of Israel. I can't think of any other nation where we refuse to \nrecognize its capital. It is time for us to put our Embassy in the \ncapital of Israel.\n  The bill has funded Contributions to International Organizations at \n$955 million to pay the costs assessed to the United States for \nmembership in international organizations. Within this amount, $54 \nmillion is for payment of United Nations arrerages. Additionally, \nContributions of International Peacekeeping Activities is funded at \n$256 million, including $46 million for payment of arrerages. So we \nhave met our commitments under the budget agreement. I only hope that \nChairman Helms and Senator Biden can get a State Department \nAuthorization bill through the Congress so we can make meaningful \nchanges in New York, and we can reorganize our international affairs \ninto a more rational structure.\n  I'm especially pleased that the conference adopted language that I \nproposed that requests the State Department to send a reprogramming to \nensure that the United States maintains its vote in international \norganizations. With respect to organizations like the International \nRubber Organization [INRO] we are hurting U.S. business and prestige by \nmaintaining shortfalls. We are letting other third world nations \ndominate and have put the creditworthiness of the United States in a \nposition along with the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. We need to keep \ncurrent and keep our seat at the table.\n\n  Other programs to note within this Title of the bill include $1.1 \nbillion for United States Information Administration [USIA]. Under the \nUSIA account, the National Endowment for Democracy is funded at $30 \nmillion, the East-West Center is provided with $12 million, the North-\nSouth Center is $1.5 million, International Broadcasting is $364 \nmillion, and Educational and Cultural Exchange programs are $198 \nmillion without the Senate-passed overhead certification requirements. \nAdditionally, $41.5 million is provided for Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency [ACDA].\n  Finally, in the Related Agencies Title of our bill, it should be \nnoted that the Maritime Administration was funded at $138 million, with \na level of $35.5 million for the Maritime Security Program; the Small \nBusiness Administration is funded at $705 million and for its non-\ncredit programs, the bill provides $500,000 minimum level for all Small \nBusiness Development Centers; the Federal Trade Commission is funded at \n$106.5 million; and Legal Services Corporation is at $283 million, \nincluding Senator Wellstone's floor amendment which ensure that income \neligibility determinations in cases of domestic violence are made only \non the basis of the assets and income of the individual.\n  Finally, on a separate but related note, I would like to take a \nmoment to address a matter of importance regarding the Federal \nCommunications Commission, which is provided for this Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill. On July 1, the interstate access \nfees paid by long distance companies to connect their customers to the \nlocal telephone companies' networks were reduced by over $1.5 billion \nannually. AT and MCI responded to these reductions by announcing \nplans to pass these savings to their customers.\n  AT committed to reduce its day and evening rates by 5 and 15 \npercent, respectively, on July 15. One of the news services reported \nthat AT's residential customers would save $600 million and business \ncustomers would save $300 million annually. Similarly, MCI announced it \nwill pass along these savings to customers as well.\n  In the past, AT was regulated as a dominant carrier and regularly \nfiled its tariffs with the Federal Communications Commission thereby \nproviding the necessary verification of these types of savings for \nconsumers. With AT now being a non-dominant carrier, it no longer has \nto file data with the Commission to justify its rates. There is some \nconcern that the tariffs that AT and MCI have filed with the \nCommission do not contain a sufficient analysis to demonstrate the \namount of the long distance price reductions have been passed on to \nconsumers. At a minimum, the Commission should verify that amount of \naccess charge reductions pledged by these carriers are passed on to \nconsumers.\n  The Commission should take whatever steps it deems necessary to \nensure that these carriers furnish sufficient data to verify that \nconsumers have indeed benefited from access charge reductions. The \nCommission should also monitor long distance rates to insure that the \nbenefits of these reductions are not reversed by subsequent increases.\n  Ensuring that the long distance carriers make good on their \ncommitment to flow through access charge reductions to consumers in the \nform of lower long distance rates is an important issue that should not \nbe overlooked by the Commission.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill and I support it. We have had to \nmake some tough decisions, but under the able leadership of Chairman \nGregg and his able staff, I think we have made the right decisions. \nSenator Gregg has really taken hold of this bill this year. And, of \ncourse, I want to thank my\n\n[[Page S12667]]\n\ngood friends in the other body, Chairman Hal Rogers and Mr. Alan \nMollohan of West Virginia. They are true professionals. They have \noutstanding staff, first rate professional staff in Jim Kulikowski, \nTherese McAuliffe, Jennifer Miller, Mike Ringler, Jane Wiseman, Pat \nSchleuter, Mark Murray, David Reich, Sally Gaines and Liz White.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the FY 1998 Commerce, Justice, \nState, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the work of \nStraight and Narrow, a non-profit organization headquartered in \nPaterson, New Jersey, which has been a pioneer in the field of \nsubstance abuse treatment with impressive results.\n  Straight and Narrow serves more than 750 people a day, almost all of \nthem poor. Its services cover the whole spectrum of the substance abuse \nfield, from effective prevention services for young people to treatment \nof the chemically dependent. Straight and Narrow's programs have been \nproven to deliver effective treatment at a significantly lower cost per \npatient than most treatment programs. National studies of Straight and \nNarrow's work have concluded that its results have far exceeded those \nof other approaches to substance abuse treatment.\n  Straight and Narrow is currently working in conjunction with the New \nJersey Department of Corrections and the National Development and \nResearch Institutes [NDRI] on a research and demonstration proposal to \ndevelop a national model of Straight and Narrow's approach to substance \nabuse treatment. This proposal includes clinical trials of the use of \npatient work combined with psychological counseling, family therapy, \neducation, job training, and after care for treatment of substance \nabusers from disadvantaged backgrounds, including non violent \nprisoners.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of Straight and Narrow's accomplishments in \nNew Jersey, and I believe that it would be most advantageous for the \nFederal Government to assist in the development of a model for the \nimplementation of Straight and Narrow's programs on the national level. \nI believe that Straight and Narrow's proposal is one that the \nDepartment of Justice should seriously consider supporting, and I hope \nthe Department will give this proposal serious consideration.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I proceed to some closing bills and \nExecutive Calendar, I would like to consult with the Democratic leader. \nSo I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12662-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12667-S12668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEADBEAT PARENTS PUNISHMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 271, S. 1371.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1371) to establish felony violations for the \n     failure to pay legal child support obligations, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, let me take a moment to explain the Deadbeat \nParents Punishment Act of 1997, which I introduced with Senator DeWine \nand which I drafted with the help of the administration. This measure \ntoughens the criminal penalties we created in the Child Support \nRecovery Act of 1992 and creates new gradations of offenders to target \nand punish the most egregious child support evaders. It ensures that \nmore serious crimes receive the more serious punishments they clearly \ndeserve. And, Mr. President, this measure sends a clear message to \ndeadbeat dads and moms: ignore the law, ignore your responsibilities, \nand you will pay a high price. In other words, pay up or go to jail.\n  When Senator Shelby and I introduced the original Child Support \nRecovery Act, we knew that Federal prosecutors had a role to play to \nkeep these parents from shirking their legal, and I would argue moral, \nresponsibilities. It has been estimated that if delinquent parents \nfully paid up their child support, approximately 800,000 women and \nchildren could be taken off the welfare rolls. In fact, Mr. President, \nsince that legislation was signed into law in 1992, over 386 cases have \nbeen filed, resulting in at least 165 convictions to date. And not only \nhas that law brought about punishment, but it has also brought about \npayment. Collections have increased by nearly 50 percent, from $8 \nbillion to $11.8 billion, and a new national database has helped \nidentify 60,000 delinquent fathers--over half of whom owed money to \nwomen on welfare. Although we should be proud of that increase, we can \nnot merely rest on our laurels. More can be done--and today the \nSenate's passage of the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act is a step in \nthe right direction.\n  Mr. President, as you know, current law already makes it a Federal \noffense to willfully fail to pay child support obligations to a child \nin another State if the obligation has remained unpaid for longer than \na year or is greater than $5,000. However, the current law, by \nproviding for a maximum punishment of just 6 months in prison for a \nfirst offense, makes violations only a misdemeanor. A first offense--no \nmatter how egregious--is not a felony under current law.\n  Police officers and prosecutors have used the current law \neffectively, but they have found that current misdemeanor penalties do \nnot have the teeth to adequately deal with more serious cases--those \ncases in which parents move from State to State, or internationally, to \nintentionally evade child support penalties. Those are serious cases \nthat deserve serious felony punishment and, under this new measure, \nthat serious punishment will be available.\n  Mr. President, I believe that making the Deadbeat Parents Punishment \nAct law will make a difference in the lives of families across the \ncountry. I thank my friend from Ohio, and this bill's original \ncosponsor, Senator DeWine for his efforts on behalf of children and \nfamilies, and I commend my colleagues in the Senate for passing this \nimportant message. I look forward to this measure quickly passing the \nHouse and being signed into law by the President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSection-by-Section Analysis of S. 1371, The Deadbeat Parents Punishment \n                              Act of 1997\n\n       The ``Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1997'' amends the \n     current criminal statute regarding the failure to pay legal \n     child support obligations, 18 U.S.C. 228, to create felony \n     violations for aggravated offenses. Current law makes it a \n     federal offense to willfully fail to pay a child support \n     obligation with respect to a child who lives in another state \n     if the obligation has remained unpaid for longer than a year \n     or is greater than $5,000. A first offense is subject to a \n     maximum of six months of imprisonment, and a second or \n     subsequent offense to a maximum of two years.\n       The bill addresses the law enforcement and prosecutorial \n     concern that the current statute does not adequately address \n     more serious instances of nonpayment of support obligations. \n     For such offenses a maximum term of imprisonment of just six \n     months does not meet the sentencing goals of punishment and \n     deterrence. Aggravated offenses, such as those involving \n     parents who move from state to state to evade child support \n     payments, require more severe penalties.\n       Section 2 of the bill creates two new categories of felony \n     offenses, subject to a two-year maximum prison term. These \n     are: (1) traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with the \n     intent to evade a support obligation if the obligation has \n     remained unpaid for a period longer than one year or is \n     greater than $5,000; and (2) willfully failing to pay a \n     support obligation regarding a child residing in another \n     state if the obligation has remained unpaid for a period \n     longer than two years or is greater than $10,000. These \n     offenses, proposed 18 U.S.C. 228(a) (2) and (3), indicate a \n     level of culpability greater than that reflected by the \n     current six-month maximum prison term for a first offense. \n     The level of culpability demonstrated by offenders who commit \n     the offenses described in these provisions is akin to that \n     demonstrated by repeat offenders under current law, who are \n     subject to a maximum two-year prison term.\n       Proposed section 228(b) of title 18, United States Code, \n     states that the existence of a support obligation in effect \n     for the time period charged in the indictment or information \n     creates a rebuttable presumption that the obligor has the \n     ability to pay the support\n\n[[Page S12668]]\n\n     obligation for that period. Although ``ability to pay'' is \n     not an element of the offense, a demonstration of the \n     obligor's ability to pay contributes to a showing of willful \n     failure to pay the known obligation. The presumption in favor \n     of ability to pay is needed because proof that the obligor is \n     earning or acquiring income or assets is difficult. Child \n     support offenders are notorious for hiding assets and failing \n     to document earnings. A presumption of ability to pay, based \n     on the existence of a support obligation determined under \n     state law, is useful in the jury's determination of whether \n     the nonpayment was willful. An offender who lacks the ability \n     to pay a support obligation due to legitimate, changed \n     circumstances occurring after the issuance of a support order \n     has state civil means available to reduce the support \n     obligation and thereby avoid violation of the federal \n     criminal statue in the first instance. In addition, \n     the presumption of ability to pay set forth in the bill is \n     rebuttable, a defendant can put forth evidence of his or \n     her inability to pay.\n       The reference to mandatory restitution in proposed section \n     228(d) of title 18, United States Code, amends the current \n     restitution requirement in section 228(c). The amendment \n     conforms the restitution citation to the new mandatory \n     restitution provision of federal law, 18 U.S.C. 3663A, \n     enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \n     Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, section 204. This change \n     simply clarifies the applicability of that statute to the \n     offense of failure to pay legal child support obligations.\n       Proposed subsection (e) clarifies that prosecutions for \n     violations of this section may be brought either in the \n     district where the child resided or the obligor resided \n     during a period of nonpayment. Inclusion of this language is \n     necessary in light of a recent case, Murphy v. United States, \n     934 F.Supp. 736 (W.D. Va. 1966), which held that a \n     prosecution had been improperly brought in the Western \n     District of Virginia, where the child resided, because the \n     obligor was required, by court order, to send his child \n     support payments to the state of Texas. Proposed subsection \n     (e) is not meant to exclude other venue statutes, such as \n     section 3237 of title 18, United States Code, which applies \n     to offenses begun in one district and completed in another.\n       For all of the violations set forth in proposed subsection \n     (a) of section 228, the government must show the existence of \n     a determination regarding the support obligation, as under \n     current law. Under proposed subsection (f)(3) the government \n     must show, for example, that the support obligation is an \n     amount determined under a court order or an order of an \n     administrative process pursuant to the law of a State to be \n     due from a person for the support and maintenance of a child \n     or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living. \n     Proposed subsection (f)(3), however, expands the scope of \n     covered support obligations to include amounts determined \n     under a court order or an order of an administrative process \n     pursuant to the law of an Indian tribe. Subsection (f)(1) \n     defines the term ``Indian tribe'' to mean an Indian or Alaska \n     Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community \n     that the Secretary of Interior acknowledges to exist as an \n     Indian tribe pursuant to section 102 of the Federally \n     Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a. The \n     expanded definition permits enforcement of the statute for \n     all children for whom child support was ordered by either a \n     state or tribal court or through a state or tribal \n     administrative process.\n       Proposed subsection (f)(2) of section 228 amends the \n     definition of ``state,'' currently in subsection (d)(2), to \n     clarify that prosecutions may be brought under this statute \n     in a commonwealth, such as Puerto Rico. The current \n     definition of ``state'' in section 228, which includes \n     possessions and territories of the United States, does not \n     expressly include commonwealths.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill appear at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1371) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House of Representatives on the bill (H.R. 867) to \npromote the adoption of children in foster care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives.\n\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nissue of the Record.]\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, H.R. 867, the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct of 1997, is an extremely important piece of legislation. Let me \nbegin by thanking Senators Craig, Chafee, Rockefeller, Jeffords, Coats, \nGrassley, Moynihan, Landrieu, Chairman Roth, and Senator Lott, the \nmajority leader, who has made this bill a priority. I thank all of them \nand I thank their staffs for all the hard work they have done. I also \nwant to thank our distinguished House colleagues Representatives Dave \nCamp and Barbara Kennelly, as well as Chairman Shaw, and their staffs, \nfor their hard work in moving the bill through the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n[[Page S12669]]\n\n  This is a significant bill for a number of reasons.\n  It will require reasonable efforts to be made to find adoptive homes \nfor children.\n  It requires concurrent case planning, which will reduce the amount of \ntime that a child has to wait to be adopted. It would do this by \npermitting States to develop an alternative permanency plan in case a \nchild's reunification with his family doesn't work out.\n  The bill shortens the time line for children in foster care.\n  And it reduces interstate geographic barriers to adoption.\n  But there is one element of this bill that is especially important--a \nprovision I have been working to enact for over 2 years now. This one \nprovision will save the lives of many children--and ensure that many \nothers get to live in safe, loving, and permanent adoptive homes.\n  My staff and I have been involved in the discussion, drafting, \nnegotiation, and adoption of just about every provision in this bill. \nBut I have been working for the passage of this one particular \nprovision for a very long time--and I believe it merits extended \ndiscussion in detail.\n  This provision is a clarification of the so-called reasonable efforts \nlaw, that was first passed in 1980. I introduced this provision as S. \n1974 in the 104th Congress, and again as S. 178 in the 105th Congress.\n  I have given at least nine speeches on the floor discussing the need \nfor this legislation; chaired one hearing on it; and testified at \nseveral others.\n  Anyone who is seeking to understand the need for this legislation--\nand our legislative purpose in passing this bill today--would do well \nto review my remarks in the Record on those occasions. I will detail--\nin these remarks today--both the dates of these speeches, and their \npage citations in the Record for easy reference.\n  On May 23, 1996, I held my first press conference to call for a \nchange in the reasonable efforts law.\n  On June 4, 1996, I discussed this problem here on the Senate floor. \nThat speech will be found in the Record at page S5710.\n  On June 27, 1996, I testified before our colleagues over in the House \nWays and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing on how \nP.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act is a barrier \nto adoption.\n  On July 18, 1996, I introduced S. 1974, a bill to clarify what \nCongress means by reasonable efforts. I offered the bill the very same \nday as an amendment to the Senate's welfare reform legislation, but \nwithdrew the amendment because it was not germane. Nevertheless, I \ncontinued to talk about this problem, in an effort to create momentum \nto bring this kind of legislation to the floor.\n  My remarks on that occasion will be found at page S8142 of the \nRecord.\n  On November 20, 1996, we held a hearing in the Labor and Human \nResources Subcommittee on improving the well-being of abused and \nneglected children.\n  When the new Congress reconvened in January of this year, I \nreintroduced my bill to clarify reasonable efforts, as S. 178. It was \nmy very first order of business in the new Congress.\n  On January 21, 1997, I spoke about this on the Senate floor. That can \nbe found in the Congressional Record, page S551.\n  On February 14, President Clinton endorsed my reasonable efforts \nbill.\n  On February 24, I spoke about this on the Senate floor--page S1431.\n  On March 20, Senators Chafee and Rockefeller introduced another bill \nto help us build momentum. That bill was titled S. 511, the Safe \nAdoptions and Family Environments Act.\n  On April 8, I testified again in the House Ways and Means Committee \non this topic.\n  On April 30, H.R. 867, the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997, \noverwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 416 to \n5. This bill, sponsored by Representatives Dave Camp and Barbara \nKennelly, included my language to clarify reasonable efforts. I talked \nabout that bill, on the same day that it passed in the House, on the \nfloor of the Senate. Those remarks can be found at S3841.\n  Mr. President, I addressed this issue again on the Senate floor on \nMay 1. Those remarks can be found at page S3898, and yet again, on May \n5, I spoke about the issue, and those remarks can be found at S3947.\n  On May 21, I testified on this issue at a hearing in the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  On October 1, I addressed this issue on the Senate floor again. Those \nremarks can be found at page S10262. On October 8, I testified yet \nagain in a hearing before the Finance Committee on the Promotion of \nAdoption, Safety and Support of Abused and Neglected Children Act, the \nPASS Act, as it is commonly known.\n  Finally, on October 24 of this year, I addressed this issue again on \nthe Senate floor, and those remarks can be found on page S11175.\n  The legislation that we will take up in a moment and that I hope we \npass today is the culmination of that effort. I have taken the time of \nthe Senate today to outline that history, as I stated a moment ago, \nbecause I want to make it very clear what the legislative history is \nand what the intent was behind that provision of the bill.\n  Let me turn now to the need for this provision.\n  Let me explain why this provision was the focus of so much attention \nand why we need this provision.\n  We need it, Mr. President, because of an unintended consequence of a \nbill that was passed by this Congress in 1980. The Adoption Assistance \nand Child Welfare Act of 1980 included a provision saying that for a \nState to be eligible for Federal funds for foster care spending, that \nState must have a child welfare services plan approved by the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services and that plan must be in effect.\n  The State plan must provide, and I quote now from the 1980 law, it \nmust provide ``that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) \nprior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or \neliminate the need for removal of the child from his home and (B) to \nmake it possible for the child to return to his home.''\n  Mr. President, over the last 17 years, since this law went into \neffect and since this provision became part of our Federal law, this \nlaw, tragically, has often been seriously misinterpreted by those \nresponsible for administering our foster care system.\n  Too often, reasonable efforts, as outlined in the statute, have come \nto mean unreasonable efforts. It has come to mean efforts to reunite \nfamilies which are families in name only. I am speaking now of \ndangerous, abusive adults who represent a threat to the health and \nsafety and even the lives of these children.\n  This law has been misinterpreted in such a way that no matter what \nthe particular circumstances of a household may be, it is argued that \nthe State must make reasonable efforts to keep that family together and \nto put it back together if it falls apart. I have traveled across the \nState of Ohio, talking with child service representatives, with judges, \nother social welfare professionals who have told me about this problem. \nI have held hearings with experts from other parts of the United \nStates, and we have discovered that this is a truly national problem.\n  There can be no doubt that this problem did, in fact, arise because \nof the 1980 law, and it arose because this 1980 law was and has been \nfor 17 years misinterpreted. Clearly, the Congress of the United States \nin 1980 did not intend that children should be forced back into the \ncustody of adults who are known to be dangerous and known to be \nabusive.\n  My purpose in making these comments today is to make absolutely \ncertain that this legislation that I believe we are about to pass, H.R. \n867, is not misinterpreted. My purpose today is to make sure the bill \nwe are about to pass is not misinterpreted. I intend, therefore, to \nexplain in some detail our purpose in passing this legislation.\n  Let me begin, if I can, Mr. President, by reading clause A of H.R. \n867, and this is the bill we are about to take up.\n  Clause A of this bill says:\n\n       (A) in determining reasonable efforts to be made with \n     respect to a child, as described in this section, and in \n     making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety \n     shall be the paramount concern.\n\n  Let me read it again. Clause A of H.R. 867 that we are about to take \nup says:\n       In determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect \n     to a child, as described in this section, and in making such \n     reasonable\n\n[[Page S12670]]\n\n     efforts, the child's health and safety shall be the paramount \n     concern.\n\n  The purpose of clause A, Mr. President, is to make it clear to \neveryone involved in caring for our young people, not just judges, but \nalso caseworkers, prosecutors, magistrates, court-appointed attorneys, \nand child advocates--all of them--that reasonable efforts to reunify \nfamilies must be governed by one overriding principle, and that \noverriding principle is that the health and safety of the child must \nalways, always, always come first.\n  In determining what efforts are required, in determining what efforts \nare reasonable, we must give priority to this clause.\n  Second, clause A also makes clear that there are some cases in which \nreasonable efforts do not need to be made to reunify children with \ndangerous adults. In some cases, no efforts are reasonable efforts. In \nsome cases, any efforts are unreasonable efforts.\n  All the rest of this section of this bill, which will become law, \nmust be read in the light of clause A which I just read. Clause A \ngoverns the law of reasonable efforts. Clause A defines, once and for \nall, the overriding principle, that the health and safety of the child \nmust always, always, always come first.\n  This bill that we are about to take up also includes a list of \ncertain very specific cases in which reasonable efforts are not \nrequired, very specific cases laid out in the statute. They include the \ncrimes set forth already in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment \nAct, or CAPTA. They also include aggravated circumstances that will \nhave to be defined by each individual State, and they include also \ncases in which the parental rights have been involuntarily terminated \nas to the sibling of the child in question.\n  Mr. President, let me point out now very carefully so there is no \nrisk of misinterpretation on this floor, this list that I have just \nread is not meant to be an exclusive list. The authors of this \nlegislation do not--do not--intend these specified items to constitute \nan exclusive definition of which cases do not require reasonable \nefforts to be made.\n  Rather, these are examples--these are just examples--of the kind of \nadult behavior that makes it unnecessary, that makes it unwise, makes \nit simply wrong for the Government to make continued efforts to send \nchildren back to their care. This is not meant to be an exclusive list. \nWe make this clear in the text of the bill.\n  Let me read the rule of construction from the bill H.R. 867:\n\n       (c) Rule of Construction--Nothing in this part shall be \n     construed as precluding State courts from exercising their \n     discretion to protect the health and safety of children in \n     individual cases, including cases other than those described \n     in section 471(a)(15)(D).\n\n  ``Nothing in this part shall be construed as precluding State courts \nfrom exercising their discretion to protect the health and safety of \nchildren in individual cases, including cases other than those \ndescribed in section 471(a)(15)(D).''\n  This leaves absolutely no room for doubt. Whether the case comes \nunder the previously listed examples or not, the health and safety of \nthe child must--must--come first.\n  The passage of this bill will cause a momentous change in how we look \nout for the interests of the most vulnerable children in this country. \nI thank a number of individuals who have helped us build a consensus \nfor making this change. I must say that is what had to happen before we \ncould pass this bill. We had to get a consensus, not just in the \nSenate, not just in the House, but, frankly, among caring people across \nthis country. It had to become a public issue.\n  Let me thank some of the people who helped change that and build that \nconsensus.\n  Dr. Richard Gelles, whose pathbreaking book called ``The Book of \nDavid,'' did so much to educate me and the rest of America on this \nissue. He deserves a great deal of thanks.\n  Peter Digre, Director of the department of children and family \nservices of the county of Los Angeles, was also instrumental and \ntestified about the need for our bill.\n  Mrs. Sharon Aulton, the grandmother of Christina Lambert and Natalie \nAulton, two children who lost their lives to child abuse. I think Mrs. \nAulton was very brave when she came before us to share her \nheartbreaking story. She helped us bring the point home really as no \none else could about the need for change.\n  Mary McGrory of the Washington Post, a tireless advocate for \nchildren, who wrote at least two very compelling columns about the need \nfor change in our reasonable efforts law.\n  Dave Thomas of Ohio, a man who has devoted an incredible amount of \neffort to promote adoption as a way to provide a better future for \nAmerica's endangered children.\n  All the caseworkers, the CASA volunteers, prosecutors and other \nconcerned citizens throughout Ohio and across this country who took the \ntime to help me and my staff learn about this issue and craft the \nbeginnings of a solution.\n  Mr. President, speaking of my staff, I also thank my senior counsel, \nKarla Carpenter, who has worked so tirelessly on behalf of getting this \nbill passed. She has spent literally thousands of hours, both in the \nState of Ohio and here in Washington, working on this triumph today. \nThe bill that is about to be passed today is a great credit to her fine \nwork.\n  I thank all these individuals. They all deserve the gratitude of \nanyone who cares about our children.\n  Mr. President, you will notice and Members of the Senate will notice \nI said a moment ago we have crafted the beginnings of a solution. It is \nthat, it is the beginnings. It is, I think, precisely what we have \nstarted today, the beginnings of a solution to this problem.\n  The sad truth is, some children will continue to spend too much time \nwaiting to be adopted. But without this bill, more children would have \nto wait, and they would have to wait longer. It is also true, Mr. \nPresident, that it is a tragic fact that children will continue to die \nin this country of child abuse. But without this bill, more children \nwould have died.\n  Mr. President, we should make no mistake about the challenges ahead. \nWe stand only at the very beginning of a long struggle to save \nAmerica's children. I do not think it is enough, as we do in this bill, \nto get more children adopted, although we are doing that, nor it is \nenough to make sure that fewer children are killed.\n  It is our responsibility as a Congress, as citizens, as a people to \ndo all we can to build an America, to build a country where children do \nnot die of child abuse. I see an America and I want America, Mr. \nPresident, where every child has the opportunity to live in a safe, a \nstable, a loving, and a permanent home.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I intend to return to this issue next \nyear. There is a great deal we can still do. There is a great deal we \nmust do, and there is a great deal we must do soon.\n  We need, for example, to provide better training for caseworkers who \nlook out for our children. We need to make sure that they have smaller \ncase loads. We need to do more to emphasize adoption as the solution \nand provide greater resources and more emphasis on adoption so we can \nincrease adoptions.\n  We need, Mr. President, to provide better training for the courts \nthat deal with our children. We need to make sure that the families who \nare in trouble, but who can be saved, do get help, and that they get \ngood help, and that they get it before it is too late.\n  That is quite an extensive agenda, Mr. President, for this country, \nbut I believe it is necessary, and I believe we are up to it.\n  If we want to continue to think of ourselves as a good country, we \ncannot afford to continue allowing so many of our children to be abused \nand so many to be killed, nor, Mr. President, can we allow so many of \nour children to languish in an unadoptable situation where they are \nsometimes shuttled, many times from home to home to home, without \ngetting what every child deserves, needs, and should have--and that is \na loving home and someone to love that child.\n  I think we can and we must do better. With the bill we pass today, we \nsay plainly and simply that there are cases in which reasonable efforts \nare not required to reunite innocent children with dangerous adults. \nWith the bill we pass today, we will truly save lives.\n  This historic change took a great deal of effort and consensus \nbuilding. It is a good day's work and a good start\n\n[[Page S12671]]\n\nat fixing America's No. 1 challenge--protecting and rescuing our young \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the Members of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud and pleased to be part of \nthe successful effort to pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n1997. Having worked to achieve the objectives of this bill for many \nyears, I am very grateful to everyone involved in reaching today's \nresult--the final passage of a significant bill that will help children \nand families in true need across the country for many years to come.\n  This legislation is the culmination of extensive bipartisan \nnegotiations between the House and Senate over the course of this year \nto enact the most effective ways to ensure the health, safety, and \nstability of America's most vulnerable population: abused and neglected \nchildren. The product of intense debate and sometimes difficult \nconcessions on all sides, this bill has emerged as a positive first \nstep in fixing our Nation's broken child welfare system. At the same \ntime this process has demonstrated the undeniable benefits of \nbipartisan cooperation and compromise, it has also highlighted the \nmountain of work still left to be done on behalf of abused and \nneglected children. In that regard, I hope the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act of 1997 will be a cornerstone for future efforts on behalf \nof abused and neglected children, especially those children whose \nspecial needs present formidable barriers to their safe adoptive \nplacement.\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 is most significant in its \nfocus on moving children out of foster care and into adoptive and other \npositive, permanent placements. If American child welfare policy does \nnot succeed in providing a real sense of belonging and identity to \nchildren living in the foster care system, we will be denying these \nyoung people the fundamental supports they need to become satisfied and \ncaring adults. It would be a tragedy to write these children off as a \nlost generation, just another group of children from broken homes and a \nbroken system who just didn't get enough support to make a difference.\n  In my role as chairman of the National Commission on Children, I had \nthe unique opportunity to travel across the country and speak with \nhundreds of children, parents, and caregivers about how to effectively \naddress their most basic needs and about how the Government can help to \nfoster their most fundamental aspirations. Because of that commission, \nI spent a day in LA juvenile court and saw the system at its worst, \noverwhelmed and ineffectively serving children. But I also met a \ndedicated advocate, Nancy Daly, and she introduced me to the \nIndependent Living Program and other efforts that can work to serve \nchildren. We've stayed in touch, working on these issues together ever \nsince.\n  At the heart of the recent debate about the best policy for adoption \nand child welfare, dozens of complex questions have been raised about \nhow Federal taxpayer dollars should be spent and who is worthy of \nreceiving them. As we struggle with these difficult issues, which often \npit social against fiscal responsibility, I keep returning to the same \nfundamental lesson I have learned from the families with whom I have \nspoken over the years: If we cannot build social policy that \neffectively protects our children, we have failed to do our job as a \ngovernment and a society.\n\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank my friends and \ncolleagues, John Chafee and Larry Craig for their unflagging leadership \nin bringing the legislation this far. My partnership with Senator \nChafee on children's issues is one of the most fulfilling aspects of my \nlegislative work, and I thank him for his leadership. Senator Craig \nalso provided tremendous help and fortitude in achieving the final \nconsensus and action needed to produce results. There have been a \nseries of premature reports about the collapse of negotiations. Without \ntheir efforts and the rest of our bipartisan coalition, the naysayers \nmight have triumphed over the needs of almost a half a million children \nin foster care.\n  I would also like to share my sincere appreciation with the other \nMembers of the Senate adoption working group who have worked so hard to \ncreate a solid bipartisan package: Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Coats, \nBond, Landrieu, Levin, Moynihan, Kerrey, and Dorgan. I would also like \nto acknowledge the work of Finance chairman, Senator Roth, who has made \nit possible for the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to become a \nreality.\n  I also want to pay special tribute to the First Lady, Mrs. Clinton, \nfor her longstanding and intense dedication to the goals pursued in \nthis legislation. She has told me of the public's deep concern for \nchildren who are barred from becoming part of permanent, loving \nfamilies. Her interest and encouragement have been invaluable to me and \nto others involved in this effort, and I know she will help ensure the \nadministration's commitment to turning this new law into reality.\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 will fundamentally shift \nthe focus of the foster care system by insisting that health and safety \nshould be the paramount considerations when a State makes any decision \nconcerning the well-being of an abused and neglected child. This \nlegislation is designed to move children out of foster care and into \nadoptive and other permanent homes more quickly and more safely than \never before. For the first time, this legislation requires States to \nuse reasonable efforts to move eligible foster children toward adoption \nby introducing a new fast-track provision for children who have been \nsubjected to severe abuse and other crimes by their parents. In such \nsevere cases, this bill would require that a permanency hearing be held \nwithin 30 days. In the case of an abandoned infant where reasonable \nefforts have been waived to reunite the family, that child could be \nmoved into a safe and permanent home in a month's time.\n  While this legislation appropriately preserves current Federal \nrequirements to reunify families when that is best for the child, it \ndoes not require the States to use reasonable efforts to reunify \nfamilies that have been irreparably broken by abandonment, torture, \nphysical abuse, murder, manslaughter, and sexual assault. In cases \nwhere children should not be reunited with their biological families, \nthe Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 requires that the States use \nthe same reasonable efforts to move children toward adoption or another \npermanent placement consistent with a well thought-out and well-\nmentioned permanency plan.\n\n  In addition, the act encourages adoptions by rewarding States that \nincrease adoptions with bonuses for foster care and special-needs \nchildren who are placed in adoptive homes. Most significantly, the \nlegislation takes the essential first step of ensuring ongoing health \ncoverage for all special-needs children who are adopted. Without this \nessential health coverage, many families who want to adopt children \nwith a range of physical and mental health issues, would be unable to \ndo so. I am delighted to see that medical coverage, which has always \nbeen a vital part of any program that substantively helps children, is \nalso a key component of this bipartisan package.\n  Ensuring safety for abused and neglected children is another \nsignificant goal of this legislation. The Adoption and Safe Families \nAct of 1997 seeks to accomplish this goal by ensuring that the safety \nof the child is considered at every stage of the child's case plan and \nreview process. Moreover, the bill requires criminal background checks \nfor all potential foster and adoptive parents.\n  The legislation also substantially cuts the time a child must wait to \nbe legally available for adoption into a permanent home by requiring \nStates to file a petition for termination of parental rights for a \nchild who has been waiting too long in a foster care placement. At the \nsame time that it speeds adoptions where appropriate, it also gives \nStates the discretion to choose not to initiate legal proceedings when \na child is safely placed with a relative, where there is a compelling \nreason not to go forward, or where appropriate services have not been \nprovided in accordance with the child's permanency plan.\n  At the same time that this bill imposes tough but effective measures \nto decrease a child's unnecessary wait in foster care, it reauthorizes \nand provides $60 million in increased funding\n\n[[Page S12672]]\n\nfor community-based family support and court improvements over the next \n3 years, collectively referred to as the ``Promoting Safe and Stable \nFamilies Program.'' As part of a balanced bipartisan package, these \nprograms will support a range of fundamental State services to help \nchildren and families and to provide necessary services to adoptive \nfamilies. This legislation also takes care to assure that children who \nhave gone through adoptions that have been disrupted or whose adoptive \nparents die will remain eligible for Federal support.\n  For West Virginia, and every State, this legislation means positive \nchange. Our State currently has about 3,000 children in foster care. \nUnder this new legislation, the emphasis will shift the primary focus \nto their health and safety and to finding them a stable, permanent \nhome. Throughout these debates, I have listened to West Virginia \nleaders, including Chief Justice Margaret Workman, who testified before \nthe Senate Finance Committee, and Joan Ohl, our West Virginia Secretary \nof Health and Human Resources. I have visited agencies in my State that \nprovide the full range of services from family supports to adoption, \nand I have been in touch with social workers and families. I know that \nthe provisions of this legislation will challenge my State, but I am \nequally confident that its leaders are ready to make the necessary \nchanges to do more for the thousands of children in West Virginia who \nare depending upon us.\n  I am pleased to have been a part of this tremendous effort on behalf \nof abused and neglected children, and am hopeful that the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act of 1997 will bring about real and positive \nimprovements in the lives of the half a million American children \nliving in foster care.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since the Senator from Indiana is in the \nchair, I want to compliment Senator Coats for his involvement in this \nlegislation. He had a very important role in this adoption and foster \ncare legislation. I know the bill contains key parts in which he was \ninterested. Senator Coats was very much a part of this being a \nsuccessful product.\n  Confronting the issues for children in foster care, is uncomfortable, \nalmost painful. But the foster care system is in crisis and children \nare suffering. We are compelled to confront these problems.\n  Foster care is a complicated entitlement program. While the issues \nare complex, so are the solutions. Today we are getting what we are \npaying for. It is not such a good situation, because what we are \ngetting is long-term foster care--not permanency for these kids.\n  Foster care was set up to be a temporary emergency situation for \nkids. The foster care system now is a lifestyle for so many of them. \nThe Federal Government continues to pour billions of dollars into a \nsystem that lacks genuine accountability. Instead of encouraging States \nto increase adoptions, the current system rewards long-term foster care \narrangements.\n  Jennifer Toth described in her book ``Orphans of the Living,'' that \nchildren are ``consigned to the substitute child care system, a chaotic \nprison-like system intended to raise children whose parents and \nrelatives cannot or will not care for them.'' She also wrote, ``The \nchildren in substitute child care today have all suffered trauma. They \nare all at greater risk than the general child population. Yet they are \ngiven less care, when they need more care.''\n  In Iowa, we have an organization called the Iowa Citizens Foster Care \nReview Board. They had a project of asking children in foster care and \nkids who were waiting to be adopted what they would like to tell us and \nthe rest of the world. I could give lots of quotes, but these are \nexamples from two of the children. ``Don't leave us in foster care so \nlong.'' ``Check on us frequently while we're in foster care to ask us \nhow we're doing and make sure we are safe.'' ``Tell us what's going on \nso we don't have to guess. Tell us how long it will be before we're \nadopted and why things seem to take so long.''\n  Children need to know that they have permanency, which means \nsuccessful, healthy reunification with their birth families or \npermanency in an adoptive home.\n  A happy, permanent home life provides more than just a safe haven for \nkids; it gives kids confidence to grow into positive contributors to \nour society.\n  In the United States, at least a half million children are not living \nin permanent homes. While waiting for adoption or a safe return to \ntheir natural families, too many kids live out their entire childhoods \nin the foster care system.\n  Sadly, it often turns into an lonely, even futile transition. There \nis a short window of opportunity to do something about this with each \nand every kid, and each and every kid is a little different in this \nregard. If this window of opportunity is missed, a child can leave the \nfoster care system a legal orphan--as an adult--having gone through \ntheir entire childhood never having permanency--never having a place \nthat they can call home.\n  More needs to be done to dispel the myth that some kids are \nunadoptable. I have had people right here in Washington, DC, tell me \nthat some kids are not adoptable. No kid is unadoptable. The only \nproblem is that we just haven't found a home for them yet.\n  I support the Adoption and Safe Families Act because it takes the \ninitial, necessary steps toward real reform. For the first time in 17 \nyears, this body has strived to address the pain and suffering of these \nchildren. A cornerstone has been laid upon which future adjustments can \nbe made and reforms can be built.\n  The bill will ensure health care coverage for adopted special needs \nchildren, break down geographic restrictions facing adoptive families, \nand encourage creative adoptive efforts and outreach.\n  One of the problems we as legislators have experienced has been that \ninadequate statistics are not kept; we don't have good enough \nstatistics to understand how States are performing with their child \ncare system. The data is too sparse and States can't tell us how many \nchildren they actually have in their care, or how long they have been \nthere. When the situation is that way, Mr. President, some children can \nbe lost in the system. So our bill is requiring States to report \ncritical statistics. Children will be identified and their lives will \nbe personalized to those responsible for them. The status quo will not \nbe able to hide behind the lack of information excuse. We have run into \nthat when dealing with this legislation.\n  Currently, the Federal Government does not require that States \nactively seek adoptive homes for all ``free-to-be-adopted'' children, \nwho often are assigned to long-term foster care. This bill, however, \ncompels States to make reasonable efforts to place a child in a \npermanent adoptive home. Long-term foster care should never be a \nsolution for any kid.\n  In most States, children are being denied permanency because of the \nartificial barrier of geography. This bill will break down the \ngeographic barriers to adoption--prohibiting discrimination against \nout-of-State adoptive families--allowing more children to find \npermanent families.\n  There is a mismatch between the location of children free to be \nadopted and families willing to adopt. Above all, these children need \nloving homes, and no State line should get in the way of their well-\nbeing.\n  The bill establishes for foster and pre-adoptive parents the right to \nbe given notice of hearings and the right to testify on behalf of the \nchildren in their care. How could anyone ever want to leave these \npeople out of the process?\n  These parents have been in charge of the children 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week. They are the ones in the best position to know the \nproblems that these children might have and can represent the \nchildren's concerns. It is an important change to make as we seek to \nbetter represent the children's best interests.\n  The Federal Government plays a significant role in child welfare by \nproviding funds to States and attaching conditions to those funds. The \nsingle largest category of Federal expenditure under the child welfare \nprograms is for maintaining low-income foster care children. To receive \nFederal funds, States must comply with the requirements of this bill, \nand States will be penalized for noncompliance. We are sick and tired \nof kids being kept in the foster care system because there is money \nthat comes from the Federal Government for those kids. There is an\n\n[[Page S12673]]\n\nincentive--a monetary incentive--not to move these children toward \npermanency.\n\n  I am pleased with the provisions in this bill which emphasizes \nadoption promotion and support services in the Family Preservation and \nSupport Services Act.\n  To help ensure that new adoptive families are healthy and stay \ntogether, the bill provides post-adoptive services and respite care. It \nis a proven approach.\n  In States where post-adoption services are offered, the number of \nadoptive families that have trouble staying together is significantly \nlower.\n  I congratulate the Members for their efforts on this issue and \ncommend the authors of this monumental piece of legislation. One person \nthat hasn't gotten much attention--and he played a very important role \nin this process--is Senator Roth, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. He was instrumental in forging an agreement with members so \nthat this bill could pass, as it will tonight. His guidance and insight \nwere critical to the bill's success.\n  Today, we begin to dramatically change the culture surrounding \nadoption. We begin the education process. We begin by dismissing the \ndehumanizing myth surrounding special-needs children. These children \ndeserve permanent homes, too. These children are precious, and all \nchildren in need of permanent homes are adoptable.\n  I have been impressed by the compassion of those who adopt these \nspecial children. They are gifted and they ought to inspire all of us \nto be more concerned about kids in need. We know that more families are \nwilling to adopt children, including those with the most challenging of \ncircumstances.\n  Let's build upon the cornerstone of this monumental bill. Even though \nwe will have passed this legislation, some children will still remain \nhostages in an inefficient system. More reform is needed to help place \nmore children in a safe, permanent home.\n  I am looking toward future years to do more in the following areas. \nPeople should know that Chuck Grassley, the Senator from Iowa, is not \ndone with changes in foster care and adoption at the Federal level.\n  First, we need to dramatically limit the time a child can legally \nspend in foster care. The national average length of stay in foster \ncare is 3 years. That is three birthdays, three Christmases, and that \nis going through the first, second, and third grades, without having a \nmom and dad.\n  Second, we need to remove financial incentives to keep children in \nfoster care, and provide incentives for success, not just for attempts \nto adopt. Currently, the system pays the same rate per child per month \nwithout limitation. The Federal Government must pay for performance.\n  These children are the most vulnerable of all; their lives begin with \nabuse and neglect by their own parents and, for many, they experience \nsystemic abuse by languishing in long-term foster care.\n  The Congressional Research Service stated, ``Children are vulnerable, \nand their well-being is affected by conditions beyond their control.'' \nBut their well-being is not beyond our control. These children depend \non sound Federal policy that promotes permanency. Together with those \non the front lines, we can make this policy work.\n  Congress has said that long-term foster care should never be a \nsolution for a child who needs a home. It takes the critical first \nsteps toward complete reform of a broken-down system, and it lays the \ncornerstone for continued improvement on behalf of tens of thousand of \nchildren left in limbo each year in the foster care system.\n  Foster care is a poor parent. A loving, committed family is the best \ngift that we can give to any child.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, with the Senate's vote today on ``The \nAdoption and Safe Families Act,'' we are sending the President a \nlandmark reform of the nation's foster care system and a bill that will \nmake an enormous difference in the lives of many children in America.\n  Every child deserves a safe, loving, permanent family. For a lot of \nus, it's inconceivable that this most basic need is out of reach for \nhundreds of thousands of children across the nation. Although we've \ntried to provide a safety net to protect children at risk of abuse or \nneglect, that safety net is failing all too many children. The problem \ndoes not lie with the vast majority of foster parents, relatives and \ncaseworkers who work valiantly to provide the care needed by these \nchildren. Rather, the problem is the system itself, and incentives \nbuilt into it. On one end, it's allowing children to slip back into \nabusive homes; on the other end, it's trapping them in what was \nsupposed to be ``temporary'' foster care, instead of moving them into \npermanent homes.\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 will bring more children \nhome--to safe, permanent homes--and it will bring them home faster. It \nwill change the culture of foster care with a number of fundamental \nreforms:\n  Currently, to obtain federal funds, states are required to use \n``reasonable efforts'' to keep families together. While that sounds \nlike a goal we all can support, this requirement has resulted in states \nusing extraordinary efforts to keep children in what may actually be \nabusive or unsafe situations. Tragically, it's the children who \nultimately pay for mistakes when this happens--sometimes with their \nvery lives.\n  Our bill will change this. It requires that the child's health and \nsafety must be the paramount concerns in any decisions made by the \nstate on behalf of that child. While the reforms in the bill respect \nthe rights of others--such as birth parents, relatives, foster families \nand adoptive parents--it makes clear that the focus must always be on \nthe child's health and safety.\n  In addition to this general rule, the bill provides that the \n``reasonable efforts'' requirement does not apply where there are \naggravated circumstances such as abandonment, torture, chronic abuse or \nsexual abuse. This is not a comprehensive list; we've tried to make \nclear that states have the power to suspend the requirement for other \naggravated circumstances that jeopardize the health and safety of the \nchild.\n  Mr. President, these critical reforms will help save the lives of \nchildren. That's probably the most important goal of the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act. But it's not the only goal; other reforms in the \nbill are aimed at encouraging adoption and helping to move children \nthrough the foster care system and into permanent, loving homes.\n  For instance, for the first time, steps will have to be taken to free \na child for adoption or other permanent placement once the child has \nbeen in foster care for fifteen months or more. In cases of severe \nabuse, when ``reasonable efforts'' are not appropriate, this bill \nestablishes a new expedited process, requiring a permanency planning \nhearing to be held within 30 days. For the first time, states will be \nrequired to use ``reasonable efforts'' to place a child for adoption, \nif returning the child to the family is not an option. For the first \ntime, those efforts must be documented.\n  We were particularly concerned about helping make adoption more \nlikely for foster children with ``special needs.'' These are children \nwho, by definition, are hard to place, perhaps because they require \nspecial medical help or mental health services, or the like. This bill \nrequires health insurance coverage for children with special needs, \nwhich will make it more possible for families of all incomes to give \nthese children a home.\n  This bill also provides states with financial rewards based on their \nsuccess in increasing adoptions. An even higher reward is provided for \nincreasing the adoptions of special needs children. The bill authorizes \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to provide technical \nassistance to states and localities to promote adoption of foster \nchildren. We've also highlighted adoption promotion and support as \nservices funded by the Family Preservation Program, which we have \nreauthorized for three years and renamed the ``Promoting Adoptive, Safe \nand Stable Families'' program.\n  We also attempted to address what many in the field have told us is a \nmajor hindrance to adoption: geographic barriers. It's my understanding \nthat states are working independently to resolve this problem. Our bill \ngives them an additional push toward resolution, by providing that \nstates risk losing their federal payments if they deny\n\n[[Page S12674]]\n\nor delay the placement of a child when an approved family is available \noutside their jurisdiction. We've also required a study and report to \nCongress on interjurisdictional adoption issues, so that we can take \nadditional actions in the future in this area, if necessary.\n  This bill makes a number of system reforms aimed both at helping to \nadvance our goals and providing a foundation for additional reforms in \nthe future.\n  For instance, we're requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to work with state and local officials, child advocates and \nothers in developing performance measures and publishing a report \nevaluating the effectiveness of our child welfare programs. This bill \nalso requires HHS to develop and recommend to Congress a system for \nbasing federal assistance payments on performance. It allows child \nwelfare agencies to use the Federal Parent Locator Service to assist in \nlocating absent parents. It allows agencies to use concurrent \nplanning--that is, providing services to reunite or preserve the family \nwhile simultaneously recruiting adoptive parents, so that if the family \ncannot be preserved or reunited, the child will not have to wait such a \nlong time before moving into a permanent home.\n  Before concluding, let me acknowledge the hard work of a number of \nmembers in both the House and the Senate, without which we wouldn't \nhave a bill today. Although we may have started with fundamentally \ndifferent views as to how best to change the system, we were united--\nand driven to resolve our differences--by the strong belief that reform \nis urgently needed now. I am pleased to have had a part in the \nbipartisan Senate coalition that worked and re-worked this legislation: \nSenator DeWine, Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Coats, Senator Bond, Senator Levin, Senator \nNickles, and Senator Grassley. Special thanks must go to Chairman Roth \nof the Senate Finance Committee, and his staff, who helped navigate the \nSenate bill to the floor and through the House. The Senate coalition \nappreciated having excellent technical assistance from Karen Spar of \nthe Congressional Research Service. I'd like to thank the other \ncosponsors of the Senate PASS Act for their support: Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Johnson, Senator Kerrey and Senator Moseley-\nBraun. I also appreciate the efforts on the House side, led by \nCongressmen Camp and Kennelly, and Chairman Shaw.\n  Mr. President, these reforms will save lives and help move children \nout of foster care, faster, and into safe, permanent, loving homes. \nIt's the hope of all who support this legislation that President \nClinton will sign it into law before the end of November--which, \nappropriately enough, is National Adoption Month. Let's bring these \nchildren home.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Roth, \nChafee, Craig, and Rockefeller for bringing this foster care and \nadoption assistance bill to the floor.\n  This bill contains a number of long overdue programmatic changes to \nstrengthen the foster care system.\n  In addition, the bill provides more funds to reward states that \nincrease adoptions. These adoptions will preclude children from having \nlong, or even worse, permanent stays in state foster care systems.\n  To achieve this additional funding, the bill contains a discretionary \nspending cap adjustment of $20 million per year for the years 1999 to \n2002.\n  One could argue that this cap adjustment would result in an increase \nin the deficit. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nspending from this incentive payment will reduce mandatory foster care \nspending by $25 million over the next 5 years.\n  The bill also contains additional mandatory spending for family \npreservation services. The Family Preservation Program attempts to \nprovide intensive services to families at risk of having children \nremoved from the home and put into foster care.\n  This additional money would raise total funding for family \npreservation services to $1.435 billion over the next 5 years or $80 \nmillion above the President's request.\n  I want to raise a couple concerns. First, there are a number of minor \nBudget Act violations, like the cap adjustment.\n  Second, and of greater concern, is an offset for the additional \nFamily Preservation spending. The offset was conceived of and added at \nthe last minute. I do not believe the policy was thought out and the \neffects certainly are not well known to this body.\n  The offset would tap into the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n[TANF] contingency fund and could unfairly target small, poor states \nwith volatile unemployment rates. Moreover, the offset would, \nperversely, take away funds from states when they are needed the most.\n  The contingency fund was a vital part of making welfare reform work \nby increasing funds to states experiencing increased unemployment or \nrising food stamp caseloads.\n  The offset allows states to receive a contingency grant payment in \none year, but then require that state to pay back at least a portion in \nthe next year.\n  The repayment would be prorated among the states that qualify in any \ngiven year. For example if five states qualify for payments in the year \n2000, those states would split the $16 million required repayment in \nthe year 2001.\n  However, the risk is that one state or a handful of very small states \nwill qualify for contingency grant payments and will be forced to pay \nback the full amount.\n  This risk is justified. In 1997 only one state, New Mexico, qualified \nfor contingency payments. Had this bill been in effect this year, New \nMexico would have had to pay back almost all of their contingency \ngrant.\n  The economy in New Mexico is currently doing better, unemployment is \ndown to 6.4 percent and the state does not currently qualify for the \ncontingency fund. But my state and many other similar states are always \nvulnerable. One plant closing can mean a substantial increase in \nunemployment and need.\n  While $16 million with respect to the Federal Budget does not sound \nlike a lot to many people, this is a substantial sum to New Mexico. $16 \nmillion represents over ten percent of New Mexico's entire TANF grant.\n  In fact this offset would represent over a ten percent reduction in \nthe TANF grant for 31 states and a cut of over fifty percent for 6 \nstates.\n  Further this grant reduction would come at time when a state needs it \nthe most, when state coffers are under pressure from an increase in \nunemployment.\n  I understand that this bill enjoys broad support and that the bill on \nnet contains important, necessary changes. I do not intend to hold it \nup today.\n  I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Roth to formalize my \nunderstanding that next year the Finance Committee will address this \nproblem and restore full funding to the contingency grant.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator \nRoth for bringing this foster care and adoption assistance bill to the \nfloor. The bill contains a number of long overdue changes to the foster \ncare system. However, the bill contains an offset for new spending that \nwould take money out of the temporary assistance for needy families \n[TANF] contingency fund. It is my understanding that only those states \nthat qualify for contingency payments would be affected by this offset.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. That is true. States that qualify for payments in one \nyear would pay back a prorated share in the next.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am concerned that this repayment would target states \nthat need the funding most: states with rising unemployment.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Finance Committee is aware of that potential situation. \nWe will monitor the situation and work with you and the Administration \nto make adjustments in the operation of the contingency fund if \nnecessary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much. I look forward to an \nequitable resolution in this matter.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the bill before us is a remarkable \nachievement. It not only represents a true bipartisan effort to change \na system that too often becomes mired in bureaucracy, but it also \nrepresents a significant change in the way that system works and what \nits goals should be. I am very proud to have played a part in\n\n[[Page S12675]]\n\nnegotiating a good bill, and I want to commend, in particular, my \ncolleagues Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Coats, and \nSenator Craig for their hard work on this bill. I also want to thank \nSenator Roth for his efforts in negotiating this legislation with our \nHouse counterparts.\n  This legislation will lead to an improvement in the services we \nprovide to nearly 100,000 children in the foster care system who are \nunable to return to their biological families because of threats to \ntheir health and safety. This bill guarantee as never before that their \nhealth and safety will be the ``paramount concern'' at every step of \ntheir stay in foster care, including in the development of their \npermanency plan. It also assures that every effort will be made to move \nchildren into safe, permanent homes as quickly as possible.\n  Why is this important? Too often, children languish in foster care \nfor years--years--before they find a safe, loving family. Many \nchildren, especially those with special needs, often never are placed \nwith an adoptive family. Those children grow up in the foster care \nsystem, never knowing the security and warmth that a loving family \nprovides.\n  To help ensure that the child's safety remains the paramount concern, \nthis bill changes the focus on the way states define the term \n``reasonable effort.'' Too often, states have placed too much emphasis \non returning a child to his or her biological family, even when doing \nso may mean endangering the child. This bill provides that states \nshould still make every attempt to keep families intact, but--and this \nis a significant change in the current law--it also makes it very clear \nthat there are a number of circumstances in which a state does NOT have \nto make a reasonable effort to reunite a child with the biological \nfamily. For example, if a parent has been found to have murdered \nanother child in the family, or has subjected a child to chronic abuse, \nit is unreasonable--and irrational--to insist that the state return \nthat child to the family. That seems like common sense, but, as we all \nknow, the law doesn't always lead to common sense conclusion. This \nlegislation clarifies this.\n  I also want to point out that this bill requires, for the first time, \nstates to implement procedures by which they will perform criminal \nbackground checks on potential foster and adoptive parents. I think the \naverage citizen would be very surprised to learn that we do not \ncurrently require states to do such checks. While some states check \nprospective adoptive parents for evidence of past criminal activity \nwhich might indicate that it would be dangerous to place a child in \ntheir care, most states do not. This bill would change that situation. \nThe original House bill did not contain this provision, and I want to \ncommend the Senate conferees, especially Senator Coats, for insisting \nthe Senate's language remain intact. It makes good sense.\n  Another hard-fought provision that the Senate can be very proud of \nprovides that when a special needs child is adopted--that is, one who \nis hard to place because of a physical or mental disability--then the \nstate must ensure that the child will have health insurance coverage. \nToo many of these special needs children have found that when they are \nadopted, their access to health care disappears and the adoptive family \nmust shoulder the entire financial responsibility for the child. That \ncan create a huge disincentive for an otherwise loving family to adopt \na child with a physical disability. Our bill says that when a child is \nadopted, he or she will have the health insurance needed to meet his or \nher needs. That is a significant step, and, again, I am pleased the \nSenate remained steadfast in its insistence on this provision.\n  Mr.. President, this bill is a victory for children and adoptive \nparents nationwide. There are more than 100,000 children awaiting \nadoption or other permanent placements, and this bill is a good step \ntoward moving many of them into safe, loving, permanent homes.\n  Again, I extend my deepest thanks to Senators Chafee, Rockefeller, \nCraig, Coats, DeWine, Kerrey, and Roth for their hard work on this \nbill. We have been working to come to this agreement for months, and \nthis bill is the hard-fought result of those efforts. I urge all my \ncolleagues to give their support to this legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 867, the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. This legislation promotes \nadoption and makes important reforms in foster care. It includes \nprovisions drawn from two bills I co-sponsored earlier this year, S. \n511 [the ``SAFE'' Act] and S. 1195 [the ``PASS'' Act]. We have been \nable to work out bipartisan legislation with two goals we all share--\nensuring the safety of children in the child welfare system, and \nfinding permanent homes for as many children in foster care as \npossible.\n  Children in the child welfare system, victims of abuse and neglect, \nare among the most vulnerable in our society. Just this week, in my own \nstate, we learned of another tragic death, that of little Sabrina \nGreen. Sabrina, nine years old, lived in the Bronx. After both her \nmother and her latest foster mother died, Sabrina went to live with her \noldest sister, Yvette Green. After what appears to have been months of \nabuse--such as burning Sabrina's hand over a stove as punishment for \ntaking food out of the refrigerator--she was found beaten to death. Her \nsister and her sister's boyfriend have been accused of this crime.\n  We owe it to these abused and neglected children to do our best on \ntheir behalf. And I am encouraged that a group of our colleagues has \nworked together--on a bipartisan basis--to develop this legislation. I \nthank Senators Chafee, Rockefeller, Roth, Craig, Jeffords, Kerrey, \nCoats, DeWine, Landrieu, and the others who have played important roles \nin this effort.\n  This bill clarifies that the health and safety of the child are to be \nthe ``paramount'' concern when making the difficult decisions involved \nin the child welfare system and it contains several other ``safety \nfirst'' provisions, such as requiring criminal records checks for \nprospective adoptive and foster parents. The bill accelerates the \nprocess for determining the permanent placement for a child in foster \ncare, so that children do not spend years bouncing among foster homes. \nH.R. 867 also promotes adoption by providing states with financial \nincentives to get children in foster care adopted, and by breaking down \nhealth insurance and geographic barriers to adoption.\n  This legislation is an important step forward in our efforts to help \nabused and neglected children. I am proud to support it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do want to say, Mr. President, for the Record, and I note \nSenator Daschle is also very interested in this, that I am very pleased \nwe were able to get this legislation through the whole process. There \nwas a lot of work by Senators on both sides of the aisle. I believe \nthis will be one of the two or three important bills we passed this \nyear, because it will help with foster care and adoption. I commend all \nSenators.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur in what the majority leader just \nsaid. This is an important issue to the administration. They called \nagain this afternoon to confirm it was going to pass.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Henry G. Ulrich, III, 2552.\n\n\n   statement on the nomination of lynn adelman to u.s. district court\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to tell you why \nLynn Adelman, the President's nominee for the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Wisconsin, is such a fine choice to fill the \nvacancy created when Judge Curran took senior status.\n  First, Lynn Adelman has a record of unquestioned skill and unequaled \nexperience in his 30 years of practice. His dedication, hard work and \nintelligence has been displayed in both civil and criminal cases, \nbefore the Wisconsin Supreme Court and before the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  Second, Lynn Adelman has spent a life devoted to public service. He \nhas dedicated a great deal of his professional time to disadvantaged \nclients. And, rather than pursue his private practice full-time, he has \nsimultaneously served in public office. As a State senator for 20 \nyears, much of the time serving as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nhe has championed the causes of families, crime victims and government \naccountability.\n  Based on this outstanding record, Lynn Adelman received high marks \nfrom the nonpartisan commission that Senator Feingold and I established \nwith the State Bar. And his nomination has bipartisan support, \nincluding the endorsement of Wisconsin's Republican Governor, Tommy \nThompson. Although they have not always seen eye to eye, Governor \nThompson wrote that Lynn is ``thoughtful, fair and open-minded'' as \nwell as someone who ``is sensitive to and has respect for the principle \nof the separation of powers.''\n  Finally, let me conclude on a personal note. My family has known the \nAdelman family for over 30 years, and I have known Lynn personally for \nmore than 20. I know that he has the compassion, integrity and skill \nthat will make him a valuable addition to the bench.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the U.S. Senate took \naction today to confirm Lynn Adelman to the Federal District Court. \nLynn's entire career, both in the State legislature and his private \nlegal practice, has been marked by his dedication to serving the people \nof our State and makes him particularly well suited for a position on \nthe federal bench. I have no doubt that he will continue his career of \npublic service in this new capacity and will be an excellent jurist for \nthe people of Wisconsin.\n  President Clinton choose Lynn Adelman's name from the three forwarded \nto him by the nominations committee that Senator Kohl and I established \nto review potential nominees for Wisconsin's federal bench. I am \npleased that the full Senate, having had an opportunity to review Lynn \nAdelman's record and to hear from him directly when he testified before \nthe Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has reached the same conclusion \nthat Senator Kohl, President Clinton, Governor Thompson, people all \nacross Wisconsin and I have reached. That being that Lynn Adelman will \nbe an exemplary federal judge.\n  Lynn Adelman was born in Milwaukee and is a graduate of Princeton \nUniversity and Columbia Law School. He graduated cum laude from both of \nthese excellent institutions. After a brief period working in New York, \nLynn returned his native Wisconsin and began what to this day has been \na career of dedicated public service to the people of our State. Lynn \nworked in private practice in Wisconsin beginning in 1972 and continues \nto do so today.\n  In 1977, Lynn was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate for the 28th \nDistrict. In the twenty years that he has represented the 28th \nDistrict, he has been a leading voice in the Wisconsin Legislature. I \nhad the distinct honor of serving with Lynn for ten years while I was a \nWisconsin State Senator and worked with him on the Judiciary Committee, \nwhich he has chaired on two occasions.\n  Lynn Adelman's legislative record and commitment to the people of his \ndistrict and the State of Wisconsin has earned him bi-partisan praise. \nIn fact, Republican Governor Tommy Thompson, writing in support of this \nnominee, characterized Lynn Adelman as ``. . .thoughtful, fair and \nopen-minded. . .'' The Governor has also noted how he and Lynn have \nworked hand in hand to ensure the passage of important legislation \nranging from anti-crime and anti-drug legislation to welfare reform. \nThis bi-partisan praise is a significant statement about the character \nand ability of Lynn Adelman.\n  At the same time he has served in the Wisconsin Legislature, Lynn \nAdelman has continued his practice as a successfully attorney. He has \nappeared in both criminal and civil cases, before both State and \nFederal courts. Lynn's considerable legal skills also resulted in him \narguing before the United States Supreme Court in 1993.\n  There can be little doubt that Lynn Adelman's career makes him well \nsuited to serve on the federal judiciary. His knowledge of the law is \nundeniable. He has a unique perspective on our legal system, born of \nhis service in the legislature and as a practicing attorney, He \nunderstands the fundamental principle of separation of powers and has \nthe temperament necessary to treat everyone who comes before him with \nthe respect and dignity they deserve. In short, he has all the tools \nnecessary to serve the people of Wisconsin with distinction. I am \npleased the Senate has chosen to confirm him today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note--while I don't have the exact numbers \nhere before me, I will insert in the Record later the numbers that are \ninvolved--during the first session of the 105th Congress we have now \nconfirmed over 3,500 civilian nominations, both judicial and other \nexecutive branch nominations. That does not include military \nnominations. The total number, I think, comes to over 20,000 \nnominations that we have confirmed during the first year of the 105th \nsession of Congress.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just comment on that, as well.\n  I want to thank the majority leader for his virtually tireless \neffort, over the last couple of days in particular, to clear the \nExecutive Calendar. We had at one point well over 100 nominations \npending on the calendar and we have it down now to just a handful. That \nwould not have happened without his effort. None of these are easy. \nSome are easier than others. I wish we could have done them all. In \nsome cases it is a responsibility of those on this side for not having \nbeen able to address some of these nominations.\n  I appreciate very much the effort made by the majority leader in the \nlast couple of days to successfully complete the work of Executive \nCalendar. I think, by and large because of his efforts, we have done \nso.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12677-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are a couple of matters yet to be \ncompleted tonight, including the Amtrak reform package that should be \ncoming momentarily from the House. Senator Daschle and I want to notify \nthe President we are moving toward completion of our work tonight.\n  Later on, when we have the final announcement, we will advise the \nSenate that it would reconvene, the 105th Congress, second session, \nfollowing a live quorum the morning of January 27, and there would be a \nlive quorum which would proceed morning business until 2 p.m. on that \nday, and on Tuesday night, January 27, at 9 p.m., we would have the \nPresident's State of the Union Address. So the Senate will convene, \nthen, that night at 8:30 in order to proceed to the body of the Hall of \nthe House of Representatives to hear the address.\n  There will be no legislative business on Tuesday, January 27 except \nfor those actions that may be cleared for unanimous consent. Therefore, \nno votes will occur during the session on that Tuesday.\n  Senators should be aware that the following items are expected to be \nconsidered during the early days of the second session of the 105th \nCongress:\n\n[[Page S12679]]\n\n The ISTEA transportation infrastructure bill; juvenile justice; the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow of California to a judgeship; and the \nnomination of Ann Aiken, prior to the end of the first week.\n  I do want to thank my colleagues for their cooperation throughout \nthis session of Congress, and especially on the Executive Calendar. I \nknow there has been a lot of effort made there on both sides of the \naisle and we leave just a very few on that calendar. I note we have \nconfirmed this year 36 judges. I believe we will act on at least four \nor five others very quickly in the beginning of the next session. We \nhad three reported today by the Judiciary Committee, all of which I \nunderstand were noncontroversial, but it was late in the afternoon and \nwe did not have the time to give Senators proper notice that we would \nproceed. So I expect that we will do those the first week back, also.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12678-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMENDING THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY LEADERS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

They have worked very well together this \nsession. We had some real trials and tribulations, but I think, \ntogether, they were an outstanding combination. They were able to pass \nthe Nation's important business, such as the budget and historic tax \nrelief.\n  I think this was a productive Congress.

Mr. President, as we come to the end of the session, I \nwant to say that the Senate could not run without competent people. We \nhave been fortunate to have an outstanding majority leader in Senator \nLott, who is a man of integrity, ability, and dedication, and an \noutstanding man in the minority leader, too, Senator Daschle. Both of \nthem have performed outstanding service to their country and this body. \nI predict that, someday, Senator Lott may become our President. I also \nwant to thank our leadership, including Senators Nickles, Craig, Mack, \nCoverdell, and McConnell, all who have cooperated and worked together \nto bring about the results that we have obtained.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to compliment some other people, too, and \nI will read their names: Elizabeth Greene, David Schiappa, Greer \nAmburn, of the Republican floor staff; the Democratic floor staff, Lula \nDavis and Marty Paone; the cloakroom staff, Brad Holsclaw, Laura \nMartin, Tripp Baird, and Mike Smythers.\n  I also want to thank the Secretary of the Senate, Gary Sisco; the \nSergeant at Arms, Greg Casey; the Senate Chaplain, Lloyd J. Ogilvie; \nthe clerks of the Senate; the Senate Parliamentarians, the Official \nReporters of the Senate, and the Senate Pages, who have all contributed \nto make this a successful session. We are very proud to commend them \nfor their outstanding work.\n  At the close of the session, I want to say that a lot has been done \nhere. In years to come, people can look back and say that the 105th \nsession of Congress accomplished a great deal. It is because of these \nleaders here and their staffs who worked hard. We could not run this \nplace without these competent staff members. I am very proud of all of \nthem.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to say that it has been a pleasure \nto work with all these people, the Senators and the staffs. As the \nholiday season approaches, I wish them all a happy Thanksgiving and a \nmerry Christmas.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this will be next to my last end-of-session \nperiod, and at the end of next year and the 105th Congress I will be \njoining my family back in Kentucky.\n  But let me say that in all of my 23 years so far here I have never \nenjoyed so much the friendship and watched the work of the Democratic \nleader to be any more outstanding or any more caring, developed with \nintegrity and character. He is one individual who I think, when you \nlook back at his theme of ``families first''--that was the view of all \nof the 100 Senators--that not only would this Chamber be covered with \naccolades for the job he has done, but we would see this country \nprogress in a much better and finer fashion.\n  So to the Democratic leader, I pay my respect, and my everlasting \nthanks for his courtesy in working with me during the year.\n  Having said that, I want to say that he has developed one of the \nfinest staffs not only on the floor but in his office that anyone could \nwork with. All of us are anxious to do good. All of us are anxious to \nsay the right things. But we have to have the right kind of support.\n  So as we observe the Senate floor and see who is doing the work and \nputting the package together, we all understand that we have chosen \nwell in the staff on both sides.\n  So, Mr. President, I didn't want to leave here without saying to my \nfriend from South Dakota when he reached out to help all families that \nhe reached\n\n[[Page S12680]]\n\nout to my family and to my family's family. And I see what good will \ncome from his efforts and his desire and his hope and vision for the \nfuture.\n  Also, I want to say that I think he has worked very well with the \nmajority leader. The majority leader has had some tremendous stress and \nstrain. But had it not been for the cooperation and effort of the \nDemocratic leader, the first session of the 105th Congress would not be \nending on the high note that I believe it is.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Kentucky \nfor his very generous comments. I am not worthy of his remarks. I \nappreciate very much the kindness that he has shown me in all the years \nthat we have worked together but in particular the last three. I \ncouldn't be a luckier leader than I am to have the ability to work as \nclosely as I can and do with the distinguished minority whip. It has \nbeen a real joy for me.\n  This has not been an easy year for him. As the ranking member of the \nRules Committee, he had to deal with a very, very contentious issue \nwith the seating of Senator Landrieu.\n  He has had an array of challenges presented to him, and each and \nevery time I had the confidence and the good fortune to know that he \nwas going to successfully work through those challenges and \ndifficulties with the kind of ability and tenacity and extraordinary \nwork that he does so routinely.\n  So I thank him for his work. I thank him for his friendship and the \ntremendous effort that he has put forward in making our caucus what it \nis today. I truly believe that any leader is only as good as the team \nhe has to work with. I have the good fortune to have, in my view, one \nof the best teams the Democratic caucus has ever had in leadership. And \nhe is the preeminent example of what I am referring to. He is respected \nso widely and so enthusiastically that it goes without saying that when \nit comes to respect and when it comes to the extraordinary admiration \nthat his colleagues have for him, Wendell Ford is in a class by \nhimself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12680-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THANKING THE STAFF\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

They have just \nbeen remarkable all year long. But whether it is in the leader's office \nor here on the floor, it has made my job one that has been so much \neasier as a result of their efforts and their knowledge of the way our \nprocess works. They bring to work each day an extensive experience but, \nmore than experience, an attitude that I think epitomizes the kind of \nquality of people that we have.\n  So I thank our staff.

Mr. President, I am completing my first year in the \nSenate. I will be the first to confess I have a lot to learn, but it \nhas certainly been a rewarding experience serving in this great body. \nHaving had the opportunity to serve 14 years in the House, I was no \nstranger to Capitol Hill, but this is a much different institution. The \ndynamic of 100 men and women working together as opposed to 435 is \nsubstantially different. I have been impressed with the volume of work \nthat each Senator is asked to shoulder. I have also been very impressed \nwith the leadership, and I join my colleague from Kentucky, Senator \nFord, in noting the fine work of Senator Daschle as the Democratic \nminority leader. It is a tough job. He is lucky to have a good staff to \nhave the energy and talent he brings to it. We are fortunate on the \nDemocratic side to have him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12680-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12680-S12681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF BILL LANN LEE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this moment I would like to make \nreference to what happened in the Senate Judiciary Committee today \nrelative to the nomination of Bill Lann Lee.\n  Bill Lann Lee is a Chinese-American who was designated by President \nClinton to head the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. \nIt is probably one of the more controversial jobs in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Civil rights, of course, throughout our history has evoked great \nemotion. Bill Lann Lee is a person, the son of Chinese immigrants, who \ncame up the hard way, faced challenges which many of us have never \nfaced, overcame them, and then devoted 23 years of his life serving \nwith the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. It is interesting; he filed some 200 \ndifferent civil rights lawsuits in his public career, settled all but \nsix of them--settled all but six of them.\n  As the mayor of Los Angeles, a Republican, Richard Riordan, said, \nBill Lann Lee is the mainstream of civil rights law. He is a person who \nlooks for practical and pragmatic solutions to civil rights challenges.\n  Mr. President, in my estimation, he is exactly the right person for \nthis job, and I am glad the President nominated him. What happened to \nBill Lann Lee today in the Judiciary Committee was a very sad situation \nfor Bill Lann Lee. Unfortunately, he did not have the votes and had his \nname been called, he would not have been approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and sent to the floor of the Senate for \nconfirmation. So as a result, there was a parliamentary tangle, and \nwhen all was said and done very little was done after 2 or 3 hours of \nspeeches.\n  It strikes me as sad that we have now reached a point in this debate \nover race and civil rights in this country where we are headed in the \nwrong direction. It is sad that the leaders of both political parties \ndo not look for opportunities to bind the wounds of this country, \nwounds of several centuries over the issue of race, but instead \ncontinue to look for flash points, buzz words, bringing up issues like \nquotas and preferences and such.\n  Bill Lann Lee was asked directly, what is his position on quotas. He \nsaid, unequivocally, decisively, ``I am against them.'' Bill Lann Lee \nsaid, ``I am against quotas.'' But if you would listen to his critics \nin the Judiciary Committee today, you would think his answer was \nexactly the opposite. They won't accept yes for an answer. Bill Lann \nLee said, ``Yes, I am opposed to quotas,'' and yet they continue to \nbadger him and say, oh, that isn't what he really means.\n  It is ironic, too, when they quizzed him about the important Supreme \nCourt decisions in the area of civil rights, he gave what I thought \nwere very cogent, thoughtful answers and complete to the best of his \nability. In fact, his answers, as the New York Times reported this \nmorning, were virtually identical to the answers of Seth Waxman, a man \nwho sought the position of Solicitor General, who was well qualified \nfor the job, and was approved by the Judiciary Committee and by the \nSenate without much of any kind of resistance. But along comes Bill \nLann Lee, and for some reason, giving the same answers to the same \nquestions, he is being rejected.\n  I said today in the Judiciary Committee that I wasn't certain that if \nThurgood Marshall's name had been submitted today to head the Civil \nRights Division, he could have made it through that committee. In fact, \nI will go beyond that; he could not have made it through that committee \nbecause, you see, Thurgood Marshall, who distinguished himself in the \nfield of civil rights throughout his lifetime and went on to serve this \ncountry with distinction on the Supreme Court, was an activist, a man \nwho actively pursued the cause of equal rights in America. And I have \nto tell you that the political sentiment in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is not open to that sort of individual.\n\n[[Page S12681]]\n\n  So now President Clinton faces a dilemma, what to do. After the \nSenate Judiciary Committee action today, or failure to act, should the \nPresident walk away from Bill Lann Lee and try to find some other for \nthe job? I hope he doesn't. I hope he doesn't. I hope the President \nwill appoint Bill Lann Lee, as he has the right to do, as a recess \nappointment to this job that will at least give him 1 year to serve in \nthis position. He deserves it. And in that service he will prove to a \nlot of his detractors that he is up to the job.\n  In addition, I might add, if Bill Lann Lee won't make it in this \nposition, if Republicans are opposed to him, I am afraid there isn't a \nperson the President could send that they would approve because, you \nsee, they are not looking for someone who represents the philosophy of \nthe administration, the philosophy of the Department of Justice or the \nphilosophy of the President. They are looking for someone who \nrepresents their Republican philosophy. But if I understand the \nConstitution in its basic form, the people of America spoke last \nNovember and said that Bill Clinton was to be the President. They \nendorsed his philosophy over Bob Dole and other candidates, and now \nwhen he tries to appoint people to positions to carry out that \nphilosophy, they say, no, we are not going to let that happen.\n  That is a sad situation, sadder still when you think about how this \nhas developed to a point where what was a bipartisan consensus on the \nissue of civil rights is starting to deteriorate very dramatically. \nToday in the committee only one Republican Senator, Arlen Specter, of \nPennsylvania, said he would vote for Bill Lann Lee. We needed one more \nout of the remaining nine, and we could not find them. So Bill Lann \nLee's nomination languished.\n  What is sadder still is that this fine man and his beautiful family \nare now left with uncertainty about their future. When he could have \nbeen preparing to serve this Nation in an important capacity and make \nlife better for so many people, his future is in doubt.\n  Those who argued that this is just a question of race looked beyond \nthe issue of civil rights in its entirety.\n  The issue of civil rights goes beyond racial questions into questions \ninvolving gender, questions involving people with personal physical \ndisabilities, questions of ethnic background. The Civil Rights Division \nmakes us feel uncomfortable as Americans because time and again it \nforces us to focus our view on things we don't want to talk about. We \ndon't want to talk about discrimination at a major corporation against \nAfrican Americans. We don't want to talk about discrimination at a \nmajor city's police department against women. We don't want to talk \nabout meetings of Federal law enforcement officials, as happened \nseveral years ago, where there were outright racist comments being made \ntime and again. Yet we must. Because if this Nation really stands for \nwhat we believe it does, if it is truly committed to equal rights, we \nhave to face the reality that there are times when we have strayed from \nour goal.\n  Bill Lann Lee, I hope, will ultimately be confirmed by this Senate, I \nhope not only because he would be the highest ranking Asian American in \nthe history of this country but also because, with his life, he has set \nout to prove that having been the son of Chinese immigrants, having \nbeen someone who is a recipient of an affirmative action program at \nYale University and also at Colombia Law School, that he could prove \nhimself to be up to the task.\n  I had a moment this evening, so I took out a card in my desk and \nwrote a personal note to him because I have been thinking about him a \nlot recently. I still remember his wife, his family. I especially \nremember his mother, his mother who is I am sure up in years but I \nwon't even try to guess what her age might be. She was a woman who \nworked in a hand laundry in New York for years, and there she sat at a \nconfirmation hearing seeing her son who used to run around this little \nhand laundry in New York now being nominated for one of the highest \npositions in the Federal Government. I am glad she got to see that \nnomination, but I am sorry that she had to witness what has happened \nsince. She came to this country as an immigrant with hope. Her husband, \nwho Bill Lee identified as his greatest inspiration in life, was a man \nwho was totally committed to this country.\n  During World War II, at the age of 36 when he could have escaped the \ndraft, he volunteered, went into the Army Air Corps and served with \nreal distinction. When he came out he said to his sons, ``It was the \nright thing to do. They treated me like I was an American--not a \nChinaman living in America.''\n  That lesson was not lost on Bill Lann Lee. It hasn't been lost on any \nof us. I sincerely hope that when we return, some of the rancor and \nsome of the negative feelings have abated and that people will consider \nonce again the need to look at this important nomination. If there \nneeds to be a national debate on affirmative action, the debate should \ntake place right here on the floor of this Chamber. Democrats and \nRepublicans can argue the merits or demerits. They can talk about \nchanges, as we should in any law. But to make this one man the focal \npoint of this debate and to literally say that he cannot have an \nopportunity to serve because we as a nation are divided on the \nquestion, I think is fundamentally unfair.\n  So, as we adjourn and go off for another 10 or 11 weeks back in our \ndistricts and other places, back in our home States, I hope we will not \nforget that we have a responsibility when we return, a responsibility \nnot just to Bill Lann Lee but to many others who hope that in a \nbipartisan fashion we can continue to address the issue of civil rights \nin a civil manner.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate today has \naccepted the House amendment to S. 476 to ensure Indian reservations \nand rural areas are eligible for the funding authorized under this bill \nto expand Boys & Girls Clubs across the country. I am also pleased that \nthis legislation will be sent to the President this evening for his \nsignature.\n  When this bill was under discussion in the Senate last spring, I made \nsure that rural areas, including many areas of my home State of \nVermont, would be eligible for grants to establish some of the targeted \n2,500 new Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Representative Buyer's \namendment will now ensure that Indian reservations will qualify under \nthis bill. The original language in this bill was more restrictive, \nrequiring the grants to be used only for the purpose of establishing \nBoys & Girls Clubs in public housing projects and other distressed \nareas. I have worked with the Boys & Girls and know that they \nunderstand that rural areas as well as urban can qualify as \n``distressed areas''.\n  The bill is now more expansive and will give girls and boys in rural \nareas and on reservations greater opportunities to share in Boys & \nGirls Clubs and their programs. The revised statute will authorize \ngrants for establishing and extending facilities ``where needed''. \nParticular emphasis continues to be given to housing projects, where \nBoys & Girls Clubs have proven effective in preventing youth crime, and \nto distressed areas, rural or urban. But the ``where needed'' language \nshould help make expansion into rural areas a greater priority.\n  The changes made to that program by this bill also permit up to 5 \npercent of the grant funds to be used to establish a role model \nspeakers' program. Anyone who has seen Boys & Girls Clubs of America \ncommercial with Denzel Washington and his coach will know the kinds of \noutstanding role models that we are seeking to promote to encourage and \nmotivate young people to be involved, productive citizens.\n  I have seen the outstanding results at the Boys & Girls Clubs in \nBurlington, VT. The role models they provide include the outstanding \ninstructors and volunteers who work in the Club's many programs. I have \nalso witnessed the outstanding result of the Kids `N Kops Program at \nthe University of Vermont with the cooperation of local law \nenforcement.\n  Expansions are proceeding and over 200 new clubs serving 180,000 \nyouth were opened as a result of last year's appropriation. I know that \nthe Burlington Boys & Girls Clubs received $100,000 to help enhance \nthat Club's outreach efforts. I am also pleased to report that a new \nclub will soon be established in Rutland, VT. I would like to thank \nRobbie Callaway and the many others at the Boys & Girls Clubs of \nAmerica who have worked so hard to establish these important programs \nthroughout the United States. I applaud your dedication and commitment \nto ensuring that our Nation's youth have solid alternatives to hanging \nout in the streets.\n  I know that the national headquarters is also researching the \nfeasibility of a club in Essex Junction. I hope that with the \ncontinuation of this initiative they will look for opportunities to \nserve young people in Montpelier, Brattleboro, St. Johnsbury and other \nVermont locations, as well. I would be delighted for a sizable portion \nof the 1,000,000 additional young people who we hope will be served by \nthe end of this century to come from the 145,000 young people in \nVermont and those in other rural areas.\n  In supporting this bill, I encourage the Boys & Girls Clubs as one \nexample of a successful youth-oriented program that can help make a \ndifference in young people's lives and prevent crime and delinquency. I \nalso support the work of others who are effective with young people, \nincluding our outstanding 4-H programs.\n  This measure should not become an excuse for anyone not to join with \nus to bolster comprehensive drug education and prevention for all \nelementary and high school students. As I have urged in the Judiciary \nCommittee discussions of S. 10, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile \nOffender Act, we should proceed to help create after school ``safe \nhavens'' where children are protected from drugs, gangs and crime with \nactivities including drug prevention education, academic tutoring, \nmentoring, and abstinence training. This bill is a step but should not \nbe the end of our efforts to support programs that help prevent \njuvenile delinquency, crime, and drug abuse.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move that the Senate concur in the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nmake a few brief comments with my colleague, Senator Lott, in support \nof H. J. Res. 95, a resolution passed by the House of Representatives \nwhich gives the consent of Congress to the Chickasaw Trail Economic \nDevelopment Compact. As the U.S. Constitution requires all State \ncompacts to be approved by Congress, Representatives Ed Bryant of \nTennessee and Roger Wicker of Mississippi recently introduced this \nlegislation in the House.\n  This Compact will allow the States of Tennessee and Mississippi to \ndetermine the feasibility of establishing an industrial park which \nwould straddle the border between the two States. This proposed \nIndustrial Park would lie in both Fayette County, TN. and Marshall \nCounty, MS. Governors Sundquist and Fordice have each expressed their \nsupport for this initiative, as they believe this type of industrial \npark will be strengthened by taking a regional approach to industrial \nrecruitment and development.\n  I believe that Tennessee will benefit from this initiative by \ncombining the competitive assets of southwest Tennessee and Northern \nMississippi to create an attractive and viable business park.\n  I ask my friend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, if he agrees that \nthis initiative will be of significant benefit to our two States and, \nindeed, to much of the Southeast region?\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his comments. This area of our two \nStates is growing rapidly and I agree that a new, bistate industrial \npark would be of great benefit to both Mississippi and Tennessee. It is \nmy hope that this proposed economic development project will mean a \nmajor increase in the number of jobs and level of prosperity for this \nregion of the country.\n  I have been working on this proposal for an industrial park for a \nnumber of years and I am pleased that this essential, in fact critical, \nnext step of the process is taking place now. I know that both you and \nI will keep a close watch on the progress of this proposed industrial \npark and I thank you for bringing it up on the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of House Joint \nResolution 95, a measure introduced by my friend, Representative Ed \nBryant of the Seventh District of Tennessee. This legislation gives \ncongressional approval to the Chickasaw Trail Economic Development \nCompact. This partnership is an interstate compact created by agreement \nof the Mississippi and Tennessee State Legislatures to promote joint \neconomic development and interstate cooperation in a rural, undeveloped \narea of Fayette County, TN, and Marshall County, MS.\n  The plan creates the Chickasaw Authority, which will conduct a study \nof the feasibility of establishing an industrial park in the area. If \nthis study produces a positive recommendation, Mississippi and \nTennessee would then negotiate a new compact implementing the details \nto establish a 4,000- to 5,000-acre industrial park. Such a facility \nwould capitalize on the strengths that lie on both sides of the State \nline and attract new investment and employment opportunities. The \nproximity of the park to metro Memphis would build on the already \nstrong commercial activity in Southwest Tennessee and North \nMississippi. To my knowledge, this type of cooperation between States \nhas never been attempted.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to add my name to the unanimous support of \nthe members of the Tennessee and Mississippi congressional delegations. \nit is my hope that this project will bring economic development and \njobs by attracting new sophisticated high-technology industries to the \narea. I would like to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, for his \nassistance in bringing this measure before the Senate, and I would also \nlike to thank Senator Thompson and Senator Cochran for their support \nfor this initiative. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be considered read a third time and passed; that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating \nto the resolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J.

The \n     Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General, \n     shall approve the entity's statement of work and the award \n     and shall oversee the contract. In carrying out its \n     responsibilities under the preceding sentence, the Inspector \n     General's Office shall perform such overview and validation \n     or verification of data as may be necessary to assure that \n     the assessment conducted under this subsection meets the \n     requirements of this section.\n       (b) Assessment Criteria.--The Secretary and Amtrak shall \n     provide to the independent entity estimates of the financial \n     requirements of Amtrak for the period described in subsection \n     (a), using as a base the fiscal year 1997 appropriation \n     levels established by the Congress. The independent \n     assessment shall be based on an objective analysis of \n     Amtrak's funding needs.\n       (c) Certain Factors To Be Taken into Account.--The \n     independent assessment shall take into account all relevant \n     factors, including Amtrak's--\n       (1) cost allocation process and procedures;\n       (2) expenses related to intercity rail passenger service, \n     commuter service, and any other service Amtrak provides;\n       (3) Strategic Business Plan, including Amtrak's projected \n     expenses, capital needs, ridership, and revenue forecasts; \n     and\n       (4) assets and liabilities.\n     For purposes of paragraph (3), in the capital needs part of \n     its Strategic Business Plan Amtrak shall distinguish between \n     that portion of the capital required for the Northeast \n     Corridor and that required outside the Northeast Corridor, \n     and shall include rolling stock requirements, including \n     capital leases, ``state of good repair'' requirements, and \n     infrastructure improvements.\n       (d) Bidding Practices.--\n       (1) Study.--The independent assessment also shall determine \n     whether, and to what extent, Amtrak has performed each year \n     during the period from 1992 through 1996 services under \n     contract at amounts less than the cost to Amtrak of \n     performing such services with respect to any activity other \n     than the provision of intercity rail passenger \n     transportation, or mail or express transportation. For \n     purposes of this clause, the cost to Amtrak of performing \n     services shall be determined using generally accepted \n     accounting principles for contracting. If identified, such \n     contracts shall be detailed in the report of the independent \n     assessment, as well as the methodology for preparation of \n     bids to reflect Amtrak's actual cost of performance.\n       (2) Reform.--If the independent assessment performed under \n     this subparagraph reveals that Amtrak has performed services \n     under contract for an amount less than the cost to Amtrak of \n     performing such services, with respect to any activity other \n     than the provision of intercity rail passenger \n     transportation, or mail or express transportation, then \n     Amtrak shall revise its methodology for preparation of bids \n     to reflect its cost of performance.\n       (e) Deadline.--The independent assessment shall be \n     completed not later than 180 days after the contract is \n     awarded, and shall be submitted to the Council established \n     under section 203, the Secretary of Transportation, the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     United States Senate, and the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the United States House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2265 and, \nfurther, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2265) to amend the provisions of title 17 and \n     18, United States Code, to provide greater copyright \n     protection by amending criminal copyright infringement \n     provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of passage of H.R. 2265, \nThe No Electronic Theft [NET] Act. This bill plugs the ``LaMacchia \nLoophole'' in criminal copyright enforcement.\n  Current sec. 506(a) of the Copyright Act contains criminal penalties \nfor willful copyright infringement for ``commercial advantage or \nprivate financial gain.'' In U.S. versus LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 \n(D. Mass. 1994), defendant, a graduate student attending MIT, \nencouraged lawful purchasers of copyrighted computer games and other \nsoftware to upload these works via a special password to an electronic \nbulletin board on the Internet. The defendant then transferred the \nworks to another electronic address and urged other persons with access \nto a second password to download the materials for personal use without \nauthorization by or compensation to the copyright owners. Because the \ndefendant never benefited financially from any of these transactions, \nthe current criminal copyright infringement could not be used. \nFurthermore, the court held that neither could the federal wire fraud \nstatute, since Congress never envisioned protecting copyrights under \nthat statute. For persons with few assets, civil liability is not an \nadequate deterrent.\n  It is obvious that great harm could be done to copyright owners if \nthis practice were to become widespread. Significant losses to \ncopyright holders would undermine the monetary incentive to create \nwhich is recognized in our Constitution. Mr. President, I believe that \nwillful, commercial-scale pirating of copyrighted works, even when the \npirate receives no monetary reward, ought to be nipped in the bud. This \nbill does that.\n  I will admit, Mr. President, that I initially had concerns about this \nbill. I was afraid that the language was so broad that the net could be \ncast too widely--pardon the pun--so that minor offenders or persons who \nhonestly believed that they had a legitimate right to engage in the \nbehavior prohibited by the bill would be swept in. What of the educator \nwho feels that his or her action is a fair use of the copyrighted work? \nAlthough the bill is not failsafe, because of the severity of the \npotential losses to copyright owners from widespread LaMacchia-like \nbehavior and the little time remaining in this session, on balance I \nwas persuaded to support the bill.\n  I place great store by the ``willfulness'' requirement in the bill. \nAlthough there is on-going debate about what precisely is the \n``willfulness'' standard in the Copyright Act--as the House Report \nrecords--I submit that in the LaMacchia context ``willful'' ought to \nmean the intent to violate a known legal duty. The Supreme Court has \ngiven the term ``willful'' that construction in numerous cases in the \npast 25 years, for example: U.S. versus Bishop, 412, U.S. 346 (1973); \nU.S. versus Pomponio, 429 U.S. 987 (1976); Cheek versus U.S., 498 U.S. \n192 (1991); and Ratzlaf versus U.S., 510 U.S. 135 (1994). As Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, that is the interpretation that I give to \nthis term. Otherwise, I would have objected and not allowed this bill \nto pass by unanimous consent. Under this standard, then, an educator \nwho in good faith believes that he or she is engaging in a fair use of \ncopyrighted material could not be prosecuted under the bill.\n\n  I am also relying upon the good sense of prosecutors and judges. \nAgain, the purpose of the bill is to prosecute commercial-scale pirates \nwho do not have commercial advantage or private financial gain from \ntheir illegal activities. But if an over-zealous prosecutor should \nbring and win a case against a college prankster, I am confident that \nthe judge would exercise the discretion that he or she may have under \nthe Sentencing Guidelines to be lenient. If the practical effect of the \nbill turns out to be draconian, we may have to revisit the issue.\n  In addition to my concern that the bill's scope might be too broad, I \nwanted to make sure that the language of the bill would not prejudice \nin any way the debate about the copyright liability of on-line and \nInternet service providers. Mr. President, there are good arguments on \nboth sides of the issue, and I will shortly begin the process of \nbringing the parties together to try to obtain a mutually agree-upon \nsolution to this problem. It is my understanding that representatives \nof the OSP/ISP community and the fair use community were consulted \nduring the passage of the bill in the House. This tends to confirm my \njudgment that the bill was not intended to affect the OSP/ISP liability \ndebate.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to point out two areas that are \nsusceptible to interpretation mischief. First,\n\n[[Page S12690]]\n\nthe bill amends the term ``financial gain'' as used in the Copyright \nAct to include ``receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of \nvalue, including receipt of other copyrighted works.'' The intent of \nthe change is to hold criminally liable those who do not receive or \nexpect to receive money but who receive tangible value. It would be \ncontrary to the intent of the provision, according to my understanding, \nif ``anything of value'' would be so broadly read as to include \nenhancement of reputation or value remote from the criminal act, such \nas a job promotion.\n  Second, I am concerned about the interplay between criminal liability \nfor ``reproduction'' in the bill and the commonly-held view that the \nloading of a computer program into random access memory [RAM] is a \nreproduction for purposes of the Copyright Act. Because most shrink-\nwrap licenses purport to make the purchaser of computer software a \nlicensee and not an owner of his or her copy of the software, the \nordinary purchaser of software may not be able to take advantage of the \nexemption provided by sec. 117, allowing the ``owner'' of a copy to \nreproduce the work in order to use it in his or her computer.\n  Many shrink-wrap licenses limit the purchaser to making only a single \nbackup copy of his or her software. Thus, under a literal reading of \nthe bill, the ordinary purchaser of computer software who loaded the \nsoftware enough times in the 180-day period to reach the more-than-\n$1,000 threshold may be a criminal. This is, of course, not the intent \nof the bill. Clearly, this kind of copying was not intended to be \ncriminalized.\n  Additionally, Congress has long recognized that it is necessary to \nmake incidental copies of digital works in order to use them on \ncomputers. Programs or data must be transferred from a floppy disk to a \nhard disk or from a hard disk into RAM as a necessary step in their \nuse. Modern operating systems swap data between RAM and hard disk to \nuse the computer memory more efficiently. Given its purpose, it is not \nthe intent of this bill to have the incidental copies made by the user \nof digital work be counted more than once in computing the total retail \nvalue of the infringing reproductions.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, I do not believe this is the perfect \nbill, but it is a good bill that addresses a serious problem that has \nthe potential of very soon undermining copyright in many works, not \njust computer software. I am confident that prosecutors and the courts \nwill make their decisions with the purpose of the bill in mind--the \nelimination of willful, commercial-scale pirating of copyrighted works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America's founders recognized and valued \nthe creativity of this Nation's citizens such that intellectual \nproperty rights are rooted in the Constitution. Article I, section 8, \nclause 8 of the Constitution states that ``The Congress shall have \npower * * * [t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by \nsecuring for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right \nto their respective writings and discoveries.'' The Continental \nCongress proclaimed, ``Nothing is more properly a man's own than the \nfruit of his study.''\n  Protecting intellectual property rights is just as important today as \nit was when America was a fledgling nation.\n  It is for this reason I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nH.R. 2265, the ``No Electronic Theft [NET] Act of 1997.'' I introduced \nthe first legislation on this subject in 1995. The bill was the \n``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995,'' and it stood as the \nonly legislation on this issue in the 104th Congress. I then made some \nchanges to that bill and introduced it this session as the ``Criminal \nCopyright Improvement Act of 1997,'' S. 1044. Senator Kyl is an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 1044 and I thank him for his support.\n  Like the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997, the NET Act of \n1997 would close a significant loophole in our copyright law and \nenhance the Government's ability to bring criminal charges in certain \ncases of willful copyright infringement. By insuring better protection \nof the creative works available online, this bill will also encourage \nthe continued growth of the Internet and our National Information \nInfrastructure. It will encourage the ingenuity of the American people, \nand will send a powerful message to intellectual property pirates and \nthieves that we will not tolerate theft.\n  For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law, a defendant's \nwillful copyright infringement must be ``for purposes of commercial \nadvantage or private financial gain.'' Not-for-profit or noncommercial \ncopyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no \nmatter how egregious the infringement or how great the loss to the \ncopyright holder. This presents an enormous loophole in criminal \nliability for willful infringers who can use digital technology to make \nexact copies of copyrighted software and other digitally encoded works, \nand then use computer networks for quick, inexpensive and mass \ndistribution of pirated, infringing works. The NET Act would close this \nlegal loophole.\n  United States versus LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is \nan example of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In \nthat case, the defendant had set up computer bulletin board systems on \nthe Internet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software \nprograms. This resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders \nof over $1 million over a 6-week period. Since the defendant apparently \ndid not profit from the software piracy, the Government could not \nprosecute him under criminal copyright law and instead charged him with \nwire fraud. The District Court described the student's conduct ``at \nbest * * * as irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-\nindulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values.''\n  Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because \nit viewed copyright law as the exclusive authority for prosecuting \ncriminal copyright infringement. The Court expressly invited Congress \nto revisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, \nstating:\n\n       Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach \n     to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software \n     even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer. \n     One can envision ways that the copyright law could be \n     modified to permit such prosecution. But, ``[i]t is the \n     legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and \n     ordain its punishment.''\n\n  I introduced the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995 on August \n4, 1995 in response to this problem. The NET Act is the result of our \nefforts. It would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful \ncopyright infringements in the following ways: First, it amends the \nterm ``financial gain'' as used in the Copyright Act to include \n``receipt, or expectation of receipt, or anything of value, including \nthe receipt of other copyrighted works.'' This revision would make \nclear that ``financial gain'' includes bartering for, and the trading \nof, pirated software.\n  Second, it amends Section 506(a) of the Copyright Act to provide that \nany person who infringes a copyright willfully by the reproduction or \ndistribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, \nof one or more copies or phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works \nwith a total retail value of more than $1,000, shall be subject to \ncriminal liability.\n  A misdemeanor offense under the bill is defined as an offense in \nwhich an individual reproduces or distributes one or more copies or \nphonorecords of one or more copyrighted works with a total value of \nmore than $1,000.\n  The felony threshold under the bill is defined as an offense in which \nan individual reproduces or distributes 10 or more copies of \nphonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works with a total retail value \nof $2,500 or more.\n  Section (2)(b) of the bill clarifies that for purposes of subsection \n506(a) of the Copyright Act only, ``willful infringement'' requires \nmore than just evidence of making an unauthorized copy of a work. This \nclarification was included to address the concerns expressed by \nlibraries and Internet access to services because the standard of \n``willfulness'' for criminal copyright infringement is not statutorily \ndefined and the court's interpretation have varied somewhat among the \nFederal circuits.\n  This clarification does not change the current interpretation of the \nword ``willful'' as developed by case law and as applied by the \nDepartment of Justice, nor does it change the definition of ``willful'' \nas it is used elsewhere in the Copyright Act.\n\n[[Page S12691]]\n\n  Third, the bill requires that any criminal proceeding brought under \nthe Copyright Act must commence within 5 years from the time the cause \nof action arose. The current limit, as contained in section 507(a) of \nthe Copyright Act, is 3 years. This brings copyright crimes into \nconformance with the statute of limitations for other criminal acts \nunder title 18 of the United States Code.\n  Fourth, the bill would insert new subsections in title 18 of the \nUnited States Code requiring that victims of offenses concerning \nunauthorized fixation and trafficking of live musical performances and \nvictims of offenses concerning trafficking in counterfeit goods or \nservices be given the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement \nto the probation officer preparing the presentence report. The bill \ndirects that the statement identify the victim of the offense and the \nextent and scope of the injury and loss suffered, including the \nestimated economic impact of the offense on that victim.\n  The NET Act reflects the recommendations and hard work of the \nDepartment of Justice and the Copyright Office. Specifically, Scott \nCharney and David Green of the Department of Justice and Marybeth \nPeters, Shira Perlmutter, and Jule Sigall of the Copyright Office \nhelped me on this legislation. The Department of Justice and the \nCopyright Office provided valuable input as far back as 3 years ago, \nwhen I introduced the first legislation on this subject, and they have \nworked with me through the drafting of this year's Senate bill and with \nme and all the interested parties on this year's House version to \nensure that the final product was one that could be widely accepted. In \nfact, just today the Senate received a letter from the Department of \nJustice providing its views on the NET Act and strongly supporting the \nenactment of this legislation.\n  I also want to thank Mr. Hyde, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Coble, Mr. Frank, and \nMr. Goodlatte for their fine work on this matter.\n  By passing this legislation, we send a strong message that we value \nintellectual property, as abstract and arcane as it may be, in the same \nway that we value the real and personal property of our citizens. Just \nas we will not tolerate the theft of software, CD's, books, or movie \ncassettes from a store, so will we not permit the stealing of \nintellectual property over the Internet.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2265, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice dated \nNovember 7, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, This provides the views of the \n     Department of Justice on H.R. 2265, the ``No Electronic Theft \n     (NET) Act,'' which was passed by the House of Representatives \n     on November 4, 1997, and which we understand may shortly be \n     considered in the Senate. We strongly support enactment of \n     this legislation.\n       As introduced, H.R. 2265 built upon, and closely resembled, \n     S. 1044 and its predecessor bill that was introduced in the \n     104th Congress. The Department of Justice testified in \n     support of H.R. 2265 while the bill was being considered by \n     the House Judiciary Committee. We worked extensively with the \n     bill's sponsors to ensure that it would meet the concerns of \n     interested parties, including the Department of Justice, the \n     copyright community, and those non-profit organizations and \n     Internet Service Providers concerned about the possibility \n     that the new legislation might sweep too broadly. The result, \n     in our view, is an excellent bill that protects copyrights in \n     the digital age in a careful and balanced manner. The House-\n     passed bill accomplishes several important goals, including:\n       Permitting the Department to prosecute large-scale illegal \n     reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works where the \n     infringers act without a discernible profit motive, while \n     making clear that small-scale non-commercial copying \n     (copyrighted works with a total retail value of less than \n     $1,000) is not prosecutable under federal law;\n       Clarifying that ``willful'' infringement must consist of \n     evidence of more that the mere intentional reproduction or \n     distribution of copyrighted products;\n       Defining ``financial gain'' to include the ``receipt, or \n     expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the \n     receipt of other copyrighted works,'' to ensure that persons \n     who illegally traffic in copyrighted works by using barter \n     rather than cash are covered by the statute;\n       Clarifying that ``reproduction or distribution'' includes \n     electronic as well as tangible means;\n       Extending the statute of limitations from three to five \n     years, bringing the criminal copyright statute into line with \n     most other criminal statutes;\n       Establishing a recidivist provision that raises penalties \n     for second or subsequent felony copyright offenses;\n       Recognizing victims' rights by allowing the producers of \n     pirated works to provide a victim impact statement to the \n     sentencing court; and\n       Enhancing the deterrent power of the copyright criminal \n     laws by directing the Sentencing Commission to amend the \n     Sentencing guideline for copyright and trademark infringement \n     to allow courts to impose sentence based on the retail value \n     of the good infringed upon, rather than the often lower value \n     of the infringing good.\n       The Department of Justice believes that the differences \n     between S. 1044, as introduced, and H.R. 2265, as passed by \n     the House of Representatives, are not significant. We \n     therefore recommend that the Senate expedite final passage of \n     this important piece of legislation by adopting the House-\n     passed bill before the end of the first session of the 105th \n     Congress.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of \n     additional assistance in connection with this or any other \n     matter. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that \n     there is no objection from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program to the presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am proud to support H.R. 2265, the No \nElectronic Theft [NET] Act which is the companion bill to S. 1044, the \nCriminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997, introduced by Senator Leahy \nand myself.\n  H.R. 2265 passed the House of Representatives earlier this week and \nnow has the opportunity to obtain Senate approval and be sent to the \nPresident before we adjourn for the session. The bill is supported by \nthe Department of Justice, the U.S. Copyright Office, and the Software \nPublishers Association, which is the leading trade association of the \ncomputer software industry, representing over 1,200 companies that \ndevelop and market software for entertainment, business, education, and \nthe Internet.\n  H.R. 2265 will help combat software piracy by closing a major \nloophole in federal law, which was highlighted by the case of United \nStates v. LaMacchia, 871 F.Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994). Under current \nlaw, a showing of financial gain is required to prove criminal \ncopyright infringement. In LaMacchia, the defendant maliciously pirated \nsoftware which resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders \nof over $1 million in just over 6 weeks. Because LaMacchia did not \nprofit from the software piracy, he could not be prosecuted under \ncriminal copyright law.\n  Because much software piracy on the Internet apparently occurs \nwithout the exchange of money, the so-called ``LaMacchia loophole'' \ndiscourages law enforcement from taking action against willful, \ncommercial-scale software pirates out to gain notoriety, not money.\n  In sum, this bill extends criminal infringement of copyright to \ninclude any person--not just those who act for purposes of commercial \nadvantage or private financial gain--who willfully infringe a \ncopyright. Specifically, the bill: (1) expands the definition of \n``financial gain'' to include the expectation of receipt of anything of \nvalue--including the receipt of other copyrighted works; (2) sets \npenalties for willfully infringing a copyright by reproducing or \ndistributing (including electronically), during any 180-day period, one \nor more copies of one or more copyrighted works with a total retail \nvalue of more than $1,000; (3) extends the statute of limitations for \ncriminal copyright infringement from three to five years; (4) punishes \nrecidivists more severely; (5) extends victims' rights with regard to \ncriminal copyright infringement; and (6) directs the Sentencing \nCommission to determine sufficiently stringent guidelines to deter \nthese types of crimes.\n  H.R. 2265 is needed to help protect the interests of the entire \nsoftware industry by protecting against the unauthorized copying and \ndistribution of\n\n[[Page S12692]]\n\ncomputer programs. In 1996, piracy cost the software industry over $2 \nbillion in the United States and over $11 billion around the world.\n  Mr. President, the United States is the world's leader in \nintellectual property. We export billions of dollars of copyrighted \nworks every year. Our creative community is a bulwark of our national \neconomy. By addressing the flaw in our copyright law that LaMacchia has \nbrought to light, H.R. 2265 sends the strong message that we value the \ncontributions of writers, artists, and other creators, and will not \ntolerate the theft of their intellectual endeavors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The bill (H.R. 2265) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12689-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      OTTAWA AND CHIPPEWA JUDGMENT FUNDS DISTRIBUTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Gorton, Hollings and Ford, in approving this \namendment to authorize the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] \nResearch, Engineering, and Development [RE] account for fiscal years \n1998 and 1999. The FAA's RE account is used to finance\n\n[[Page S12694]]\n\nprojects to improve the safety, security, capacity, and efficiency of \nthe U.S. aviation system.\n  FAA research and development activities help to provide the \nadvancements and innovations that are needed to keep the U.S. aviation \nsystem the best in the world. Our nation's ability to have a strong \naviation-related research and development program directly impacts our \nsuccess in the global market and our standard of living.\n  This legislation authorizes the funding needed for ongoing or planned \nFAA RE projects that will provide important benefits for the U.S. \naviation system and its users. The FAA RE program will fund projects \nto determine how limited airport and airspace capacity can meet ever \nincreasing demands, how aviation security can be improved, and how \nflight safety concerns can be addressed.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been particularly concerned about \nensuring that the FAA has an adequate level of funding for security \nresearch and development. The threat of terrorism against the United \nStates has increased and aviation is, and will remain, an attractive \nterrorist target. That is why this legislation provides $54 million for \nsecurity technology research and development. This figure represents \nalmost one-fourth of the total authorized funding level, and is $10 \nmillion above the appropriations level.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hollings, Aviation Subcommittee Chairman \nSenator Gorton, Senator Ford, and I have worked hard with the FAA and \nour colleagues in the House to craft legislation that can provide the \nFAA with the funding it needs for critical research and development \nprojects, while also being mindful of our tight federal budget. I urge \nmy colleagues to approve this legislation by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, when TWA flight 800 exploded over the \ncoast of Long Island on July 17, 1997, 230 people perished. They left \nbehind people who loved and cared about them. They left a void in many \npeople's lives. When a USAirways jet crashed in Charlotte in July 1994, \n37 people died, including many from my State. The pain and suffering \nthose families suffered is heartbreaking.\n  H.R. 1271, the FAA Research, Engineering, and Development \nAuthorization Act of 1997, authorizes more than 4450 million to conduct \nbasic aviation safety research, with one primary goal--to reduce the \nlikelihood that another family will lose a loved one in an aviation \naccident.\n  When we talk about safety, it all begins with two factors--leadership \nand research. The U.S. today is the world's leader in aviation safety. \nHowever, that is not enough. We must maintain that leadership and \ncontinue to pursue the best means to avoid aviation disasters.\n  Over the last several years, we have stressed the need to improve \nsecurity. New machines continue to be tested and improved. This bill \nfurthers that process. We also must remain vigilant about other areas \nto improve safety, like controlled flight into terrain and human \nfactors. All too often an accident is a function of a human error. The \nerror can be the result of technology design or human judgment. \nResearch remains the key to making adjustments so that our families do \nnot have to experience what the families of TWA flight 800 or the \nUSAirways Charlotte flight had to endure.\n  The bill also recognizes that we must work with our colleges and \ntechnical schools to develop programs to meet challenges of the future. \nOur Nation's aircraft maintenance program will be changing. Our air \ntraffic control workforce and maintenance workforce will be changing \nwith the new equipment scheduled to be installed over the next 5 years. \nWe must remain ahead of the technological curve--working with the \nschools will facilitate our preparation for change. The administration \nknows this and has worked with me to address that issue.\n  We worked hard with the administration on this bill, and it is my \nunderstanding that they support the bill. In the area of security, for \nexample, the fiscal year 1998 Transportation Appropriations Act \nprovided $44.225 million. The authorization in H.R. 1271 is more than \n$11 million more, an amount which will give the FAA flexibility to move \nfunds from one account to another, should it be necessary.\n  I understand that the FAA may request additional funding for fiscal \nyear 1999 to further its modernization efforts. In addition, more \nfunding for security may be requested, and we will need to consider \nthose requests, if made.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 2979, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will read the report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2979) to authorize acquisition of certain real \n     property for the Library of Congress, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the legislation before us would authorize \nthe Architect of the Capitol to accept a gift of approximately 41 acres \nof property and buildings in Culpeper, Virginia for use by the Library \nof Congress as a national audiovisual conservation center. The purchase \nprice of this facility is $5.5 million. The private foundation which \nhas offered to purchase this property and donate it for the Library's \nuse has also agreed to provide the Library with an additional $4.5 \nmillion for the renovation of this property, making a total gift of $10 \nmillion. The renovations to the property will be made by the Architect \nof the Capitol, as approved by the appropriate oversight and \nappropriations committees.\n  The Library's film collection is currently stored in several Library \nor government-leased sites. With this gift,\n\n[[Page S12695]]\n\nthe Library intends to consolidate the storage of its audio-visual \ncollection, specifically its acetate film collection. However, the \nfacility at Culpeper cannot currently house the nitrate-based film \ncollection. While I will not object to passage of this legislation, I \nam concerned by both the manner in which the Library presented this \nissue to Congress and by a number of precedent-setting issues this gift \nraises which have not been fully aired.\n  It is my understanding that the Library first identified the Culpeper \nproperty as a potential site for storage of a portion of its film \ncollection several years ago. And yet, this legislation before us today \nwas shared with my office only last week, and was introduced in the \nHouse and Senate over the week-end. While it is not unusual this time \nof year to see legislation flying past the Congress on its way to the \nWhite House for signature, this measure raises a number of concerns \nthat should, and could, have been fully debated by those who ultimately \nwill be responsible to the taxpayer for the cost of its maintenance and \nupkeep in the years to come.\n  First, and most importantly, is the issue of whether the government, \nparticularly the Library, should be in the business of acquiring real \nestate. It is rather ironic that this is being proposed at a time when \nthe leadership in the Congress is calling for privatization of many \nlegislative branch functions and the sale of certain legislative branch \nproperties. It is particularly true of this property which includes \nabout 41 acres, but insufficient buildings and improvements to house \nall of the Library's audiovisual collection. I don't want to assume \nwhat the Library plans to do with all this property, but I got a pretty \ngood idea by reading the study the Library commissioned from Abacus \nTechnology Corporation.\n  The current buildings on the Culpeper property can house only the \nacetate film collection. In order to consolidate the nitrate film \ncollection at the Culpeper site, the Abacus study recommends \nconstructing new buildings to house the nitrate collection. And how \nmuch would such facilities cost? Over $16 million over the next 4 \nyears. But a hefty building and expansion program is not all that is \nplanned for these 41 acres. The Abacus study describes the Library's \nvision with regard to this audiovisual center as offering, subject to \nthe approval of Congress, a cost-effective conservation service for \nother libraries and archives. Whether this will require additional \nbuildings or is included in the Abacus cost estimates already is not \ndisclosed.\n  A second concern that this issue raises is the ultimate cost to the \ntaxpayer of accepting this gift. According to the Abacus study, the \ntotal cost for renovating, maintaining and expanding the Culpeper \nproperty over the 25 year life cycle of the facility is $47 million. \nOther alternatives identified by Abacus and the Library range from \nabout $54 million to $86 million. However, the Abacus study does not \ninclude cost estimates for the Architect of the Capitol for the on-\ngoing maintenance and repair of the 41 acres of grounds and buildings \nthat would now be owned by the government.\n  Thirdly, as currently structured, it is not clear how this property \nand facilities will be managed. By statute, the Architect of the \nCapitol is responsible for only the structural work on buildings and \ngrounds of Library property, including the maintenance and care of the \ngrounds and certain mechanical equipment. Since this site is over 70 \nmiles away from Washington, it may require that the Architect \nphysically locate maintenance personnel there. But the Architect will \nnot manage these 41 acres and buildings--that will now be the \nresponsibility of the Library--hardly a task they have much experience \nwith. Moreover, as my colleagues know, the Library has its own security \nforce. Presumably, this facility will also need to be secure. However, \nin recent years, there have been discussions about the possibility of \ntransferring certain exterior security functions of the Library \nsecurity force to the Capitol Police. I'm not sure I want our Capitol \npolice responsible for taking care of the security of 41 acres in \nCulpeper.\n  I appreciate the pressure the Librarian feels to raise private funds \nto provide core Library functions. However, any gift that the Librarian \nsolicits ultimately becomes the responsibility of the American \ntaxpayers. Before we saddle them with the maintenance, upkeep, and \noverhead of additional federal buildings and prime real estate, there \nshould an opportunity to fully air these issues. Changes I sought in \nthis legislation will do that, even if after the fact.\n  Being from Kentucky, I know better than to look a gift horse in the \nmouth. But being from west Kentucky, which is hog country, I also know \na pig-in-a-poke when I see it. The Library may not be asking the \nAmerican taxpayers to accept a pig-in-a-poke, but with all the \nunanswered questions, this Culpeper property is pretty darn close to \nit. I'll be sticking close to the farm over the next year, and as \nprovided by this legislation, will be looking for answers to these \nquestions before approving improvements and expansions on this gift.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The bill (H.R. 2979) was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12694-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12695-S12696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATIVE TO GERMAN REPARATIONS TO \n                          HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 138, S. Con. \nRes. 39.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 39) expressing the \n     sense of the Congress that the German government should \n     expand and simplify its reparations system, provide \n     reparations to Holocaust survivors in Eastern and Central \n     Europe, and set up a fund to help cover the medical expenses \n     of Holocaust survivors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the German Government has long \nrecognized its moral obligation to assist the survivors of the \nHolocaust. The landmark reparations agreements of the early 1950's \nbetween the West German Government and Jewish groups were predicated on \nthis simple premise. Yet, as years go by, it has become increasingly \napparent that a large number of survivors, particularly those living in \nEastern and Central Europe, were excluded from these agreements and are \nnow being denied assistance on the flimsiest of technical grounds. As a \nresult, in July Senators Graham, Hatch, and Dodd joined me in \nintroducing Senate Concurrent Resolution 39. I am pleased that the \nSenate will take up this important issue today.\n  The need for such legislation was reinforced only last week. On \nNovember 5, Judge Heinz Sonnenberger in Germany upheld just 1 of 22 \nclaims made by a group of Jewish women seeking payment for their work \nas slave laborers at Auschwitz. The other claims were dismissed by the \njudge on the grounds that the women had already received compensation \nunder Germany's Federal Compensation Law. This decision represents the \nGerman Government's intractable attitude toward survivors of Nazi slave \nlabor, however, it also presents a small window of hope for the \nsurvivors of slave labor who until now have been denied compensation by \nthe German Government.\n  The German Government has continually dealt with the survivors of \nNazi persecution in a heartless, bureaucratic manner, basing its \ndecisions on technical questions and eschewing a moral obligation to \naid all survivors regardless of past compensation, current financial \nstatus, or amount of pain suffered. This practice stands in sharp \ncontrast to the generous disability pensions paid by the German \nGovernment to former members of the Waffen-SS and their families. Until\n\n[[Page S12696]]\n\nlast year, when the German Supreme Court ruled that cases of \ncompensation for slave labor could be taken up by the German courts, \nsurvivors of slave labor had been told that they should address their \nclaims to the companies that used slave labor and not the German \nGovernment. Often companies had already paid a lump sum toward \ncompensation and refused to hear further claims, while other companies, \nwhich had never paid claims, refused to pay them altogether. After 50 \nyears of avoidance, it is time for the German Government to take the \nopportunity this ruling provides and address the issue of compensation \nto slave laborers head on.\n  Judge Sonnenberger's ruling is the first time that a German court has \nawarded compensation to a survivor of slave labor to be paid by the \nGerman Government. The possibility that this ruling is a precedent may \nbe a bright spot in this otherwise regrettable decision. Perhaps other \nsurvivors of slave labor, who have never received compensation from the \nGerman Government, will be emboldened by this ruling and bring their \nown cases forward. This progress is tempered by the rejection of the \nother 21 claims. In this regard, Judge Sonnenberger's decision carries \non the German Government's practice of overlooking humanitarian \nconsiderations when judging compensation claims made by the survivors \nof Nazi persecution.\n  In order to encourage a change in the German Government's position, \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 39 urges the German Government to expand \nand simplify its reparations system, to provide reparations to \nsurvivors in Eastern and Central Europe, and to set up a fund to help \ncover the medical expenses of Holocaust survivors. Although half a \ncentury has passed since the end of World War II, it is important to \nremember how many chapters opened by the devastating war remain \nunfinished. I hope this action will help bring the issue of reparations \nfor survivors of Nazi persecution the fore, and encourage the German \nGovernment to make appropriate changes so that the elderly survivors of \nthe Holocaust receive appropriate reparations.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 39) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 39\n\n       Whereas the annihilation of 6,000,000 European Jews during \n     the Holocaust and the murder of millions of others by the \n     Nazi German state constitutes one of the most tragic episodes \n     in the history of man's inhumanity to man;\n       Whereas there are more than 125,000 Holocaust survivors \n     living in the United States and approximately 500,000 living \n     around the world;\n       Whereas aging Holocaust survivors throughout the world are \n     still suffering from permanent injuries suffered at the hands \n     of the Nazis, and many are unable to afford critically needed \n     medical care;\n       Whereas, while the German Government has attempted to \n     address the needs of Holocaust survivors, many are excluded \n     from reparations because of onerous eligibility requirements \n     imposed by the German Government;\n       Whereas the German Government often rejects Holocaust \n     survivors' claims on the grounds that the survivor did not \n     present the claim correctly or in a timely manner, that the \n     survivor cannot demonstrate to the Government's satisfaction \n     that a particular illness or medical condition is the direct \n     consequence of persecution in a Nazi-created ghetto or \n     concentration camp, or that the survivor is not considered \n     sufficiently destitute;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors in the \n     former Soviet Union and other formerly Communist countries in \n     Eastern and Central Europe have never received reparations \n     from Germany and a smaller number has received a token \n     amount;\n       Whereas, after more than 50 years, hundreds of thousands of \n     Holocaust survivors continue to be denied justice and \n     compensation from the German Government;\n       Whereas the German Government pays generous disability \n     pensions to veterans of the Nazi armed forces, including non-\n     German veterans of the Waffen-SS;\n       Whereas in 1996 the German Government paid $7,700,000,000 \n     in such pensions to 1,100,000 veterans, including 3,000 \n     veterans and their dependents now living in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas such pensions are a veteran's benefit provided over \n     and above the full health coverage that all German citizens, \n     including veterans of the Waffen-SS, receive from their \n     government; and\n       Whereas it is abhorrent that Holocaust survivors should \n     live out their remaining years in conditions worse than those \n     enjoyed by the surviving former Nazis who persecuted them: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the German Government should expand and simplify its \n     system of reparations so that all Holocaust survivors can \n     receive reparations, regardless of their nationality, length \n     or place of internment, or current financial situation;\n       (2) the German Government should provide reparations to \n     Holocaust survivors in the former Soviet Union and other \n     former Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe;\n       (3) the German Government should fulfill its \n     responsibilities to victims of the Holocaust and immediately \n     set up a comprehensive medical fund to cover the medical \n     expenses of all Holocaust survivors worldwide; and\n       (4) the German Government should help restore the dignity \n     of Holocaust survivors by paying them sufficient reparations \n     to ensure that no Holocaust survivor be forced by poverty to \n     live in conditions worse than those generally enjoyed by the \n     surviving former Nazis who persecuted them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12695-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12696-S12697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR A CENTER FOR HISTORICALLY BLACK HERITAGE WITHIN FLORIDA \n                             A UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1559, introduced earlier today by \nSenators Mack and Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1559) to provide for the design, construction, \n     furnishing, and equipping of a Center for Historically Black \n     Heritage within Florida A University.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \nfriend Senator Mack to introduce legislation authorizing the expansion \nof the Black Archives Research Center and Museum at the Florida \nAgricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida.\n  This legislation is significant not only to the Florida A but to \nnational heritage. Since 1977, the Black Archives at FAMU has been \ncharged with collecting all materials reflecting the African-American \npresence and participation regionally, nationally and internationally.\n  The Black Archives Research Center and Museum is the largest \nrepository of African-American history in the Southeast.\n  In 1997, Time magazine and Princeton Review chose Florida A \nUniversity as the college of the year. This recognition is well \ndeserved. Since 1992, Florida A University has vied with Harvard in \nenrolling the most National Achievement Scholars. (Florida A leading \nin 1992 and 1995 and Harvard in 1993 and 1994.)\n  The Black Archives includes over 500,000 artifacts, manuscripts, art \nworks and oral history tapes pre-dating the Civil War, through the \nearly days of the civil rights movement to today.\n  Unfortunately, this fine center finds itself in disrepair.\n  The bill Senator Mack and I introduce today would authorize the \ndesign, and construction of a facility to better house these priceless \ndocuments for future generations.\n  Our bill would stipulate that the State of Florida match the Federal \ninvestment dollar for dollar, making it truly a Federal-State \npartnership.\n  Specifically, our bill would make the Black Archives Research Center \nand Museum eligible for up to $3.8 million in Federal funding beginning \nin 1998 and any succeeding years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that material relating to the Black Archives \nResearch Center and Museum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12697]]\n\n\n       The BARCM is located in the oldest building on the campus \n     of Florida A University. The building was completed in \n     1907, with the assistance of a $10,000 grant from Andrew \n     Carnegie. This building is still standing and has been placed \n     on the National Register of Historic Places.\n       The purpose of the Black Archives was set forth in 1971 in \n     an act of the Florida legislature that mandated the \n     establishment of a repository to ``serve the state by \n     collecting and preserving source materials on or about Black \n     Americans from the earliest beginnings to the present.''\n       The BARCM was formally dedicated and officially opened in \n     1977. Part of its scholarly and cultural responsibility is \n     the collection of any materials reflecting the Black presence \n     and participation in local, regional, national and \n     international history. The BARCM has the largest repository \n     of African American history and artifacts in the southeast \n     including over 500,000 artifacts, manuscripts, art work, and \n     oral history tapes, as well as meeting and research rooms and \n     a mobile touring museum.\n       The Black Archives Research Center and Museum (BARCM) is \n     presently 3000 square feet. It is planned that the interior \n     of the present building be restored to its original \n     appearance. True to the Carnegie-style architectural design, \n     the building can easily be divided into four wings; two on \n     the first floor and two on the second floor. The building \n     which was originally the campus library and post office, \n     would be used solely as museum space and would house \n     permanent collections as well as traveling or touring \n     exhibits. As such, there would only be a need for one staff \n     person on site, a tour guide or docent. There is also \n     potential for housing a museum store and gift shop at this \n     location. This enterprise could possibly generate revenues \n     toward the ongoing support and maintenance of the building. \n     The basement of the Carnegie building would be used for an \n     educational ``Underground Railroad'' for grades K-12.\n       With proper funding, the Carnegie building would be \n     ``connected'' (via catwalk or breezeway) to the larger 33,000 \n     square foot space that is proposed to be built directly \n     behind it. The larger 33,000 square foot space would be used \n     as a research library, an archives, and as much-needed \n     storage space. In addition, work space and preservation \n     laboratory would be housed on the sub-level. While the \n     Carnegie building would be used for major exhibitions and \n     educational programs, the larger and newer space would be \n     designated almost solely for serious study and analysis of \n     the various collections. Tours would be prohibited in the \n     larger space.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements related to the bill appear \nat this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1559) was deemed read the third time, and passed, as \nfollows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Oceans Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.\n\n        (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Covering more than two-thirds of the Earth's surface, \n     the oceans and Great Lakes play a critical role in the global \n     water cycle and in regulating climate, sustain a large part \n     of Earth's biodiversity, provide an important source of food \n     and a wealth of other natural products, act as a frontier to \n     scientific exploration, are critical to national security, \n     and provide a vital means of transportation. The coasts, \n     transition between land and open ocean, are regions of \n     remarkably high biological productivity, contribute more than \n     30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, and are of \n     considerable importance for recreation, waste disposal, and \n     mineral exploration.\n        (2) Ocean and coastal resources are susceptible to change \n     as a direct and indirect result of human activities, and such \n     changes can significantly impact the ability of the oceans \n     and Great Lakes to provide the benefits upon which the Nation \n     depends. Changes in ocean and coastal processes could affect \n     global climate patterns, marine productivity and \n     biodiversity, environmental quality, national security, \n     economic competitiveness, availability of energy, \n     vulnerability to natural hazards, and transportation safety \n     and efficiency.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are not infinite, and human \n     pressure on them is increasing. One half of the Nation's \n     population lives within 50 miles of the coast, ocean and \n     coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are now \n     threatened with depletion, and if population trends continue \n     as expected, pressure on and conflicting demands for ocean \n     and coastal resources will increase further as will \n     vulnerability to coastal hazards.\n       (4) Marine technologies hold tremendous promise for \n     expanding the range and increasing the utility of products \n     from the oceans and Great Lakes, improving the stewardship of \n     ocean and coastal resources, and contributing to business and \n     manufacturing innovations and the creation of new jobs.\n       (5) Marine research has uncovered the link between oceanic \n     and atmospheric processes and improved understanding of world \n     climate patterns and forecasts. Important new advances, \n     including availability of military technology, have made \n     feasible the exploration of large areas of the ocean which \n     were inaccessible several years ago. In designating 1998 as \n     ``The Year of the Ocean'', the United Nations highlights the \n     value of increasing our knowledge of the oceans.\n       (6) It has been 30 years since the Commission on Marine \n     Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the Stratton \n     Commission) conducted a comprehensive examination of ocean \n     and coastal activities that led to enactment of major \n     legislation and the establishment of key oceanic and \n     atmospheric institutions.\n       (7) A review of existing activities is essential to respond \n     to the changes that have occurred over the past three decades \n     and to develop an effective new policy for the twenty-first \n     century to conserve and use sustainable ocean and coastal \n     resources, protect the marine environment, explore ocean \n     frontiers, protect human safety, and create marine \n     technologies and economic opportunities.\n       (8) While significant Federal ocean and coastal programs \n     are underway, those programs would benefit from a coherent \n     national ocean and coastal policy that reflects the need for \n     cost-effective allocation of fiscal resources, improved \n     interagency coordination, and strengthened partnerships with \n     State, private, and international entities engaged in ocean \n     and coastal activities.\n       (b) Purpose and Objectives.--The purpose of this Act is to \n     develop and maintain a coordinated, comprehensive, and long-\n     range national policy with respect to ocean and coastal \n     activities that will assist the Nation in meeting the \n     following objectives:\n       (1) The protection of life and property against natural and \n     manmade hazards.\n       (2) Responsible stewardship, including use, of fishery \n     resources and other ocean and coastal resources.\n       (3) The protection of the marine environment and prevention \n     of marine pollution.\n       (4) The enhancement of marine-related commerce, \n     transportation, and national security, and the resolution of \n     conflicts among users of the marine environment.\n       (5) The expansion of human knowledge of the marine \n     environment including the role of\n\n[[Page S12698]]\n\n     the oceans in climate and global environmental change and the \n     advancement of education and training in fields related to \n     ocean and coastal activities.\n       (6) The continued investment in and development and \n     improvement of the capabilities, performance, use, and \n     efficiency of technologies for use in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (7) Close cooperation among all government agencies and \n     departments to ensure--\n       (A) coherent regulation of ocean and coastal activities;\n       (B) availability and appropriate allocation of Federal \n     funding, personnel, facilities, and equipment for such \n     activities; and\n       (C) cost-effective and efficient operation of Federal \n     departments, agencies, and programs involved in ocean and \n     coastal activities.\n       (8) The preservation of the role of the United States as a \n     leader in ocean and coastal activities, and, when it is in \n     the national interest, the cooperation by the United States \n     with other nations and international organizations in ocean \n     and coastal activities.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) The term ``Commission'' means the Commission on Ocean \n     Policy.\n       (2) The term ``Council'' means the National Ocean Council.\n       (3) The term ``marine research'' means scientific \n     exploration, including basic science, engineering, mapping, \n     surveying, monitoring, assessment, and information \n     management, of the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes--\n       (A) to describe and advance understanding of--\n       (i) the role of the oceans, coasts and Great Lakes in \n     weather and climate, natural hazards, and the processes that \n     regulate the marine environment; and\n       (ii) the manner in which such role, processes, and \n     environment are affected by human actions;\n       (B) for the conservation, management and sustainable use of \n     living and nonliving resources; and\n       (C) to develop and implement new technologies related to \n     sustainable use of the marine environment.\n       (4) The term ``marine environment'' includes--\n       (A) the oceans, including coastal and offshore waters and \n     the adjacent shore lands;\n       (B) the continental shelf;\n       (C) the Great Lakes; and\n       (D) the ocean and coastal resources thereof.\n       (5) The term ``ocean and coastal activities'' includes \n     activities related to marine research, fisheries and other \n     ocean and coastal resource stewardship and use, marine \n     aquaculture, energy and mineral resource extraction, national \n     security, marine transportation, recreation and tourism, \n     waste management, pollution mitigation and prevention, and \n     natural hazard reduction.\n       (6) The term ``ocean and coastal resource'' means, with \n     respect to the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes, any living or \n     non-living natural resource (including all forms of animal \n     and plant life found in the marine environment, habitat, \n     biodiversity, water quality, minerals, oil, and gas) and any \n     significant historic, cultural or aesthetic resource.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL OCEAN AND COASTAL POLICY.\n\n       (a) Executive Responsibilities.--The President, with the \n     assistance of the Council and the advice of the Commission, \n     shall--\n       (1) develop and maintain a coordinated, comprehensive, and \n     long-range national policy with respect to ocean and coastal \n     activities; and\n       (2) with regard to Federal agencies and departments--\n       (A) review significant ocean and coastal activities, \n     including plans, priorities, accomplishments, and \n     infrastructure requirements;\n       (B) plan and implement an integrated and cost-effective \n     program of ocean and coastal activities including, but not \n     limited to, marine research, stewardship of ocean and coastal \n     resources, protection of the marine environment, maritime \n     transportation safety and efficiency, the marine aspects of \n     national security, marine recreation and tourism, and marine \n     aspects of weather, climate, and natural hazards;\n       (C) designate responsibility for funding and conducting \n     ocean and coastal activities; and\n       (D) ensure cooperation and resolve differences arising from \n     laws and regulations applicable to ocean and coastal \n     activities which result in conflicts among participants in \n     such activities.\n       (b) Cooperation and Consultation.--In carrying out \n     responsibilities under this Act, the President and the \n     Council may use such staff, interagency, and advisory \n     arrangements as they find necessary and appropriate and shall \n     consult with non-Federal organizations and individuals \n     involved in ocean and coastal activities.\n\n     SEC. 5. NATIONAL OCEAN COUNCIL.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The President shall establish a \n     National Ocean Council which shall consist of--\n       (1) the Secretary of Commerce, who shall be Chairman of the \n     Council;\n       (2) the Secretary of the Navy;\n       (3) the Secretary of State;\n       (4) the Secretary of Transportation;\n       (5) the Secretary of the Interior;\n       (6) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency;\n       (7) the Director of the National Science Foundation;\n       (8) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology \n     Policy;\n       (9) the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality;\n       (10) the Chairman of the National Economic Council;\n       (11) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; \n     and\n       (12) such other Federal officers and officials as the \n     President considers appropriate.\n       (b) Administration.--\n       (1) The President or the Chairman of the Council may from \n     time to time designate one of the members of the Council to \n     preside over meetings of the Council during the absence or \n     unavailability of such Chairman.\n       (2) Each member of the Council may designate an officer of \n     his or her agency or department appointed with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate to serve on the Council as an alternate \n     in the event of the unavoidable absence of such member.\n       (3) An executive secretary shall be appointed by the \n     Chairman of the Council, with the approval of the Council. \n     The executive secretary shall be a permanent employee of one \n     of the agencies or departments represented on the Council and \n     shall remain in the employ of such agency or department.\n       (4) For the purpose of carrying out the functions of the \n     Council, each Federal agency or department represented on the \n     Council shall furnish necessary assistance to the Council. \n     Such assistance may include--\n       (A) detailing employees to the Council to perform such \n     functions, consistent with the purposes of this section, as \n     the Chairman of the Council may assign to them; and\n       (B) undertaking, upon request of the Chairman of the \n     Council, such special studies for the Council as are \n     necessary to carry out its functions.\n       (5) The Chairman of the Council shall have the authority to \n     make personnel decisions regarding any employees detailed to \n     the Council.\n       (c) Functions.--The Council shall--\n       (1) serve as the forum for developing an ocean and coastal \n     policy and program, taking into consideration the Commission \n     report, and for overseeing implementation of such policy and \n     program;\n       (2) improve coordination and cooperation, and eliminate \n     duplication, among Federal agencies and departments with \n     respect to ocean and coastal activities;\n       (3) work with academic, State, industry, public interest, \n     and other groups involved in ocean and coastal activities to \n     provide for periodic review of the Nation's ocean and coastal \n     policy;\n       (4) cooperate with the Secretary of State in--\n       (A) providing representation at international meetings and \n     conferences on ocean and coastal activities in which the \n     United States participates; and\n       (B) coordinating the Federal activities of the United \n     States with programs of other nations; and\n       (5) report at least biennially on Federal ocean and coastal \n     programs, priorities, and accomplishments and provide \n     budgetary advice as specified in section 7.\n\n     SEC. 6.

App.) does \n     not apply to the Commission.\n       (g) Cooperation With Other Agencies.--\n       (1) The Commission is authorized to secure directly from \n     any Federal agency or department any information it deems \n     necessary to carry out its functions under this Act. Each \n     such agency or department is authorized to cooperate with the \n     Commission and, to the extent permitted by law, to furnish \n     such information to the Commission, upon the request of the \n     Chairman of the Commission.\n       (2) The Commission may use the United States mails in the \n     same manner and under the same conditions as other \n     departments and agencies of the United States.\n       (3) The General Services Administration shall provide to \n     the Commission on a reimbursable basis the administrative \n     support services that the Commission may request.\n       (4) The Commission may enter into contracts with Federal \n     and State agencies, private firms, institutions, and \n     individuals to assist the Commission in carrying out its \n     duties. The Commission may purchase and contract without \n     regard to sections 303 of the Federal Property and \n     Administration Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253), section \n     18 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. \n     416), and section 8 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     637), pertaining to competition and publication requirements, \n     and may arrange for printing without regard to the provisions \n     of title 44, United States Code. The contracting authority of \n     the Commission under this Act is effective only to the extent \n     that appropriations are available for contracting purposes.\n       (h) Report.--The Commission shall submit to the President, \n     via the Council, and to the Congress not later than 18 months \n     after the establishment of the Commission, a final report of \n     its findings and recommendations. The Commission shall cease \n     to exist 30 days after it has submitted its final report.\n       (i) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to support the activities of the \n     Commission a total of $6,000,000 for fiscal years 1998 and \n     1999.

REPORT AND BUDGET COORDINATION.\n\n       (a) Biennial Report.--Beginning in January, 1999, the \n     President, through the Council, shall transmit to the \n     Congress biennially a report, which shall include--\n\n[[Page S12700]]\n\n       (1) a comprehensive description of the ocean and coastal \n     activities and related accomplishments of all agencies and \n     departments of the United States during the preceding two \n     fiscal years; and\n       (2) an evaluation of such activities and accomplishments in \n     terms of the purpose and objectives of this Act. Reports made \n     under this section shall contain such recommendations for \n     legislation as the President may consider necessary or \n     desirable.\n       (b) Budget Coordination.--\n       (1) Each year the Council shall provide general guidance to \n     each Federal agency or department involved in ocean or \n     coastal activities with respect to the preparation of \n     requests for appropriations.\n       (2) Working in conjunction with the Council, each agency or \n     department involved in such activities shall include with its \n     annual request for appropriations a report which--\n       (A) identifies significant elements of the proposed agency \n     or department budget relating to ocean and coastal \n     activities; and\n       (B) specifies how each such element contributes to the \n     implementation of a national ocean and coastal policy.\n       (3) Each agency or department that submits a report under \n     paragraph (1) shall submit such report simultaneously to the \n     Council.\n       (4) The President shall, in a timely fashion, provide the \n     Council with an opportunity to review and comment on the \n     budget estimate of each such agency or department.\n       (5) The President shall identify in each annual budget \n     submitted to the Congress under section 1105 of title 31, \n     United States Code, those elements of each agency or \n     department budget that contribute to the implementation of a \n     national ocean and coastal policy.\n\n     SEC. 8. REPEAL OF 1966 STATUTE.\n\n       The Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of \n     1966 (33 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) is repealed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1639\n\n               (Purpose: To modify the bill as reported)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Ms. Snowe and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Ms. Snowe and \n     Mr. Hollings, proposes an amendment numbered 1639.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1213, the \nOceans Act of 1997 and to thank the bill's principal sponsors for \naddressing my concerns. This legislation has broad, bipartisan support \nand as the senior Senator from the Ocean State, I am glad the United \nStates Senate will be on the record on ocean and coastal policy as we \nenter 1998, which the United Nation has designated as the ``Year of the \nOcean.''\n  The Oceans Act of 1997 is a significant bill. Its 1966 predecessor, \nthe Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act, was one of the \nseminal developments in environmental law. The act created the \nCommission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources, better known \nas the Stratton Commission. The Stratton Commission's report, ``Our \nNation and the Sea'' was delivered in 1969 and, among its many \nimportant recommendations, led directly to the creation of National \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970.\n  I would note that two distinguished Rhode Islanders played leading \nroles in the Stratton Commission. University of Rhode Island Professor \nEmeritus John A. Knauss, then the Dean of the University of Rhode \nIsland's Graduate School of Oceanography, was a Commission member and \nchaired the panel on Environmental Monitoring and on Management and \nDevelopment of the Coastal Zone. Professor Emeritus Lewis Alexander of \nthe University of Rhode Island, who has had a distinguished career in \ngovernment and academia, was the Commission's Deputy Director. I expect \nthat the Rhode Islanders will play key roles in the new Stratton \nCommission.\n  The value of our oceans and coastal areas cannot be underestimated. \nMore than half of the United States population lives in or near a \ncoastal area. The commercial fishing industry alone, which depends on \nthese areas, contributes $111 billion dollars per year to the national \neconomy. Moreover, oceans are the lifeblood of the world. The health of \nour marine resources is intertwined with that of ecosystems throughout \nthe world.\n  The purpose of the bill before us is to develop and maintain a \ncomprehensive national policy for our oceans and coastal areas. A \nnational ocean policy includes a broad range of issues from commerce, \nenvironmental protection, scientific research, to national security. To \nthat end, the bill establishes a 16-member National Ocean Commission, \nwhich will be assisted by an interagency National Ocean Council, in \ndeveloping and making recommendations to Congress for a national oceans \npolicy.\n  As originally reported by the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTechnology, the creation of the National Ocean Council, raised two \nconcerns. First, how would the National Ocean Council affect the \nexecution of existing environmental laws? Second, is it timely now to \ncreate a permanent Council prior to the report of the independent \nNational Ocean Commission created in the bill?\n  The manager's amendment that is before us to day answers both of \nthese questions. Any possible ambiguity regarding the National Ocean \nCouncil's role is resolved. Existing responsibilities under federal law \nare unaffected.\n  I was concerned creation of a permanent Council now would unduly \nconstrain the Commission's recommendations. The manager's amendment \nmakes it clear, however, that the National Ocean Council's function is \nto assist the independent National Ocean Commission in the preparation \nof its report. After the Commission completes its report, the Council \nwill take the Commission report into account in developing an \nimplementation plan for a national ocean and coastal policy. the \nNational Ocean Council will also cease to exist one year after the \nCommission submits its report.\n  Before closing, I want to commend Senators Hollings for his \npersistence with respect to oceans and coastal policy. I also want to \nthank him, as well as Senators Snowe and McCain, for addressing my \nconcerns in the manager's amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate passage of \nS. 1213, the Oceans Act of 1997. The bill calls for an action plan for \nthe twenty-first century to explore, protect, and make better use of \nour oceans and coasts. Its passage is, quite simply, the most important \nstep we can take today to ensure the future of our oceans and coasts.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support, in particular, the \nleadership of the Commerce Committee, Senators McCain and Snowe, for \ntheir cosponsorship and their efforts over the last several weeks to \nbring this bill to the floor. Following in the Commerce Committee \ntradition with respect to ocean issues, this has been a bipartisan \nprocess. I also thank the other cosponsors of the legislation, Senators \nStevens, Kerry, Breaux, Inouye, Kennedy, Boxer, Biden, Lautenberg, \nAkaka, Murkowski, Thurmond, and Murray for their continued support. \nFinally, I want to express my appreciation to the numerous academic, \nenvironmental, and industry groups who agree that the time has come for \nthis bill.\n  The legislation that is before the Senate today is a substitute by \nSenator Snowe and myself, that reflects the comments received from the \nadministration and concerns expressed by Senator Chafee and others. The \nessential elements of the bill remain the same as the committee-\nreported version and would establish two new entities. First is a 16-\nmember Commission on Ocean Policy (Commission) to provide \nrecommendations for a national ocean and coastal policy. Second is the \nNational Ocean Council (Council), a high-level Federal interagency \nworking group to advise the President and the Commission, assist in \npolicy development and implementation, and coordinate Federal programs \nrelating to ocean and coastal activities.\n  The changes made by the Snowe-Hollings substitute focus primarily on \naddressing concerns expressed regarding the establishment of the \nCouncil. Over the past two weeks, the National Security Council and the \nDepartment of Commerce have worked under Secretary Daley's able \nleadership to pull together the views of the numerous Federal entities \ninvolved in ocean and coastal activities. The results of that effort \nare reflected in the amendment,\n\n[[Page S12701]]\n\nand I am including a letter from Secretary Daley expressing the \nadministration's support for S. 1213 following my statement. At Senator \nChafee's request, we also have agreed to sunset the Council one year \nafter the Commission completes its report. As we have discussed with \nboth the administration and Senator Chafee, the purpose of the Council \nis to ensure coordinated input by Federal agencies and departments in \nthe development and implementation of a national ocean and coastal \npolicy. The Council is intended to provide an important forum for \nadministration ocean policy discussions, not to supersede other ongoing \ncoordination mechanisms like the interagency working group on \ninternational ocean policy, nor to interfere with ongoing Federal \nactivities under existing law. The changes made by the substitute \nshould clarify that intent, and if, based on experience and the \nCommission recommendations, the Council proves to be an effective long-\nterm mechanism for coordinating Federal ocean activities, it could be \nextended either administratively or legislatively.\n\n  In 1966, Congress enacted the Marine Resources and Engineering \nDevelopment Act (1966 Act). This bill would update and replace that \nlegislation. The 1966 Act established the Stratton Commission whose \nreport, ``Our Nation and the Sea,'' defined national objectives and \nprograms with respect to the oceans and in conjunction with the 1966 \nAct laid the foundation for U.S. ocean and coastal policy and programs, \nguiding their development for three decades.\n  While the Stratton Commission displayed broad vision, the world has \nchanged in numerous ways since 1966. The U.S. legal and bureaucratic \nframework related to the oceans has grown enormously in the past 30 \nyears. In 1966, there was no NOAA, no Environmental Protection Agency, \nand no laws like the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, the \nMarine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research, and \nSanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act, or the Oil Pollution Act. Today people who work and \nlive on the water face a patchwork of confusing and sometimes \ncontradictory federal and state regulations. Fishermen tell me they \nneed a law degree to go fishing. This bill will allow us to reduce \nconflicts while maintaining environmental and health safeguards.\n  Oceans and coasts face pressures today that the authors of the 1966 \nAct could not have foreseen. Today, over 50 percent of the U.S. \npopulation lives in coastal areas which account for less than 10 \npercent of our land area. By the year 2010, 127 million people, an \nestimated 60 percent of Americans, will live along the coast. Greater \nunderstanding of ocean and coastal ecosystems and improved management \nare essential to maintain healthy coasts and to prepare for and protect \ncommunities from natural hazards like hurricanes.\n  We need to do a better job of managing and using marine resources as \ndemonstrated by fish kills, oil spills, the invasion of zebra mussels, \nand the death of thousands of marine animals from marine plastic \ndebris. We have fallen short in defending our shores and waters. In \nrecent years, New England has struggled with the collapse of their \ntraditional cod, haddock, and flounder. In other regions, overfished \nstocks include sharks, swordfish, bluefin tuna, salmon, red snapper, \ngrouper, and weakfish. Restoring fisheries could add an estimated $2.9 \nbillion to the economy each year. However, we are allowing about 20,000 \nacres of coastal wetlands, important fish habitat, to disappear each \nyear. Louisiana alone has lost half a million acres of wetlands since \nthe mid 1950's.\n\n  Environmental threats to the oceans are growing increasingly complex. \nThis past summer, local newspapers reported daily on Pfiesteria, the \ntiny killer cell wreaking havoc in the Chesapeake Bay and North \nCarolina. Thousands of fish were killed--literally eaten alive by this \ntoxic organism--and some fishermen, swimmers, boaters, and scientists \nexposed to the cell experienced memory loss, skin lesions, and other \ntroubling symptoms. Scientists suspect everything from inadequate city \nsewage plants to farm manure and fertilizer runoff. The technical, \nlegal, and management tools to address Pfiesteria may exist \ncollectively within a variety of federal and state agencies. However, \nwe currently lack a structured and effective means to bring this \nexpertise to bear on the problem.\n  Another challenge is El Nino, the cyclical warming of ocean waters \noff the western coast of South America. The warming results in \nsignificant shifts in weather patterns, including rainfall and \ntemperatures in the United States and elsewhere. Experts estimate that \nan additional 150 Americans die in storms and flooding in El Nino \nyears. While El Nino is a natural phenomenon, human effects on the \noceans and atmosphere may increase its magnitude and frequency. \nAdvanced forecasts could reduce by up to $1 billion the agricultural, \neconomic, and social impacts resulting from El Nino. In addition, \naction to reduce global warming and other changes to the oceans and \natmosphere may reduce the severity of future El Nino events.\n  We have an opportunity to take economic and scientific advantage of \nrecent technological advances related to the oceans. Today, we still \nhave explored only a tiny fraction of the sea, but with the use of new \ntechnologies what we have found is truly incredible. For example, \nhydrothermal vents, hot water geysers on the deep ocean floor, were \ndiscovered just 20 years ago by oceanographers trying to understand the \nformation of the earth's crust. Now this discovery has led to the \nidentification of nearly 300 new types of marine animals with untold \npharmaceutical and biomedical potential.\n  A re-examination of national policies is also essential to maintain \nU.S. leadership on international ocean issues. On November 16, 1994, \nthe U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea entered into force for most \ncountries of the world. Although the United States has accepted most \nprovisions of the treaty as customary international law and 120 other \nnations are party, U.S. ratification remains in question. At issue is \nwhether changes made to the treaty in 1994 adequately correct the \nseabed mining provisions that the United States has opposed for twelve \nyears.\n  The last 31 years have brought great changes to our oceans and coast. \nOur nation needs to reexamine our policies and programs so that we can \ncontinue to explore, protect, and sustainably use ocean resources now \nand throughout the twenty-first century. The Oceans Act of 1997 will \nguide us through that process with the vision it demands. I urge the \nSenate to pass S. 1213.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter dated November 9, 1997 from the \nSecretary of Commerce be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    The Secretary of Commerce,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on the Oceans Act of 1997 (S. \n     1213) as reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science and Transportation. As you prepare to bring the bill \n     to the Senate floor, your consideration of the \n     Administration's views would be appreciated.\n       The Committee has developed a bill that supports and \n     furthers the Administration's ocean policy goals. The \n     Administration has in place robust interagency mechanisms for \n     coordinating ocean policy issues. We believe that the bill, \n     as modified by the Manager's Amendment that was recently \n     provided to us, would be consistent with, and assist in \n     achieving, the Administration's domestic ocean policy \n     objectives. Accordingly, the Administration supports Senate \n     passage of S. 1213, as modified by the Manager's Amendment.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the submission of this letter \n     to the Congress from the standpoint of the program of the \n     President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William M. Daley.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, that the bill be considered read the third \ntime, and passed, as amended, and that any statements relating to the \nbill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1639) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1213 ) was considered read the third time, and passed, \nas amended, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12702]]\n\n                                S. 1213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Oceans Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.\n\n        (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Covering more than two-thirds of the Earth's surface, \n     the oceans and Great Lakes play a critical role in the global \n     water cycle and in regulating climate, sustain a large part \n     of Earth's biodiversity, provide an important source of food \n     and a wealth of other natural products, act as a frontier to \n     scientific exploration, are critical to national security, \n     and provide a vital means of transportation. The coasts, \n     transition between land and open ocean, are regions of \n     remarkably high biological productivity, contribute more than \n     30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, and are of \n     considerable importance for recreation, waste disposal, and \n     mineral exploration.\n        (2) Ocean and coastal resources are susceptible to change \n     as a direct and indirect result of human activities, and such \n     changes can significantly impact the ability of the oceans \n     and Great Lakes to provide the benefits upon which the Nation \n     depends. Changes in ocean and coastal processes could affect \n     global climate patterns, marine productivity and \n     biodiversity, environmental quality, national security, \n     economic competitiveness, availability of energy, \n     vulnerability to natural hazards, and transportation safety \n     and efficiency.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are not infinite, and human \n     pressure on them is increasing. One half of the Nation's \n     population lives within 50 miles of the coast, ocean and \n     coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are now \n     threatened with depletion, and if population trends continue \n     as expected, pressure on and conflicting demands for ocean \n     and coastal resources will increase further as will \n     vulnerability to coastal hazards.\n       (4) Marine transportation is key to United States \n     participation in the global economy and to the wide range of \n     activities carried out in ocean and coastal regions. Inland \n     waterway and ports are the link between marine activities in \n     ocean and coastal regions and the supporting transportation \n     infrastructure ashore. International trade is expected to \n     triple by 2020. The increase has the potential to outgrow--\n       (A) the capabilities of the marine transportation system to \n     ensure safety; and\n       (B) the existing capacity of ports and waterways.\n       (5) Marine technologies hold tremendous promise for \n     expanding the range and increasing the utility of products \n     from the oceans and Great Lakes, improving the stewardship of \n     ocean and coastal resources, and contributing to business and \n     manufacturing innovations and the creation of new jobs.\n       (6) Research has uncovered the link between oceanic and \n     atmospheric processes and improved understanding of world \n     climate patterns and forecasts. Important new advances, \n     including availability of military technology, have made \n     feasible the exploration of large areas of the ocean which \n     were inaccessible several years ago. In designating 1998 as \n     ``The Year of the Ocean'', the United Nations highlights the \n     value of increasing our knowledge of the oceans.\n       (7) It has been 30 years since the Commission on Marine \n     Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the Stratton \n     Commission) conducted a comprehensive examination of ocean \n     and coastal activities that led to enactment of major \n     legislation and the establishment of key oceanic and \n     atmospheric institutions.\n       (8) A review of existing activities is essential to respond \n     to the changes that have occurred over the past three decades \n     and to develop an effective new policy for the twenty-first \n     century to conserve and use, in a sustainable manner, ocean \n     and coastal resources, protect the marine environment, \n     explore ocean frontiers, protect human safety, and create \n     marine technologies and economic opportunities.\n       (9) Changes in United States laws and policies since the \n     Stratton Commission, such as the enactment of the Coastal \n     Zone Management Act, have increased the role of the States in \n     the management of ocean and coastal resources.\n       (10) While significant Federal and State ocean and coastal \n     programs are underway, those Federal programs would benefit \n     from a coherent national ocean and coastal policy that \n     reflects the need for cost-effective allocation of fiscal \n     resources, improved interagency coordination, and \n     strengthened partnerships with State, private, and \n     international entities engaged in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (b) Purpose and Objectives.--The purpose of this Act is to \n     develop and maintain, consistent with the obligations of the \n     United States under international law, a coordinated, \n     comprehensive, and long-range national policy with respect to \n     ocean and coastal activities that will assist the Nation in \n     meeting the following objectives:\n       (1) The protection of life and property against natural and \n     manmade hazards.\n       (2) Responsible stewardship, including use, of fishery \n     resources and other ocean and coastal resources.\n       (3) The protection of the marine environment and prevention \n     of marine pollution.\n       (4) The enhancement of marine-related commerce and \n     transportation, the resolution of conflicts among users of \n     the marine environment, and the engagement of the private \n     sector in innovative approaches for sustainable use of marine \n     resources.\n       (5) The expansion of human knowledge of the marine \n     environment including the role of the oceans in climate and \n     global environmental change and the advancement of education \n     and training in fields related to ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (6) The continued investment in and development and \n     improvement of the capabilities, performance, use, and \n     efficiency of technologies for use in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (7) Close cooperation among all government agencies and \n     departments to ensure--\n       (A) coherent regulation of ocean and coastal activities;\n       (B) availability and appropriate allocation of Federal \n     funding, personnel, facilities, and equipment for such \n     activities; and\n       (C) cost-effective and efficient operation of Federal \n     departments, agencies, and programs involved in ocean and \n     coastal activities.\n       (8) The enhancement of partnerships with State and local \n     governments with respect to oceans and coastal activities, \n     including the management of ocean and coastal resources and \n     identification of appropriate opportunities for policy-making \n     and decision-making at the State and local level.\n       (9) The preservation of the role of the United States as a \n     leader in ocean and coastal activities, and, when it is in \n     the national interest, the cooperation by the United States \n     with other nations and international organizations in ocean \n     and coastal activities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2476, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2476) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to require the National Transportation Safety Board and \n     individual foreign air carriers to address the needs of \n     families of passengers involved in aircraft accidents \n     involving foreign air carriers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has turned to \nH.R. 2476, the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. I urge its \nimmediate adoption. H.R. 2476 is virtually identical to legislation \nthat I introduced earlier in the year, and that the Commerce Committee \napproved in September. I commend my committee colleagues--especially \nSenators Gorton, Hollings, and Ford--for working with me on this issue. \nIn particular, I want to recognize Representative Underwood, who \nspearheaded this effort in the House.\n  It was the tragic crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam that brought \nthe need for this legislation into focus. The bill would require a \nforeign air carrier that wants permission to operate in the United \nStates to develop a family assistance plan, in the event of an accident \non U.S. soil.\n  Specifically, the foreign air carrier would be required to provide \nthe Secretary of Transportation and the chairman of the National \nTransportation Safety Board [NTSB] with a plan for addressing the needs \nof the families of passengers involved in an aircraft accident that \ninvolves an aircraft under the control of that foreign air carrier, and \nthat involves a significant loss of life. The Secretary could not grant \npermission for the foreign air carrier to operate in the United States \nunless the Secretary had received a sufficient family assistance plan.\n  The requisite family assistance plan would include a reliable, \nstaffed toll-free number for the passengers' families, and a process \nfor expedient family notification prior to public notice of the \npassengers' identities. An NTSB employee would serve as director of \nfamily support services, with the assistance of an independent \nnonprofit organization with experience in disasters and post-trauma \ncommunication with families. The foreign air carrier would provide \nthese family liaisons with updated passenger lists following the crash. \nThe legislation would require that the carrier consult and coordinate \nwith the families on the disposition of remains and personal effects.\n  The legislation would build on the family assistance provisions that \nCongress enacted last year as part of the Federal Aviation \nReauthorization Act\n\n[[Page S12705]]\n\nof 1996. Domestic air carriers are already operating under the same \nlegislative requirements set out in the legislation before us.\n  Again, it was the unfortunate confusion and heartache surrounding the \ntragic airline crash in Guam that demonstrated the need for this bill. \nI urge immediate adoption of the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support \nAct.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank Congressman Underwood of \nGuam for pursuing H.R. 2476. The bill, virtually identical to a bill \nreported by the Commerce Committee, S. 1196, puts the same burden on \nforeign air carriers serving the United States as those now imposed on \nU.S. carriers when dealing with the families affected by aviation \ndisasters. Under existing law, U.S. carriers must develop and submit \nplans to the Department of Transportation and the National \nTransportation Safety Board on how they will address the needs of the \nfamilies of victims of disasters. The law today does not include \nforeign air carriers, and thus, H.R. 2476 is needed.\n  The bill is supported by the Administration, and I support its \nadoption. What we are asking all of the carriers to do is treat people \nfairly. The U.S. carriers have already been asked to do it, and now we \nare asking the foreign air carriers to do it. All carriers, foreign or \nU.S., should be prepared to deal with the families and to provide them \nwith the kinds of assistance they have every reason to expect. H.R. \n2476 ensures that this will happen. I urge the Senate to pass this \nbill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator McCain, Senator \nHollings, and Senator Ford in urging that we immediately adopt H.R. \n2476, the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. I also recognize \nRepresentative Underwood's efforts to facilitate this legislation \nfollowing the recent crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam, which \nkilled more than 200 people.\n  As Senator McCain stated, last year the Congress approved almost \nidentical legislation that required domestic air carriers to establish \na disaster support plan for the families of aviation accident victims. \nThe legislation we are now considering would extend this requirement to \nforeign air carriers if they have an accident on American soil.\n  I would note that the Family Assistance Task Force strongly supports \nthis legislation. The task force, which Congress established to find \nnew ways to assist family members and others devastated by an airline \ncrash, recently voted unanimously to endorse this act. The task force \nalso asked that Congress pass this legislation as expeditiously as \npossible.\n  It is unfortunate that airline accidents often provide the impetus to \nmake improvements. The Flight 801 tragedy clearly showed the need to \nimprove planning to assist family members when a foreign airline \ncrashes on American soil. Despite the best efforts of the National \nTransportation Safety Board and others, the family members of Flight \n801 accident victims would have been better served if a plan had been \nin place.\n  As we all know, the news of an air disaster spreads quickly. The \nmedia is often reporting about a crash as soon as, if not before, the \nrescue teams reach the scene. This legislation provides a framework to \nensure that family members receive proper assistance. Among other \nthings, foreign airlines would be required to have a plan to publicize \na toll-free number, have staff available to take calls, have an up-to-\ndate list of passengers, and have a process to notify families--in \nperson if possible--before any public notification that a family member \nwas onboard a crashed aircraft. These are basic services that anyone \nshould receive.\n  Hopefully, it will never be necessary for any foreign airline to use \nthe plans required under this act. In the event of an accident, \nhowever, family members of victims are due the consideration and \ncompassion that this legislation provides.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator McCain for moving this legislation \nquickly, and I would urge that we now adopt the Foreign Air Carrier \nFamily Support Act.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on August 5, 1997, Korean Air flight 801 \ncrashed into a hillside on Guam, killing 228. We worked with Chairman \nMcCain and our House colleagues last year to enact legislation \nrequiring U.S. air carriers to develop plans to address the needs of \nfamilies following an aviation disaster. The 1996 Federal Aviation \nAdministration [FAA] Reauthorization Act (P.L. 104-264), however, did \nnot impose a similar requirement on foreign carriers serving the United \nStates.\n  Section 703 of the FAA Reauthorization Act specifically requires that \nthe air carrier submit disaster plans to the Secretary of \nTransportation and the National Transportation Safety Board. The plans \nmust include items such as a means to publicize toll-free telephone \nnumbers for the families, a process for notifying families, an \nassurance that the families be consulted on the disposition of remains \nand personal effects, and a requirement that the carrier work with \nother organizations in dealing with the disaster.\n  Congressman Underwood of Guam originally introduced H.R. 2834 on the \nHouse side, and a corresponding bill, S. 1196, was introduced in the \nSenate to subject foreign carriers serving the United States to the \nrequirements mentioned above. The Senate bill was considered and \nreported by the Commerce Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 2834 so the \nPresident can sign this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2476) was considered, read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12704-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12705-S12706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING CLARIFICATION TO THE PILOT RECORDS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2626, which was received \nin the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2626) to make clarifications to the Pilot \n     Records Improvement Act of 1996, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last year, as part of the Federal \nAviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 1996, we imposed a \nseries of new requirements before an ``air carrier'' could hire a \npilot. When the bill as originally crafted was being developed, we \nworked with the pilots' unions and with the Air Transport Association \nto develop a workable approach that is fair to pilots and airlines and \nadvances aviation safety.\n  H.R. 2626 clears up a number of technical problems, but continues the \nspirit of the original legislation--to make sure that pilots operating \ncommercial aircraft are qualified. For many smaller carriers, such as \non-demand carriers like Bankair in South Carolina, the new law created \na number of logistical problems. I added a provision to the fiscal year \n1998 Transportation Appropriations law to ensure that the FAA, as \nholder of some pilot records, is able to supply those records \nexpeditiously.\n  H.R. 2626 will allow air carriers to hire, but not use, a pilot until \nhis or her records had been checked. Smaller carriers operating non-\nscheduled flights also are given additional flexibility. I support the \nchanges, and urge the passage of H.R. 2626.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to explain to my colleagues the need \nfor H.R. 2626, a bill to make clarifications to the Pilot Records \nImprovement Act of 1996. Last year, we worked diligently with the \nairlines, ALPA and the Independent Pilots Association, to craft a bill \nthat requires air carriers to share pilot records before a pilot could \nbe employed. The change in law was necessitated by a safety \nrecommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board.\n  H.R. 2626 modifies the law to let the air carriers hire a pilot prior \nto final check of the records, but the pilot can not operate a \ncommercial flight until\n\n[[Page S12706]]\n\nthe records are checked. Thus, the carriers can begin training new \nemployees, and when the records are cleared, put the pilot to work. \nBecause there have been problems in expeditiously providing records, \nthe hiring process will not be impeded.\n  For small aircraft that are not used in scheduled service, for \nexample, an on-demand cargo charter aircraft with a maximum payload \ncapacity of less than 7,500 pounds, a fully certified pilot can operate \nsuch aircraft for a limited period while the records are being \nreviewed. The requirement on the cargo operator is not changed--the \nrecords must be obtained and checked, but the pilot can fly for a 90-\nday period. Finally, the bill provides a narrow good faith exception \nfor a carrier seeking the records of a pilot from another carrier that \nhas ceased to exist. All other requirements for the pilot--licenses, \nmedical tests, for example--are unchanged.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2626) was considered read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12705-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY AND SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Among the $198,000,000 in German assets located in the \n     United States and seized by the United States Government in \n     World War II were believed to be bank accounts, trusts, \n     securities, or other assets belonging to Jewish victims of \n     the Holocaust.\n       (2) Among an estimated $1,200,000,000 in assets of Swiss \n     nationals and institutions which were frozen by the United \n     States Government during World War II (including over \n     $400,000,000 in bank deposits) were assets whose beneficial \n     owners were believed to include victims of the Holocaust.\n       (3) In the aftermath of the war, the Congress recognized \n     that some of the victims of the Holocaust whose assets were \n     among those seized or frozen during the war might not have \n     any legal heirs, and legislation was enacted to authorize the \n     transfer of up to $3,000,000 of such assets to organizations \n     dedicated to providing relief and rehabilitation for \n     survivors of the Holocaust.\n       (4) Although the Congress and the Administration authorized \n     the transfer of such amount to the relief organizations \n     referred to in paragraph (3), the enormous administrative \n     difficulties and cost involved in proving legal ownership of \n     such assets, directly or beneficially, by victims of the \n     Holocaust, and proving the existence or absence of heirs of \n     such victims, led the Congress in 1962 to agree to a lump-sum \n     settlement and to provide $500,000 for the Jewish Restitution \n     Successor Organization of New York, such sum amounting to \\1/\n     6\\th of the authorized maximum level of ``heirless'' assets \n     to be transferred.\n       (5) In June of 1997, a representative of the Secretary of \n     State, in testimony before the Congress, urged the \n     reconsideration of the limited $500,000 settlement.\n       (6) While a precisely accurate accounting of ``heirless'' \n     assets may be impossible, good conscience warrants the \n     recognition that the victims of the Holocaust have a \n     compelling moral claim to the unrestituted portion of assets \n     referred to in paragraph (3).\n       (7) Furthermore, leadership by the United States in meeting \n     obligations to Holocaust victims would strengthen--\n       (A) the efforts of the United States to press for the \n     speedy distribution of the remaining nearly 6 metric tons of \n     gold still held by the Tripartite Commission for the \n     Restitution of Monetary Gold (the body established by France, \n     Great Britain, and the United States at the end of World War \n     II to return gold looted by Nazi Germany to the central banks \n     of countries occupied by Germany during the war); and\n       (B) the appeals by the United States to the 15 nations \n     claiming a portion of such gold to contribute a substantial \n     portion of any such distribution to Holocaust survivors in \n     recognition of the recently documented fact that the gold \n     held by the Commission includes gold stolen from individual \n     victims of the Holocaust.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n\n[[Page S12707]]\n\n       (1) To provide a measure of justice to survivors of the \n     Holocaust all around the world while they are still alive.\n       (2) To authorize the appropriation of an amount which is at \n     least equal to the present value of the difference between \n     the amount which was authorized to be transferred to \n     successor organizations to compensate for assets in the \n     United States of heirless victims of the Holocaust and the \n     amount actually paid in 1962 to the Jewish Restitution \n     Successor Organization of New York for that purpose.\n       (3) To facilitate efforts by the United States to seek an \n     agreement whereby nations with claims against gold held by \n     the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary \n     Gold would contribute all, or a substantial portion, of that \n     gold to charitable organizations to assist survivors of the \n     Holocaust.\n\n     SEC. 102. DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE TRIPARTITE GOLD COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Directions to the President.--The President shall \n     direct the commissioner representing the United States on the \n     Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold, \n     established pursuant to Part III of the Paris Agreement on \n     Reparation, to seek and vote for a timely agreement under \n     which all signatories to the Paris Agreement on Reparation, \n     with claims against the monetary gold pool in the \n     jurisdiction of such Commission, contribute all, or a \n     substantial portion, of such gold to charitable organizations \n     to assist survivors of the Holocaust.\n       (b) Authority To Obligate the United States.--\n       (1) In general.--From funds otherwise unobligated in the \n     Treasury of the United States, the President is authorized to \n     obligate subject to subsection (2) an amount not to exceed \n     $30,000,000 for distribution in accordance with subsections \n     (a) and (b).\n       (2) Conformance with budget act requirement.--Any budget \n     authority contained in paragraph (1) shall be effective only \n     to such extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance \n     in appropriation Acts.\n\n     SEC. 103. FULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATION OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, not to \n     exceed a total of $25,000,000 for all such fiscal years, for \n     distribution to organizations as may be specified in any \n     agreement concluded pursuant to section 102.\n       (b) Archival Research.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the President $5,000,000 for archival \n     research and translation services to assist in the \n     restitution of assets looted or extorted from victims of the \n     Holocaust and such other activities that would further \n     Holocaust remembrance and education.\n                         TITLE II--WORKS OF ART\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Established pre-World War II principles of \n     international law, as enunciated in Articles 47 and 56 of the \n     Regulations annexed to the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) \n     Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, prohibited \n     pillage and the seizure of works of art.\n       (2) In the years since World War II, international \n     sanctions against confiscation of works of art have been \n     amplified through such conventions as the 1970 Convention on \n     the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, \n     Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which \n     forbids the illegal export of art work and calls for its \n     earliest possible restitution to its rightful owner.\n       (3) In defiance of the 1907 Hague Convention, the Nazis \n     extorted and looted art from individuals and institutions in \n     countries it occupied during World War II and used such booty \n     to help finance their war of aggression.\n       (4) The Nazis' policy of looting art was a critical element \n     and incentive in their campaign of genocide against \n     individuals of Jewish and other religious and cultural \n     heritage and, in this context, the Holocaust, while standing \n     as a civil war against defined individuals and civilized \n     values, must be considered a fundamental aspect of the world \n     war unleashed on the continent.\n       (5) Hence, the same international legal principles applied \n     among states should be applied to art and other assets stolen \n     from victims of the Holocaust.\n       (6) In the aftermath of the war, art and other assets were \n     transferred from territory previously controlled by the Nazis \n     to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, much of which has \n     not been returned to rightful owners.\n\n     SEC. 202. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING RESTITUTION OF \n                   PRIVATE PROPERTY, SUCH AS WORKS OF ART.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that consistent with the \n     1907 Hague Convention, all governments should undertake good \n     faith efforts to facilitate the return of private and public \n     property, such as works of art, to the rightful owners in \n     cases where assets were confiscated from the claimant during \n     the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that \n     the claimant is the rightful owner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/13/senate-section/article/S12706-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12707-S12710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATIONAL WEEK OF RECOGNITION FOR DOROTHY DAY AND THOSE WHOM SHE SERVED\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 163 \nintroduced earlier today by Senator Moynihan, D'Amato, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 163) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the 100th anniversary of the birth of Dorothy Day, \n     and designating the week of November 8 through November 14, \n     1997 as ``National Week of Recognition for Dorothy Day and \n     those whom she served.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a sense of the \nSenate resolution commemorating the 100th anniversary of the birth of \nDorothy Day, a woman who embodies the very idea of service to others. I \nam pleased to be joined by Senators D'Amato, Wellstone, Levin, Dodd, \nTorricelli, Reed, Durbin, Mikulski, and Kennedy in paying tribute to \nher life.\n  The life of Dorothy Day is central to modern Catholic social thought. \nHers was a radical brand of discipleship, akin to what the German \ntheologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer described as ``costly grace'' in The \nCost of Discipleship. She lived a life of voluntary poverty and \nhardship, forsaking material comfort and opting to live among the poor \nwhom she served. Just as Jesus befriended the tax collector and the \nprostitute, Dorothy Day embraced the drug addicted and the \ndisenfranchised. She saw Christ in everyone--especially in the poor and \nthe oppressed--and treated people accordingly. In short, she lived the \nGospel.\n  In 1933, Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin joined to found the Catholic \nWorker Movement and the Catholic Worker newspaper ``to realize in the \nindividual and society the express and implied teachings of Christ.'' \nThat same year, they opened the first Catholic Worker Hospitality \nhouse, St. Joseph's House, in Manhattan's Lower East Side. The country \nwas, by then, in the throes of the Great Depression, a period of \nsuffering unknown to this country before or since. Dorothy Day \nministered to the physical and spiritual needs of the legions of poor \nwho arrived on the doorstep at St. Joseph House. Today, some 64 years \nafter its creation, the Catholic Worker Movement remains a vibrant \nlegacy to her life. There are now more than 125 Catholic Worker \n``Houses of Hospitality'' in the United States and around the world.\n  Perhaps Dorothy Day's life was summed up best by those at the \nUniversity of Notre Dame who bestowed the Laetare Medal upon her in \n1972 for ``comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable \nvirtually all of her life.'' Indeed she did and we are all the better \nfor it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a tribute by Patrick Jordan, \nwho knew Dorothy Day from his days living at the Catholic Worker, from \nCommonweal and the text of the Resolution be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Commonweal, Oct. 24, 1997]\n\n                          An Appetite for God\n\n                          (By Patrick Jordan)\n\n       Dorothy Day was born on Pineapple Street in Brooklyn \n     Heights on November 8, 1897. On the hundredth anniversary of \n     her birth, her spirit is alive in the Catholic Worker \n     movement she and Peter Maurin founded in 1933. The movements \n     is still building, a rather remarkable feat in the history of \n     American religious communities, now with over 125 houses and \n     farming communes in the United States and in seven other \n     countries. There are a variety of Catholic Worker \n     publications that display strong writing and intellectual \n     vitality: critical voices in the midst of the capitalist \n     state, and lively antidotes to the spirit of bourgeois \n     Christianity. Day and Maurin would be pleased.\n       In a real sense, Day was an Augustinian figure. She was a \n     captivating, commanding presence, full of personal paradoxes \n     (vulnerable and yet like steel) and inconsistencies (patient \n     but fretful), who nonetheless cohered and remained \n     consistently stalwart. She had been around (as she attests in \n     her classic spiritual autobiography. The Long Loneliness), \n     knew the full joys and sorrows of life from her harsh \n     experience, and had gone through a life-searing conversion. \n     She possessed marvelous observational skills and wrote with \n     uncommon beauty and alacrity about her times: describing the \n     challenge of\n\n[[Page S12708]]\n\n     living good, and yes, holy lives in an era of warring \n     empires. She loved heroic figures, and aspired to be one. She \n     hoped that her books would be read by millions and would lead \n     to nonviolent, revolutionary change. She had a sense of humor \n     about herself and her work, and told the story of having been \n     asked to speak at a college on the topic ``Saints and \n     Heroes.'' She was greatly surprised (and delighted) when she \n     found the lecture hall packed. Only later did she discover \n     the reason: her talk had been mistakenly billed ``Saints and \n     Eros.''\n       For me, Dorothy Day was the most engaging and engaged \n     person I have ever met. Even now, seventeen years after her \n     death in 1980, I think of her almost daily, with deep \n     affection. What would she have thought of this moral dilemma, \n     this political situation, this church teaching? How would she \n     have approached a certain crisis, dealt with that obnoxious \n     persons? If the problem happens to be several-sided and \n     particularly dicey, I can be sure her response would be \n     challenging, distinct, and unpredictable. Not that it would \n     necessarily come as a surprise (she used to love to repeat \n     the phrase, based on her sense of the Gospels. ``There are \n     always answers; they are just not calculated to soothe''). \n     Her principles were doggedly clear: The admonitions of the \n     Gospels, the Psalms, and Saint Paul. These ran so deeply in \n     her that they seemed to issue from her marrow. When TV \n     newsman Mike Wallace asked her, ``Does God love murderers, \n     does he love a Hitler, a Stalin?'' she responded reflexively: \n     ``God loves all men, and all men are brothers''.\n       In person, even in her seventies, Day was physically \n     striking: tall, lean, her pale blue eyes keen but not \n     intrusive. In the ideal movie of Dorothy's life, Jessica \n     Lange would be cast in the part. Dorothy was one of those \n     individuals whose presence can affect the tone of whole \n     gatherings. When she entered a crowded room, people with \n     their backs to the door would turn spontaneously. Yet she was \n     unfailingly modest, and almost painfully shy in public.\n       Dorothy's mind, while not that of a trained intellectual, \n     was one of the most acute and supple I have seen at work; she \n     was highly intuitive, shrewd when it came to money, morally \n     rugged. She seemed to know herself with perfect clarify, the \n     fruit of a lifetime of self-examination: ``Cleanse us of our \n     unknown faults,'' she would repeat often. Lecturing about the \n     Catholic Worker, she would say of herself: ``There is always \n     a subtle self-aggrandizement. One may not intend it, yet \n     there it crops out to humiliate one. Perhaps it is good to \n     have this come out in the open.'' Both spiritually and \n     personally, she was the genuine article.\n       If you went to talk to Dorothy in her small room on the \n     third floor of the East First Street house, where she lived \n     from 1968-76, you might be ensnared for hours. She would \n     regale you with stories. In her early years as a reporter she \n     had interviewed everyone from Trotsky to Jack Dempsey. She \n     knew Eugene O'Neill and Dos Passos, and had inspired Auden. \n     She had testified before Congress on conscientious objection, \n     and while in Moscow in 1971, had defended Solzhenitsyn before \n     the Soviet writers' group, breaking up their meeting. She had \n     been shot at for her civil rights protests, been thrown into \n     solitary confinement; she had taken on both church and state, \n     loved both the opera and folk singer Joan Baez, was a doting \n     mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, received Communion \n     from the hands of the pope, and was a voracious reader. Yet \n     for all that, when you were with her you felt perfectly at \n     home; so much so you wanted to stay, maybe forever--at least \n     I wanted to.\n       Even after over forty years of the hard Catholic Worker \n     life, Dorothy's voice was young and there was merriment in \n     her laughter. Vivian Gornick, the feminist writer, did a \n     perspective on Day for the Village Voice in November 1969. At \n     one point during their four-hour conversation, Gornick sensed \n     that Dorothy had read her thoughts--a not uncommon experience \n     if you spent time with her. While Day had not been critical \n     of Gornick, the experience had raised questions for the \n     latter. According to Martin Buber, the zaddik (or righteous \n     teacher) responds to people's needs but first elevates them. \n     Sitting there in the soup kitchen at 36 First Street, Gornick \n     observed in Day ``a love that categorically refuses to deny \n     the irreducible humanity'' of each person. ``I felt in her a \n     woman who has done many things she would wish not to have \n     done; . . . been alone a long, long time in a curious, \n     exalted, exhausting manner; and more important, that all of \n     this was not a comfortable matter of the past; all of this \n     was an ongoing affair . . . [in which Day's] faith is put \n     through the fires daily.'' What comes through in Gornick's \n     article is the journalist's keen respect for the older woman.\n       Dorothy once told Robert Coles--in a different context--``I \n     have never wanted to lecture people; I have hoped to act in \n     such a way that I will be reaching out to many others who \n     will never be part of the Catholic Worker movement.'' It \n     seems to have worked with Gornick and countless others.\n       I recently asked Tom Sullivan and Nina Polcyn Moore, both \n     old friends and Catholic Workers, what made Day tick.\n       Sullivan, now in his eighties and in poor health in New \n     York City, told me ``her spirituality is basic. She started \n     with the saints, and was oriented to the early Christians.'' \n     For Moore, who now lives in Illinois, it was a matter of \n     ``love, divine and human.'' Dorothy ``was not content with \n     anything but the best,'' Moore told me. ``She loved God with \n     all her heart.''\n       But it was Day's constancy in the hard vocation she had \n     chosen that most amazed Moore: ``Her availability to people \n     and events, her fidelity to the Gospels, and her embracing \n     the precariousness of the Worker life are keys to her \n     greatness.'' According to Moore, who traveled with her here \n     and abroad, Day evolved from a young radical to a person of \n     international significance ``because she was on fire with the \n     love of God.''\n       In From Union Square to Rome, Dorothy's first book about \n     her conversion, she defines a mystic as someone in live with \n     God: ``Not one who loves God, but who is in love with God.'' \n     Years later, she quoted with relish Sonya's last line in \n     Uncle Vanya: ``I have faith Uncle, I have fervent, passionate \n     faith.''\n       That faith was evident in every aspect of Day's life, I \n     suppose it is what attracted so many of us to her: In seeing \n     her faith we experienced our own hoped-for faith being \n     validated and strengthened. ``Every act of faith increases \n     your faith,'' she instructed me over and over. But her faith \n     was not a cold series of propositions or legalisms. It was \n     rather a vital relationship. ``More and more I see [that] \n     prayer is the answer,'' she wrote in 1970. ``It is the clasp \n     of the hand, the joy and keen delight in the consciousness of \n     the Other. Indeed, it is like falling in love.'' Not many \n     people can write or speak of prayer that way because we don't \n     practice it. C.S. Lewis advised that we develop not simply a \n     spirituality, but an ``appetite for God.''\n       To see Dorothy at prayer was to observe someone completely \n     engrossed. I can vividly picture her praying, off to the left \n     side in one of the pews at Nativity Church in Manhattan. \n     Coupled with this memory is another of my walking into her \n     room one Saturday afternoon as she was listening to the \n     opera. It was Wagner and Dorothy's face was transfixed. She \n     didn't know I was there, and I retreated hastily, almost \n     embarrassed to have intruded at such a private moment. But \n     from those instances I learned something about the \n     intercourse between prayer and ecstasy, and how they relate \n     to beauty and love, human and divine.\n       For Nina Moore, it was Day's constancy in prayer, study, \n     and reading that explained what could be explained about her \n     continued spiritual growth. Lacking the structure of a formal \n     monastic regimen (she was a Benedictine oblate and attached \n     to the Jesu Caritas fellowship), Day had to steal the early \n     morning hours for her spiritual exercises. She did this \n     almost daily, year in and out: ``My strength . . . returns to \n     me with my cup of coffee and the reading of the psalms,'' she \n     said.\n       Dorothy's take on life of the soul was anything but \n     ``spiritualized.'' It was sacramental and sensual, but it was \n     not romantic. ``I can't bear the romantics,'' she told \n     Gornick. ``I want a religious realist. I want one who prays \n     to see things as they are and do something about it.'' Her \n     own faith had required a terrible price: the end of her \n     marriage and the breakup of her family: ``For me, Christ was \n     not bought for thirty pieces of silver,'' she wrote forty \n     years after her conversion, ``but with my heart's blood. We \n     buy not cheap in this market.''\n       What was essential for Dorothy--and what a popular mid-\n     century retreated movement and the Catholic Workers fostered \n     (see box)--was the serious attention and self-discipline \n     required for growth in the life of the spirit. In this \n     matter, I believe, Dorothy's mentor was Friedrich von Hugel, \n     who wrote, in Victorian style, of the ``costingness'' of such \n     growth. ``Plant yourself,'' von Hugel counseled,'' on \n     foundations that are secure: God, Christ, suffering, the \n     Cross.'' I often saw Dorothy with his short classic, The Life \n     of Prayer.\n       But the life of the spirit has to be cultivated, not merely \n     for the sake of one's own self-improvement, but for the well-\n     being of the whole church. As Dorothy prayed in Rome in 1965: \n     ``Give us, O Lord, peace, strength, and joy, so that we in \n     turn may give them to others.''\n       Theologically, Dorothy Day's chief contributions have to do \n     with the issues of freedom, poverty, and violence.\n       Freedom. Perhaps her deepest personal, intuitive insight. \n     Without freedom, there can be neither faith nor love.\n       When Dorothy first met Peter Maurin in 1932, she was \n     impressed that he was carrying two books in his building \n     pockets: Saint Francis and Peter Kropotkin. Kropotkin known \n     as the anarchist prince, was, like Charles de Foucauld, a \n     soldier and scientist. He had forsaken his title and had been \n     jailed and exiled for agitating for reform in Czarist Russia. \n     Even before meeting Maurin, Day held nonviolent anarchist \n     views (she was a decentralist who felt more at home with the \n     Wobblies than the Communists). The theoretical value Day saw \n     in anarchism was its emphasis on personal freedom and \n     responsibility, and on developing social patterns that foster \n     them.\n       On the spiritual level, the highest rung of being, God \n     gives freedom so that men and women can become human; thus \n     the story of Adam and Eve. Charles Peguy, poet and essayist, \n     and an influence on both Maurin and Day, has God address the \n     issue this way: ``But what kind of salvation would it be that \n     was not free?'' And then God validates ``man's'' power ``to \n     decide'' by declaring: ``And that freedom of his is my \n     creation'' (and therefore good).\n       Along with freedom comes the possibility--the \n     inevitability--of sin. On this point Day would refer to \n     Augustine and Julian of Norwich: God has already repaired the \n     worst\n\n[[Page S12709]]\n\n     possible catastrophe the Fall) by taking on our human flesh, \n     suffering our fate, and redeeming us.\n       Unlike many birthright Catholics, Day did not feel \n     constrained by the institution. She took as her own Saint \n     Paul's phrase--``You are no longer foreigners and aliens, but \n     fellow citizens with the saints'' (Ephesians 2:19)--and \n     placed her trust in the church, which she loved and which is \n     itself held accountable to the Gospels. For encouragement, \n     Day looked to the lives of the saints, whom she found to be \n     anything but toadies. Partiarchy? When it came to ``this \n     business of `asking Father' what to do about something,'' she \n     said, it ``never occurred to us.''\n       At Vatican II, she noted her admiration for John Courtney \n     Murray. She felt grateful for the church's clear but long \n     overdue statement on religious freedom and the primacy of \n     conscience.\n       Poverty. As noted above, Maurin brought with him Kropotkin \n     and Francis. For the Christian, poverty is not only a matter \n     of the soul--it is a social concern. It entails not only \n     personal spiritual obligations, but matters of strict justice \n     and compassion.\n       We begin by looking at our own lives. When asked to address \n     the relations between individuals, Day said, Jesus always \n     emphasized the problems of wealth and poverty. Looking at \n     society this way, Day was explicit: ``It is impossible, save \n     by heroic charity, to live in the present social order and be \n     a Christian.'' After reading Abbie Hoffman's Revolution for \n     the Hell of It in 1968, she commented: ``A terrifying book; \n     bitterness, hatred, hell unleashed. The fruits of war, \n     materialism, prosperity. . . . God help our children.''\n       Dorothy Day's own approach was twofold. First, there was a \n     line she repeated often from Saint John of the Cross: ``Where \n     there is no love, put love, and you will find love.'' And \n     second, cultivate a life of detachment and share the plight \n     of the poor: ``We [Catholic Workers] believe in an economy \n     based on human needs, rather than the profit motive. . . .We \n     are not judging [wealthy] individuals, but are trying to make \n     a judgment on the system . . . which we try to withdraw from \n     as much as possible. . . . What is worst of all is using God \n     and religion to bolster up our own greed, our own attachment \n     to property, and putting God and country on an equality.'' \n     Finally, she pointed out, ``we are not going to win the \n     masses to Christianity until we live it,'' and that included \n     having a willingness to embrace poverty.\n       For Day, to live poorly meant to share the life of the \n     poor: ``Let us love to live with the poor because they are \n     especially loved by Christ.'' Each person who presents \n     himself or herself to us--rich, middle class, or poor--must \n     be given love, ``not because it might be Christ . . . but \n     because they are Christ.'' How did she know for sure? \n     ``Because we have seen his hands and his feet in the poor \n     around us. . . . We start by loving them for him, and soon we \n     love them for themselves, each one a unique person, most \n     special. . . . It is through such exercises that we grow, and \n     the joy of our vocation assures us we are on the right \n     path.'' According to Kate Hennessy, Day's granddaughter, \n     ``she turned the life of poverty into something dynamic, full \n     of richly simple moments for those who have nothing.''\n       How Dorothy Day managed to keep her psychological wholeness \n     over the years in the disorder, disease, mental confusion, \n     and violence that mark Catholic Worker houses was a practical \n     miracle to me. ``Pray and endure,'' she would repeat. Some of \n     her stamina came from knowing the critical distinction \n     between love and pity. ``The law of love is reciprocity,'' \n     Georges Bernanos had written, ``and reciprocity is not \n     possible where there is pity.'' Martin Buber explained it \n     more eloquently: ``Help is no virtue, but an artery of \n     existence.'' To really help someone, however, ``the helper \n     must live with the other; only help that arises out of living \n     with the other can stand before the eyes of God.'' Day \n     insisted that she ``would not dare write or speak or follow \n     the vocation God has given me to work with the poor and for \n     peace if I did not have the constant reassurance of the \n     Mass.''\n       Violence I need not recount at length Day's work for \n     justice, peace, and nonviolence. Historically, she had a \n     critical if indirect bearing on Vatican II's condemnation of \n     nuclear war and its endorsement of the right to conscientious \n     objection. Her pacifist stand in World WAr II was intensely \n     controversial, not only among Americans in general but even \n     among Catholic Workers; Mike Wallace's question indicates \n     that it still is today. Day's repeated stints in jail for \n     protesting war preparation and the war economy--including her \n     challenge that people withdraw from participating in both--\n     achieved modest success, symbolically--by helping to end the \n     air-raid drills in New York City during the fifties and \n     sixties--and practically in the lives of not a few \n     individuals who refused induction, changed their jobs, or \n     resisted paying war taxes.\n       Day's staunch views on pacifism drew a deep line between \n     just-war teaching and gospel nonviolence. She shared with \n     Saint James the view that the roots of violence are fear, \n     lack of forgiveness, and greed. Fear leads us to strike out \n     at enemies; it may even help to create them. Day believed the \n     Catholic Worker must be a school of nonviolence. The \n     young volunteers who came in search of their vocation, she \n     wrote, ``learn not only to love with compassion, but to \n     overcome fear, that dangerous emotion that precipitates \n     violence. They may go on feeling fear, but they know the \n     means [the `spiritual weapons,' as she called them, of \n     self-discipline, willingness to take up the cross, \n     forgiving `seventy times seven,' and readiness to lay down \n     one's life for one's fellows] to overcome it.'' Here, \n     prayer and daily Mass were the best offense. From her own \n     testimony of sitting through nights of threatened violence \n     in the racially divided South in the 1960s, it is prayer \n     that ``gives courage.''\n       Was she critical of her own track record? Always. \n     Repeatedly I heard her say of herself and her co-workers, \n     quoting the Letter to the Hebrews: ``We have not yet resisted \n     unto blood.'' She felt she might yet prove to be as avenging \n     as any potential adversary.\n       One of Day's most notable achievements for peace took place \n     quietly behind the scenes. In Rome in 1965 for the last \n     session of the council, she joined a small group of women at \n     a convent to fast for ten days, on water only, as the \n     conciliar debate raged over what would be the church's \n     official teaching on modern war.\n       Dorothy did not like to fast (she said her besetting sins \n     were gluttony and sloth), and made sure she had filled her \n     senses by going to the opera (Cavalleria Rusticana) before \n     the fast. Her report in the November 1995 Catholic Worker \n     included the daily schedule of the group and concluded as \n     follows:\n       As for me, I did not suffer at all from the hunger or \n     headache or nausea which usually accompanied the first few \n     days of a fast, but I had offered my fast in part for the \n     victims of famine all over the world, and it seemed to me \n     that I had very special pains. They were certainly of a kind \n     I have never had before, and they seemed to pierce the very \n     marrow of my bones . . . They were not like the arthritic \n     pains, which, aggravated by tension and fatigue, are part of \n     my life now that I am sixty-eight. One accepts them as part \n     of age, and also part and parcel of the life or work, which \n     is the lot of the poor. So often I see grandmothers in Puerto \n     Rican families bearing the burden of children, the home, \n     cooking, sewing, and contributing to the work of mother and \n     father, who are trying to make a better life for their \n     children. I am glad to share their fatigue with them.\n       But these pains . . . seemed to reach into my very bones, \n     and I could only feel that I had been given some little \n     intimation of the hunger of the world. God help us, living as \n     we do, in the richest country in the world, and so far from \n     approaching the voluntary poverty we esteem and reach toward. \n     . . May we try harder to do more in the future.\n       This is vintage Dorothy Day: the immediacy of concerns; the \n     challenge, complexity, and interrelation of the big issues \n     (war and poverty); the incorporation of her personal \n     experience; the self-criticism and pledge to do better; and \n     the radical, foundational nature of her Christian \n     perspective.\n       No retrospect of Dorothy Day's spirituality would be \n     complete without mentioning her tremendous personal \n     struggles. These centered, in her late years, on two related \n     areas: discouragement and perseverance. From her earliest \n     Catholic Worker writings, Day speaks of discouragement in the \n     work (see, House of Hospitality). The utter hopelessness of \n     the situation of some of the people with whom she lived (``we \n     are a community of need, not an international community'') \n     included physical violence, broken families, addiction, \n     suicides, evictions, fires, poor food, attrition of co-\n     workers. All of these could be overwhelming. Dorothy was \n     sometimes so jangled by them--and by family concerns, \n     overwork, travel, writing, speechmaking, and innumerable \n     obligations--that she would break into tears. ``Don't let \n     yourself get into this state!'' she would tell me, better \n     escaping for a reprieve to her sister's or daughter's.\n       Dorothy also told me that twice in her life she had \n     overcome serious bouts of depression by reading herself out \n     of them (she recommended Dickens), but said that if she ever \n     were to experience such depression again, she would consider \n     shock treatment.\n       Another line of cure--which she had learned from her \n     mother--was to clean the house. And then there were the \n     theater and music: ``Saw My Fair Lady. A very good cure for \n     melancholy. Theme: Man's capacity to change.'' Again, ``I am \n     now listening to a concert, Brahms's Second Symphony, joyful \n     music to heal my sadness. All day I have felt sad. I am \n     oppressed by a sense of failure, of sin.''\n       On the conjunction between what Dorothy called ``the dark \n     night of the senses and the dark night of the soul,'' she \n     reflected: ``It seems to me that they often intermingle.'' \n     this led her to prescribe Ruskin's ``Duty of Delight'': ``I \n     found a copy of Ruskin, The True and the Beautiful,'' she \n     wrote while visiting her daughter in Vermont, and ``the \n     beautiful quotation on the duty of delight. Making cucumber \n     pickles, chili sauce, and grape juice. Delightful smells.'' \n     And the ``duty'' must be taken seriously, not only for \n     oneself but ``for the sake of others who are on the verge of \n     desperation.''\n       And then there was use of the other serious spiritual \n     weapons: prayer, Scripture, community, the sacraments. The \n     ancient Christian writers had long been concerned with \n     acedia, spiritual sloth, which is associated with a failure \n     against hope. Depression, a modern manifestation, is, in \n     part, a constricting of that virtue, and of the power of the \n     will to act. Day often prayed to Saint Ephraim, one of the \n     desert fathers. He seemed to have struggled with the problem \n     of discouragement, and spoke of the distress caused by his \n     own procrastination. The best practical remedy for such a \n     condition, Day\n\n[[Page S12710]]\n\n     noted, was ``faithfulness to the means to overcome it: \n     recitation of the psalms each day, prayer and solitude, and \n     by these means arriving--or hoping to arrive--at a state of \n     well-being.'' The psalms she found particularly helpful in \n     this regard: ``I have stilled and quieted my soul'' (Ps. \n     131), and ``Relieve the troubles of my heart'' (Ps. 25). She \n     would also quote Saint Paul's Letter to the Romans, chapter \n     8--``Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ''--and \n     his advice not to judge others or even oneself, for Christ \n     understands our failures: he was, after all, the world's \n     greatest failure.\n       Among contemporary spiritual writings, she recommended in \n     this regard Dom Hubert van Zeller's Approach to Calvary: \n     ``Awoke at 5:30,'' she penned in 1965. ``Usual depression \n     over failures, inefficiency, incapacity to cope. Van Zeller's \n     book invaluable, teaching on how to accept all this \n     discouragement, which he says will increase with age. . . . \n     One must just keep going.''\n       And that connects with the matter of perseverance, a \n     subject on which she corresponded sporadically with Thomas \n     Merton: ``I am often full of fear about my final \n     perseverance,'' she told him in 1960. But then, during his \n     own long struggles with the problem, she advised: Your work \n     ``is the work God wants of you, no matter how much you want \n     to run away from it.''\n       She eventually came to terms with the fact that her \n     difficulties were not going to end in this life. In the last \n     book she gave me, Spiritual Autobiography of Charles de \n     Foucauld (she was always giving gifts and books, prayer books \n     and Bibles especially), she had underlined the following \n     passage from de Foucauld: ``Our difficulties are not a \n     transitory state of affairs. . . . No, they are the normal \n     state of affairs and we should reckon on being in angustia \n     temporum [`in straightness of times,' Dan. 9:21] all our \n     lives, so far as the good we want to do is concerned.''\n       In 1960, Dorothy Day commented favorably on a then-current \n     appraisal of the state of the American Catholic church, \n     rendered by the Jesuit theologian, Gustave Weigel. Three \n     things were most needed in the U.S. church, said Weigel: \n     Austerity, preached and lived; a deeper awareness of the \n     reality of God; and a truer and more effective love for all \n     people, including those who are our enemies. One could not \n     find a more succinct summary of Day's own views. In 1968, she \n     complained that the Catholic press in the United States was \n     too much concerned with the problems of authority, birth \n     control, and celibacy, whereas the real problems were ``war, \n     race, poverty and wealth, violence, sex, and drugs.'' Some \n     things change slowly. Or not at all.\n       Without the saints, Bernanos said fifty years ago, the \n     church is only dead stones: Without them, the very grace \n     lying within the church's institutional and sacramental forms \n     remains fallow. Despite the unparalleled upheavals of our \n     times, grace has not remained hidden. We have been its \n     appealing power.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
