Mr. President, while the Senate is conducting its morning \nbusiness, a conference is being held in Georgetown by the Progress & \nFreedom Foundation (PFF) on an issue that has gotten a great deal of \nattention over the past few weeks. From the conference title--\nCompetition, Convergence and the Microsoft Monopoly--one might be \ndeceived into believing these are frightening times for American \nconsumers.\n  Any fears about the success of Microsoft isn't coming from those who \nbuy Microsoft products, but from frustrated competitors. While I don't \ndismiss the concerns expressed by anti-Microsoft factions, their \narguments certainly lack force when consumers appear to be so \ncompletely uninterested in this tale.\n  In fact, that's the untold story in the drama of the past several \nmonths--what does the consumer think of all this? How are American \nconsumers being impacted? These questions are appropriate when you \nconsider that the anti-trust laws of this country came into being to \nencourage competition and to protect consumers, not to settle bickering \namong business competitors.\n  Unfortunately, a lot of words have been printed and broadcast on this \nsubject, but we've hardly heard a peep from the people who matter \nmost--the consumers. This concerns me precisely because it appears that \nso many people\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nparticipating in this dispute have already decided who gets to wear the \nblack hat, and who the white.\n  At this morning's event my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who \nchairs the very committee that exercises jurisdiction over the \nantitrust laws, spoke to the PFF conference about the Microsoft \ndispute. Normally, I don't keep track of where my colleagues make \nspeeches and what they speak about, but because Senator Hatch has been \nquoted in the news media as taking a very hard anti-Microsoft line, I \nfeel compelled to share some of his statements with my colleagues and \nrebut some of the criticism that he, and other Microsoft critics, have \ntossed out in the past several weeks about one of America's most \nvisible, and successful, companies.\n  On Jan. 25th, Senator Hatch spoke at length to the San Jose Mercury \nNews about Microsoft and his competitors, and I was surprised by the \ntone of his remarks. The newspaper quotes Senator Hatch as saying, ``if \nMicrosoft has engaged in driving out competition, and I think it has--\nmost everybody who's looked at it carefully believes it has--and takes \ncontrol of (Internet standards), they're going to exercise a tremendous \namount of control over Internet content and commerce.'' Senator Hatch \ngoes on to say, ``if they're using anticompetitive practices to achieve \nthat, it's wrong--and we have to do something about it.''\n  In light of Senator Hatch's comments, I am concerned about how \nMicrosoft is treated on Capitol Hill. Fortunately, Senator Hatch has \npromised that the Judiciary Committee has no intention of interfering \nwith [the Microsoft litigation] and as our examination goes forward, we \nwill work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that it continues to be fair \nand balanced. (Feb. 3 letter to Gorton/Murray)\n  I appreciate this statement, but I must admit it concerns me when he \nspeaks at a conference that refers to Microsoft as a ``monopoly.''\n  Having said that, I would like to begin my comments on the Microsoft \ninvestigation by making a couple of points:\n  First, the question of whether the company has violated antitrust \nlaws is something of an abstract question that has been posed, not by \nAmerican consumers, but by Microsoft's competitors. I believe that to \nbe the key of this entire discussion, and why I feel so strongly that \nMicrosoft is being treated unfairly. This isn't an effort led by those \nwho purchase software products . . . if it were, you can be sure that \nmy attitude would be much different . . . this fight was started by \nthose who must compete with Microsoft, which, in my opinion, makes it \nvery hard for those individuals and companies to make an argument that \nis not completely driven by their self-interest.\n  Let's remember why we have anti-trust laws in this country--these \nlaws weren't written to preserve unsuccessful competitors; they were \nwritten to encourage competition, and thereby protect consumers. And to \ndate, I haven't seen one bit of evidence to support the theory that \nconsumers are being hurt by Microsoft's success, or the success of any \nother company in the software industry.\n  Second, as a former state attorney general, I support government \nenforcement of antitrust laws, but I cannot support the DOJ's attempts \nto restrict Microsoft's ability to produce and market the full-featured \nproducts its customers demand. Product design decisions should be made \nby software developers responding to consumer demand in the \nmarketplace, not by governmental agencies.\n  And so on behalf of the American consumer, indeed the American \neconomy, I'd like to review a few facts that we simply should not \noverlook today.\n  From 1990 to 1996, the number of software companies in the United \nStates grew 81 percent, from 24,000 to 44,000 companies.\n  During the same period, employment in the American software industry \ngrew 70 percent, to more than 600,000 jobs today.\n  The industry generated direct wages of more than $36 billion in 1996, \nand another $83 billion in related sectors of the economy.\n  It generated $7.2 billion in taxes paid to federal and state \ngovernments, and another $7.9 billion through the ``ripple'' effect.\n  Venture capital investment in new technology companies is at an all \ntime high--$2.4 billion invested last year alone.\n  Prices for personal computer hardware and software are constantly \nfalling. Where a single Microsoft application such as Microsoft Word \ncost $399 in 1990, today consumers can acquire all of Microsoft Office \n(which includes word processing, spreadsheet, presentations, scheduling \nand other functionality) for just $499 at retail.\n  If Microsoft's competitors are right, how could all of that success \ntaken place? Wouldn't logic tell us that if a ``Microsoft Monopoly'' \nactually existed, prices would be higher, job growth would be lower, \nand venture capital investment would be next to nothing? Yet, the facts \nshow the opposite course.\n  Also, I think it's important to remind ourselves that all of these \naccomplishments took place without government regulation or \ninterference.\n  Let's review that again: Competition in the American software \nindustry is not only healthy but vigorous. America leads the world. \nInnovation is at an all-time high. Employment is flourishing. Prices \ncontinue to fall for consumers and businesses alike. Productivity is \nskyrocketing. And barriers to entry for any company or individual that \nwants to compete in this industry are low.\n  The principal assets required to create software are human \nintelligence, creativity and a willingness to assume entrepreneurial \nrisk. All of the hallmarks of a thriving, healthy industry are in place \nin America's software industry.\n  Let's return now to this question--what is the basic goal of \nantitrust law in America?\n  I believe that the basic goal of our anti-trust laws is to promote \ncompetition, thereby insuring that consumers benefit from the \nwidespread availability of goods and services at fair prices. Often \ncompetition is vigorous, but the fact that certain companies perform \nbetter than others is no reason to doubt that consumers benefit greatly \nfrom their success. As many courts have recognized, all companies \nshould strive to do as much business as they can, even if that means \ntaking business away from rivals, because it is that quest that causes \nthe creation of new and better products offered to consumers at \nattractive prices.\n  So, why are a handful of Microsoft's competitors so successful at \nscaring up government investigations, public policy debates and media \nscrutiny? One might argue that all of these incredible statistics that \nI've just reviewed are somehow skewed because Microsoft is really the \nonly beneficiary. In other words, all of the benefits accrue to \nMicrosoft. Well, that's just wrong. Once again, the facts tell another \nstory:\n  The top 20 companies in the industry account for only 42% of the \ntotal revenues from packaged software sales--demonstrating that the \nsoftware industry is highly competitive and decentralized.\n  Microsoft represents less than 4% of total worldwide software \nindustry revenues. In 1996, total software industry revenues were $250 \nbillion; Microsoft's portion was less than $10 billion. How can there \nbe a ``Microsoft Monopoly'' if Microsoft accounts for less than 4% of \nindustry revenues? If such a monopoly existed, shouldn't that \npercentage be more like 60%, 70%, 80% or higher?\n  But what about Microsoft's dominance in the PC software space? Well, \na few more facts:\n  In online services, Microsoft represents only 9.8 percent of the \nonline services sector. America Online has 75 percent.\n  Database software: Microsoft represents only 6 percent of the \ndatabase software sector, compared to Oracle's 30 percent share.\n  E-mail software: Microsoft represents only 14 percent of e-mail \nsoftware revenues, compared to 43 percent for IBM/Lotus.\n  Server operating systems: Microsoft represents only 27 percent of \nserver software revenues, compared to 41 percent for Novell.\n  Again, where is the monopoly? Percentages of 9.8, 6, 14 and 27 hardly \nsound like monolopies to me.\n  So we're still left to ponder, why the fuss over Microsoft, given all \nof this good news? This is the question so many in the media are \nstriving to answer. The New Republic recently attributed it to techno-\nangst--society's\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\nanxiety about the Information Age and its desire to focus that angst on \nsomeone or some company.\n  I think a more plausible answer is a coordinated PR and lobbying \ncampaign by a handful of Microsoft's competitors. Two weeks ago, the \nauthor and management guru James Moore wrote in The New York Times:\n\n       The courtroom drama played out in Washington in recent \n     weeks concealed what was happening backstage: a small number \n     of companies that compete with Microsoft have managed to make \n     the Federal Government an unwitting tool of their narrow \n     competitive objectives.\n       These sorts of unholy alliances almost always lead to bad \n     policy. If users are better served, if the cost of software \n     is reduced and if new layers of information-industry \n     innovation are built, a strong argument can be made that the \n     public good is being achieved without Government \n     intervention.\n\n  The public good is being achieved without Government intervention. \nThis cannot be overemphasized. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has \nplayed an important role in developing intelligent public policy with \nan eye toward limiting the role of government in markets. In 1995, PFF \npublished a major study on the need to replace the FCC and \nsubstantially deregulate the telecommunications marketplace. Today, PFF \nis conducting a major project designed to limit government interference \nin the market for digital broadband networks. I applaud PFF's efforts \non behalf of the free market in those industries, and am somewhat \nmystified by the organization's apparent inconsistency with regard to \nMicrosoft and the software industry. Based on the organization's past, \nI simply want to encourage the Progress and Freedom Foundation to \nremain steadfast in its belief in the American marketplace.\n  Now, I'd like to turn for a moment to addressing some of what I will \ncall the myths out there about Microsoft. I think it's important that \nwe deal with some of the less scholarly thinking and ideas up front.\n  Myth #1: Microsoft is somehow going to control access and commerce on \nthe Internet.\n  I was amused to see a press release earlier this week from the New \nYork Attorney General's Office making this claim. It's almost as though \nthe PR campaign being championed by several Microsoft competitors who \nhave decided these buzzwords have the most media appeal. Anyone who \ngoes out onto the Internet to find the world of knowledge and \ninformation available there knows that no one will ever control access \nand commerce on the Internet. Such a thought is as laughable as \nsuggesting one company will control all commerce and information in the \nworld. The Internet is a vast information source that will continue to \ngrow and expand. No company will ever represent more than a tiny \nfraction of all the commerce and all the content available on the \nInternet.\n  Myth #2: Some companies are afraid to come forward with complaints \nabout Microsoft because they are afraid that Microsoft will use its \ndominance in the marketplace to punish them.\n  My colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, \nhas made this charge himself in interviews with the news media. This is \na serious accusation but one that is also baseless. Microsoft has gone \nso far as to give the Justice Department a letter that it can present \nto anyone and everyone doing business with the company encouraging them \nto cooperate with the DOJ on its investigation. Microsoft has been \nextremely cooperative for years with the DOJ. And it would be out of \ncharacter for Microsoft--a company that values its partners--to make \nthis an issue with them.\n  Myth #3: Microsoft's license agreements with Internet Service \nProviders unfairly force ISPs to promote only Internet Explorer, and \nprohibit ISPs from even mentioning the existence of Netscape Navigator.\n  Like PC manufacturers, ISPs know and understand their customers. They \nprovide their customers with choice--whether it's Internet Explorer, \nNavigator or some other product. Microsoft has no exclusive \narrangements with ISPs. This is a non-issue.\n  Myth #4: Microsoft is entering into proprietary agreements with \nContent Providers to create popular websites that can only be viewed \nusing Microsoft's browser.\n  Let me be absolutely clear. A consumer can use any browser he or she \nwants to view any material on the Internet. A content provider may \nchoose to take advantage of technology available in either Internet \nExplorer or Navigator to make their content even more compelling.\n  Content providers like Warner Brothers want to reach the most \ncustomers. They aren't looking for exclusionary technology. They are \nlooking for the best technology to serve their customers. Right now \nWarner Brothers believes that Microsoft has the best technology. There \nare other content providers that believe Netscape has the best \ntechnology. That's what competition is all about. This is similar to \nsaying that manufacturers of VHS videocassette players entered into \nproprietary deals with Hollywood studios to force their movies on VHS \ntapes rather than Beta tapes. Just as VHS and Beta were competing \nstandards, so too are Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. May the \nbest technology win.\n  Myth #5: The Justice Department is working to restore choice for \nconsumers.\n  This is disingenuous at best. Consumers have always had choice. \nNetscape and thousands of other software programs run wonderfully on \nMicrosoft Windows. In fact, the great untold story is how Microsoft \nspends more than $65 million and 1,000 Microsoft employees to work with \nits competitors to build great software applications that run on \nWindows.\n  It's important to understand these myths. Sound public policy must be \nbased in fact, not competitive rhetoric.\n  These are exciting times for American consumers and for American \nbusiness. Microsoft's business model, which is focused on rapid product \ndevelopment, broad distribution at low prices and close collaboration \nwith hardware and software vendors, is helping to drive demand through \nthe high technology sector. We are seeing upgrades to \ntelecommunications networks--telephone, cable, satellite and wireless--\nthe introduction of new types of devices such as hand held computers \nand automobile PCS--and the creation of innovative new software to make \nthese networks and devices improve the lives of all consumers.\n  New technologies and new ideas are being introduced at a dizzying \npace--led largely by innovative and highly competitive American \ncompanies.\n  I've spoken today about the American consumer and the American \nsoftware industry. I'd like to conclude by talking a little about \nMicrosoft. You can hardly talk about innovation and competition without \nfocusing on Microsoft. It's founder, Bill Gates, is one of the true \nvisionaries of the Information Age and his company has produced \ntechnology that will forever change the way we work, play and think.\n  I have enjoyed watching this phenomenal man and his company for many \nyears. And over those years, I have seen Microsoft remain committed to \nfour very important business principles that have guided the company \nsince its founding:\n  1. Microsoft builds software that improves the quality of people's \nlives. Bill Gates' vision of Information at Your Fingertips brings \nbusinesses closer to their customers, voters closer to their elected \nofficials, doctors closer to their patients and teachers closer to \ntheir students.\n  2. Microsoft listens closely to its customers and focuses on how it \ncan do a better job. If you want to know the true secret to Microsoft's \nsuccess, look at its intense focus on incorporating customer feedback \ninto its products.\n  3. Microsoft believes that innovation is at the heart of its future. \nMicrosoft will spend more than $2 billion this year on research and \ndevelopment. More than 16 percent of its revenues are dedicated to R \nIts competitors, Sun and Oracle will spend about 8 percent of revenues \non R\n  4. Microsoft partners with many companies, large and small, who share \nthese principles. Microsoft's thousands of partners are in every state \nin America--independent software vendors who build great software \nproducts for the Windows operating system, PC manufacturers, solution \nproviders who support and implement Microsoft technology solutions and \nmany other partners.\n  In conclusion, I believe that a review of the facts shows that the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\nsoftware industry is healthy, vigorous, innovative and continually \nimproving the lives of American consumers. Microsoft is one of many \naggressive and innovative companies in this industry. Its leadership is \nan asset for the nation. Its leadership is also not guaranteed. In any \ndynamic, innovative industry such as software, your position in the \nmarket is only as strong as your last product release. The competitive \nthreats to Microsoft are real.\n  As PFF, the participants at its conference, and many of my colleagues \nknow all too well, it is the marketplace, not government regulation \nthat will ensure continued innovation and consumer benefits.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an address I \ngave to the Progress and Freedom Foundation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Address of Sen. Orrin G. Hatch before the Progress and Freedom \n                      Foundation February 5, 1998\n\n                      Antitrust in the Digital Age\n\n       Good morning. It is a true pleasure to be with you this \n     morning and to be included in such a distinguished group of \n     leading economic and antitrust thinkers. I know that, given \n     the early hour, some of you no doubt are looking for some \n     eye-opening comments. Well, I hate to disappoint, but, let's \n     not kid ourselves folks, this is antitrust we're talking \n     about, so I hope you've had your coffee.\n       Seriously, though, I would like to applaud the Progress and \n     Freedom Foundation for convening this symposium, as well as \n     those who have focused their intellectual energies on the \n     topics to be discussed today.\n       It is, I believe, no overstatement to say that the so-\n     called Digital Revolution is one of the most important \n     economic developments of our age, one which promises to \n     fundamentally change our economy, our business, and our daily \n     lives.\n       Just when I have finally mastered how to set the clock on \n     my VCR, I discover that it won't be long before I'll be \n     watching movies off the Internet, not my VCR. Now I'm really \n     beginning to understand that ``virtual reality'' means \n     something more than simply getting up in the morning.\n       These rapid changes present numerous challenges to \n     policymakers who are seeking to understand what, if any, role \n     the government should play both in the transition to our new \n     digital economy and in the new economy itself. These changes \n     present challenges to policymakers who are seeking to ensure \n     that, where there truly is a productive role for government, \n     this role is both limited and effective.\n       While of course the Digital Revolution impacts numerous \n     policy areas, I believe that, ranking high among those is the \n     task of understanding the proper role of antitrust in high-\n     technology markets. I promise to keep my comments brief this \n     morning, but thought I would spend a few minutes discussing \n     why I believe it is important for antitrust policymakers, law \n     enforcers, and intellectuals to engage in a serious \n     examination of market power and structure, and the proper \n     role for antitrust enforcement, in the Digital Age.\n       Make no mistake about it--these are difficult issues. \n     Anyone who suggests that the answers are easy cannot be \n     taking the issues very seriously. But anyone who suggests \n     that these are not serious policy issues, worthy of debate \n     and study, has, for one reason or another, chosen to ignore \n     reality.\n       But, the difficulty of the questions should not deter us \n     from seeking answers. And, especially given the breathtaking \n     pace by which technology is advancing, it is imperative that \n     we search all the more diligently and assertively.\n\n\n                     I. Antitrust and Free Markets\n\n       While there has always been, and probably will always be, \n     considerable debate about the proper role of antitrust \n     enforcement, it is important to note here something that just \n     about everybody agrees with: some degree of antitrust \n     enforcement is important to protecting our free market system \n     and the consumers that system is meant to benefit.\n       Thus, most who, like myself, trumpet the free enterprise \n     system, also recognize that proper antitrust enforcement \n     plays an important role in protecting free markets. Let me \n     repeat that. Proper antitrust enforcement plays an important \n     role in protecting free markets.\n       From Adam Smith to Robert Bork, free market, free-\n     enterprise proponents have long recognized as much. So let me \n     debunk the myth that economic conservatives do not believe in \n     antitrust. To the contrary, we believe strongly in \n     antitrust--so long as the role of antitrust is understood \n     properly and not overextended.\n       Properly conceived, the role of our antitrust laws is to \n     maximize consumer welfare--allowing the marketplace to work \n     its will so that the products consumers want can be produced \n     in an efficient fashion and offered at competitive prices. \n     The basic premise is that antitrust protects ``competition'' \n     in the marketplace, and that a competitive marketplace \n     enhances consumer welfare. In a properly functioning \n     competitive market, consumer choice dictates which products \n     will be produced and sold, and competition among firms \n     determines who will make them and at what price. Consumer \n     welfare is maximized, and society's ``pie'' is larger.\n       At the same time, though, our society and our antitrust \n     laws recognize that markets will not always operate freely \n     and achieve their objective of maximizing consumer welfare. \n     The reality is that, in some circumstances, private market \n     power can distort the workings of the marketplace and, as a \n     consequence, can hurt consumer welfare by raising prices, \n     restricting consumer choice, or stifling innovation. This is \n     where antitrust steps in.\n       As Judge Bork has written, proper antitrust enforcement \n     actually ``increase[s] collective wealth by requiring that \n     any lawful products . . . be produced and sold under \n     conditions most favorable to consumers . . .. The law's \n     mission is to preserve, improve, and reinforce the powerful \n     economic mechanisms that compel businesses to respond to \n     consumers.'' That's an important point--preserving ``economic \n     mechanisms that compel businesses to respond to consumers.'' \n     [The Antitrust Paradox at 91 (1993).]\n       The $64,000 question, though--or, perhaps in today's \n     context I should say the $300 billion question--lies in \n     defining what actually injures consumer welfare, calling for \n     antitrust enforcement. For it is not enough to say that any \n     reduction in the amount of rivalry in a particular industry \n     reduces competition, injures consumers, and should be stopped \n     by antitrust laws. The very nature of competition and \n     capitalism is for firms to beat each other in the \n     marketplace. While this process--competition--certainly \n     benefits consumers, its natural outcome is that the firms who \n     succeed do so at the expense of other firms. [See id. at 49.]\n       Antitrust law certainly cannot be about punishing winners \n     or protecting losers. The goal is not simply to identify \n     practices that reduce competition or rivalry. Rather, it is \n     to identify when the exercise of market power impedes markets \n     from operating freely and, as a consequence, hurts consumers.\n       Where such situations can be identified, antitrust has the \n     additional burden of identifying effective remedies that \n     actually benefit consumers and are not more costly than the \n     so-called anticompetitive practices identified in the first \n     place. This sounds pretty simple, but it is not, especially \n     when you are dealing with highly complex, fast-moving \n     marketplaces such as high technology.\n       But it is my hope that those participating in this \n     symposium today will help those of us in policymaking or \n     enforcement positions arrive at the right answers. For \n     getting the answers right is, I would argue, more important \n     now than ever, especially with respect to these markets which \n     will be the key to our economy for years to come.\n\n\n       II. The Importance of Antitrust to the Digital Revolution\n\n       The stakes are high, because ill advised antitrust policy, \n     whether it is overly aggressive or overly timid, could have \n     drastic consequences for the future of our economy. I would \n     like to spend the rest of my time this morning explaining why \n     I think understanding and implementing appropriate antitrust \n     policy for the digital marketplace is a singularly important \n     policy issue.\n       1. First is the very simple fact that high technology \n     represents the most important sector of our economy. High \n     technology is the single largest industry in the United \n     States, leading all other sectors in terms of sales, \n     employment, exports, and research and development. [American \n     Electronics Association. ``Cybernation,'' 1997.]\n       Perhaps more importantly, high technology is the key to the \n     development of our future economy. Not only will \n     technology continue to be one of the driving forces behind \n     our economy's growth, but it also will drive the \n     development of the Internet, the ``Information Highway,'' \n     which, by all accounts, will fundamentally alter the way \n     we do business.\n       Even Congress, which has traditionally been an institution \n     of Luddites, is getting into the swing of things. \n     Communication and accountability to our constituents is much \n     improved by web sites and e-mail. Although, come to think of \n     it . . . we may want to rethink this e-mail thing. Now we get \n     feedback instantly--not even a grace period.\n       The future direction of the Internet will be shaped in no \n     small part by events occurring in today's marketplace. A \n     handful of developments in today's marketplace could, I \n     believe, have tremendous impact on the Internet, electronic \n     commerce, and information technology as a whole, for years to \n     come.\n       2. Which brings me to my second, somewhat related reason \n     for suggesting that antitrust enforcement in high technology \n     is a vitally important policy issue. We are currently in the \n     midst of important structural shifts in the computing world.\n       Given the unique nature of high technology markets, it is \n     with respect to precisely such technological paradigm shifts \n     that healthy competition and effective antitrust policy is \n     most important. Allow me a moment to elaborate on this point, \n     which I believe is a fundamental and important one.\n       As many economists and capitalists alike have come to \n     recognize--including, I might note, many of today's \n     participants, and software industry leaders such as Bill \n     Gates--the economic dynamics in so-called ``network'' markets \n     such as the software industry often allow individual firms to \n     garner unusually large market shares in particular segments.\n       Most who have studied such markets closely, agree that the \n     cyclical effects of network\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\n     effects or increasing returns can translate early market \n     leads into rather large market dominance, if not de facto \n     monopolies, as well as a significant degree of installed base \n     lock-in. This in itself is not anti-competitive when it \n     results from proper market behavior.\n       While lock-in effects and single firm dominance of \n     particular sectors certainly render a market less than \n     competitive, and consequently has costs in terms of consumer \n     welfare, it also produces an important positive effect.\n       When one firm dominates the market for a product which \n     serves as a platform--a product to which other software \n     developers will write their programs--that firm creates a de \n     facto standard, a uniform platform. Software developers thus \n     are not faced with the cost, in terms of time and resources, \n     to develop applications that run across a variety of \n     platforms. This can lead to significant boosts in \n     productivity and innovation.\n       Indeed, this is precisely what we have seen with respect to \n     Microsoft's successful establishment of the Windows monopoly, \n     which, by creating a uniform platform for software \n     developers, has had a tremendous effect in the recent boom in \n     software applications and the software industry generally. \n     Even those who are concerned about Microsoft's exercise of \n     its vast market power must enter this efficiency gain in the \n     ``plus'' column of their consumer welfare calculation. The \n     fact of the matter is that Microsoft and the success of \n     Windows has been an important ingredient in the innovation \n     and wealth creation our software industry has produced over \n     the past decade or so.\n       So, if a single firm's domination of a particular sector at \n     a particular point in time might be the result of perfectly \n     rational market behavior, and indeed may have some economic \n     benefits, where do we go from here? Does this mean that \n     antitrust is useless, irrelevant, or even counterproductive \n     in high technology markets? To some extent, perhaps. On \n     balance, the antitrust machinery in Washington, D.C. probably \n     shouldn't concern itself with every technology market which, \n     at a particular point in time, is dominated by a particular \n     firm to an unusual, even unhealthy extent.\n       Where antitrust policy should focus, I would propose (with \n     a large footnote to the Judiciary Committee testimony of \n     Professor Joseph Farrell, and other economists who have \n     studied these markets), is on the transition from one \n     technology to the next--on so-called paradigm or structural \n     shifts in computing.\n       While it may be likely and even, to a degree, useful, to \n     have a particular firm dominate a particular segment at any \n     point in time, it is dangerous, unhealthy, and harmful to \n     innovation and consumer welfare where that firm can exploit \n     its existing monopoly to prevent new competitors with \n     innovative, paradigm shifting technologies, from ever having \n     a fair shot at winning and becoming the new market leader or \n     de facto standard.\n       This is especially the case where a single firm exercises \n     predatory market power to prevent healthy competition over a \n     series of structural computing shifts. Where this is so, one \n     would imagine that investors and innovators would find other \n     things to do with their time and money than to try to compete \n     with the entrenched firm to establish an important new \n     technology. Innovation is chilled, and the consumer suffers.\n       The critical question, then, is how a dominant or monopoly \n     firm exercises its market power, even if fairly and naturally \n     obtained, with respect to the new guy that comes down the \n     pike offering an innovative, potentially paradigm shifting \n     technology. Does this new firm, offering a new technology \n     that may compete with, replace or otherwise threaten the old \n     firm's entrenched monopoly, have a legitimate opportunity to \n     compete in the marketplace?\n       To borrow a phrase recently attributed to Professor Carl \n     Shapiro, do innovative start-ups get a ``market test,'' or \n     are they ``killed in the crib before they get a chance to \n     become a core threat?'' [Steve Lohr with John Markoff, ``Why \n     Microsoft is Taking a Hard Line with the Government?'' The \n     New York Times, January 12, 1998 at D1.]\n       In high-technology markets displaying a high degree of \n     single-firm dominance, this is perhaps the most important \n     question for antitrust policymakers and enforcers:\n\n       To what extent are innovators who offer potentially \n     fundamental changes to the nature of computing given a fair \n     ``market test,'' and just what practices by the entrenched \n     firm should be considered anticompetitive or predatory \n     efforts to foreclose the opportunity for such a genuine \n     market test?\n\n       I believe this is precisely the question--or one of the \n     questions--presented by Microsoft today and is one of the \n     reasons why Microsoft in particular inescapably invites \n     scrutiny in the course of assessing competition policy in \n     this digital age.\n       Of course, while antitrust policy in the Digital Age \n     encompasses more than scrutiny of a particular firm, the fact \n     remains that Microsoft in particular does raise a handful of \n     questions, given its dominance of the desktop, together with \n     its admitted effort to coopt important paradigm shifts and, \n     in the process, extend its dominance to a number of new \n     markets.\n       The Internet generally and, more specifically, the \n     potential promise of browser software, and object-oriented, \n     ``write once, run anywhere'' software, represent important \n     and possibly critical developments for the computer industry. \n     Both the possibility of a new, browser-based platform and \n     interface, and the possibility of a programming language that \n     is genuinely platform independent, able to interoperate with \n     any type of operating system, could fundamentally change the \n     nature of computing.\n       Among other things, both of these developments, likely \n     representing the next generation in computing, introduced a \n     serious threat to Microsoft's desktop dominance. As we all \n     now know, Microsoft has clearly come to recognize as much.\n       Thus, with respect to both the so-called ``browser wars'' \n     and the battle between Java (Sun's essentially open \n     programming language) and ActiveX (Microsoft's proprietary \n     alternative to Java), we see Microsoft in a fever pitched \n     battle to control two potentially fundamental technological \n     developments and to prevent new technologies, developed by \n     other firms, from undercutting the current desktop monopoly \n     Windows enjoys.\n       I am confident that nobody from Microsoft would dispute \n     this assertion. Nor should they. Microsoft has all the right \n     in the world not to be asleep at the switch and allow a \n     fundamental, structural technology shift from undermining its \n     current dominance of the software market. Its shareholders no \n     doubt would demand as much.\n       At the same time, this is precisely where the practices of \n     a currently dominant firm, such as Microsoft, must be \n     scrutinized, and where the appropriate rules of the road must \n     be clarified and enforced. Tying arrangements, free product \n     offerings, licensing or marketing practices that are \n     effectively exclusionary--these and other practices may be \n     entirely appropriate in most instances.\n       But the question that, in my view, must be addressed is \n     whether such practices, when engaged in by an entrenched \n     monopolist with respect to paradigm shifting innovations, \n     have the predatory effect of foreclosing innovators from \n     getting a fair market test. Where they do, I would suggest \n     that we have a significant market imperfection which impedes \n     innovation, and in the process hurts both the industry and \n     the consumer.\n       The questions that I believe law enforcers and policymakers \n     must address are first, how to identify when particular \n     practices have such an effect; and, second, whether our \n     current antitrust regime adequately guides industry as well \n     as the courts and the enforcers to reach the right answer in \n     a timely fashion. These are some of the questions I plan to \n     give close scrutiny in the coming months, and which I hope to \n     learn more about from today's presenters and panelists.\n       Answering these questions, and coming up with the proper \n     policy and/or enforcement solutions, is more important now \n     than ever. The market battles being waged today are likely to \n     have significant consequences for the Digital Age tomorrow.\n       3. Which brings me to my third and final reason why I \n     believe sound antitrust policy is so critically important to \n     the Digital Age: because it could prove critical to the \n     growth of a free and open Internet.\n       Interfaces. In the proper hands, software interfaces are \n     everything. To oversimplify somewhat grossly, software \n     interfaces refer to certain critical external links or hooks \n     in a software program that permit other programs to \n     communicate, and therefore interoperate, with the first \n     program. Because interfaces are the key to interoperability, \n     and interoperability is the key to software markets, \n     relentlessly aggressive, savvy companies with vast resources \n     can be quite successful at translating the control of a \n     critical interface into control of the markets on either side \n     of the interface.\n       And the ultimate interfaces are the interfaces to Internet \n     access and content.\n       Microsoft has made no secret of the fact that it has made \n     dominating the Internet space a corporate priority. And I \n     credit them for it. Any genuine free-marketeer, any genuine \n     capitalist, must admire the efforts the company has recently \n     taken to go after what Microsoft itself has called the huge \n     ``pot of gold'' the Internet represents.\n       Like many, I cannot help but admire and applaud Microsoft's \n     drive to pursue this vision. Whether it be a no-holds barred \n     approach to competing with alternative browser vendors, \n     seeking to control Web software programming and tools markets \n     with proprietary products, buying the intellectual property \n     of WebTV, making large investments in the cable industry \n     while vying to control the operating systems of cable set-top \n     boxes, linking Internet content to the Windows desktop, or \n     any other of a handful of aggressive steps to control the \n     groundwells, plumbing and spigots of the Internet, one can \n     hardly question Microsoft's ambition to dominate the Internet \n     space, or their business savvy in getting there.\n       Just how much control over the Internet Microsoft will \n     exercise is anyone's guess, and I certainly do not pretend \n     that I know the answer. But many certainly do believe that \n     this is what Microsoft is out to achieve, in effect a \n     proprietary Internet, and that the answer lies in the outcome \n     of market battles which are being waged right now. For \n     controlling the key Internet interfaces is a critical step to \n     controlling much of the Internet itself.\n       This, then, is my third reason for why properly calibrated, \n     vigilant antitrust enforcement is all the more imperative \n     today. In the end, the marketplace should be permitted to \n     choose whether it wants a proprietary Internet. I think I \n     know what the answer would be. But I can assure you that, if\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\n     one company does exert such proprietary control over the \n     Internet, and the Internet does in fact become a critical \n     underlying medium for commerce and the dissemination of news \n     and information, rest assured that we will be hearing calls \n     from all corners for the heavy hand of government \n     regulation--for a new ``Internet Commerce Commission.''\n       It seems far better to have antitrust enforcement today \n     than heavy-handed regulation of the Internet tomorrow.\n       So, let me suggest to those of you who abhor the regulatory \n     state that you give this some thought. Vigilant and effective \n     antitrust enforcement today is far preferable than the heavy \n     hand of government regulation of the Internet tomorrow.\n\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n       In closing, I would like to come back to what I said at the \n     outset. These are difficult, but very important, policy \n     issues. Because of what is at stake, effective and \n     appropriate antitrust policy is critical to our digital \n     future. Antitrust policy that errs on either side--be it too \n     aggressive or too meek, could have serious consequences. But \n     because of the uniqueness, and the complexity of high \n     technology markets, discerning the proper role for antitrust \n     requires some fairly hard-headed analysis.\n       Those who dismissively say that technology is complicated \n     stuff that changes like quicksand are in a sense correct. \n     But, is the answer, as has been suggested by some politicians \n     and other new-found friends of Microsoft here in Washington, \n     simply to throw up our hands and move on to other, easier, \n     and less sensitive issues? Hardly.\n       Rather, let me suggest that the answer is to make sure that \n     the rules of the road are the right ones, and that the \n     referees do a good job enforcing them, when and where it is \n     appropriate. Antitrust policymakers and enforcers should not \n     shirk their duties just because the task is a hard one.\n       I have a great degree of confidence that the current head \n     of the Antitrust Department is up to the task, and, as \n     Chairman of the Committee with antitrust and intellectual \n     property jurisdiction, I plan to do what I can to ensure that \n     the rules are being applied both fairly and effectively. We \n     in Congress not only can, but in my view must, ask the \n     questions and help ensure the right answers.\n       Toward this end, I would like again to thank the Progress \n     and Freedom Foundation, and those who have dedicated the time \n     and intellectual effort to these difficult questions, for \n     taking a very productive step in this process of \n     understanding and implementing a sound, effective role for \n     antitrust policy in the Digital Age. I expect that we all \n     will learn a great deal from what I trust will be a vibrant \n     and energetic discourse throughout the remainder of the day.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want particularly to thank my friend \nfrom Nevada for agreeing to let me proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a unanimous consent request, the Senator \nfrom Nevada is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Washington, it was a pleasure to \nyield that time and to listen to his statement, which was typically \nmuch like the Senator from Washington; it was very thorough and \neducational for me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my statement, \nthe Senator from California be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S413-7", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S418-S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEED FOR THE HIGHWAY BILL NOW\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the State of Nevada is a large State, one of \nthe largest in the Union, 74 million acres. Nevada is also the most \nmountainous State in the Union except for Alaska. We have 314 separate \nmountain ranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. We also \nhave vast extremes in weather. In the southern part of the State it is \nnot unusual for places such as Laughlin, NV, in the southern tip of the \nState to reach temperatures of 120 degrees. In the northern part of the \nState we at times have the coldest place in the Nation, temperatures \nfar below zero that remain for days at a time.\n  The State of Nevada is also the fastest growing State in the Nation; \nwe also have the fastest growing city and the fastest growing county: \nthe city of Las Vegas city and Clark County. Every month, 7,800 new \nresidents move into Clark County. So we have an unusual State.\n  The reason I lay this on the Record today is that the State of Nevada \ndesperately needs a highway bill. We desperately need a surface \ntransportation bill brought before this body and debated and resolved. \nThe ISTEA legislation, as we call it, was a good piece of legislation \nwhen it passed in 1991. I was fortunate to be on the subcommittee that \ndrafted that legislation. I was fortunate to be able to work on that \ncommittee with the chairman of the committee, Senator Moynihan, and the \nranking member, now the chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee.\n  We did some unique things with that ISTEA legislation. We allowed \nmore spending but more of that spending power went to the individual \nStates. That was the main goal of the ISTEA legislation that passed in \n1991: turning more spending power and authority over to the States and \nlocalities while maintaining a strong national transportation system. \nAnd during the 6 years this legislation has been in effect it has \nworked well.\n  We have made progress in returning more authority to local \njurisdictions. I believe, when we are able to take up the bill that \ncame out of the committee, the bill which is now before this body, we \nwill continue along the same lines.\n  I rise today to say that I think we are breaking faith with the \nAmerican people by not having this legislation in the Chamber today. I \nhave outlined the problems we have in the State of Nevada. Because of \nthe mountains we have around the State, because of the extremes we have \nin weather around the State of Nevada, we badly need these highway \nfunds. All of this is compounded by the tremendous growth we are having \nin the State of Nevada.\n  The President came to Lake Tahoe last summer with the Vice President \nand five Cabinet officers. A commitment was made by the States of \nCalifornia and Nevada to do something about Lake Tahoe because it is \nbeing degraded environmentally. Everyone agrees--Republicans, \nDemocrats, conservatives, liberals, environmentalists, \nnonenvironmentalists--that the lake needs to be saved, and a commitment \nwas made at that time to save that lake. Part of the salvation of the \nlake comes in the form of transportation improvements in the ISTEA bill \nthat should be before this body.\n  Mr. President, the money that we are talking about spending is not \nnew tax dollars. We are not spending money that does not exist. Every \ntime an individual goes to a service station to buy gas, they put gas \nin their car and automatically, because of legislation that has been \npassed here, the money that comes from that purchase goes into a trust \nfund. That money is set aside for highway construction and surface \ntransportation. And so we are not here today demanding that we spend \nnew taxes for these roads that are badly needed in Nevada and around \nthe country. What we are saying is let's spend the money that is in the \ntrust fund. That is all we are asking. Let's spend the money. There has \nbeen a commitment made that those moneys that have been collected \nshould be spent on our surface transportation. The first step is to get \nthe highway bill done (and the sooner the better).\n\n  Mr. President, when I practiced law, we would set up trust funds for \nour clients, and it could be as a result of a contract that you were \ndealing with for your client, trying to resolve contractual \ndifferences; it could be for the sale of a piece of real estate; it \ncould be for a personal injury case. This money was put into a trust \nfund for the client. If in fact we used those trust fund moneys for \nanything else, to pay rent, to purchase a car, or to do something that \nwasn't in keeping with our client's wishes, we could be disbarred and \nin fact criminally prosecuted.\n  I cannot imagine that we are using these trust fund moneys for these \nhighways for some other purpose. If we did that in the private sector, \nwe would be subject, if we were a lawyer, to disbarment; if you were \nnot a lawyer, maybe to criminal prosecution and, in fact, if you were a \nlawyer to criminal prosecution.\n  So these highway trust fund moneys should be spent for the purpose \nfor which they were collected and no other purpose. Not for offsetting \nthe deficit, not for a fancy new spending program in some other place. \nThis money should be used for surface transportation. I cannot \nunderstand why we are not bringing this bill before this body \nimmediately.\n  When Congress was unable last year to complete its work on the long-\nterm reauthorization program, I was a strong proponent of the notion \nthat we needed to pass a short-term extension. The Presiding Officer at \nthis moment serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee with \nthis Senator. He, too, helped move the bill out of the\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\ncommittee, and we agreed that there should be a short-term extension to \nensure continuity in State programs and to live up to our obligation to \nthe American people to provide a world-class--in fact, the best--\ntransportation system.\n  That is what these trust fund moneys are all about. I supported this \nshort-term approach as a last resort. But I was under the assumption \nthat leadership here would allow us to move the surface transportation \nbill to the floor so that we could begin working on it as soon as we \nreturned from the recess. This has to happen. It was supposed to be one \nof the first things we brought up when we got back here.\n  The surface transportation bill made the States partners with the \nFederal Government. With this highway bill, we had more of a \npartnership than we had ever had before. The partnership was to build a \nstronger transportation system and to maintain a stronger \ntransportation system. We are leaving the departments of transportation \nin all States in the lurch by putting off work for months now. This is \nno way to treat a partner. If we are truly partners with the States, \ntheir departments of transportation, then certainly we should be moving \nthis legislation.\n  State transportation programs are continuing for the moment, but \nlet's not kid ourselves. These programs are dying. They are on life \nsupport, but they are dying. We designed the short-term extension in a \nway that we would, in effect, force ourselves to work on this \nlegislation after we came back after the first of the year. We are not \nfollowing through on that. Our goal was to allow the States to spend \nunallocated balances for a couple of months to prevent a lapse in the \nprograms. We didn't build an extra quarter or 6 months into that idle \ntime.\n  I congratulate and I applaud Senator Byrd, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, who has been on this floor and steadfastly \nand continually and very effectively has brought to the attention of \nthis body and the people of this country the need that we move to (and \npass) the surface transportation bill. The closer we get to the \nelection the harder it is going to be to do the right thing in regard \nto this legislation. If we wait until April, April is going to become \nJuly, and then July will become October. We should do this now. We \nshould move this bill as quickly as possible.\n  There are some States, including the State of Nevada, where we are \nlimited in terms of the amount of funds we can allocate because of bid-\nletting procedures. There are only certain times that we can let these \ncontracts--sometimes because of weather in parts of the State of \nNevada. As I have already described, because of the weather extremes, \nyou cannot do work all year round in the State of Nevada. So we need to \nlet these bids take place. As I have indicated, there are many parts of \nNevada, in the high Sierras and other parts of the State of Nevada, \nwhere the construction season is extremely short. Delays in \nreauthorization are going to lead to delays in roadbuilding and \nmaintenance soon. A delay of several months can easily lead to a delay \nof a year or more in the colder climates of our State.\n  This applies all over the country. Nevada is currently the fastest \ngrowing State in the Nation. As I indicated, about 8,000 people moved \nto Clark County last month--that's the Las Vegas area. In order to \naddress our long-term growth-related infrastructure needs, we need a 6-\nyear bill; not a 3-month bill, not a 6-month bill. Six-month bills do \nnot allow us to adequately plan for the future. It is unfair of this \nbody, this Congress, to arbitrarily wreck the planning processes of 50 \nStates and tens of thousands of highway construction workers and \ncontractors whose livelihood depends on the timely and consistent flow \nof these highway funds. We must move forward. To not do so is simply \nunfair. It is unfair for the Congress of this country to hold up the \ngas taxes that the people pay every time they fill up their tanks at a \nservice station while we continue collecting these huge sums of money \nevery day to go into this trust fund. We are not being fair to the \nAmerican public by not spending these trust funds.\n  We spend a lot of time in this body talking about States rights. \nLet's demonstrate our commitment to States by passing this highway \nbill. It is important we do it. It is important we do it tomorrow, not \nnext month or the month after that. Let's get to work on \nreauthorization today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, Congress has increased the priority of \nthe war on drugs in recent years. We've allocated nearly $300 million \nin additional funds to the U.S. Customs Service since 1996.\n  And I think all of us know that the Southwest Border is still, \nwithout question, ground zero in U.S. drug interdiction efforts, with \nmore than 70% of the cocaine and other narcotics entering this country \nacross the 2,000 mile stretch of border between our country and Mexico.\n  To meet this threat Congress authorized more than $100 million over \nthe last two years to add 650 inspectors and employ state of the art \ntechnologies along the Southwest border. The President's budget in \nfiscal year 1999 calls for an additional $104 million for Southwest \nBorder narcotics efforts.\n  So you can imagine my surprise when I opened yesterday's edition of \nthe Los Angeles Times to read the following:\n\n       The amount of cocaine seized at the commercial ports of \n     entry along the U.S./Mexico border plummeted 84% in 1997, \n     forcing U.S. Customs Service officials to develop a new drug \n     fighting strategy and leaving them concerned about a backlash \n     in Congress.\n\n  Well, Mr. President there is a backlash from this United States \nSenator because for five and a half years now I have sounded a constant \ndrumbeat on Treasury and on Customs to stop the mixed missions of the \nCustoms Department and understand that there is a major problem with \ncocaine coming across the Southwest Border. Frankly an 84% drop in \nseizures last year indicates that all of the money and all of the \npersonnel we have been pumping in has simply not done the job. 84% at \nthe Southwest border, and cocaine seizures are down 15% across the \nnation.\n  If someone could tell me the reason for the drop is because, overall, \nthere is less cocaine coming into the country--I'd say, \ncongratulations, our efforts have been successful.\n  But that doesn't appear to be the case. Narcotics intelligence \nofficials continue to warn that an estimated 5 to 7 tons of cocaine \nenters this country every single day of the year. We are just not \ngetting it.\n  If someone could tell me that the drop along the Southwest Border is \nbecause our efforts have been so successful, that the drug smugglers \nare going elsewhere--I'd say bravo, the taxpayers' money has been well \nspent.\n  But, again, that does not appear to be the case. Customs officials \nare widely quoted in news reports saying the problem is that the drug \ntraffickers continue to stay two steps ahead of our interdiction \nefforts. And in fact, that is the case.\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\n  Let me again quote from this article:\n\n       Customs officials received a warning in June 1997 that \n     portions of the agency's enforcement strategy at the ports \n     had been compromised. A June 20, 1997 memo from Assistant \n     Commissioner Robert S. Trotter to all Southwest border port \n     directors warned that ``traffickers have developed detailed \n     knowledge and profiles of our port operations''.\n\n  More than once, Customs officials have come into my office to tell me \nthat--not only is it not possible to increase inspection of trucks and \ncars entering our border, obviously because there are so many of them--\nit is not really necessary, because today we are applying sophisticated \ntechnology, including electronic technology, random searches, and \nCustoms' vast intelligence operations and all of that combined is \nenough to do the job.\n  Four years ago I went and spent a day at the Otay Mesa port at the \nSouthwest border. I observed, directly adjacent to our Customs \nfacilities, ``spotters'' who are individuals standing out on the street \nwith radios and cellular telephones. I then went up to a hill \noverlooking the Customs facility and I watched the spotters work. They \nget on their phones and they talk to the trucks waiting to cross the \nborder and they direct the trucks as to which lines they should be in \nto get through the border.\n\n  I mentioned this at the highest levels of the Treasury, both verbally \nand in writing. I said that we must do something about the spotters. \nFour years later, the spotters are still there, they are still \noperational. I am told that there is no law under which we can do \nanything about it. Unfortunately, at no time has Customs come forward \nin this four year period with any recommendations for any laws to be \npassed to deter this activity which is almost certainly an illegal \nconspiracy to bring cocaine into this country across the Southwest \nborder.\n  The ``random'' searches that I have heard so much about are supposed \nto keep traffickers trembling in their big-rigs. But they have become \nso predictable that, by Customs' own admission, ``traffickers know what \ncargo, conveyances, or passengers we inspect, how many of those \nconveyances are checked on an average day, what lanes we work harder, \nand what lanes are more accessible for smuggling.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not insensitive to how difficult this task \nis, and I want to commend the extremely hard working men and women of \nthe United States Customs Service. I know many of them personally. I \nknow they work hard. I know they try to do their job. They put on those \nuniforms every day, they inhale all of these exhaust fumes, and they \ntry to keep up with what has been a massive increase in traffic coming \nacross the border.\n  But, Mr. President, I do not like to be told how effective our \nintelligence is, and how sophisticated our technology is, and how tough \nour enforcement efforts are--and then read reports in the newspaper \nfrom Customs' officials about how easily the traffickers are walking \nall over us.\n  I do appreciate the candor from Acting Commissioner Sam Banks on the \nweaknesses in our efforts. And I understand that Customs is moving very \nrapidly to counter this 84% drop in seizures with a new operation \nentitled ``Operation Brass Ring''. They clearly know that what they are \ndoing is insufficient.\n  For some time, I have believed that the mixed mission given by the \nAdministration to the United States Customs Service creates a situation \nwhereby the law enforcement functions of the United States Customs \nService cannot be carried out properly.\n  You cannot run an agency with a mixed mission, especially a mission \nthat has the kind of a diametrically different goals that Customs \nfaces. Move the trucks by the millions, just do random searches, depend \nonly on technology, and avoid statistics like the one that just \nappeared in the Los Angeles Times with an 84% drop in seizures in \ncocaine coming across the Southwest border.\n  I have urged the Administration to appoint a law enforcement person \nas the new Commissioner of Customs. I am heartened to understand that \nthe Administration has just signed off on the appointment of Ray Kelly \nas the new Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service.\n  I have worked with Mr. Kelly over the past few years as he has been \nthe Secretary for Enforcement in the Treasury Department. I believe he \nis a straight shooter. He is a law enforcement person. He has an \nexemplary background. I hope that he will be able to redirect the \nCustoms Service to understand that they do have a law enforcement \nmission. And, in fact, that that mission is to deter contraband from \ncoming across the border of the United States.\n  We also know, Mr. President, that guns in large supply are moving \nfrom this country down to Mexico. These guns are used for two purposes. \nOne is to give them to the cartels for their use and the second is for \nrevolutionary insurrection against the government of Mexico.\n  I believe that the work of the United States Customs is really cut \nout for them. In the best of all worlds, trade will continue to \nincrease across the Southwest Border, providing jobs and income for \nthose on both sides of the border.\n  But if we are serious about the drug threat--as we say we are--we \nmust demand that the law enforcement functions of deterring contraband \nbe made the highest mission of the United States Customs Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled \n``Drop in Drug Seizures Worries U.S. Customs'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 4, 1998]\n\n               Drop in Drug Seizures Worries U.S. Customs\n\n                             (By H.G. Reza)\n\n       San Diego--The amount of cocaine seized at the commercial \n     ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted 84% in \n     1997, forcing U.S. Customs Service officials to develop a new \n     drug-fighting strategy and leaving them concerned about a \n     backlash in Congress.\n       Bill Heffelsinger, assistant to acting customs Commissioner \n     Samuel H. Banks, said Tuesday that inspectors working at the \n     high-risk commercial ports on the Southwest border \n     confiscated 2,383 pounds of cocaine last year, compared to \n     15,114 pounds in 1996.\n       Nationwide, the quantity of cocaine seized by the agency \n     dropped 15% last year to 159,475 pounds, compared to 187,947 \n     pounds in 1996, Heffelsinger added. The total number of \n     seizures by customs agents and inspectors of all kinds of \n     drugs was a record 26,240 nationwide last year, authorities \n     said.\n       Acting Commissioner Banks, in an interview Tuesday, said \n     the drop in cocaine seizures is worrisome. ``You look at \n     those numbers and you want to be your own worst critic,'' \n     Banks said. ``You're going to be asked questions on [Capitol] \n     Hill, and we have to provide answers [for how to stop the \n     flow of drugs].''\n       Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said Tuesday he was \n     disappointed by customs' failure to seize more cocaine at the \n     commercial ports.\n       ``Congress has directed almost every possible resource \n     toward drug interdiction efforts, including more agents, \n     better technology and several hundred million dollars in \n     additional funding,'' said Packard. ``These are not the \n     results we expected. If interdiction is down, the American \n     people deserve some answers.''\n       Customs officials hope to find answers through Operation \n     Brass Ring, a new nationwide drug interdiction strategy \n     launched by the agency this week. Officials said the \n     operation is part of a broader five-year program by the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy to reduce by 50% the \n     amount of illegal drugs entering the country and, according \n     to a news release, ``was designed almost entirely in the \n     field by . . . inspectors, investigators and union \n     representatives.''\n       Memos obtained by The Times show that the new strategy \n     comes at a time of concern among customs union officials over \n     possible political repercussions resulting from the drop in \n     the amount of cocaine caught at the commercial ports.\n       A Nov. 28, 1997, National Treasury Employees Union memo \n     noted that Congress had authorized $64 million in funding in \n     1997 for 657 new enforcement positions along the Southwest \n     border as part of Operation Hard Line, the drug interdiction \n     plan in effect at the time.\n       Hard Line was launched in 1995 after The Times reported \n     that there had been virtually no cocaine seizures at the \n     biggest commercial ports on the U.S.-Mexico border, where \n     thousands of trucks cross daily.\n       The union memo predicted that ``no doubt Congress will be \n     highly upset with these [1997] figures . . . border drug \n     interdiction is becoming a major political issue in \n     Washington.''\n       Another union memo on Dec. 22 said new ``enforcement \n     operations'' were needed and urged inspectors to be flexible \n     and imaginative in their approach to drug interdiction.\n       ``The objective being to increase our seizures so customs \n     and [the union] don't get their heads handed to them by the \n     politicians in Washington when the budget meetings start in \n     March,'' the memo said.\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\n       Robert Tobias, president of the employees union, said he \n     would not apologize for the blunt talk in the memos.\n       ``This was me doing my job as president to inform [members] \n     what the stakes are,'' said Tobias. ``There's nothing wrong \n     with telling people that if you don't get off your duff \n     you're in danger of losing your job. Brass Ring is a wake-up \n     call to all of us involved in fighting drugs.''\n       On Tuesday, Banks said he was pleased that the president's \n     proposed customs operating budget for 1999, publicly \n     announced Tuesday, was $1.8 billion, up from $1.7 billion in \n     1998. That budget must still be approved by Congress.\n       Banks said he was willing to publicly admit some of the \n     agency's enforcement problems ``so we can get the issue out \n     there, even if it's critical to us.''\n       ``I'm willing to take it on the chin if necessary to get \n     the message out, so we can focus on the drug problem,'' said \n     Banks. ``I want to get the message out to the American public \n     so they can deal with it in the community and in schools.''\n       Banks said Brass Ring will ``dramatically increase drug \n     seizures'' at the 24 points of entry on the U.S.-Mexico \n     border.\n       ``The push for Brass Ring is to turn up the heat internally \n     and get people focused. We're trying to get people focused. \n     We're trying to put the heat on ourselves,'' Banks said.\n       A Nov. 28, 1997, report by the union said that \n     ``intelligence sources are reporting that 5 to 7 tons of \n     illegal drugs are being smuggled from Mexico to the U.S. \n     every day.''\n       In the interview Tuesday, Banks said he does not dispute \n     the union's figures.\n       Concern over the declining cocaine interdiction figures \n     arose in September, when Banks reported in a memo to customs \n     employees that he had met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, head of \n     the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Sept. 18, \n     1997, memo said that ``we were asked some tough questions \n     about the effectiveness of our various operations, and we did \n     not always have convincing answers.''\n       Heffelsinger said the biggest problem in customs' \n     interdiction plan had been its predictability.\n       In 1997, 3.5 million trucks and rail cars crossed into the \n     United States from Mexico at the commercial ports along the \n     border from Texas to California and about 30% were inspected \n     for narcotics, customs officials said. An equal number of \n     trucks and rail cars crossed in 1996, and 25% were inspected \n     for drugs that year, they added.\n       However, ``we aren't as unpredictable as we would like to \n     be. The goal of Brass Ring is to get back to being \n     unpredictable,'' Heffelsinger said.\n       Customs officials received a warning in June 1997 that \n     portions of the agency's enforcement strategy at the ports \n     had been compromised. A June 20, 1997, memo from Assistant \n     Commissioner Robert S. Trotter to all Southwest border port \n     directors warned that ``traffickers have developed detailed \n     knowledge and profiles of our port operations.''\n       Trotter said that spotters, commonly used by drug rings to \n     warn of enforcement activity at the ports, ``have determined \n     what cargo, conveyance or passengers we inspect, how many of \n     those conveyances are checked on an average day, what lanes \n     we work harder and what lanes are more accessible for \n     smuggling.''\n       Banks acknowledged that customs has still not learned how \n     to defeat the spotters, who work in the open on the U.S. side \n     at the gates to the commercial ports.\n       ``There's no question that people are sitting at the ports, \n     shepherding loads and acting as guides,'' said Banks. ``We're \n     trying to turn the tables on them and use them against \n     themselves. Counter surveillance is part of [the Brass Ring \n     strategy], but I can't say more.''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, it is imperative that the Senate turn \nimmediately to the consideration of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1997. We now have less than 45 days \nremaining in which the Senate will be in session between today and May \n1, 1998.\n  On May 1 of this year, our State highway departments throughout the \nland and our transit providers across the Nation will be forbidden by \nlaw from obligating any new Federal highway or transit funds. That is \nthe drop-dead date. That is the deadline.\n  What will it mean to individual States when they no longer can move \nforward on a comprehensive highway construction program? What will it \nmean to your State? What will it mean to mine? What will it mean for \nour Nation's highway construction workers when they are thrown out of \nwork, when that paycheck stops and when they have to struggle to put a \nmeal on their family table?\n  What will it mean for our urban transit systems when they must cease \nprogress on projects, projects that are needed to minimize congestion \nand to move our constituents to work, to schools, to places of worship, \nto child care centers, and back home?\n  It will mean disruption, deprivation, and, in cases where some \nconstruction projects need to go forward for the sake of safety, it \nwill mean that accidents, injuries, and perhaps even death may be the \nresult because of our delay--our inexcusable delay. There is no excuse \nfor the delay.\n  On Monday of this week, the President sent his formal budget request \nfor fiscal year 1999 to the Congress. That budget calls for the overall \nobligation ceiling for our Federal aid highway programs to be frozen. \nNow hear that! This is the President's budget, calling for the Federal \naid highway program to be frozen for each of the next 6 years at the \nlevel enacted for FY 1998, namely, $21.5 billion.\n  The President ran for office the first time on a strong platform \nrecommending more infrastructure in this country, more highways, safer \nbridges, but the President now is proposing an absolute freeze on \nhighway spending for the next 5 years; never mind the tremendous unmet \nneeds that exist across this Nation for bridge and highway \nconstruction, and for safety improvements; never mind a critical \nprovision in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which is there by virtue \nof an amendment that was offered by my friend and colleague from Texas, \nSenator Phil Gramm; never mind that critical provision in the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, a bill that the President signed into law with much \nfanfare, and rightly so, last year.\n  That bill included a provision transferring the 4.3 cent gas tax--\nthat had been used for deficit reduction since 1993--into the highway \ntrust fund, so that it could not be used for other programs, instead of \nthe highway program, but could be used to address these serious highway \ndeficiencies. But even with this new source of revenue to the trust \nfund--roughly $7 billion per year--the President's budget now calls for \nthe overall Federal obligation ceiling for highways to increase by how \nmuch? Not one copper cent! Not one penny; not one penny! Over the next \n5 years, it is to be frozen.\n  Under the President's budget, the uncommitted balance of the highway \ntrust fund will grow and grow and grow, like topsy. Based on estimates \nthat I have received from the Congressional Budget Office, under the \ncommittee-reported bill, the unspent balance of the highway trust fund \nwill grow from $25.7 billion at the end of this fiscal year to more \nthan $71.8 billion at the close of the authorization period covered by \nthe next ISTEA legislation.\n\n  At that time, therefore, there will be almost $72 billion that would \njust sit unspent in the highway trust fund; $72 billion paid by you out \nthere, paid by you, the buyers of gasoline; $72 billion paid by our \nconstituents--yours, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, and mine--paid by our constituents at the gas pump--money \nthat will be deposited into the highway trust fund but not used. Not \nused.\n  Under the President's budget, the trust fund balance would grow even \nlarger, since his 5-year highway freeze is some $9.6 billion less than \nwould even be authorized in the committee-reported bill which we \ndebated on this Senate floor for about 21 days last fall.\n  I do not believe that a majority of this body supports the notion \nthat highway spending should be frozen for the next 5 years, while the \nunspent balance in the highway trust fund rises by roughly 300 percent \nover the next 6 years. I am confident that a majority of this body does \nnot support that idea.\n  I do believe, however, that it is incumbent for this Senate to take \nup the highway bill, to take it up immediately and to make it clear \nthat we do not support the President's proposal for a 5-year freeze on \nhighway spending.\n  Let the President hear that message, loud and clear. We do not \nsupport a 5-\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\nyear freeze on highway spending, nor do the American people support \nthat. I am confident they don't.\n  The financial needs of our national highway network vastly exceed our \ncurrent levels of expenditure. If we freeze highway spending for the \nnext 5 years, the gap between what will be needed just to maintain the \npresent inadequate conditions of our Nation's highways, on the one \nhand, and what we will be able to spend, that gap is going to grow \nwider and wider and wider, and we will fall farther and farther behind.\n  Yet, Mr. President, the Department of Transportation has stated that \nour Nation would be required to spend an extra $15 billion each year \nabove current spending levels just to maintain the current conditions \nof our Nation's highways. We would have to boost spending on highways \nby more than $15 billion a year to make the least bit of improvement \noverall in the condition of our Nation's highways. Now, that is what \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation is telling us.\n  And what are the current conditions of our Nation's highways? At \npresent, only 39 percent of our National Highway System is rated in \ngood condition. That is not what Senator Byrd is saying, that is what \nSenator Byrd says that the U.S. Department of Transportation says. \nFully 61 percent of our Nation's highways are rated in either fair or \npoor condition.\n  For our 42,794 mile interstate system, the crown jewel of our \nNational Highway System, one-half of the mileage is rated in fair or \npoor condition. These figures only worsen when one looks at our other \nmajor and Federal State highways. In our urban areas, 65 percent of our \nnoninterstate highway mileage is rated in fair or poor condition.\n  There are over a quarter of a billion miles of pavement in the United \nStates that is in poor or mediocre condition. This is what the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation tells us. There are almost 95,000 bridges \nin our country that have been classified as deficient, and within that \ntotal, roughly 44,000 bridges have been deemed to be structurally \ndeficient, meaning that they need significant maintenance, \nrehabilitation or replacement.\n  Many of these bridges require load posting, requiring heavier trucks \nto take longer alternate routes. That affects our efficiency, our \nproductivity and our overall economy. And an additional 51,000 bridges \nhave been deemed to be functionally deficient, meaning that they do not \nhave the lane width, shoulder width or vertical clearances sufficient \nto serve the traffic demand. The condition of our highway system is \nfast becoming a national disgrace.\n  As I said, Mr. President, to make any improvements at all in these \nconditions, to keep these conditions from worsening further, we would \nhave to boost spending in our highways, according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, by more than $15 billion annually.\n  With that backdrop, it defies sanity that the administration wants to \nfreeze highway spending over the next 5 years. Every driving American \npays gas taxes. We have told them that that money would go toward \nincreased highway investments. What will we tell them now? Mr. \nPresident, this Senate needs to take an immediate step to call up the \nhighway bill and to tell the traveling public that we do not support \nfreezing highway spending for the next 6 years.\n  Why wait until May 1, when our States will be prohibited from \nobligating any Federal funds on highway or transit projects? We should \ncall up the highway bill and make it clear to America that we meant \nwhat we said when we voted to transfer the 4.3 cents gas tax from \ndeficit reduction to the highway trust fund. An overwhelming majority \nof the Senate supported that transfer. The administration may have \nfrozen the transportation budget, but this Senate does not have to \nfreeze in a stupor of suspended animation while we watch our States \ncareen toward a certain brick wall. There are only 45 days left. Now is \nthe time--now is the time--to take the next step by moving to the \nhighway bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may reserve that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 20 \nminutes, and then at the conclusion, following the time reserved for \nthe Senator from West Virginia, that Senator Bond be recognized to \nproceed with the measure that was originally planned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, last Monday several Senators came to the \nfloor to express their concern because the Senate has failed to pass a \nreauthorization of the Nation's surface transportation programs. \nSenator Byrd was on the floor again Tuesday and indeed has been on the \nfloor today, Thursday, on this same subject. As Senators and the \nAmerican people listen to these expressions of concern, I hope they \nwill keep the bigger picture in mind.\n  First, why hasn't the Senate passed an ISTEA II bill that would \nreauthorize our highway and transit programs? Well, it isn't for lack \nof trying, Mr. President. That bill was before the Senate for a period \nof more than 2 weeks at the close of the session last year. But Senate \nconsideration of the bill was blocked by a filibuster, a filibuster \nthat was supported by some of the very Senators who now complain about \nlack of action.\n  The majority leader filed four--not one, not two, not three, but \nfour--cloture petitions to force action on the bill. I voted for \ncloture each and every time. Almost all the Members on this side of the \naisle voted for cloture each and every time. But on the other side of \nthe aisle we did not get much support for acting on ISTEA; in fact, we \ndid not get any support. Considering that, Senators who now come to the \nfloor demanding action on this bill used the procedural rules of the \nSenate to block action just a few short weeks ago. They voted to block \nISTEA four times, as I say. Not once, not twice, not three, but four \ntimes they blocked action on proceeding to ISTEA.\n  On four separate occasions, when these Senators could have used their \npower as voting Members of this body to help the majority leader move \nthis vital legislation forward, they voted no. They would not help. If \nthey believe ISTEA is a vital bill, why didn't they help? With their \nhelp we could have completed Senate action last year.\n  Last Monday, one Senator even said that Congress is ``derelict in its \nduty'' because it has not acted on the ISTEA reauthorization. Now, \n``derelict in its duty'' is a pretty strong statement. Well, who is it \nthat has been derelict? It has not been the majority leader. He forced \nfour cloture votes on this bill. I did everything I could to move the \nbill forward. I was ready then. I am ready now.\n  If dereliction of duty is a fair charge, I suppose it is a charge \nmost appropriately aimed at those Senators who voted against cloture on \nthis bill four separate times. There is a record. Anyone can look up \nand see who those Senators were.\n\n  Now, my second point goes to the schedule for completing action on \nISTEA. The Senators who spoke Monday and Tuesday were talking as if \nSenate action is all that is needed to wrap this matter up now. They \nwent on at great length about how the States need early Senate action \nso the States can plan for the coming construction season. These \nSenators expressed great frustration on behalf of the States because \nany further delay will greatly complicate the work of the States.\n  Well, I am sympathetic to the plight of our State transportation \ndepartments because this bill has been delayed. I wish we were at the \nend of the day and the States had the bottom-line allotments they need \nfor their planning, but as everybody knows, Senate action on this bill \nis only a very small step in a long traveling process.\n  The House has to do a bill. That bill is likely to be very different \nfrom the Senate bill so, therefore, we have to resolve the differences \nin conference and then bring the bill back for passage in the \nrespective bodies. Any State that did any planning based solely on a \nSenate-passed bill would be making a\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\ngreat mistake. Frankly, they cannot make any plans until the entire \nprocess is completed.\n  Now, everyone knows that the House has made a very firm decision to \npostpone action on this transportation legislation, so-called ISTEA \nreauthorization, until the budget resolution for fiscal year 1999 is \ncompleted. That is a fact. The House has said that. Even if we passed \nISTEA II in the Senate this afternoon, we would not speed up the \nprocess one iota. Even if we passed it last year when some of us were \nhere on the floor ready to take action we would still be forced to wait \nfor the House to complete its work.\n  As I look at the calendar, the House is making the task facing the \nStates more difficult. But we cannot change the calendar by voting on \nthis bill today on the floor of the Senate.\n  So what is really going on here, Mr. President? Why would Senators \nwho voted to block action on this bill just a few weeks ago now come to \nthe floor demanding action today? Why would Senators who know that we \nhave to wait for the budget resolution to be completed before the House \nwill act speak as if the Senate is ``dithering and dallying and \ndelaying'' on this bill?\n  The real issue, Mr. President, is how much money are we going to \nspend on the highway program. That is the real question. The Senators \nwho are clamoring for action now are the sponsors of a big amendment to \ndramatically increase Federal highway spending. They want the bill to \ncome up now because they want their amendment for highway spending to \nbe considered now in a budgetary vacuum with no other priorities \ncompeting for the dollars they would like to spend on highways.\n  A week ago, the President of the United States delivered his State of \nthe Union Address. Perhaps the most memorable line in that speech was \nhis call to use any future budget surpluses for ``Social Security \nFirst.''\n  If there is a surplus--and at this point everybody should keep in \nmind it is a projected surplus; the dollars have not actually come in \nyet--the President said Congress should not spend the money and \nCongress should not cut taxes; rather, we should use the surplus to \nshore up the Social Security system so that it can go on meeting the \nretirement needs of all Americans well into the next century.\n  Those Senators who are calling for action on the highway bill now are \nnot exactly in the President's camp when it comes to Social Security \nfirst. They might be called the ``Highway First\" crowd. They want the \nSenate to take up the highway bill so that they can put a big \nproportion of the potential surplus into more highway spending before \nanybody else, including Social Security, can lay claim to that \nprojected budget surplus.\n  ``Highways First,'' that is their motto. I must say, I find their \narguments astonishing, especially when they are expressed by the \nSenator from Texas. It comes down to this. ``The Government has a \nsurplus. We must spend the surplus. To do otherwise would break a \nsolemn oath we made to the American people.''\n  Now, the surplus that the Senator from Texas most frequently mentions \nin the context of the highway bill is one that will result because of \naction taken last year to put the revenue from the 4.3-cent gasoline \ntax imposed in 1993, that was passed to reduce the deficit--and the \nvote, as has been pointed out today, was to transfer that--into the \nhighway trust fund.\n  In 1993, when the Democratic Party still controlled the Congress, \ngasoline taxes were increased by 4.3 cents per gallon with the revenue \ngoing to the general fund to reduce the deficit. The Senate Republicans \nall voted against that tax increase in 1993. But last year, with the \nRepublicans in charge, the revenue from that tax increase was \ntransferred into the highway trust fund from the deficit reduction area \nwhere it was before. And now we are asked to spend it.\n  Now, the notion--this is something I really want to stress --the \nnotion that anybody promised the American people to spend that 4.3 \ncents on highway construction is preposterous. It is just the opposite. \nThe American people were promised that that 4.3-cent increase would be \nused to bring down the deficit, not to increase spending programs.\n\n  Now that the deficit is under control, the Senator from Texas has led \nthe charge to transfer the revenue from that tax to the highway trust \nfund. As a result, the highway trust fund is projected to run a big \nsurplus in the future. And without even a blush, the Senator from Texas \nsays we are bound by a solemn commitment to prevent that surplus. Pour \nit into highway spending whether it is needed or not--tax and spend. \nNever was there a more open and shut case of the ``tax and spend'' \nfever.\n  The clamor we have heard over the past few days to do ISTEA now is \nall about spending the surplus. And who is going to be first at the \ntrough? It is not about dereliction of duty. Senators who voted four \ntimes to block the bill just a few weeks ago are in no position now to \nsuggest that the Senate is shirking its duty.\n  And it is not about when this bill will ultimately be concluded. I \nwish it were done already. It is a burden, as anybody knows. No one \nknows better than some of the Senators on the floor today what it is \nlike to manage a complicated, contentious piece of legislation such as \nthe surface transportation legislation.\n  I wish that we could have accelerated the schedule by acting here in \nthe Senate today. Unfortunately, we are not in control of the calendar. \nThe House has decided, as I said before, to wait until the budget \nresolution has been completed.\n  What these Senators really want for the Senate is to vote on their \namendment to spend more on highways before any other priorities can \nmake a claim on this potential surplus. ``Highways First,'' as I say, \nis their motto.\n  I know there are many Members of this body who believe we should \nspend more on highways, maybe not ``Highways First,'' not take it all, \nbut some more. For those Senators, I would make three quick points.\n  First, the bill reported by the committee--the committee I am \nchairman of that brought the bill to the floor--dramatically increases \nhighway spending. It is up over 20 percent over ISTEA I. It is up $25 \nbillion over the 6-year period. In the context of the balanced budget \namendment reached last year, that essentially freezes discretionary \nspending over the next 5 years. And here is a program that gets a 20 \npercent increase. Thus, no one can argue that we did not do very well \nin connection with this piece of legislation.\n  As a second point, if Senators believe that even more is needed, they \nwill have the opportunity to make that case when the Senate considers \nthe budget resolution in March. The committee-reported bill tracks the \nspending levels given to us in the budget resolution last year. We have \nfollowed our instructions in and abided by the budget that this Senate \nadopted, and the ink is hardly dry on it. It was only signed by the \nPresident I believe in July. If the Senate changes course and wants to \nincrease spending in the budget resolution for next year, then I would \nassume an amendment to ISTEA II to carry out that instruction would be \nadopted.\n  Third, Senators should be careful about the sequence of these \ndecisions. I believe that many Senators have signed on to the so-called \nByrd-Gramm amendment without fully understanding all the subtleties. It \ndoes authorize massive amounts of additional spending, but it also \nrestructures who has first claim to the funds that are actually \nappropriated.\n  The Byrd-Gramm amendment increases the share of the pie going to 13 \nAppalachian Regional Commission States and to a trade corridor program \nthat would benefit a few States, such as Texas. Their portion of the \npie gets bigger. But if the pie itself does not grow because there is \nno room in the budget for larger appropriations, the net effect will be \nthat all the other States will go down. In other words, they are locked \nin at this increased amount for the Appalachian Regional Commission \nStates and this corridor dealing with the so-called NAFTA demands. That \nis locked in under the proposal that they have. And if we do not \nincrease the overall spending, then theirs stays up there and it comes \nout of the portion allocated to all the other States.\n  A Senator voting for Byrd-Gramm now because he or she wants to \nincrease highway spending authorization could actually cause his or her \nState to lose highway dollars if subsequent\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nbudget decisions do not provide for increased highway appropriations. \nSo I urge everyone to be cautious on this matter.\n  All these considerations have persuaded me that the wisest course is \nthe one that Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, has \nurged. Let's make the spending decisions in the context of the entire \nbudget. I'm ready to go with ISTEA II now. I am more committed to \ngetting ISTEA done than any other Member of this body. I want it \ncompleted, but I am willing to stand down for the time being because I \nbelieve the Senate will make better public policy if it considers \nhighway spending in the context of the entire budget rather than in the \nvacuum of these early days of the session, as the highways first group \nhas been urging.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, at last we have smoked him out. I have \nbeen speaking on this floor urging that the leadership bring up the \nhighway bill. So we are having a good debate today. That is what we \nhave been needing all along. The debate is just starting.\n  I'm glad that my friend has come out of the bushes. Let's debate this \nmatter, but let's debate it with the bill before the Senate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Without it being charged as my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How did the Senator vote on the cloture motion when we \ntried to move to this bill in October, late September, October?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator thinks he has me over a barrel. \nI voted against cloture. I make no bones about that.\n  But why finger point at that bill? Finger pointing isn't going to \nresolve the problems that are going to confront our highway departments \nand our Governors and our mayors throughout this country. That is not \ngoing to do any good, Senator.\n  Yes, I voted against cloture. I would like to see a campaign finance \nreform bill, but I would also like to see a highway bill. So forget \nwhat happened back there on cloture.\n  Lot's wife looked back and she turned to salt. Let's don't look back. \nLet's keep our promise, the promise that was made to bring up this \nhighway bill. I didn't make that promise. The leadership of the Senate \nmade that promise.\n  This is not a partisan matter, Mr. President. Republicans and \nDemocrats buy gas at the gas station. Republicans and Democrats pay a \ngas tax. Republicans and Democrats use the highways of this country and \nthe transit systems. Republicans and Democrats are injured and die when \nsafety conditions get to the point where accidents occur. So this is \nnot a partisan matter.\n  I know that the Senator from Rhode Island is against that amendment. \nHe has been all along. He was against it when the bill was up last \nfall. That is a given. There is no surprise in that. But, Mr. \nPresident, the promise was made to bring up the highway bill.\n  Now, I have been around this Senate a long time, and this is the \nfirst time I have heard that the House controls the Senate calendar. I \ndon't believe that, and I have reason to believe that if the Senate \nwill act, the House might change its mind. Why should the House control \nthe calendar here? The highway needs are out there. The Senator knows \nthat. They exist in his own State. They exist in my State. They exist \nin every State in this country.\n  The highway departments and the Governors and the mayors don't know \nhow to plan their budgets for this year because they don't know what \nFederal resources they can count on and they can't do long-term \nplanning. When we talk about highways, those plans have to be long \nterm.\n  I say to the Senator, why not have a bill up now? Let's debate it, \nbut let's debate while we are on the bill. That is the promise that was \nmade. I didn't make that promise. I'm not attacking any Senator \npersonally. I am urging the Senate leadership to take up the bill. Why \nnot have the bill before the Senate? Now, if we take up the bill, the \nHouse will surely move, I would think. The pressure will be on them. We \ncan't base our actions on what the House might do.\n  The House schedule doesn't change the May 1 deadline, Senator. The \nMay 1 deadline is only 45 days away, and the House schedule won't \nchange that. That is approaching. Every day that we waste here, sitting \non our hands talking about other matters, some of which are important, \nsome of which are not--I pointed out just the other day that we wasted \nover 3 hours in one day in recesses and in quorum calls. We could be \ndebating this bill, my friend. I hope that the Senator will join us in \nurging the leadership to bring this bill up. I would like to hear the \nSenator on the floor every day. I would like to hear his voice rising, \nup sometimes, up and down. I hope he will join us because I would like \nto be here with him. I would like to be debating the highway bill.\n  We have had a series of broken promises. Congress acted to shift the \n4.3-cent gas tax to the highway trust funds. The people have been told, \nregardless of what the Senator says, the people have the understanding \nthat that money is going to be spent on surface \ntransportation programs. So we promised that, and then we promised to \ntake up the highway bill. What about the highway needs? How can we \nignore those needs when we have huge, unspent balances in the trust \nfund?\n\n  Mr. President, I just called my highway department this morning, and \naccording to the West Virginia State Highway Commissioner, if ISTEA is \npostponed beyond the May 1 date, 75 highway projects, including about \n20 bridges in West Virginia, will have to be delayed. This story can be \ntold all over this country. Senator, you will hear it. You will hear \nit. I say that with the utmost respect. The Senator from Rhode Island \nis going to hear it.\n  Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is my friend and I respect him highly, always have and \nwill continue to do so.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to say there is nobody I enjoy \ndueling with more on this floor than the Senator from West Virginia. We \nhave been against each other on some rare issues. We have been together \non many issues.\n  Mr. BYRD. I like it much better when we are together.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As I listened to what he said, Mr. President, it brought \nto mind that old song, ``Will you love me in November as you did in \nJune?'' And I say to the Senator, why didn't he love this bill in \nOctober as he does in February?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I loved it. I loved it then.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We had not one, we had not two, we had not three, we had \nfour votes, Mr. President----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I loved it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. To try to move this bill that the Senator from West \nVirginia is embracing now.\n  His arms are around ISTEA II----\n  Mr. BYRD. Tell me now.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. With affection. Where was he when we needed him?\n  Mr. BYRD. I wanted to offer my amendment, but the amendment tree was \nfilled.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And we have those votes, and I looked; where is a vote--\nwe are voting aye.\n  Mr. BYRD. I didn't see the Senator looking for me.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I sought him, but I couldn't find him----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will have order.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And I went away distressed.\n  So now we will have an opportunity in this bill, as the majority \nleader has made it clear the way we will proceed, and I look forward, \nas we get into this, that he will support a bill that will accomplish \nthe goals of the Nation in the context of all the other demands that \nare placed upon the budget of the United States.\n  I will conclude by stressing once again that we have an increase in \nthis bill this year, ISTEA II, over the past, of 20 percent when the \nother discretionary accounts are frozen. In other words, the nondefense \nitems and the nonentitlement items are all frozen--whether you are \ntalking Head Start, school lunches, the school programs, the health \nprograms; they are frozen--and we get a 20 percent increase, which is \npretty good, for this program.\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator from Missouri yield?\n  Mr. BOND. For a brief comment?\n  Mr. BYRD. For a brief comment.\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for \nhis patience in listening to this discussion that has been going on. He \nis going to manage a bill, but he has been very patient, and I think we \nimposed on him. I just wanted to apologize and thank him.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to the consideration of Calendar No. 304, S. 1601, regarding human \ncloning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. In light of the objection from the other side of the aisle, \nI now move to proceed to S. 1601.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate on the motion?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to debate the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California may proceed.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a rush to judgment on one of \nthe most fundamental issues of the 20th century. Mr. President, this is \nnot renaming National Airport Ronald Reagan Airport.\n  Mr. President, I submit respectfully to the distinguished Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle that this is a major debate that has \nscientific implications, moral implications and ethical implications. \nIt is a debate, also, that involves one of the most difficult areas of \nscience involving human genetics, with a vocabulary and a lexicon that \nis not understood by the great bulk of the American people and \ncertainly not by many of us in the U.S. Senate.\n  Both the Bond-Frist bill and the Feinstein-Kennedy bill dealing with \nthe subject of human cloning were introduced less than 48 hours ago--48 \nhours. No hearings have been held on either bill, no floor debate has \nbeen held on either bill. The medical community, the research \ncommunity, patients with currently incurable diseases whose cure we \nmight affect by both of these bills have barely read the bills, much \nless analyzed them.\n  As a matter of fact, the letters are now beginning to pour in. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a 9-page statement of \nthe Biotechnology Industry Organization regarding legislation \nintroduced to ban human cloning and a letter to Senator Mack from the \nAmerican Association for Cancer Research.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement of the Biotechnology Industry Organization Regarding \n              Legislation Introduced To Ban Human Cloning\n\n       The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) believes that \n     it is both unsafe and unethical to even attempt to clone a \n     human being. BIO strongly supported the review of this issue \n     by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) and the \n     moratorium on cloning imposed by President Clinton. We \n     believe that the FDA has clear authority and jurisdiction and \n     will, as they have stated, prohibit any attempt to clone a \n     human being.\n       BIO is concerned about the scope and impact of legislation \n     introduced to make it a crime with a ten year prison sentence \n     to conduct biomedical research which may or may not have any \n     relevance to the cloning of a human being. We are very \n     concerned about the rushed process to pass legislation on \n     this complex subject and the possibilities for unintended \n     consequences. The scientific and legal issues with respect to \n     any legislation regarding biomedical research are exceedingly \n     technical, and a hastily drafted bill could advertently and \n     inadvertently damage biomedical research on deadly and \n     disabling diseases.\n       The Senate needs to adhere to the standard for doctors, \n     ``first, do no harm.'' Biomedical research into deadly and \n     disabling diseases is far too important to rush to enact \n     legislation which would unequivocally undermine promising \n     research and therapies. The Senate should be extremely \n     cautious before it starts sending scientists to jail when the \n     purpose of their research meets the highest moral and ethical \n     standards and holds such promise for relieving human \n     suffering.\n\n\n           analysis of pending bills and the science at risk\n\n       Several bills have been introduced in the Senate regarding \n     human cloning. They vary widely in focus and precision. The \n     three principal bills are S. 368, S. 1599, and S. 1602 and we \n     have analyzed each of them here.\n       The first bill introduced by Senator Bond last year, S. \n     368, is one of the better drafted bills introduced in either \n     body. It uses reasonably accurate terms to describe the \n     applicable science and limits Federal funding for the cloning \n     of a human being.\n       The new bill introduced by Senator Bond, S. 1599, would \n     impose a ten year prison sentence for any individual for the \n     act of ``producing an embryo (including a preimplantation \n     embryo)'' through the use of a specified technology, \n     ``somatic cell nuclear transfer,'' even if the production of \n     such an embryo is for purposes unrelated to the cloning of a \n     human being and even if the embryo does not contain nuclear \n     DNA which is identical to that of an existing or previously \n     existing human being (cloning). The bill goes beyond the \n     issue of cloning to make it a crime to use somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer of a nucleus derived from normal sexual \n     union of an egg and sperm, which is obviously not cloning. It \n     would also make it a crime to conduct some research seeking \n     to generate stem cells to treat a wide range of deadly and \n     disabling diseases, treatments which have nothing whatever to \n     do with human cloning.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ An identical bill has been introduced by Senator Lott as \n     S. 1601 and this may be the bill which is called up for the \n     Senate debate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The third bill, introduced by Senator Feinstein, S. 1602, \n     would impose heavy civil fines for any entity that would \n     ``implant or attempt to implant the product of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus . . .'' This sharply \n     focuses the bill on an attempt to clone a human being and \n     would not imperil biomedical research.\n\n\n                 impact of bills on stem cell research\n\n       The current bill introduced by Senator Bond would, because \n     it goes well beyond the issue of human cloning, imperil \n     promising biomedical research, including research to generate \n     stem cells. Instead of focusing on cloning, it makes it a \n     crime to zygote or embryo through the use of a new \n     technology, somatic cell nuclear transfer, even if the use of \n     this technology is essential for the generation of stem cells \n     to treat disease and where there is no intention or attempts \n     through use of this technology to clone a human being. \n     Basically the current bill would make it a crime to conduct \n     research if it could possibly be related to the cloning of a \n     human being even if it is not, in fact, conducted for that \n     purpose.\n       This approach in S. 1599 goes beyond the issue of human \n     cloning and would outlaw some research to create stem cells, \n     including stem cells for the following types of treatments: \n     cardiac muscle cells to treat heart attack victims and \n     degenerative heart disease; skin cells to treat burn victims; \n     spinal cord neuron cells for treatment of spinal cord trauma \n     and paralysis; neural cells for treating those suffering from \n     neurodegenerative diseases; pancreas cells to treat diabetes; \n     blood cells to treat cancer anemia, and immunodeficiencies; \n     neural cells to treat Parkinson's, Huntington's and \n     Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); cells for use in genetic \n     therapy to treat 5,000 genetic diseases, including Cystic \n     Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs Disease, schizophrenia, depression, \n     and other diseases; blood vessel endothelial cells for \n     treating atherosclerosis; liver cells for liver diseases \n     including hepatitis and cirrhosis; cartilage cells for \n     treating of osteoarthritis; bone cells for treatment of \n     osteoporosis; myoblast cells for the treatment of Muscular \n     Dystrophy; respiratory epithelial cells for the treatment \n     of Cystic Fibrosis and lung cancer; adrenal cortex cells \n     for the treatment of Addison's disease; retinal pigment \n     epithelial cells for age-related macular degeneration; \n     modified cells for treatment of various genetic diseases; \n     and other cells for use in the diagnosis, treatment and \n     prevention of other deadly or disabling diseases or other \n     medical conditions.\n       To be precise, the current bill introduced by Senator Bond, \n     S. 1599, would make it a crime to generate stem cells, for \n     the above uses, where somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technology is used. It would not ban stem cell research where \n     the stem cell is generated without the use of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer. It is not possible to say how much of this \n     promising research will or might involve the use of somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer. As described below, the bill would \n     clearly ban the generation of any stem cells\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\n     ``customized'' to an individual where somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer must be used.\n       This stem cell technology is exciting and potentially \n     revolutionary. Scientists are developing a new approach for \n     treating human diseases that doesn't depend on drugs like \n     antibiotics, but on living cells that can differentiate into \n     blood, skin, heart, or brain cells and can potentially treat \n     various cancers, spinal cord injuries, and heart disease. For \n     example, this stem cell research has the potential to develop \n     and improve cancer treatments by gaining a more complete \n     understanding of cell division and growth and the process of \n     metastasis. This could also lead to a variety of cancer \n     treatment advances.\n       The type of cells that make up most of the human body are \n     differentiated, meaning that they have already achieved some \n     sort of specialized function such as blood, skin, heart or \n     brain cells. The precursor cells that led to differentiated \n     cells come from an embryo. The cells are called stem cells \n     because functions stem from them like the growth of a plant. \n     Stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal, meaning that \n     they can reproduce more of themselves, and differentiation, \n     meaning that they can specialize into a variety of cell types \n     with different functions. In the last decade, scientists \n     studying mice and other laboratory animals have discovered \n     new powerful approaches involving cultured stem cells. \n     Studies of these cells obtained from a mouse's stem cells \n     show they are capable of differentiating, in vitro or in vivo \n     into a wide variety of specialized cell types. Stem cells \n     have been derived by culturing cells of non-human primates. \n     Promising efforts to obtain human stem cells have also \n     recently been reported.\n       Stem cell research has been hailed as the ``[most] \n     tantalizing of all'' research in this field, because adults \n     do not have many stem cells. Most adult cells are fully \n     differentiated into their proper functions. When \n     differentiated cells are damaged, such as damage to cardiac \n     muscle from a heart attack, the adult cells do not have the \n     ability to regenerate. If stem cells could be derived from \n     human sources and induced to differentiate in vitro, they \n     could potentially be used for transplantation and tissue \n     repair.\n       Using heart attacks as an example, we might be able to \n     replace damaged cardiac cells, with healthy stem cells, that \n     could differentiate into cardiac muscle. Research using these \n     stem cells could lead to the development of ``universal donor \n     cells,'' and could be an invaluable benefit to patients. Stem \n     cell therapy could also make it possible to store tissue \n     reserves that would give health care providers a new and \n     virtually endless supply of the cells listed above. The use \n     of stem cells to create these therapies would lead to great \n     medical advances. We have to be sure that this legislation \n     concerning human cloning would not in any way obstruct this \n     vital research.\n\n\n             Bond Bill Application to Non-Identical Nucleus\n\n       The purpose of a bill to ban human cloning is supposedly to \n     ban the cloning of an individual and the essence of this is \n     the duplication of the DNA of one individual in another. The \n     term ``somatic cell,'' however, is not limited in the current \n     Bond bill to somatic cells with DNA which is the same as that \n     of an existing or previously existing human being. If it is \n     not limited to cases where the DNA is identical, human \n     cloning is--by definition--not involved.\n       The current Bond bill goes beyond cloning because it does \n     not define the term ``somatic cell'' or limit to cases where \n     the DNA is identical. It only defines the term ``somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer,'' but it does not define the term ``somatic \n     cell.'' We need a brief glossary of terms to define what \n     constitutes a ``somatic cell.''\n       ``Zygote'' means a single celled egg with two sets (a \n     diploid set) of chromosomes as normally derived by \n     fertilization;\n       ``Egg'' and ``oocyte'' mean the female gamete;\n       ``Gamete'' means a mature male or female reproductive cell \n     with one set (a haploid) set of chromosomes;\n       ``Sperm'' means the male gamete;\n       ``Somatic cell'' means a cell of the body, other than a \n     cell that is a gamete, having two sets (a diploid set) of \n     chromosomes.\n       So a ``somatic cell'' is any cell of the body other than a \n     gamete, and it includes a fertilized egg. This means that the \n     current Bond bill would make it a crime to use somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer even in cases where the somatic cell \n     contains a nucleus derived from sexual reproduction, which is \n     obviously not cloning. This means that even though the \n     nucleus is not a clone, the current Bond bill makes it a \n     Federal crime to create it. This means that the current Bond \n     bill goes beyond the issue of cloning.\n       Because of this coverage of all ``somatic cells'' the \n     current Bond bill would make it a crime for doctors to use a \n     currently effective treatment for mitochondrial disease. \n     In this treatment women who have the disease have an \n     extreme and tragic form of infertility. The disease is a \n     disease of the mitochondria, which is an essential element \n     of any egg. The treatment for this disease involves the \n     use of a fertilized nucleus which is transferred through \n     the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to an egg from \n     which the nucleus has been removed. The new egg is a \n     fresh, undiseased egg. The current Bond bill would make a \n     crime to provide this treatment even though the nucleus \n     which is transferred is the product of fertilization, no \n     cloning.\n\n\n                         customized stem cells\n\n       If the current Bond bill was limited to sometic cells with \n     nuclear DNA identical to that of an existing or previously \n     existing human being, i.e., to a cloned nucleus, it would \n     make it a Federal crime to conduct one especially promising \n     type of stem cell research, into generating ``customized'' \n     stem cells.\n       A researcher or doctor might want to create a human zygote \n     with DNA identical to that of an existing or previously \n     existing person through the use of somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer, the act prohibited in the bill, in order to create \n     a customized stem cell line to treat the individual from whom \n     the DNA was extracted. By using the same DNA, the stem cell \n     therapy would more likely to compatible with, and not be \n     rejected by, the person for whom the therapy is created. By \n     starting with the patient's own nuclear DNA, the therapy is, \n     in effect, custom made for that person. It is like taking the \n     patients blood prior to surgery so that it can be infused \n     into the patient during surgery (avoiding the possibility of \n     contamination by the use of blood of another person).\n       Because the current Bond bill makes it a crime to use the \n     technology--somatic cell nuclear transfer--it would make it a \n     crime to develop a therapy with the equivalent of the \n     patient's personal monogram on it a customized treatment \n     based on their own nuclear DNA.\n       Because the bill introduced by Senator Feinstein requires \n     the implantation of an embryo, it does not curtail stem cell \n     research, and the bill provides that the transfer nucleus \n     must be that of an ``existing or previously existing human \n     child or adult,'' precisely the limitation not present in the \n     current Bond bill. None of the issues we have raised \n     regarding the current Bond bill apply to the Feinstein bill, \n     which is narrowly focuses on the act of cloning, or \n     attempting to clone an individual.\n\n\n                     Protecting biomedical research\n\n       The current Bond bill and the Feinstein bill both contain \n     clauses for the protection of biomedical research. There is a \n     critical difference between them.\n       At the press conference announcing introduction of his bill \n     Senator Bond distributed a document entitled ``Current \n     Research Untouched by the Bond/Frist/Gregg Legislation.'' The \n     title of this document was followed by a list of such \n     research, including ``In Vitro Fertilization,'' ``Stem Cell \n     Research,'' ``Gene Therapy,'' ``Cloning of Cells, Tissues, \n     Animals and Plants,'' ``Cancer,'' ``Diabetes,'' ``Birth \n     Defects,'' ``Arthritis,'' ``Organ Failure,'' ``Genetic \n     Disease,'' ``Severe Skin Burns,'' ``Multiple Sclerosis,'' \n     ``Muscular Dystrophy,'' ``Spinal Cord Injuries,'' \n     ``Alzheimer's Disease,'' ``Parkinson's Disease, and ``Lou \n     Gehrig's Disease''. Unfortunately, the title is followed by a \n     critical qualification, an asterisk. The asterisk \n     qualification states, ``The current Bond bill would not \n     prohibit any of this research, even embryo research, as long \n     as it did not involve the use of a very specific technique \n     (somatic cell nuclear transfer) to create a live cloned human \n     embryo.''\n       In the ways described above this asterisk qualification \n     acknowledges that the bill would, in fact, make it a crime to \n     conduct some types of stem cell research and other research. \n     Given the importance of the asterisk, the document's title \n     the list of supposedly protected research could be considered \n     misleading. The document should more accurately have been \n     entitled ``Only Some Research Regarding the Following \n     Diseases is Outlawed.''\n       The current Bond bill contains a Section 5 entitled \n     ``Unrestricted Scientific Research.'' This section provides \n     that ``Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act \n     shall be construed to restrict areas of scientific research \n     that are not specifically prohibited by this Act (or \n     amendments).'' This provision is circular. It states that the \n     bill does what it does and does not do what it does not do. \n     The provision does nothing to modify the prohibitions on \n     research and does nothing to protect ``scientific research.''\n       In contrast the Feinstein bill includes a provision \n     regarding ``Protected Research and Practices'' which provides \n     that ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict \n     areas of biomedical and agriculture research or practices not \n     expressly prohibited in this section, including research or \n     practices that involve the use of--(1) somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer or other cloning technologies to clone molecules, \n     DNA, cells, and tissues; (2) mitochondrial, cytoplasmic or \n     gene therapy; or (3) somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques \n     to create nonhuman animals.'' This is a ``savings'' clause \n     with meaning and content. Its reference to the cloning of \n     ``cells'' and to ``mitrochondrial'' therapy are laudatory and \n     meaningful.\n\n\n          NBAC Recommendation and Clinton Administration Bill\n\n       The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) cautioned \n     that poorly crafted legislation to ban human cloning may put \n     at risk biomedical research on the following types of \n     diseases and conditions: ``Regeneration and repair of \n     diseased or damaged human tissues and organs'' (NBAC report \n     at 29); ``assisted reproduction'' (NBAC report at 29); \n     ``leukemia, liver failure, heart and kidney disease'' (NBAC \n     report at 30); and ``bone marrow stem cells, liver cells, or \n     pancreatic beta-cells (which product insulin) for \n     transplantation'' (NBAC report at 30). The Clinton \n     Administration proposed law, like the Feinstein bill, avoids \n     the peril identified by\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\n     NBAC and focuses only on the issue of human cloning and does \n     not imperil biomedical research.\n\n\n                         sunset and preemption\n\n       NBAC proposed that any law include both sunset review and \n     preemption provisions.\n       Regarding a sunset review provision, NBAC stated in its \n     report: ``It is notoriously difficult to draft legislation at \n     any particular moment that can serve to both exploit and \n     govern the rapid and unpredictable advances of science. Some \n     mechanism, therefore, such as a sunset provision, is \n     absolutely needed to ensure an opportunity to re-examine any \n     judgment made today about the implications of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer cloning of human beings. As scientific \n     information accumulates and public discussion continues, a \n     new judgment may develop and we, as a society, need to retain \n     the flexibility to adjust our course in this manner. A sunset \n     provision . . . ensures that the question of cloning will be \n     revisited by the legislature in the future, when scientific \n     and medical questions have been clarified, possible uses have \n     been identified, and public discussion of the deeper moral \n     concerns about this practice have matured.'' NBAC report at \n     101.\n       President Clinton has proposed a five year sunset in his \n     bill. The Feinstein bill includes a ten year sunset and the \n     current Bond bill includes no sunset review.\n       BIO supports inclusion of a sunset review provision, but \n     the most important issue is whether the terms of the \n     prohibition in any law focuses only on the issue of human \n     cloning. A sunset review provision will not undo the damaged \n     which a poorly crafted, over broad law would do to biomedical \n     research prior to the sunset date.\n       The Feinstein bill, but not the current Bond bill, includes \n     a clause which preempts inconsistent state laws. NBAC \n     strongly supported a preemption of state laws: ``The \n     advantage to federal legislation--as opposed to state-by-\n     state laws--lies primarily in its comprehensive coverage and \n     clarity. . . . Besides ensuring interstate uniformity, a \n     federal law would relieve the need to rely on the cooperation \n     of diverse medical and scientific societies, or the actions \n     of diverse IRBs, to achieve the policy objective. As an \n     additional benefit, federal legislation could displace the \n     varied state legislative efforts now ongoing, some of which \n     suffer from ambiguous drafting that could inadvertently \n     prohibit the important cellular and molecular cloning \n     research described . . . in this report.'' NBAC report at \n     100.\n       Numerous bills introduced in state legislatures, some of \n     which are very poorly crafted and over broad.\n       BIO supports inclusion of a preemption clause. Again, the \n     key issue is whether the prohibition in any law focuses only \n     on the issue of human cloning and does not imperil biomedical \n     research. A poorly drafted, over broad Federal law which \n     preempts state laws might do even more damage.\n\n\n                        nbac role and commission\n\n       NBAC performed a public service with its quick and \n     thoughtful analysis of the human cloning issue. The current \n     Bond bill would set up an entirely new body to review the \n     human cloning issue rather than rerefer the issue back to \n     NBAC for further review. NBAC is well qualified and \n     positioned to perform this function and it may be wasteful \n     and expensive to establish another body to perform this \n     ongoing review. The Feinstein bill calls on NBAC to conduct \n     the reviews.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          American Association for\n\n\n                                        Cancer Research, Inc.,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, February 4, 1998.\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mack: Medical research, conducted in the \n     United States over the last 20 years, has opened up \n     tremendous opportunities to make progress against many \n     devastating diseases. The scientific community does not \n     desire to make human beings, or modify or genetically mark \n     any portion of our population. However, to deny the \n     application of molecular biology, made possible through the \n     use of cloning technologies, to patients who could be \n     benefited would be a great injustice.\n       A litany of beneficial applications of cloning technology \n     was enumerated in this weeks TIME Magazine. Several of these \n     applications are at the core of cutting-edge cancer research, \n     and there are many more potential benefits that are unknown \n     at this time. These applications, as well as any future \n     progress, would be eliminated by broad legislation setting \n     back progress and potential in our conquest to develop \n     effective approaches to the prevention, detection, and \n     treatment of cancer.\n       The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), with \n     over 14,000 members, is the largest professional organization \n     of basic and clinical cancer researchers in the world. \n     Founded in 1907, its mission is to prevent, treat, and cure \n     cancer through research, scientific programs, and education. \n     To accomplish these important goals it is essential that \n     scientists vigorously pursue all promising lines of \n     investigations against cancer.\n       The AACR feels strongly that an ethical and just compromise \n     can be reached that will protect the public and the \n     scientific community from the irresponsible application of \n     cloning technology while permitting meaningful and ethical \n     research to move forward. The medical and cancer research \n     community feels that the present rush to enact legislation \n     without proper consideration or deliberation is a serious \n     mistake, and the unfortunate result would be irresponsible \n     legislation.\n       As scientists we clearly see the tremendous advantages of \n     cloning technology as well as its potential problems, which \n     we, also, have reason to fear if it is applied in an \n     unreasonable manner.\n       The AACR, therefore, appeals to all Members of Congress to \n     establish and honor a moratorium of at least 45 days on \n     enacting any legislation until definitions and implications \n     of legislation can be determined in a more reasonable and \n     thoughtful manner, and in an open and public process. This \n     would be a service to humanity, science, and millions of \n     individuals who are now suffering, or will suffer in the \n     future, from catastrophic and crippling diseases such as \n     cancer. We appeal to all members of Congress to give this \n     important moral and scientific issue very careful \n     consideration and deliberation. Clearly a rush to judgment on \n     this complex issue could be a major setback for cancer and \n     medical research.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald S. Coffey,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Biotechnology Industry Association \nanalyzes both the Bond-Frist bill and the Feinstein-Kennedy bill, which \nis a second bill that addresses cloning. This interesting analysis, \nrepresenting the entire biotechnology industry of the United States, \nmakes a very important point, that whatever we do here impacts on human \nresearch in a multitude of different areas, and most particularly it \naffects cancer research. Mr. President, I will comment on this paper \nand also comment on a number of other items.\n  The American Association for Cancer Research's letter to Senator \nConnie Mack urges that there be a 45-day delay in enacting any \nlegislation until definitions and implications of legislation can be \ndetermined in a more reasonable and thoughtful manner and in an open \nand public process. They are calling for reason, they are calling for \nthoughtful deliberation, they are calling for a public process. Who can \ndeny that on a very complicated subject?\n  The Whitehead Institute--and specifically Gerald R. Fink, a Director \nof the American Cancer Society, Professor of Genetics--in his letter \ntalks about the limited ability to develop cell-based strategies, which \nwill take place if the Bond-Frist bill is ramrodded through this body.\n  The American Society for Reproductive Medicine has written a letter \nurging this body to vote no on the Bond-Frist legislation.\n  The American Psychological Association has written to us urging that \nwe delay, that there be discussion and debate, and they point out that \nwe need to protect research efforts in this area.\n  The American Association for the Advancement of Science has said that \nthey are deeply concerned about the ethical and scientific issues. They \nwarn us: ``Use great caution in moving with this legislation.''\n  Even the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of \nMissouri, Colombia, has written to this body urging caution.\n  The University of California at San Francisco, Roger A. Pederson, \nProfessor and Research Director of the Reproductive Unit of the \nDepartment of OB/GYN and Reproductive Science, has written to this body \nurging caution and restraint as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              American Society for\n\n\n                                        Reproductive Medicine,\n\n                                 Birmingham, AL, February 5, 1998.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Society for Reproductive \n     Medicine (ASRM) urges you not to allow the Bond Human Cloning \n     Prohibition Act (S. 1601) to be brought to the floor for a \n     vote today, and if it is, to vote against it.\n       ASRM is very concerned that in the rush to make human \n     cloning illegal, Congress will inadvertently outlaw very \n     serious and promising medical research that may uncover cures \n     to some of the most deadly diseases. Cloning is a highly \n     technical area that cannot easily be understood and should \n     not be hastily legislated.\n       Scientists engaged in legitimate medical research are not \n     interested in cloning a human being. Since October, \n     professional organizations representing more than 64,000 \n     scientists have announced their participation in a voluntary \n     five year moratorium on human cloning. Efforts led by the \n     scientific community, rather than legislative prohibitions, \n     have worked before, and will work this time.\n       When we first discovered how to duplicate DNA at any level, \n     there were cries to outlaw it. Luckily your predecessors did \n     not take that step, instead allowing the scientific \n     community's voluntary moratorium to slow\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\n     research while we explored its implications. Today millions \n     of Americans are alive thanks to drugs made using recombinant \n     DNA.\n       This bill prohibits not just the creation of a human clone, \n     but any attempt to understand how somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer could be used to improve our understanding and \n     treatment of disease.\n       We urge you and your colleagues to carefully consider any \n     human cloning legislation and to proceed through the proper \n     legislative channels so that a hastily drafted bill does not \n     get passed, sentencing millions of Americans to needless \n     suffering.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        J. Benjamin Younger, M.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Psychological Association,\n\n                                                 February 2, 1998.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein and\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Kennedy, I write to support the \n     proposed ``Prohibition on Cloning of Human Beings Act of \n     1998'' introduced by both of you. There appears to be \n     considerable confusion on this topic which apparently has \n     resulted in an effort by some to restrict various areas of \n     biomedical and agricultural research dealing with \n     reproduction and embryo research. It is important to \n     differentiate between human cloning and other types of \n     research. My understanding also is that the FDA has indicated \n     that they are the federal agency responsible for monitoring \n     any possible attempts at cloning research.\n       I do want to emphasize again that we need to protect \n     researchers efforts at research which does not include ``the \n     production of a precise genetic copy of a molecule (including \n     DNA), cell, tissue, organ, plant, animal or human''.\n       Let me also add that the American Psychological Association \n     took the stand that it is human behavior, in all its aspects \n     which should ultimately serve as the focus of scientific and \n     bioethical inquiry, not simply the techniques which initiate \n     the process. After all, just think if nature had not beaten \n     us to the development of twins. Wouldn't there be a huge cry \n     about how we ought not to have identical twins because it \n     would be unnatural to have two people so similar to each \n     other?\n       Thank you for permitting me to express my viewpoints. I am \n     sure they are shared by many scientists in this country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Norman Abeles, Ph.D,\n     Professor and Immediate Past President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      American Association for the\n\n\n                                       Advancement of Science,\n\n                                                 February 2, 1998.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The American Association for the \n     Advancement of Science (AAAS) has followed with interest the \n     developments of the past year related to cloning, including \n     current and proposed legislation regarding the possible use \n     of somatic cell nuclear transfer to clone a human being.\n       Throughout its 150-year history, AAAS has been a pioneer \n     among American scientific organizations in addressing the \n     moral and ethical issues related to scientific developments. \n     We are deeply concerned about the scientific and ethical \n     issues raised by the possibility of cloning human beings and \n     believe that a much more complete understanding of these \n     issues is essential before such experiments are even \n     considered. At the same time, however, we are also concerned \n     that well-intentioned legislation in the area of human \n     cloning may inadvertently impede vital research in \n     agriculture, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and genetics.\n       We urge that congressional leaders use great caution in \n     drafting legislation to ban human cloning. Congress should \n     consult with leading researchers in genetics and other areas \n     of the life sciences in crafting language so that definitions \n     of scientific and technical terms are well understood and the \n     resulting laws do not impede important research that may use \n     similar techniques but do not raise the same kinds of moral \n     and ethical concerns. Such related research can yield great \n     benefits, for example, in increasing agricultural production, \n     generating new products through biotechnology, finding cures \n     for genetic disorders, and reducing the costs of \n     pharmaceuticals. It is essential that these legitimate and \n     socially-important areas of research not be adversely \n     affected by legislation aimed at restricting human cloning.\n       AAAS, founded in 1848, is the world's largest \n     multidisciplinary scientific association, with 145,000 \n     individual members and nearly 300 affiliated scientific and \n     engineering societies. Our Committee on Scientific Freedom \n     and Responsibility has been a powerful voice for ethics in \n     science and, in collaboration with our Program of Dialogue \n     Between Science and Religion, held a major public forum in \n     Washington last June that explored scientific, moral, \n     ethical, and religious implications of human cloning. We are \n     eager to assist in promoting a responsible and constructive \n     dialogue between scientists, policymakers, and the public in \n     this area, and stand ready to assist you in any manner that \n     would be useful.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard S. Nicholson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   College of Veterinary Medicine,\n\n\n                              University of Missouri-Columbia,\n\n                                   Columbia, MO, February 4, 1998.\n     To: Ms. Adira Simon, Senator Kennedy's Office.\n     From: R. Michael Roberts, Curators' Professor and Chair, \n         Veterinary Pathobiology.\n     Subject: Feinstein/Kennedy (S1602) versus Bond (S1599).\n       I am sending you a copy of my letter to Senator Bond, which \n     addresses some of the same scientific issues raised in your \n     comparison.\n       I have read S1602 and believe that it would be well \n     accepted by scientists, including members of the Society for \n     the Study of Reproduction, and the Developmental Biologists. \n     What is important is criminalization of any intent to produce \n     a baby and not to ban a possibly desirable outcome of the \n     technology, which is the generation of replacement cells and \n     tissues for an individual. The Feinstein/Kennedy Bill also \n     creates a moratorium rather than a difficult-to-reverse ban \n     on cloning of human beings. Again, most scientists would find \n     this comforting.\n       I should point out that the term ``somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer technology'' has much broader meaning than the way \n     it is defined in either bill. Nuclear transfer between \n     somatic cells is a common technique and has been used for \n     decades. I would be happier if the wording of both bills made \n     it clear that it is the transfer of a somatic cell nucleus to \n     an oocyte to create a human baby that is the issue.\n       What I found contradictory about S1601 is that it creates \n     an elaborate commission to report on cloning (and other \n     issues), yet the very technique that could allow future \n     discourse will have been criminalized.\n       In summary, I judge the Feinstein/Kennedy Bill likely to \n     accomplish what most scientists and the lay public support, a \n     ban on cloning human beings. It will not prohibit the \n     legitimate use of somatic nuclear transfer to oocytes to \n     create replacement tissues, and it places a time limit on the \n     ban, which can be extended as public and scientific sentiment \n     dictates.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         University of California,\n\n\n                                                San Francisco,\n\n                                                 January 30, 1998.\n     Hon. Senator Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy, I am writing to express my profound \n     appreciation and support for your efforts to preserve the \n     opportunities for continuing research in the United States on \n     the earliest stages of human development. I can provide you \n     with the names and histories of several patients in our \n     experience who have benefited directly from prior research \n     and diagnostic procedures leading to healthy pregnancies and \n     births. In addition, I can provide you with one or more names \n     of families whose health misfortunes could have been or could \n     be avoided through research on early products of human \n     conception.\n       Please tell me if this additional information will be of \n     value to you. I applaud your efforts to achieve a responsible \n     bill on the subject of human cloning prohibition that does \n     not impede the benefits of basic and clinical research for \n     the American people.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         Roger A. Pedersen, Ph.D.,\n         Professor and Research Director, Reproductive Genetics \n           Unit, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and \n           Reproductive Sciences.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I inquire of the distinguished Senator \nfrom California how long she will be? We have not had an opportunity \nfor an opening statement. I would like to know how long she proposes to \nproceed in opposition.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to respond to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri. I think the Senator is right. I do have a very lengthy \npresentation to make, and it is going to be quite involved. I would be \nvery happy to yield to him to make his opening statement if he would \nsee that I have the floor regained directly following his statement.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would be happy to ask unanimous consent \nthat when my remarks are finished, the Senator from California be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thought before we got into a full-fledged \ndebate saying this is bad, perhaps my colleagues would like to know \nwhat it is that we propose to do, speaking for the sponsors of this \nmeasure. It is obviously one that is going to take some discussion and \ndebate, and it's very helpful to know some of the objections that are \nraised to it. Again, for the sake of the Record, let me say what this \nis.\n  This measure is a very carefully and narrowly targeted provision that \nplaces an outright ban on the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer for \nhuman cloning purposes. It defines one technique, the technique that \nwas used to\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\ncreate, by cloning, the sheep Dolly and says that you shall not do that \nfor human beings --quite simply.\n  Why is this necessary? Why is it necessary that we move forward on \nthis? Well, frankly, recent reports show that a Chicago-based scientist \nis prepared to move forward with human cloning experimentation. I think \nthis forces an immediate debate on how far out on a moral cliff we are \nwilling to let science proceed before we as a nation insist on some \nmeaningful constraints. We no longer have the luxury of waiting around \nfor this morally reprehensible act to occur.\n  That scientist is proposing to raise huge sums of money and promise \ninfertile couples that he can clone human beings for them. The time for \nthe debate and action is now. If creating test tube babies by cloning a \nhuman embryo is morally, ethically, and practically wrong, as I \nstrongly believe it is, we need to stop it now. To delay it, to \nfilibuster it, to postpone it means that not only this scientist and \nothers who, perhaps, are not holding news conferences, can go forward \nwith a process that I believe the overwhelming majority of American \npeople believe is wrong, as I believe it is. To those who say we have \nnot studied this or debated this, I only say that since we had this \nstory about the cloning of Dolly the sheep, and stories of \norganizations and individuals pursuing human cloning, they have kept \nthe debate alive. The American public is asking if similar techniques \ncan be used to clone human beings, and they are concerned very deeply \nwhether something which was thought only to be science fiction is now \ncloser to reality.\n  Now, there are some distinguished books that oppose a prohibition on \nhuman cloning. They suggest that we cannot put the genie back in the \nbottle and we cannot stop progress. I suggest that we have come to the \npoint where our technological capability may be outrunning our moral \nsense. We have, in this body, carried a prohibition against Federal \nfunding of cloning human embryos. We have prohibited the research and \nexperimentation with Federal funding because we thought it was way down \nthe line. We didn't want to see money used. Last year, after the \ncloning of Dolly the sheep, we held hearings; tremendous amounts of \ntestimony were presented. I personally testified before Senator Frist's \nsubcommittee. This is not a new debate. The reason this debate is \nimportant, and the reason that action is important is that now we are \nfaced with scientists of, I believe, questionable judgment, who would \ngo forward with something that is morally reprehensible.\n  This measure is targeted narrowly to one specific process that was \nused to clone the sheep Dolly. It is the somatic cell nuclear transfer \nto create a human embryo. In addition to prohibiting that, we have, at \nthe urging of my distinguished cosponsor, Senator Frist, provided for a \ncommission to study the ethical implications of related technologies. \nAnd I believe we have made it clear that ongoing legitimate activity, \nshort of this one specific process, cleaning out a human embryo and \nputting in a nuclear cell transfer, and starting the process of \ndifferentiation of the cell toward creating a test tube baby is \nunacceptable.\n  The ethical implications of human cloning are staggering. I believe \nthat we would have the overwhelming understanding and support of the \nAmerican people that we should never create human life for spare parts, \nas a replacement for a child who has died, or for unnatural or selfish \npurposes. How many embryos or babies would we tolerate being created \nwith abnormalities before we perfect human cloning? It took Dr. Wilmut, \nthe Scottish scientist, 276 tries before creating Dolly, and we still \ndo not even know if Dolly is the perfect sheep. For humans, those \nresults are unacceptable--creating tremendously deformed human embryos \nor human beings. Dr. Ian Wilmut, the lead Scottish scientist who \ncreated Dolly, himself stated that he can see no scenario under which \nit would be ethical to clone human life. And he is right.\n  In September of 1994, a Federal human embryo research panel noted \nthat, ``Allowing society to create genetically identical persons would \ndevalue human life by undermining the individuality of human beings.'' \nFurther, the panel concluded that there are moral concerns about the \ndeliberate duplication of an individual genome, and that making carbon \ncopies of a human being is repugnant to members of the public. ``Many \nmembers of the panel share this view and see no justification for \nFederal funding of such research.''\n  I emphatically argue that those statements apply to private sector \nresearch as well. That is what we are trying to reach. It is important \nto note that the legislation is narrowly drafted, and its sole \nobjective is to ban the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer for human \ncloning purposes. We worked overtime to ensure that this language was \nspecific so that it would ban only the technique used to create Dolly.\n\n  This technique has also been criticized by a representative of the \npharmaceutical industry, who in a prepared statement for Members of \nCongress, dated January 13, 1998, stated:\n\n       While conventional cloning technology has been used \n     extensively worldwide to meet global medical needs, nuclear \n     transfer technology is fraught with untold failures for each \n     partial success and has major scientific and significant \n     ethical issues associated with it. Furthermore, it has no \n     strong therapeutic or economic-based need driving it at this \n     time. The concept that it is a viable alternative to \n     infertile parents is cruel and completely unjustified. I \n     would challenge you not to confuse the two as the Congress \n     considers its options here.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, myself, Senator Frist, Senator Gregg, and \nothers, have met with and consulted with representatives of the \npharmaceutical industry, researchers, representatives of patient \ngroups, and we have told them what we are proposing to do, and we have \nlistened to them discuss all of the implications. We know that in vitro \nfertilization, plant and animal cloning, cloning of DNA cells and \ntissues, stem cell research, gene therapy research, and other \nactivities taking place at the Human Genome Center offer great hope in \naddressing how to prevent, diagnose, and treat many devastating \ndiseases. These types of research will continue to thrive, that is \nclear, because we have targeted our ban so narrowly, and we intend only \nto prohibit, by cloning, the creation of the human embryo.\n  This is a technique characterized by industry, researchers, \ntheologians, ethicists, and others, as fraught with failures and \nlacking therapeutic value. This bill, however, does allow the important \nand promising research to continue. I have long been a supporter of \nbiotechnology. I have supported biotechnology efforts. I continue to \nsupport everything from human genome mapping to all of the other human \nresearch efforts. We have no problems with and support cloning of \nanimals. But there is a bright line between those activities and human \ncloning, and we must draw that line. There is a line, Mr. President, \nand that line is clear.\n  You can do all the research you want. You can create organs, you can \ndo all kinds of experimentation. But you should not be able to create a \nhuman embryo by cloning, starting a test tube baby. Now, there are some \nwho say that it is all right so long as you don't implant that cloned \nhuman embryo, so long as you destroy it. Once you start the process of \ncreating this test tube baby, it is OK to destroy it. As a matter of \nfact, they would have us believe that we would start all these human \nembryos, start the cell differentiation, and then wipe them out. Well, \nI think that raises serious questions with many people, and I am \nincluded in that. But it also raise also the prospect that once you \nstart cloning these human embryos--they are very small --they can be \ntransported very easily, picked up and taken from this country to \nsomeplace else in the world in large numbers, where there may be no ban \non implementation. The difficult science is creating the human embryo. \nOnce you do that, you have opened a whole area. And to say we are just \ngoing to prevent them from being implanted so a baby is brought to \nterm, that won't get it because that is too late. I have heard the \narguments of those who oppose this bill. And, quite frankly, let me \ntell you what those arguments are.\n\n  They are that some scientists would like to be able to create human \nembryos, play with them, and experiment with them, experiment with a \nhuman embryo that is differentiating and starting to grow, and say, \n``OK. Time is\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\nup. We will toss this one away and we will start playing with another \none.'' Once you get into that process, Mr. President, you have stepped \nover the moral and ethical line. There is a clear line. There is a very \nclear line.\n  We are ready to have the argument because I believe a significant \nmajority of the Members of this body reflect a significant, \noverwhelming view of the American people that that is unacceptable. \nThere may be well-intentioned scientists who say we need to play with \nhuman embryos and start these embryos growing and let us play with \nthem. They may get something. They may develop some scientific \nknowledge. But the statements I have already presented show that there \nis no really legitimate, scientific need, and, in fact, there are grave \nmoral and ethical reasons not to. I strongly hold the belief that all \nhuman beings are unique and created by God. And I think billions of \npeople around the world share it. Human cloning, a man's attempt to \nplay God, will change the very meaning of life, of human dignity, and \nwhat it is to be human. Are we ready for that? I don't think so.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post in October of 1994 in an editorial \nsaid:\n\n       The creation of human embryos specifically for research \n     that will destroy them is unconscionable. Viewed from one \n     angle this issue can be made to yield endless complexities. \n     What about the suffering of individuals and infertile couples \n     who might be helped by embryo research? What about the status \n     of a brand new embryo? But before you get to these questions, \n     there is a simpler one. ``Is there a line that should not be \n     crossed even for scientific, or other gain, and, if so, why \n     is it?\"\n\n  That is the quotation from the Washington Post. In case you missed \nit, let me give you the first sentence again. ``The creation of human \nembryos specifically for research that will destroy them is \nunconscionable.''\n  That is a simple, straightforward statement with which I agree, and I \nbelieve when the Members before the body have an opportunity to reflect \non it and consider it, they will agree that is right.\n  Let me quote President Bill Clinton, 1994.\n\n       The subject raises profound ethical and moral questions as \n     well as issues concerning the appropriate allocation of \n     Federal funds. I appreciate the work of the committees that \n     have considered this complex issue, and I understand that \n     advances in in vitro fertilization research and other areas \n     could be derived from such work. However, I do not believe \n     that Federal funds should be used to support the creation of \n     human embryos for research purposes.\n\n  That is the President. He said don't create human embryos by cloning \nfor research.\n  That is the question. Those who would delay and filibuster want to \navoid that question and delay it. I know they are well-intentioned. I \nknow they may have great reservations. They may not agree with that \nsimple moral standard. But there are people out there who want to start \nthat process, who may as we speak be engaged in that process.\n  We have debated whether cloning of human embryos is a good idea. I \nthink there is a clear consensus. We have drafted a narrow bill, a \ntargeted one that I hope we can move forward to enact. There is a lot \nof smoke and mirrors, and there are a lot of discussions about a whole \nrange of other options. These are very technical. That is why we set up \na commission to review all of these things. What we are targeting right \nnow is the one procedure that has been used with sheep, and could be \nused, if it is not stopped, to start creating human embryos. For those \npeople who want to create human embryos for research purposes and \ndestroy them or implant them, I say you are going across the line. I \ndon't care what your motives are. I don't care whether it is \nprofitable. I don't care what you think might come out of it. At this \npoint we are saying, ``No, you cannot cross the line.''\n  Mr. President, that is what this debate is all about. I believe that \nwe may have an opportunity, if discussion continues, to bring this \ndebate to a close. At such time I will be back on this floor to say, if \nyou want to allow the scientific community and some people with \ndifferent sets of standards and different sets of judgments to go ahead \nand attempt to create human embryos by cloning by a somatic cell \nnuclear transfer, go ahead and support the extended discussion. Vote no \nagainst cloture. But, by doing so, you are providing a green light. You \nare saying, go ahead and use this technique that I believe is \nunacceptable and should be made illegal in this country as it is in the \nUnited Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and many of the other developed and \nleading countries in the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from California \nallowing me to explain what the bill is and what it is not. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri. I appreciate his comments. And I must tell him that in the \nmain I agree with him.\n  We have submitted an alternative bill to Bond-Frist. It is Feinstein-\nKennedy.\n  I am opposed to human cloning. I believe human cloning is \nscientifically dangerous, it is morally unacceptable, it is ethically \nflawed, and we should outlaw it. That is not the issue.\n  The issue is we are dealing with a complex subject. The bill at hand \nis a bill that uses words and does not define those words. There is the \nrub.\n  So the issue here today is whether we go ahead and ramrod through \nlegislation with virtually no consideration by this body, legislation \nthat would impose a permanent ban forever with prison terms of up to 10 \nyears, and we will not understand fully what that bill will do. That is \nwhy the medical and the scientific research community have asked us to \nproceed with caution.\n  Let's say that you don't believe me. Would you believe the \nBiotechnology Industry Association representing the entire \nbiotechnology community? Let me quote from page 4 of their 9-page \nstatement to us.\n       The current Bond bill goes beyond cloning because it does \n     not define the term ``somatic cell'' or limit to cases where \n     the DNA is identical. It only defines the term ``somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer,'' but it does not define the term ``somatic \n     cell.'' We need a brief glossary of terms to define what \n     constitutes a ``somatic cell.''\n       ``Zygote'' means a single celled egg with two sets (a \n     diploid set) of chromosomes as normally derived by \n     fertilization;\n       ``Egg'' and ``oocyte'' mean the female gamete;\n       ``Gamete'' means a mature male or female reproductive cell \n     with one set (a haploid) set of chromosomes;\n       ``Sperm'' means the male gamete;\n       ``Somatic cell'' means a cell of the body, other than a \n     cell that is a gamete, having two sets (a diploid set) of \n     chromosomes;\n\n  Here is the point.\n\n       So a ``somatic cell'' is any cell of the body other than a \n     gamete, and it includes a fertilized egg. This means that the \n     current Bond bill would make it a crime to use somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer even in cases where the somatic cell \n     contains a nucleus derived from sexual reproduction, which is \n     obviously not cloning. This means that even though the \n     nucleus is not a clone, the current Bond bill makes it a \n     Federal crime to create it. This means that the current Bond \n     bill goes beyond the issue of cloning.\n       Because of this coverage of all ``somatic cells'' the \n     current Bond bill would make it a crime for doctors to use a \n     currently effective treatment for mitochondrial disease. In \n     this treatment women who have the disease have an extreme and \n     tragic form of infertility. The disease is a disease of the \n     mitochondria, which is an essential element of any egg. The \n     treatment for this disease involves the use of a fertilized \n     nucleus which is transferred through the use of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer to an egg from which the nucleus has been \n     removed. The new egg is a fresh, undiseased egg. The current \n     Bond bill would make it a crime to provide this treatment \n     even though the nucleus which is transferred is the product \n     of fertilization, not cloning.\n\n  This is the Biotechnology Industry Association's statement.\n  It goes on into other areas that would be prohibited. But let me say \nwhat I think the major problem here is.\n  The key terms in this bill are undefined, and the full scope of the \nbill is unknown by anyone in this body. It is just 48 hours old. We \ndon't understand the impact of it. The bill is not ready for rushing to \nthe full Senate for immediate consideration.\n  The Bond-Frist bill fails to define the following terms: somatic \ncell, oocyte, embryo, and preimplantation embryo.\n  These are all technical, scientific, state-of-the-art terms that need \ndefinition. The bill actually drops the definitions that were in \nearlier versions of it.\n  Undefined key terms will chill vital medical research and treatment. \nThe medical and scientific community has\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\noverwhelmingly stated that this bill would chill important scientific \nand health research. The bill criminalizes that research. Scientists \nwill refuse to do that research. Venture capitalists will refuse to \nfund it when faced with possible prison terms.\n  The Bond bill bans somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, and, as \na result, the Bond bill may ban production of genetically identical \ntissues for treatment of disease and transplantation, including blood \ncell therapies for diseases, such as leukemia and sickle cell anemia; \nnerve cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's and Lou Gehrig's; multiple sclerosis; nerve cell therapy \nfor spinal cord injury; insulin transplants for diabetes; skin cell \ntransplants for severe burns; liver cell transplants for liver damage; \nmuscle cell therapy for muscular dystrophy and heart disease; and \ncartilage-forming cells for reconstruction of joints damaged by \narthritis or injury.\n  Let me say what I think the problem is.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have another bill. We approach this \ndifferently. Rather than banning all somatic cell nuclear transfer, \nperiod, the end, we say you can't use this technology if you are going \nto implanting it in a human uterus. You cannot grow a baby by \nimplanting it in a human uterus.\n  Let me restate that.\n  You cannot grow a baby using this technology unless it is implanted \nin a human uterus. I have confirmed that, to my knowledge, \nscientifically at this stage, there is no way of doing it. However, you \ncan use this somatic nuclear cell transfer for the tissue research, the \nother areas of research that I am talking about. Once you ban the \ntechnology, you cannot use it for these other areas of research.\n  That is why we feel that the place to ban it is with implantation in \nthe female uterus or womb. That stops the production of a baby. It is \ndangerous. It took 277 implants in Dolly before they got it to work. \nAnd there is a lot we do not know about the procedure. It is terribly \ndangerous because you are taking a cell at a certain degree of \nmaturity, not an infant cell. You are taking a mature cell, and you \ndon't know what the impact of that cell is going to be on developmental \ndisabilities and the rest of human development.\n\n  So scientifically it is dangerous to clone a human. Morally, we say \nit is unacceptable, and there are a lot of reasons for this: Who would \nclone? What rules do you set up in cloning? Do you permit the cloning \nof Adolf Hitlers and the other less favorable characters of history, \nhistory past and history future.\n  So there are many, many questions to discuss. I think everyone in \nthis body believes that human cloning should be made illegal, but we \nshould not attack the technology from which so much good can come. For \nexample, using this technology scientists believe that it will be \npossible to treat third-degree burns, to provide skin grafts because \nthe DNA would be the same. We may that be able to clone their skin, \ngrow that skin and transfer that skin without rejection. The same thing \nmay be true of diabetes, and particularly in juvenile diabetes which is \nso recalcitrant and so difficult to handle.\n  This technology may offer a cure. And with respect to cancer, this \ntechnology is what is used in the mass production of anticancer drugs. \nIt would stop all of this particular technology.\n  So the key is not to stop the technology. The key is to stop the \nimplantation of the embryo produced by this technology in a human \nuterus. That is what we do in our bill. And that is why I can say \nvirtually all of the scientific community supports Feinstein-Kennedy \nand opposes Bond-Frist.\n  Now, I am aware of the fact our staffs met earlier this morning. We \nall want the same thing. Let me beg this body, do not do something in a \nrush that is going to mean one day someone is not going to have a cure \nfor cancer or diabetes or somebody lying in a burn unit at St. Francis \nHospital in San Francisco or anywhere else is not going to make use of \nthis technology to produce tissue that the body will not reject.\n  That is really the issue. Why does this have to be done in 48 hours? \nThe FDA says it will prevent human cloning. Why are we rushing to do \nsomething and use terms like somatic cell and we do not define in the \nlegislation what a somatic cell is. How many people do we condemn to \ndeath because we shut off research because anybody that does any \nresearch will have a 10-year Federal prison sentence, a 10-year Federal \nprison sentence if you do research on somatic nuclear cell transfer to \ntry to develop a skin graft for a third-degree burn that will not be \nrejected?\n  That is essentially what we are talking about here today, Members of \nthe Senate. The Bond bill additionally could ban noncloning treatments \nfor diseases carried in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is the nonnuclear \nmaterial in a cell. So parents whose children inherit cytoplasmic \ndiseases can have healthy children by using a variation on somatic cell \nnuclear transfer. This isn't cloning. It is curing a disease. And I am \nas sure as I am standing here the Bond-Frist bill bans this kind of \ntherapy.\n  So let's have hearings. These bills should go to committee and be \nconsidered thoroughly. Let's have the biotechnology community testify. \nLet's have the scientific community testify. Let's have a glossary of \nterms that we all agree upon. And let's put those definitions into a \nbill. Yes, let's ban human cloning. Let's say you cannot implant a \nuterus with somatic cell nuclear transfer. Then there are no babies. \nThen there is no human cloning. But the rest of the research, research \nto cure diseases, can move ahead.\n  I am aware of the fact that the distinguished Senator from Florida is \nin the Chamber and may wish to make a statement. If I could regain the \nfloor, I would be happy to yield to him for the purpose of that \nstatement.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think there are others in the Chamber as \nwell. I do not believe that we have any agreement at this time to go \nback and forth with proponents and opponents. The Senator from \nCalifornia has the floor, and if she wishes to yield I suggest the \nSenator from New Hampshire has been here for some time.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from California has \nthe floor.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I would like to continue if I can then, and if \nthere is any message that I might be able to deliver on behalf of the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida, who probably knows more about \nresearch into areas involving cancer than many of us in this body, I \nwould be happy to deliver it for him.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator, I do not want to yield the floor \nand lose the floor because it is my intention to slow down Senate \nconsideration today in this rushed manner in hopes that we will be able \nto send it to committee, have a hearing and follow the normal \ndeliberative process, including sending it back to the Senate soon for \nthoughtful consideration.\n  Mr. MACK. I wonder if I might----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am afraid to yield the floor because I may well \nlose the floor and not get it back again. So I will continue, if I may.\n  Mr. President, just yesterday, Dr. J. Benjamin Younger, the Executive \nDirector of the American Society For Reproductive Medicine, wrote:\n\n       ``I urge you and your colleagues to carefully consider any \n     human cloning legislation and to proceed through the proper \n     legislative channels so that a sloppily drafted bill does not \n     get passed and sentence millions of Americans to needless \n     suffering.\n\n  Mr. President, once again, I say we should not charge ahead at full \nthrottle on a bill that legislates issues as profound as those \nsurrounding human cloning. There is simply too much at stake.\n  I would like to give you just a quick side-by-side comparison of the \ntwo bills under consideration that ban cloning, Bond-Frist and \nFeinstein-Kennedy.\n  Feinstein-Kennedy, as I have said, bans the implantation of the \nproduct of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus. It \nmakes unlawful the shipping of the product of somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of \nimplanting into a woman's uterus. And it prohibits the use of Federal \nfunds for implanting the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into \na woman's uterus. I recognize that is current in the fiscal year 1998 \nappropriations law, but we reinforce it in our bill.\n  The Bond bill, as I understand it, bans human somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer period. It is defined as taking the\n\n[[Page S432]]\n\nnuclear material of a human somatic cell and incorporating it into an \noocyte from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert and \nproducing an embryo, including a preimplantation embryo. Again, it \ndefines none of these terms. And it makes unlawful the importation of \nan embryo produced through human somatic cell nuclear transfer \ntechnology. It is silent on the use of Federal funds, probably because \nthe authors know that a prohibition on human embryo research is already \nin place.\n  The length of the ban in our bill is 10 years. It is a permanent ban \nin the Bond bill.\n  The reason it is a temporary ban or a moratorium of 10 years is \nlargely because a voluntary moratorium has been put in place by the \nentire American scientific community, and to the best of my knowledge, \nwhat they were requesting a 5-year moratorium which the President's \nbill contained. We felt the 5-year moratorium was too short. We prefer \nthe longer period so that it can be reviewed at the end of 10 years.\n\n  The Feinstein-Kennedy bill protects and allows biomedical and \nagricultural research on practices which are not expressly prohibited. \nThat would include research or practices involving somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer or cloning technologies, mitochondrial, cytoplasmic or gene \ntherapy or somatic cell nuclear transfer to create animals. We do not \ninterfere with that. The Bond bill protects or allows areas of \nscientific research not specifically prohibited. It is silent on \nmitochondrial, cytoplasmic or gene therapy. And that is part of our \nproblem here, and that is one of the reasons why we think it needs to \ngo to committee and we need to know at the end of the hearing exactly \nwhat it is we are doing.\n  On the issue of a national commission, Feinstein-Kennedy authorizes \nthe current National Bioethics Advisory Commission for 10 years, from \nthe date of enactment. The current commission terminates in 1999. Our \nwould continue it and we require reports and recommendations from the \ncommission in 4\\1/2\\ years and in 9\\1/2\\ years. The Bond bill would \nestablish a new national commission to promote a national dialogue on \nbioethics of 25 members appointed by the Senate and House majority and \nminority leadership by December 1, 1998, to conduct a discourse on \nbioethical issues, including cloning, and to report to Congress by \nDecember 31, 1999 and annually thereafter.\n  On the issue of penalties, the Feinstein-Kennedy bill has a civil \npenalty of $1 million or three times the gross pecuniary gain or loss \nresulting from the violation, in other words, a very stringent civil \npenalty. If an individual uses somatic cell nuclear transfer and \nimplants the product into a woman's uterus, we subject that individual \nto forfeiture of any property derived from or used to commit a \nviolation or attempted violation. This would get at the lab or hospital \nwhere an implantation into a human uterus would take place. Obviously, \nit has to be done somewhere, and I think this is in a sense a fail-safe \nmajor penalty because that entire lab could be forfeited.\n  The Bond bill has 10 years in prison or a civil penalty if pecuniary \ngain is derived of not more than twice the gross gain or both. We think \n10 years in prison, when definitions are not included to clearly show \nwhat we are talking about, 10 years in prison for someone who might use \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer to create the DNA in a cell that could \nproduce a skin graft or another tissue culture, a skin graft that would \nheal a burn patient, that that individual should not be subject to 10 \nyears in prison.\n  On the issue of preemption, there is a difference between the two \nbills as well. Feinstein-Kennedy preempts any State or local law that \nprohibits or restricts research or practices constituting somatic cell \nnuclear transfer, mitochondrial or cytoplasmic therapy or the cloning \nof molecules, DNA cells, tissues, organs, plants, animals or \nhumans. So, we would set a national standard so that the States could \nnot pass legislation and say it's OK to insert a somatic cell in a \nwoman's uterus. We preempt the area.\n\n  Internationally, there are some differences in the two bills, too. \nFeinstein-Kennedy has a sense of the Congress that the President should \ncooperate with foreign countries to enforce mutually supported \nrestrictions. The Bond bill has a sense of the Congress that the \nFederal Government should advocate for and join an international effort \nto prohibit the use of human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology \nto produce a human embryo.\n  I think we could easily come to agreement on many of these, \nparticularly this last one. I think we want the same thing.\n  The major difference is that the Feinstein-Kennedy bill would allow \nthe technology to proceed in medical research as long as it does not \ninvolve human cloning.\n  Mr. President, the successful cloning of a sheep--\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator entertain a unanimous consent request \nthat I be allowed to speak without taking the floor from the Senator, \nso the Senator can regain the floor after I finish speaking? I will not \noffer any amendments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to, again, if I can regain the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes and at the end of the statement the floor return to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California because \nI wish to address this issue, also. I, unfortunately, have a meeting \nthat starts at 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I think we are all actually concerned about the issue \nof human cloning, and certainly the representations by the doctor from \nChicago who stated he intends to pursue a course of commercializing \nhuman cloning has caused us to need to accelerate addressing this as a \npublic policy matter. It is appropriately an issue that should be \naddressed at the level of the Congress of the United States. It should \nbe spoken to by the people's representatives and not left to a \nregulatory environment such as the FDA for a determination, because it \nis a matter of dramatic import to our culture and to our scientific \ncommunity.\n  There is no question but that the concept of cloning a human is \nunethical, inappropriate and wrong. We don't have to delve very far \ninto the history of this century to see the horror that can result from \na society which allows itself to pursue a course of creating humans or \ndesigning a human race not based on God's will but based on the \ndetermination of a political decision or a scientific community. \nObviously, the Nazi government, in its seeking of a master race, \nrepresents one of the true horrors of the history of mankind.\n  So, the need to debate the issue of whether or not humans should be \ncloned I think is not necessary. There should be and I believe there is \nalmost unanimity on the need not to allow human cloning to go forward \nin our society or any other civilized society. I think it is \ninteresting to note that the European Community has also banned human \ncloning. The question becomes how should we proceed and whether we \nshould proceed with a bill that has been designed by Senator Bond, \nSenator Frist and to some part myself, or whether we should proceed in \nsome other manner. I for one strongly support the initiative that is \nput forward by the bill which we are presently considering because it \naddresses the core issue of human cloning, which is the creation of an \nembryo through the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer. That is \nreally the question here.\n  In order to clone a human, you produce an embryo and as a result you \nget a human if you follow the next scientific steps. What we have done \nis limited dramatically and really focused the question specifically on \nthe necessary scientific acts to produce a cloned human and then said, \n``No, you cannot proceed in that direction.'' That is the way it should \nbe addressed.\n\n  This bill was structured in order to respond to the very legitimate \nconcerns of the scientific community for further research in all the \nareas the Senator from California has outlined. This bill does not, in \nmy opinion, in any way limit the research into those areas because this \nbill is purely directed at the embryo issue and the creation of a \ncloned human being as a result of taking that step. The scientific\n\n[[Page S433]]\n\nissues are further protected by the commission which is in this bill, \nwhich says essentially that we have in place, or will have in place, a \nbioethical commission which will be able to evaluate science as it \nevolves and make a determination as to when science needs to have more \nleverage or needs to have more flexibility and then can come to the \nCongress and say what changes should occur in order to allow for that \nflexibility. So there is in place a commission which is not only \nscientifically based but is theologically based and which is \npolitically based, in the sense that it represents, not politicians, \nbut the community at large and which will have the capacity to review \nwhat is happening in the area of cloning technology so that we can stay \nahead of the curve and be sure we are not limiting the scientific \nexperience and expansion in this very critical area.\n  So this bill allows for cloning in the area of agriculture and it \nallows for cloning in the area of animal husbandry. It also allows for \ncloning for the production of organs. It allows for cloning in stem \ncell research technology. It allows for cloning in a whole variety of \nplaces. Where it does not allow cloning is in the production of a human \nbeing, and that is what we should be saying. As a matter of ethics, as \na matter of policy, as a matter of a nation which must stand up and \ndefine its purposes and ideas, we should be saying humans shall not be \ncloned.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know there are others on the floor. \nThe distinguished Senator from Texas and my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts wished to speak on this issue. I would just like to wrap \nup very rapidly.\n  This whole issue was really galvanized with the cloning of the sheep \nDolly. Let me reinforce the fact that it took 277 attempts before this \ncloning was successful. The impact of the cloning is not yet known.\n  The second point is that the science is such that huge disabilities, \nreal problems can result from human cloning. It is unsafe.\n  And my third point is, the circumstances to not require us to rush. \nChicago physicist Dr. Richard Seed propelled the debate into full force \nlast month when he told the media that he intended to clone human \nbeings. And he said that there were 10 clinics in the United States \ninterested in offering cloning services and that he believed the demand \nwould be for 200,000 cases per year. That's according to the American \nMedical News.\n  Since that time, as you know, the scientific community itself has \nexercised a self-imposed moratorium on human cloning. I know of no \nlegitimate lab, hospital, or facility that will permit human cloning \ntoday. I also would like to add that the FDA has said that they are \nasserting jurisdiction in this area and will not permit human cloning. \nSo I respectfully submit to those who feel there is time pressure that \nforces us to proceed to the Senate today, that is not correct. There is \ntime for us to take time to consider this issue, to hear the testimony, \nto go over the scientific terms, to really debate whether the \nFeinstein-Kennedy approach or the Bond-Frist approach or perhaps a \nthird or fourth approach is the right way to go.\n  So I would like to end my comments today, Mr. President, by thanking \nyou for your discretion and by appealing to the majority side of this \nbody. You have an opportunity to do some good. But you also have an \nopportunity to do enormous harm that could cost tens of thousands of \nlives needlessly if we do not legislate carefully. So let's do it \nright.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might speak \nfor 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S425-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S433-S434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to talk today on the same subject \nSenator Byrd spoke on earlier and that Senator Chafee also spoke on \nearlier. Without getting into a debate with Senator Chafee, I want to \nrespond to a couple of things he said.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that in the American system of \nGovernment, we have a series of dedicated revenues where we collect \nspecific taxes and fees and we tell the American people that those \ntaxes or those fees are dedicated to a specific purpose. When you go to \na filling station, if you live in a State that has banned the little \nclip that holds the nozzle in the ``on'' position so you have to stand \nthere while it's pumping gas into your car or your truck, I am sure \nthat you have read the sign on the gasoline pump. It basically says, if \nyou wanted to reduce it down to good news and bad news, that the bad \nnews is that a third of the price that Americans are paying for \ngasoline is taxes. But the good news is every American is assured on \nevery gasoline pump in America that those taxes are going to build \nhighways. Virtually every American in this era of self-service has read \nthat sign on the gasoline pump, the bad news and the good news.\n  The problem is, the good news is not true. The bad news is sure \nenough honest to God true. But the good news is not true. Today, on \naverage, somewhere between 25 cents and 30 cents out of every dollar of \ngasoline taxes is not spent on roads. So that when we tell the American \npeople that the gasoline tax is a user fee for roads, as is often the \ncase in Government, we are not totally leveling with the American \npeople.\n  Senator Byrd and I would like to partially change that. I want to \nexplain exactly what we are doing. As my colleagues will remember, in \n1993, for the first time in American history, the President pushed \nthrough Congress a permanent gasoline tax, 4.3 cents per gallon, that \nwas not dedicated to the highway trust fund, and every penny of it was \nspent by Government on a broad array of projects and programs, none of \nwhich had anything to do with highways. You will remember that I \noffered an amendment in the Finance Committee that was adopted by the \nSenate, ultimately adopted by the conference, voted on in the House and \nSenate, signed into law by the President, that took that 4.3-cent-a-\ngallon tax on gasoline away from the general revenue and put it in the \nhighway trust fund, where it belongs.\n  We now are looking at a situation where, if we don't take action to \nallow a competition where those of us who believe that, relatively \nspeaking, we are spending too much on many programs and not spending \nenough on highways, we are going to have a situation where the trust \nfund could rise to almost $80 billion, where we have collected $80 \nbillion between now and the end of the highway bill that should be \nbefore the Senate today. We will have collected $80 billion, telling \npeople the money was going to highways, and, yet, every penny of it \nwill have been spent on something else.\n  Senator Byrd and I have said that that is not honest. Senator Byrd \nand I have said that our amendment, basically, has to do in part with \nhonesty in Government.\n  Our dear colleague from Rhode Island has said that this has something \nto do with the budget surplus, or at least has talked about surpluses \nin the trust fund and the budget in such a way that people might get \nconfused between the two. So I want to make it very clear what the \nByrd-Gramm amendment does and what it does not do. In fact, anybody who \nwants to read the amendment can understand exactly what it does, \nbecause it is a very simple amendment.\n  Basically, what the amendment says is this: We have put the 4.3 cent \na gallon tax on gasoline into the trust fund. We had a surplus of $23 \nbillion that had already been collected to build roads but has been \nspent on something else. What Senator Byrd and I are saying, in \nessence, is, all right, we ought to get that money back. Fairness would \ndictate it goes to roads. It was collected for that purpose.\n  An analogy I have used is that it is like a rustler has come out and \nhas been stealing your cattle and you catch him. Senator Byrd and I \ncalled the sheriff and the sheriff has come out and arrested this \nrustler. Being benevolent, we have said two remarkable things. No. 1, \nwe are not going to hang you,\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\nand, No. 2, we are not going to make you give any of the cattle back \nthat you have already rustled. All we are saying is stop rustling our \ncattle. What you have already taken from the highway trust fund and \nspent on other things, go and sin no more.\n  Their response is, ``Well, it's great to spend money on highways, but \nwhere''--going back to my rustling analogy--``where are we going to get \nour beef? If we can't raid the highway trust fund to fund other \nprograms of Government, just where are we going to get our money?''\n  That's not my problem. We have Members of the Senate who were looking \nat that $80 billion and saying, ``Great, if we can prevent that from \nbeing spent on highways, we could spend it to pay arrears of the U.N. \ndues, we could spend it on social programs, we could give it to the \nLegal Services Corporation, we could do all kinds of things with it.'' \nSo they are not happy that Senator Byrd and I want to allow the money \nto be spent on highways.\n  After, basically, raising the concern that they are going to be \ndisadvantaged because they wanted to spend the money in inappropriate \nways, now they are trying to say that Senator Byrd's amendment and my \namendment would bust the budget. It is not so. Our amendment does not \nraise the spending caps in the budget. Our amendment does not provide \nany authority or mandate or excuse for violating the budget agreement \nwe reached last year. All our amendment says is this: You are \ncollecting this money in gasoline taxes. You are telling people that \nyou are spending the taxes to build roads. At least allow those who \nwant to deliver on what you are promising the American people the right \nto compete in the appropriations process with every other program of \nthe Federal Government.\n  The answer for those who don't want the money spent on roads is, \ndon't bring up the highway bill; wait and vote on this as part of the \nbudget. Now here is what they hope to do. They hope to convince some of \nour Democratic colleagues that if they let the highway trust fund be \nspent on highways, that there is strong support for building new roads, \nwhich the country desperately needs and, after all, we said the money \nwas being spent for it when we collected the gasoline taxes. So they \nare worried that we will build roads or they are going to argue that we \nwill build roads and that will take money away from other programs, so \nif you want other programs, you don't want to build roads.\n\n  They are going to try by getting this all involved in the budget so \nit can be commingled with President Clinton's proposal to increase \nspending by $130 billion and bust the caps. They are hoping to convince \nRepublicans that our proposal is no different than the President's \nproposal.\n  The truth is, all we are asking is that money collected in gasoline \ntaxes for highways be authorized to be spent on highways, and then we \nhave to have competition for available money. And under the budget, if \nwe spend the money on roads, obviously, we are going to have to set \npriorities, and every Member of the Senate will have to make those \ndecisions.\n  But this is not a budget issue. We are not talking about breaking the \nspending caps. This is an issue about highways. Let me tell you why it \nis critically important.\n  The current highway bill ends on May 1. It is highly unlikely that we \nwill get another extension of the highway bill. Construction projects \non roads and highways all over America are going to come to a \nscreeching halt on May 1. In my part of the country, which is more \nblessed by God than others, we have long building periods where people \ncan construct through a long spring and summer and fall and actually, \nfor all practical purposes, build year round. But in many States of the \nUnion, they have a 3- or 4-month window when they have to build \nhighways.\n  So if we follow the prescription of the people who don't support \nbuilding more roads, who want to spend the highway trust fund on other \nthings, we are going to delay, and by delaying, we may get no highway \nbill, the States in the northern part of the country may lose their \nwhole building window within this year and, finally, people need to \nmake plans. They need to hire workers. They need to buy capital \nequipment. We have major highway projects that are partially completed, \nso we have tied up all this money in building new interstates and new \nbypasses, and the States, if we are forced to stop construction, will \nget no use out of those projects.\n  So I want to urge the majority leader to bring up the highway bill \nand bring it up next week. I want to make it clear to my colleagues, I \nwill not support breaking the spending cap. I would not author an \namendment that broke the spending cap. Our amendment does not raise the \nspending cap, and that is not what the Senator from Rhode Island is \nworried about. He is worried that we won't break the spending cap and \nthat highways will compete money away from other programs. Well, I am \nnot worried about that. That is exactly what I want to do, and I think \nit is the right thing to do. We have 51 cosponsors. We would love to \nhave more.\n  I thank the Chair for the Chair's indulgence, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S433-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S434-S439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier today, a request was made to \nconsider the cloning legislation that had been introduced by my friend \nand colleague, Senator Bond. Objection was made to the consideration of \nthat legislation by the Senator from California.\n  I want to just indicate to our Members that I think Senator Feinstein \nwas quite right to file that objection. Many of us who are on the Labor \nCommittee believed we would be debating the Satcher nomination this \nafternoon. It is an enormously important matter that has been delayed \ntoo long. We have an outstanding nominee. In fairness, we should be \ncontinuing that debate today. The leadership has decided to move on to \nthis cloning legislation.\n  I believe that this legislation that is being proposed is one of the \nmost important scientific and ethical issues of the 21st century. The \nlegislation itself was introduced 2 days ago. It was put on the \ncalendar 1 day ago. It has not received 1 day of committee hearings. It \nhas not received 1 minute of committee markup. This legislation is a \nmatter of enormous significance and importance to the research \ncommunities all across this country and they understand that this \nlegislation does not only impact human cloning.\n\n  As the research community has pointed out, technologies that would be \nbanned under Senator Bond's bill offer the key for reaching resolution \nof a number of very important diseases: Cancer, diabetes, birth \ndefects, arthritis, organ failure, genetic diseases, severe skin burns, \nmultiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and spinal cord injuries. Stem \ncells may be the key to reproducing nerve cells, which is not possible \ntoday, and other cells that may be used to treat Alzheimer's disease, \nParkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease. The major researchers in \nevery one of these areas oppose strenuously the Bond legislation \nbecause they believe that it will provide a significant barrier to \nmeaningful progress in a number of promising research areas.\n  I will be delighted to discuss these issues, as Senator Feinstein \nbelieves we should, in a timely way so that we can at least have an \nopportunity to consider these measures in the committee and report \nthose out.\n  Therefore, I join Senator Feinstein in objecting to the consideration \nof cloning legislation at this time. We have introduced legislation of \nour own on this subject. We hope that the Senate will consider it in \ndue course, and that we can work out an acceptable compromise on this \nissue to give it the careful action it deserves. A rush to enact bad \nlegislation on this subject would be far worse than passing no \nlegislation at all. Every scientist in America understands that, and \nthe American people should understand it, too.\n  Several months ago, the world learned of one of the most astounding \ndevelopments in modern biology--the cloning of a sheep named Dolly. \nThis incredible scientific achievement awakened widespread concern \nabout the possibility of a brave new world, in which human beings would \nbe made to\n\n[[Page S435]]\n\norder and where individuals would seek to achieve a kind of immortality \nby reproducing themselves. There is widespread agreement among \nscientists, ethicists, and average Americans that production of human \nbeings by cloning should be prohibited.\n  The President reacted rapidly and responsibly to this scientific \nadvance and the unprecedented issues it raised by asking the National \nBioethics Advisory Commission to study the issue and make \nrecommendations. The Commission recommended that creation of human \nbeings by cloning should be banned for at least five years, and the \nAdministration has submitted legislation to implement this \nrecommendation.\n  The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I have introduced will \nassure the American public that reproducing human beings by cloning \nwill be prohibited. It follows the President's legislation and the \nrecommendations of the Commission. It makes it illegal to produce human \nbeings by cloning, and establishes strict penalties for those who try \nto do so.\n  If the legislation the Majority Leader is seeking to call up achieved \nthis objective, I believe that it would be passed unanimously by the \nSenate. Unfortunately, it goes much farther. It does not just ban \ncloning of human beings, it bans vital medical research related to \ncloning--research which has the potential to find new cures for cancer, \ndiabetes, birth defects and genetic diseases of all kinds, blindness, \nParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, paralysis due to spinal cord \ninjury, arthritis, liver disease, life-threatening burns, and many \nother illnesses and injuries.\n  All of these various kinds of research have broad support in Congress \nand the country. A blunderbuss ban on cloning research would seriously \ninterfere with this important and life-saving research, or even halt it \naltogether. Scientists, physicians and other health professionals, \nbiotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, and citizens and \npatients working with organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis \nFoundation, the Parkinson's Action Network, the AIDS Action Council, \nthe American Diabetes Association, and the Candlelighter's Childhood \nCancer Foundation understand this. The Senate should understand it, \ntoo.\n  Let me read from a letter signed by the organizations I have just \ncited and many others as well and sent to members of Congress on \nJanuary 26, 1998. The participating organizations said, ``We oppose the \ncloning of a human being. We see no ethical or medical justification \nfor the cloning of a human being and agree . . . that it is \nunacceptable at this time for anyone in the public or private sector, \nwhether in a research or clinical setting, to create a human child \nusing somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.''\n  But they go on to say, ``Poorly crafted legislation to ban the \ncloning of human beings may put at risk biomedical research.''\n  They point to a long list of diseases where cloning research could be \ncritical, including cancer, diabetes, allergies, asthma, HIV/AIDS, eye \ndiseases, spinal cord injuries, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Gaucher \ndisease, stroke, cystic fibrosis, kidney cancer, Alzheimer's \ndisease''--the list goes on and on.\n  They conclude: ``We urge the Congress to proceed with extreme caution \nand adhere to the ethical standard for physicians, `first do no harm.' \nWe believe that there are two distinct issues here, cloning of a human \nbeing and the healing that comes from biomedical research. Congress \nmust be sure that any legislation which it considers does no harm to \nbiomedical research which can heal those with deadly and debilitating \ndiseases.''\n\n  These are reasonable tests for legislation in this important area. \nFirst, do no harm. Proceed with extreme caution. No one can pretend \nthat the legislation the Majority Leader is seeking to call up meets \nthese tests?\n  Proceed with extreme caution! The Majority Leader's legislation was \nintroduced on Tuesday of this week. There has not been a single day of \nhearings held on it. Not one single day. I doubt that more than a few \nmembers of this body have even had the opportunity to read the \nlegislation.\n  Many of our offices have been deluged with calls from health \norganizations, scientific bodies, and individual scientists and \nphysicians who are seriously concerned about the damage this bill may \ndo to fundamental research and to possible discovery of long-sought \ncures for dread diseases. Within a few days, we will have dozens if not \nhundreds of distinguished scientific bodies and disease societies \nexpressing their opposition to this bill in its current form. As far as \nI know, there is not a single major scientific body of any stature that \nhas endorsed this legislation.\n  What is the rush? What is the rush? It is not as if, despite the \nabsurd publicity given to Richard Seed, a baby will be cloned tomorrow. \nTo quote again from the letter I cited earlier, ``The American Society \nfor Reproductive Medicine, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, and \nthe Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology have all \nstated that their members will not seek to clone a human being. These \nthree associations include essentially every researcher or practitioner \nin the United States who has the scientific capability to clone a human \nbeing.''\n  It is also important to recognize that the Food and Drug \nAdministration already has broad jurisdiction over human cloning, and \nwould act vigorously to shut down any clinic that operates without FDA \napproval. Such approval depends on a finding that human cloning is safe \nand effective. But given the current state of science, no human cloning \nprocedure could possibly be called safe at this time. The FDA approval \nprocess is not a permanent ban on human cloning, but it effectively \nbans the procedure for the near future.\n  So we have a situation where the procedure is not yet perfected, \nwhere the scientists who are competent to clone a human being say that \nthey will not do it, and where the FDA already has the legal tools and \nresponsibility to prevent it. We do not need to act today--and we \nshould not act today--because this bill goes far beyond the simple \nprohibition of the creation of a human being by cloning.\n  The sponsors of this legislation state that all they want to do is \nban cloning of a human being and that they do not want to interrupt \nimportant research. But their bill goes far beyond that, and it does \nnot deserve to pass.\n  This bill would clearly interfere with medical research that offers \nhope for a cure of many deadly diseases. A letter I received two days \nago from leaders of the Society for Developmental Biology states: ``As \nactive researchers in developmental biology, we understand the \nimplications of the Dolly cloning results for basic science and human \nhealth.'' These techniques are essential for basic research because, as \nthe letter goes on to say, ``Many diseases, including heart disease, \ndiabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's Disease) \ninvolve the depletion or destruction of a particular cell type. One of \nthe great hopes in medicine is to learn ways to replace the lost or \ndamaged cells, for example by stimulating the body to regenerate its \nown missing cells or by growing the cells in culture and providing them \nto patients. The main obstacle is that most of the needed cell types \ncannot be grown in culture, nor can their growth be stimulated in any \nknown way. Dolly was grown from the nucleus of an adult cell, \nproving that the genetic material of an adult body cell can be \nreprogrammed by the egg to restore the genetic potential for \nspecializing into all possible cell types. Basic research on genetic \nprogramming will likely lead to novel transplantation therapies for \nnumerous human diseases. In essence, we all carry in our cells a \nlibrary of all the information needed to build a healthy human, and \nDolly proves that the information can be reactivated and used again. \nWhat are the implications? For example, instead of diabetes meaning a \nlifetime of insulin injections accompanied by serious side effects, \nperhaps we can learn how to cause the reactivation of pancreas \ndevelopment genes and the regeneration of the missing cell types. Such \nexciting ideas are no longer far-fetched.''\n\n  The key ingredients of this research offer great hope. DNA from an \nadult cell is placed in an egg cell that has had its own DNA removed. \nThe egg cell then begins to grow and divide under the instructions of \nthe adult cell DNA. The procedure involves what is called\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\n``somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.'' In the case of Dolly, the \ntechnology was used to create a sheep embryo from an adult sheep cell. \nThe embryo was implanted in the womb of the female sheep and ultimately \nresulted in the birth of a baby sheep named Dolly.\n  The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I have introduced makes it \nillegal to implant a human embryo using this technique in a woman's \nwomb. Without that, no baby, no human being can be created by current \ncloning technology. This is what Dr. Seed says he is going to do. This \nis what most ethicists oppose. This is what the American people want \nbanned--and our legislation will do it.\n  But the bill proposed by the Majority Leader will go much farther. It \nwill block this new technology in all other cases as well. It will make \nit impossible to carry out the research that the overwhelming majority \nof scientists and researchers say is so important. It will make it \nimpossible to use this new technology to grow cells that can be used to \ncure diabetes or cancer or Alzheimer's disease or spinal cord injury.\n  The Majority Leader's bill--page 2, line 13, paragraph 301 is \nentitled, ``Prohibition on cloning.'' It is the heart of the bill. It \nstates, ``It shall be unlawful for any person or entity, public or \nprivate, in or affecting interstate commerce, to use human somatic cell \nnuclear transfer technology.'' That is the end of the statement. It \ndoes not just ban the technology for use in human cloning. It bans it \nfor any purpose at all.\n  That means scientists can't use the technology to try to grow cells \nto aid men and women dying of leukemia. They can't use it to grow new \neye tissue to help those going blind from certain types of cell \ndegeneration. They can't use it to grow new pancreas cells to cure \ndiabetes. They can't use it to regenerate brain tissue to help those \nwith Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. They can't use it to \nregrow spinal cord tissue to cure those who have been paralyzed in \naccidents or by war wounds.\n  Congress should ban the production of human beings by cloning. We \nshould not slam on the brakes and have scientific research that has so \nmuch potential to bring help and hope to millions of citizens. As J. \nBenjamin Younger, Executive Director of the American Society for \nReproductive Medicine, has said:\n  ``We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human \ncloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people to needless \nsuffering because research and progress into their illness cannot \nproceed.''\n  Let us work together. Let us stop this know-nothing and unnecessarily \ndestructive bill. Together, we can develop legislation that will ban \nthe cloning of human beings, without banning needed medical research \nthat can bring the blessings of good health to so many millions of our \nfellow citizens.\n  I bet you could take the legislation that we are talking about here, \nand I bet there aren't three Members of this Senate who have read this \nlegislation. They could not. It was just out yesterday. And most of the \nMembers have been involved in the various other measures. And we are \nbeing asked to vote on it. No committee, no explanation, absolutely \nnone that is going to affect very, very important research.\n  That is not the way that we are going to try and move on into the \nnext millennium, which is really the millennium of the life sciences. \nAs science, as chemistry and physics have been in our past history, \nlife sciences are going to be the key to the next millennium. And we \nwant to make sure that we are going to meet our responsibilities and \nour opportunities in a way that is going to bring credit to the kind of \nresearch and can help make an enormous difference to families all over \nthis country and really all over the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak, hopefully in part at \nleast, to clarify where we are today in terms of a bill which is \nenormously important to all of us, to our families, to our children, to \nhealth care, to medical science. It is a bill that has been talked \nabout in the context of cloning, of human cloning. For the past year--\nnot on the specifics of the bill--no, but there has been debate in the \npast year about whether or not today, in 1998, our society is ready to \nclone, or have mass production, of cloned human individuals.\n  My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts just spoke to the \nimportance of science, and of protecting scientific discoveries that \nwill contribute to health care for the next generation. As a scientist, \nlet me say at the outset that I could not agree more wholeheartedly \nwith the commitment to not slowing down science in its efforts to \nimprove health care.\n  I say this, and I will qualify my statement by saying that we have to \ntoday consider the ethical implications that surround scientific \ndiscovery. We must consider the ethical ramifications that might--in \ncertain very narrowly defined and specific arenas--tell us to stop, \ntell us to slow down before we jump or really leap ahead--into the \nunknown. This would have huge moral and ethical implications, not just \nin how we deal with each other as individuals, but also in terms of how \nwe deal with each other globally. This is because we are talking about \naffecting the overall genetic pool as well as the psychosocial \nimplications of how we are defined as individuals.\n  This does need to be addressed. It is going to take an ongoing \ndialogue. We cannot--cannot--answer all the questions here in this \nSenate Chamber or in the U.S. Congress. It does take the overall debate \nof ``What are the ethical limitations to various aspects of science \ntoday?'' into the public square--where we can meet with scientists, lay \npeople, bioethicists, people from the business community, theologians, \nand ethicists broadly.\n  We need to face that. And I mention that because this bill has not \nbeen brought to the floor formally. We have the objection. But I think \nit is important to understand what this particular bill does. It does \ntwo important things. No. 1, it establishes a commission, a bioethical \ncommission which is composed of 25 people, a permanent commission that \nwill look at the bioethical issues of new innovations, new science, new \ntechnology so that we do not have to debate every new breakthrough, \nevery new technology which is coming with increasing frequency here in \nthis Chamber.\n  This commission is to be comprised of 24 individuals. Subcommittees \nare set up in terms of ethics, medicine, theology, science and social \nsciences. It is broadly representative, not with politicians on it. In \nfact, there is an exclusion in there for putting politicians on it, but \nit will be appointed in a bicameral way by both sides of the aisle, \nbroadly representative, with each member serving for 3 years, rotating \nmembers, with ongoing discussion.\n  There is no forum today for the American people to have the ethical, \ntheological, scientific, social implications of this new technology \ndiscussed. And that is why this is striking such a strong chord here \ntoday. So some people say, ``Why don't we run away from this? Why don't \nwe just say,'' based on what I have just implied, ``let's don't address \nit now. Let's wait until the future?''\n  Well, in truth, that is what has happened over the last year. We had \na breakthrough. And it is a breakthrough using a specific technology \nwhich in a sheep--Dolly--really captured the attention of the world \nbecause it demonstrated for the first time that we are on the edge or \non a precipice looking out to a type of science which we have never had \nto face before realistically, and that is the replication, the \nduplication of the human being.\n  How have we handled it? It is not like we have not talked about human \ncloning. Yet a lot of people will come forward and say we have not \naddressed this in this body or as a Nation.\n\n  As chairman of a subcommittee which is focused on issues of public \nhealth and safety, I can tell you that the subcommittee actually held \ntwo hearings. The first hearing was entitled ``Examining Scientific \nDiscoveries In Cloning, Focusing On Challenges For Public Policy.'' And \nthat particular hearing was in March of last year. We had a number of \npeople come forward. Again, this is for the benefit of my colleagues so \nthey can go back and look at the testimony that was presented\n\n[[Page S437]]\n\nreally aimed directly at the Wilmut experiment on Dolly, somatic cell \nnuclear transfer and its implications.\n  That discussion was begun back in March. Harold Varmus, who is \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, came and testified. His \ntestimony is available, talking about this specific technique. Dr. Ian \nWilmut talked before our committee in a public hearing. He is an \nembryologist at Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. I had an \nopportunity to visit the institute there and view the type of research \nthat is going on personally.\n  Dr. Wilmut's testimony has been presented to this body. I would \nencourage my colleagues to go back and look at that public hearing. We \nlooked principally, at that particular hearing, at the scientific \ndiscoveries. But we wanted to hear from members of the National \nBioethics Advisory Committee, or NBAC. The NBAC committee was \neventually charged, over a 90-day period, to look at this issue of \nhuman cloning and to make recommendations. And we had Dr. Alta Charo, \nprofessor of law, University of Wisconsin, on behalf of the National \nBioethics Advisory Commission testifying.\n  We also had John Wallwork, director of the transplant unit--\ntransplantation, my field, has been mentioned on the floor today. And I \nhope to have a few comments on that shortly because I think we have to \nbe very careful not to overstate what the bill, which has not yet even \nbeen discussed, does because it is easy to frighten people and say that \nthis bill is going to shut down science in a field like \ntransplantation. It does not do that. This bill is very, very narrowly \ndefined and only in an arena which results in human cloning.\n  We held another hearing. And that hearing was entitled, ``Ethics And \nTheology: A Continuation Of The National Discussion On Human Cloning.'' \nI mention this because, as a scientist, as a physician, as someone who \nhas taken care of patients, and now as a U.S. Senator, I am going to \ncome back to again and again that we do have the responsibility to look \nat the ethical implications of new innovations. That is what we are, \ntrustees of the American people.\n  This hearing on ``Ethics And Theology: A Continuation Of The National \nDiscussion On Human Cloning'' had witnesses, such as James Childress, \nagain a member of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, and also \nEdwin Kyle, professor of religious studies at the University of \nVirginia. We had Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a member of the National \nBioethics Advisory Commission. We had a number of people testifying \nfrom the theological community as well.\n  I mentioned both of these hearings and the testimony therein for two \nreasons: No. 1, to help my colleagues and the American people know \nwhere they can reference certain material, and, No. 2, to demonstrate \nthat the dialogue has been ongoing both in Washington, DC, in the U.S. \nSenate, in Congress broadly, but also on the public square.\n  We have heard some call for a private moratorium among the scientific \ncommunities. All of that seems pretty good until we recognize that it \nis not working. Just several weeks ago, we had a proposal by an \nindividual, in essence, to set up an industry. The purpose of that \nindustry is stated, not in these exact words, but that industry which \nis proposed is to clone human individuals.\n  I'm of course, referring to Dr. Seed. Can it be done? We don't know. \nWe know that there is a certain technology that worked in an animal \nthat, if a lot of people focused on that and there were a lot of \nexperiments, could result in a human being. But the pronouncement that \nin spite of the moratorium, in spite of the discussions today, that we \nhave an individual proposing the creation of an industry that is going \nto go charging ahead when we don't know the implications to society, to \nthis country, to the world, is something that we must react to.\n  Tough issue. Ethics. We are talking about a procedure which has never \nbeen applied in the human arena. It has only been performed in animals. \nA lot of hypothetical examples will come to the floor. This bill \naddresses the problem that I just stated. We don't have a national \nforum now in which to intelligently, with broad input, discuss these \nethical implications of new technology and new innovations and science. \nThis bill, once it is allowed to be brought to the floor, very \nspecifically sets up a mechanism outside of the U.S. Congress but \nbroadly representative to be able to discuss these issues in a \nsophisticated, intelligent, ethical way. We need that mechanism. This \nbill creates that mechanism permanently.\n  The second thing that this bill does, it attempts to--and it is \ntough; I can tell you it is tough in terms of doing it just right, but \nthe bill does it just right--it narrowly focuses on a particular \nprocedure in the big world of science and research. It takes a very \nspecific procedure that has never been even used in human cells in \nterms of creating embryos and says let's ban that procedure. Let's \nallow that procedure, even in animals, in the research arena, in cells. \nLet's learn more about that procedure so we will know what those \nimplications are. But let's ban that narrow procedure when it is used \nto create a human being, another person.\n  Now, the advantage is by banning just that specific technique as it \napplies to human cloning, you can still continue experimenting with \nDollys, bovine models, pigs, cows, baboons--animal research. There will \nbe a lot of people who will say maybe we shouldn't use it there, but \nthat is not what this bill does. It only bans the somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer, so-called Dolly technique, as it applies to human cloning. In \nvitro research continues, other embryo research continues. This does \nnot stop embryo research, or research on diabetes or sickle cell or \ncancer. It does not do that. It takes a very narrow procedure which is \nnot commonly even applied to human cloning and says, stop, we will ban \nthat. All other research continues.\n  No. 1, we do not ban all somatic cell nuclear transfer, only somatic \ncell nuclear transfer which is a specific technique as it applies to \nhuman cloning. Somatic cell nuclear transfer technology can continue in \nother fields. It can continue in animals. It can continue in cells. It \nis important for people to understand that we only ban this very \nspecific procedure when used to produce a cloned human embryo.\n  Second, a little while ago a concern was expressed about the \ndefinition of ``embryo''; the definitions are imprecise. We don't need \nto get into a debate about how to define an embryo this morning or \ntoday or on the floor of the U.S. Senate because we already know what \nan embryo is. I will just cite two references. The National Institutes \nof Health Embryo Panel, which had a formal report in 1994, basically \nsaid, ``In humans, the developing organism from the time of \nfertilization.'' That is their definition of embryo.\n  If we look at the very good, although admittedly I will say \nincomplete, report by the NBAC, the National Bioethics \nAdvisory Committee appointed by the President, which had a very short \ntime line, their report I should say had recommendations based on the \nsafety of the procedure. They admitted they did not have the time or \nthe process to look at all the ethical and social and theological \nimplications. They held hearings on it, but their conclusions were not \nbased on those ethical considerations. In their report in 1997, several \nmonths ago, they said the embryo is ``the developing organism from the \ntime of fertilization.''\n\n  The NIH Embryo Panel--I was not in this body at that point in time, \nbut I have had the opportunity to go back and read their findings and \ntheir report--was very clear in their statement that the embryo does \nhave some moral significance. The embryo as just defined by these two \ndefinitions does have moral significance today.\n  There is a huge debate, a debate which I think we should avoid on \nthis narrow, narrow bill, that can go into abortion, pro-choice and \npro-life, when do you define a life. I don't think we need at this \npoint in time to get into that discussion. We do need to recognize that \npeople such as previous panels like the NIH Embryo Panel did give moral \nsignificance to that embryo.\n  Now, third, in essence, the statement was made the application of \nnuclear transfer cloning to humans could provide a potential source of \norgans or tissues of a predetermined genetic background. That statement \nrefers to my own field of transplantation where the\n\n[[Page S438]]\n\nconcept is that rejection of a heart or of a lung or of a kidney is \ndetermined in large part by how different the recipient organism looks \nat that transplanted organ, genetically how different are they, which \nexplains this whole process we called rejection. That is an \ninflammatory-like process which says the recipient body will reject \nthat heart, either more often or totally. The genetically closer you \nget, the less that process of rejection occurs, free of other types of \nimmunosuppression. This whole idea of having lots of copies of an \norgan, of a DNA, is one line of research in terms of eliminating \nrejection.\n  References were made to spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, cancer, with the whole premise being that research will be \nshut down in these fields. I want to assure my colleagues it will not. \nAgain, it is a very specific, narrow procedure as it applies to human \ncloning. Animal research will continue, plant research will continue, \nother cellular research will continue.\n  Now, NBAC also in their report in 1997 looked at this issue about \ntransplantation, since that was brought up on the floor. Let me refer \nto their finding, and this is from their Chapter 2, Science and \nApplications of Cloning, in their report. ``Because of ethical and \nmoral concerns raised by the use of embryos for research purposes, it \nwould be far more desirable to explore the direct use of human cells of \nadult origin to produce specialized cells or tissues for \ntransplantation into patients.''\n  I think it pretty much speaks for itself based on their ethical and \nmoral concerns with this type of research that you don't necessarily \nhave to rely on somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce an embryo as \nbeing the technique in order to create this likeness to prevent \nrejection.\n  No. 2, they say it deals with transplantation and research. ``Given \ncurrent uncertainties about the feasibility of this, however, much \nresearch would be needed in animal systems before it would be \nscientifically sound and therefore potentially morally acceptable to go \nforward with this approach.'' That is, the approach of somatic cell \nnuclear transfer. So what NBAC concluded, ``Given these uncertainties. \n. .much research would be needed in animal systems. . ..''\n  Our bill allows that research to continue and then make a decision, \npossibly 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 3 years from now, in \nterms of what we learn from those animal systems. Our bill says, \n``Don't use this technique to clone humans.'' There are a lot of other \nstrategies. I don't want my colleagues to think that somatic cell \nnuclear transfer technique is one of the more important techniques \ntoday. There are all sorts of strategies in terms of the \ntransplantation arena.\n\n  Again, looking at NBAC, they recognize that, ``Another strategy for \ncell-based therapies would be to identify methods by which somatic \ncells could be de-differentiated and redifferentiated along a \nparticular path. This would eliminate the need to use cells obtained \nfrom embryos.''\n  Again, now is not the time to go into these details, but I do want to \nshow in part the richness of science to demonstrate that this one \nparticular technique as applied to a human, as applied to human \ncloning, is the only thing that is being banned, and all this other \nresearch continues right along.\n  The issue has come up and will likely come up, should we create \nembryos purely for research purposes? Our bill does not. Let me say at \nthe outset, our bill, as I said, allows embryo research to continue as \nit is today under the requirements and the regulations that are out \nthere today. What our bill does, it looks at a particular technique \nwith other research and embryos allowed to continue. You can step back \nand say, should someone be out creating all these mass-produced human \nembryos just to do research on them and then destroy those embryos? It \nis an issue which is very likely to come up before this body.\n  Let me introduce it and just say that our bill does not allow \ncreation of these embryos using somatic cell nuclear transfer--human \nembryos. Again, animal research can continue. The Washington Post \nreally captured, I think, what this debate will evolve to as we look at \nethics and theology and science, careful not to slow down the progress \nof science which we want to encourage in all the fields that have been \nmentioned this morning. The Washington Post editorial in 1994 basically \nsays, ``The creation of human embryos specifically for research that \nwill destroy them is unconscionable. Viewed from one angle, this issue \ncan be made to yield endless complexity. What about the suffering of \nindividuals and infertile couples who might be helped by embryo \nresearch? What about the status of the brand new embryo? But before you \nget to these questions, there is a simpler one: Is there a line that \nshould not be crossed even for scientific or other gain, and if so, \nwhere is it?\"\n  This is not a one-side-of-the-aisle issue. In fact, both sides of the \naisle have put forth bans on human cloning. President Clinton doesn't \nbelieve the Federal Government should be funding embryo-type research. \nBasically he has said, ``The subject raises profound ethical and moral \nquestions as well as issues concerning the appropriate allocation of \nFederal funds. I appreciate the work of the committees that have \nconsidered this complex issue and I understand that advances in in \nvitro fertilization research and other areas could be derived from \nsufficient work. However, I do not believe that Federal funds should be \nused to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes.''\n  Well, let me step back and then I will close. The bill, which we had \nhoped would come to the floor today does two things. No. 1, it creates \na bioethics commission, permanent, 24 members, broadly representative \nof society today, with the disciplines of ethics, bioethics, theology, \nthe social sciences, all well represented, a forum that I think is most \nappropriate to discuss these very difficult issues of technology that \nwill be coming through even more rapidly in the future. The answer to \nthe question is, why don't we just appoint this commission and pass \nthat part of your bill and not worry? Well, that is what we have sort \nof been doing for the last several months--sitting back as the national \ndialog continues. Yet, we have a proposal coming from the private \nsector at this juncture and that proposal is to go out with the single \nobjective of cloning human beings. If we as trustees of the American \npeople want to step back and say, no, that is too hot an issue for us, \nthat is one approach. My approach is that we go in, we address that \nspecific problem, that cloning of the human individual with the very \nbest legislation that we can do, set up a commission so that in the \nfuture both that issue and other issues can be discussed, look at the \nscience, look at the ethics, look at the philosophical and social \nimplications of this research. So that is No. 1, a bioethics \ncommission.\n  No. 2 is to target the Dr. Seeds of the world--people who don't have \nthe problem, who don't fully see the ethical potential for harm to \nsociety and to the world and, therefore, have basically publicly stated \nwhat their objective is--to create human beings, and be appealing for \nresources to do just that. That is why the American people expect us to \ncome forward and debate and talk about the implications, make sure that \nwe do exactly what I have said, which there will be debate on and that \nis in a very focused way, target a particular technique which has never \nbeen used to clone a human individual. We just want to prevent that and \nallow that science to continue.\n  The editor of the New England Journal of Medicine basically has said \nin the past: ``Knowledge, although important, may be less important to \na decent society than the way it is obtained.''\n  I hope as we go forward and look at the final disposition of this \nbill that we come back to that statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague's excellent \nstatement and, of course, since he is the only physician in the Senate, \nI think we should all pay strict attention to him.\n  Let me just say that I am very concerned about debating this bill \ntoday, a bill which falls within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee, without our having any hearings or other discussion, because \nthere are a lot of complicated issues involved here.\n  I want to let the distinguished Senator from Tennessee know that I \nsupport his statements in many respects.\n\n[[Page S439]]\n\n I, too, am opposed to cloning of human beings.\n  But at the same time, we have to move very carefully in this area so \nthat we do not preclude a lot of very promising medical technologies \nand very valuable biomedical research. It may be that amendments are \nneed to clarify that.\n  I maintain an interest in this issue both as Chairman of the \nCommittee under whose jurisdiction this criminal code amendment would \nfall, and as a Senator with a long-standing interest in biomedical \nresearch and ethics.\n  The questions raised by this legislation are both novel and difficult \nand it behooves us to move carefully.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I \nam about to give be considered as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S434-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S439-S440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NOMINATION OF DAVID SATCHER TO BE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened with great care to our \ndebate about the nomination of Dr. David Satcher over the past few \ndays. It has been a constructive discussion, one which has raised a \nnumber of important issues.\n  I have the greatest respect for the Offices of the Surgeon General \nand Assistant Secretary for Health. The individual who occupies this \nposition will become the Nation's No. 1 public health official, our top \ndoctor, if you will. For this reason, this nomination deserves the \nutmost scrutiny.\n  I have the greatest respect for our colleague, the Senator from \nMissouri. I think he has made some arguments that raise very valid \nconcerns, and it behooves this body to examine them.\n  That being said, after a great deal of analysis, I have concluded \nthat Dr. Satcher is eminently qualified for the position, and that \nthere is a more than adequate explanation for his position on two key \nissues--partial-birth abortion and HIV testing in Third World \ncountries. Accordingly, I intend to support his nomination.\n  From a humble rural background, David Satcher has risen to become a \nleading public health expert--the director of the prestigious Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, a doctor who is widely respected \nfor his ability to communicate scientific information in a credible \nmanner. He has done a great job at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  I have spoken at length with Dr. Satcher and became convinced that he \nhas an agenda that Americans of both parties should support. Tobacco \ncontrol is at the top of that agenda. On the issues of teen pregnancy \nand sexually transmitted disease, Dr. Satcher intends to promote \nabstinence and assures me that he believes health and sex education are \na parental responsibility, in which the Government should play only a \nsupportive role. Moreover, Dr. Satcher believes science should \ndetermine health policy, attendant upon which we have based virtually \nall of the public health legislation that has passed this body.\n  Let me note for the Record that Dr. Satcher has experience with three \nof the four historically black medical schools. He learned firsthand of \nthe problems that Americans face in seeking care, and he does not \nadvocate for a Federal solution.\n  During Dr. Satcher's tenure at CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, \nhe worked to increase childhood immunization rates, to develop better \nways to protect Americans from new infections, and decrease teenage \npregnancy rates. He has also demonstrated U.S. leadership in attacking \nthe world AIDS problem.\n  Critics of the nomination have raised concern that he supports the \nPresident's position on partial-birth abortion. It is no secret that I \ndisagree vehemently with that position and will continue to work until \na prohibition on partial-birth abortion is the law of the land.\n  Yes, it is true that Dr. Satcher supports the President's position, \nwhich is not surprising given that Dr. Satcher is the President's \nnominee. I certainly understand the motivation of some in saying that \nhe should be opposed for that reason.\n  But in reviewing the hearing record on this nomination, I am \nimpressed by Dr. Satcher's assurances to the committee on this issue. \nHe said, ``Let me unequivocally state that I have no intention of using \nthe positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to \npromote issues relating to abortion. I share no one's political agenda, \nand I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that \nunite Americans, not divide them. If confirmed by the Senate, I will \nstrongly promote a message of abstinence and responsibility to our \nyouth, which I believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in \nour country.'' I believe that nothing in Dr. Satcher's background, \nincluding his work as CDC Director, suggests that he would try to make \nthe Surgeon General's post into a pro-abortion bully pulpit. Indeed, he \nhas personally given me his assurances to the contrary.\n  I remember when Dr. C. Everett Koop was nominated by a Republican \nPresident and his nomination was held up for some 8 or 9 months on the \nissue of abortion, even though Dr. Koop asserted he would not use the \nSurgeon General's Office as a public forum for advocacy for abortion. \nAs things worked out, we finally were able to get him confirmed, and I \nwon't go into all the details on how that happened. He proved to be one \nof the great Surgeons General of the United States. I believe Dr. \nSatcher will likewise prove to be a very successful Surgeon General of \nthe United States. I urge my colleagues to vote for him.\n\n  In addition, I am aware that another series of questions has been \nraised regarding joint CDC/NIH-sponsored clinical trials conducted in \nThailand and the Ivory Coast to determine the effectiveness of AZT to \nprevent pregnant mothers from transmitting the HIV virus to their \nchildren.\n  In a nutshell, concern has been raised because the foreign trials \nwere placebo-controlled against a ``short course'' regimen, whereas, in \nthe United States a ``long course'' AZT regimen would have been the \nbaseline for care. While it is clear that an argument can be made that \nthe U.S. standard of care could have been used, this would not have \nresolved a more difficult problem of lack of access to expensive \nmedications.\n  While opinion is hardly unanimous on this issue, the better view is \nthat these grounds were appropriate to the nations and the populations \nstudied. These trials were done in complete partnership with the local \npatients, health officials, and the World Health Organization.\n  As our debate on the Hatch-Gregg FDA export bill in 1995 made \nabundantly clear, we need not and should not second-guess the choice of \npatients and officials in other countries who, for a myriad of reasons, \nseek not to use the American standard of care. I believe it is critical \nfor those in Congress to respect differences of the health and wealth \ncharacteristics of other countries. What is appropriate policy in the \nUnited States is not necessarily appropriate in the Third World.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize the importance of the position Dr. \nSatcher seeks to assume. The Surgeon General is the head of the United \nStates Public Health Service Commission Corps. And, formerly, the \nposition of Assistant Secretary for Health was the top public health \nslot in the government. Unfortunately, the position of Assistant \nSecretary for Health was downgraded in the Clinton administration and \nhas become less important since the ``ASH'' no longer has line \nauthority over the public health agencies such as CDC, NIH and FDA.\n  I hope that Dr. Satcher will undertake a review of that decision \nbecause I think it was a mistake, and I hope to discuss that with him \nin the future.\n  In closing, I want to point out that Dr. Satcher has a distinguished \nrecord that will be an asset to those important public health \npositions.\n  Doctor Satcher is a recognized public health leader and a member of \nthe Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the \nrecipient of numerous awards, such as the 1996 awardee of the AMA's \nprestigious Dr. Nathan B. Davis award.\n  In short, Dr. Satcher is a well-credentialed, highly effective public \nhealth leader. If confirmed, he will be the highest-ranking physician \nwithin HHS and could be counted on to be an articulate national \nspokesperson on a wide range of public health issues that we all agree \nare important.\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\n  I think we can all learn by the example set almost 20 years ago when \nthis body, as I mentioned earlier, confirmed C. Everett Koop to be \nSurgeon General over the objections of many in the other party.\n  The fears about Dr. Koop's partisanship were unfounded. Today, he is \nwidely respected by Senators on both sides of the aisle, and it is my \nhope that this is a legacy Dr. Satcher will leave as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S439-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to \nannounce what I consider to be an important development on the tobacco \nlegislative front.\n\n  This morning, a senior official in the administration, David Ogden, \ncounselor to Attorney General Reno, delivered testimony on the tobacco \nsettlement at the House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n  Mr. Ogden testified that:\n\n       If there is agreement on a comprehensive bill that advances \n     the public health, then reasonable provisions modifying the \n     civil liability of the tobacco industry would not be a deal \n     breaker.\n  Since announcement of the June 20 proposed tobacco settlement last \nyear, I have maintained that a legislative measure which incorporates \nstrong public health provisions in conjunction with certain defined \ncivil liability reforms could do more to stop the next generation of \nour children from getting hooked on tobacco than any bill we have ever \nconsidered.\n  The Administration's announcement today will do much to make passage \nof that landmark legislation possible. I call upon the President to \nsend us his language on a priority basis. In fact, I have invited the \nDepartment of Justice to testify at the Judiciary Committee hearing \nnext Tuesday on the tobacco settlement, and we will be greatly \ninterested in the details of the President's position on liability.\n  Mr. President, this is a stunning breakthrough, one which I believe \ngreatly increases the probability that a broad, bipartisan consensus \ncan be reached on the tobacco settlement.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just conclude by asking unanimous \nconsent that Bruce Artim and Marlon Priest be granted privileges of the \nfloor during the pendency of the Satcher nomination and during \nconsideration of S. 1601, the anti-cloning bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to speak to the \nbioethics commission which will be proposed. It is part of a bill which \nI am not sure is going to make it to the floor today. I would like to \ncomment on that commission.\n  Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on this concept which is in \nthe bill that will be considered sometime in the future. I am not sure \nit will be this afternoon, or next week, or sometime in the future. And \nthe aspect that I want to comment on is this bioethics commission. I \nthink it is critical that at the end of this century and on into the \nnext century we have somewhere in the United States a forum where we \ncan carry on intelligent discussions on the ethical, the theological, \nthe scientific, and the medical issues that are inevitable as science \nprogresses with breakthrough discoveries that have the potential both \nfor very good--very good--but also evil. Where do we digest those in \nthe society when they are coming through not every week nor every month \nbut even more frequently? In response to that, I proposed the national \nbioethics commission.\n  We have the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, so-called NBAC. \nAnd I think over the next few days the country will become familiar \nwith that NBAC designation. The NBAC, the National Bioethics Advisory \nCommission was appointed entirely by the President of the United \nStates. They did a very good job this past year in assimilating data, \ninformation, reports, and testimony from experts and the lay public \nbroadly over a 90-day period addressing human cloning. That was a good \nstart. But they very openly said that they were unable to substantively \naddress the ethical issues surrounding human cloning.\n  As I have said earlier today, as a scientist, and a public servant \nnow, I want to make the case that we can no longer separate science \nfrom the ethical consideration in that we as a body must address how to \nestablish a forum in which such discussions can be carried out.\n  The Commission cited inadequate time to tackle the ethical issues in \nthe context of our pluralistic, complex, intricate society in that they \nchose primarily to focus on scientific concerns as well as the less \nabstract concept of safety. What is safe or not safe? Is this procedure \nsafe, or is it not safe? They then appealed to each American citizen to \nstep up to the plate and exercise their leadership and their moral \nleadership in formulating a national policy on human cloning. We need \nthat forum.\n  Time has shown that neither the Presidential Commission nor the \nUnited States Congress is probably the forum, or at least is an \ninadequate forum, for addressing these bioethical issues which are of \ntremendous intricacy and important to society.\n  I, therefore, proposed this national bioethics commission in our \nlegislation. It is representative of the public at large. It has the \ncombined participation of experts in law, experts in science, experts \nin theology, experts in medicine, experts in social science, experts in \nphilosophy, and the interest of members of the public. It is my hope \nthat this commission will forge a new path for our country in the field \nof bioethics that will enable us to have an informed, a thoughtful, a \nsophisticated, and scientific debate in the public square without fear \non behalf of the public, or politicians, or politics driving our \ndecisions.\n  In this proposal, the majority and minority leaders of Congress would \nappoint the members of the panel. No current Member of Congress or the \nadministration would serve on this panel. We simply must depoliticize \nthese discussions which will simultaneously broaden input from the \ngeneral public. Each and every citizen of this country should have the \nopportunity to contribute to these debates.\n  This commission would be established within the Institute of \nMedicine, and would be known as a commission to promote a national \ndialogue on bioethics.\n  Very briefly, it would have 25 members, 6 appointed by the majority \nleader of the Senate, 6 by the minority leader of the Senate, 6 \nappointed by the Speaker of the House, and 6 appointed by the minority \nleader of the House of Representatives. There would be a chairman. In \naddition, representatives stated in the legislation would be from the \nfields of law, theology, philosophy, ethics, medicine, science, and \nsocial science. The commission would be appointed no later than \nDecember 1st of this year. We have to move ahead quickly. They would \nserve for a length of 3 years. And the duties of the commission, as \nspelled out in the legislation, would be to provide an independent \nforum for broad public participation and discourse concerning important \nbioethical issues, including cloning, and provide for a report to \nCongress concerning the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of \nthe commission concerning Federal policy and possible congressional \naction.\n\n  Subcommittees are established on that commission for legal issues, \nfor theological issues, for philosophical\n\n[[Page S441]]\n\nand ethical issues, medical issues, and scientific issues, and for \nsocial issues.\n  I will not belabor the commission, but want to come back to the \nconcept and the concept is to have an appropriate forum to discuss the \ntypes of issues we are discussing today, which I have made the case \nthat we have to act on today in response to proposals that have been \nmade from the private sector and to have a better, a more appropriate, \na more responsive, and a more representative forum to address such \nissues in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of commentary before \nabout the President's budget, and I would like to offer a little \ncomment prior to talking about the proposals that I heard the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, make the other \nday having to do with the importance of ISTEA legislation.\n  My own view is that there is an awful lot that Congress needs to be \nproud of at the moment. We sometimes make it worse with our actions. \nAnd when we help make things better, it seems to be important for us to \ntake stock of what we have done and to acknowledge our accomplishments.\n  I believe the last 7 years in the United States we have seen a \ndramatic transformation in the United States Congress from one of an \nexpectation almost that the Japanese and other Asian nationals are \ngoing to overwhelm us.\n  I remember very well in 1991 the debate was: Will the U.S. currency \nbe devalued in the end? Could our automobile manufacturers survive? \nCould our computer manufacturers survive? There were a lot of people \nwho reached the conclusion that we would not be able to do that, and \nwhat we ought to do is adopt the Japanese model, to have the Government \nmuch more involved in the decisionmaking businesses, with a much closer \nrelationship, and industrial policy was quite popular at the time.\n  We chose a different direction. We enacted in 1990, and in 1993 and \nagain enacted in 1997, legislation that imposed fiscal discipline on \nthe Federal Government. And as a consequence of that we are now finding \nourselves debating what are we going to do about the surplus? We have \nreduced Government borrowing, and reduced Government borrowing just \nfrom the 1993 legislation by almost $800 billion; and that coupled with \ntremendous accomplishments in the private sector, businesses and \nemployees working harder, producing more, being more competitive and \nespecially paying attention to price and quality which is what the \nconsumer increasingly is looking at before they will make a purchase.\n  Our goods are selling. Our cars and computers are selling. Our \nsoftware and food is selling. Our products are selling. People \nthroughout the world, where they have an opportunity to buy our \nproducts are saying that ``Made in the U.S.A'' is good again. It wasn't \nthat long ago when people were saying maybe it is not so good.\n  So we need to congratulate ourselves. We have a surplus. The cost of \nthe Federal Government is down to the lowest as a percentage of GDP \nthan it has been in a long time. Crime is down in most major cities. \nThere is a lot that we need to feel good about--not just as Members of \nCongress but as Americans for how it is that we have gotten to where we \nare today.\n\n  Mr. President, I think, as is always the case in any competitive \noperation, that it must be pointed out that there is a need to take \nadvantage--not to say it is terrific and we are on the top of the heap \nand become complacent. That is when you get in trouble. I understand \nthat there is uncertainty when you are having to compete. But in part \nthat uncertainty means we are doing a good job because we are not \nasking anybody to provide us with an absolute guarantee of success. We \nare saying that we are prepared to get in the market and do what we \nhave to do to be successful.\n  So I believe it is not the time in 1998 to say that it is terrific, \nand let's figure out how to spend the surplus, or let's figure out how \nto take an easy course of action. I think the President has outlined \nfor us a tough course in setting Social Security as a top priority \nsaying we have to have a discussion in 1998 about it besides in 1999 \nwhat we are going to do with the most expensive program that we have in \nWashington, DC, today. I applaud that.\n  All of us need, as we look at the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers, to be alert. And the distinguished Senator from Tennessee and \nI are both on the Medicare commission, and I presume that Medicare \ncommission, which I think is going to have our first meeting sometime \nin March relatively quickly, I hope. Our big concern should be the year \n2010, the year 2030, and the CBO numbers that we are given. All of us \nneed to understand that it only extends out 10 years. The next 10 years \nlooks pretty good. Over the next 10 years not a single baby boomer will \nretire. They start to retire; 77 million of them start to retire in the \nyear 2010. And from 2010 to 2030, the number of retirees will increase \nalmost 25 million while the number of workers only goes up 5 million. \nThat is a demographic problem--not caused by liberalism or \nconservatism. It is a demographic problem, and my guess is that this \nyear it will impose some sort of children's health fee on tobacco. My \nguess is that the increased funding in NIH will go through. And my \nguess is that as a consequence of that and what other sorts of things \nthere will be that the baby-boom generation is going to live even \nlonger than what we are currently forecasting. And their demand for \ncollective transfer payments both from Social Security and Medicare are \napt to be larger than what we are currently estimating, not likely to \nbe smaller.\n\n  During that period of time--2010-2030--the percent of our budget that \nis allocated to mandatory spending, presuming that we allow net \ninterest to go down, which is by no means certain, if we allow the debt \nto be paid down so the net interest can go down, even with that \nscenario, at the end of the baby boom generation 80 percent of the \nbudget will go to mandatory spending. All one has to do is take today's \nbudget of $1.7 trillion, subtract 80 percent, and ask yourself how you \nare going to defend the Nation with 20 percent, how you are going to \nbuild our roads, how you are going to maintain a law enforcement \nsystem, how you are going to do all the things that everyone wants to \ndo with only 20 percent left.\n  That is the dilemma, it seems to me, we are going to face. So I hope \nin this moment of exuberation and exhilaration we understand now is not \nthe time to become complacent. Now is not the time for us to just come \nto the floor and try to tee up things that are relatively easy. We have \nto get the tough things done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S441-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S441-S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I was very disappointed, many of my \ncolleagues down here, a lot of us were disappointed that we were not \nable to get the ISTEA legislation passed last year. For me the ISTEA \nlegislation is one of the most important things with which this \nCongress deals. It creates immediate jobs, employs people in my State, \nbut much more importantly, it adds to the productive capacity out in \nthe future. It contributes to our capacity to be competitive. It \nenables our families to do what they want to do when they take their \nleisure time.\n  Our transportation system is enormously important, and it is one of \nthe things we in America have to be proud of. It enables us to maintain \nour competitive edge and to be able to celebrate.\n  I was encouraged earlier last year when the majority leader indicated \nthat he was going to make this a priority and bring it up right away. I \nhave great respect for Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who is asking that this legislation be taken up after we get \na budget resolution, but that means we will have to get another 6-month \nextension. That means there will be contract uncertainty out there in \nthe country. That means we may not get this thing done until next year.\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\n  All of us know there are bitter divisions about formulas, bitter \ndivisions about how we are going to allocate our money: should it go \nout to the West, to the Northeast? All of these battles that typically \ndo not break down by party line but by geographic line, all of those \nbattles will have to be waged here in the Senate Chamber when the bill \nis brought up. If you delay it, not only do we risk not getting a 6-\nmonth extension, we risk not getting ISTEA passed until very late in \nthe session, creating contract uncertainty, creating, it seems to me, \nproblems none of us ought to be courting.\n  So I hope that the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and \nthe majority leader will bring this legislation up before this budget \nresolution, will schedule it for debate as quickly as possible.\n  We need, on behalf of the American workers, on behalf of American \nbusinesses, to pass what arguably I think both Republicans and \nDemocrats would say is apt to have the most immediate, positive impact \nin terms of our economy and in terms of jobs and productivity.\n  I have a letter from one of Nebraska's significant engineering \ncompanies pointing out, quite correctly, that there is an urgency to \nthis legislation. There are jobs hanging in the balance, there is \nproductivity hanging in the balance, there is safety hanging in the \nbalance. There are lot of things that need to be done that we are not \ngoing to be able to do if this piece of legislation is delayed.\n  I voted yesterday to rename the National Airport in favor of Ronald \nReagan. I am a Democrat. There were many of us who said, oh, my gosh, \ndo we have to put a Republican name up on our airport? Ronald Reagan \nwas one of the most important Presidents of this century. It was an \nimportant piece of legislation. But relative to ISTEA, it is not as \nimportant. When you size and scale these things in terms of the \ncontribution they are going to make to keep our people safe, to give \nour kids a good education, to give Americans a shot at the American \ndream, ISTEA gives them that opportunity. ISTEA gives us jobs; it gives \nus a chance to maintain our competitive edge.\n  I hope there is some reconsideration given. I hope that the advice \nthat was offered earlier by the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, that this legislation be brought up sooner rather \nthan later will be taken by the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S441-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S442-S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INTERNATIONAL TRADE INITIATIVES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we start the second session of the \n105th Congress I want to outline my priorities on international trade \nissues from my vantage point of chairman of the Finance Committee's \nInternational Trade Subcommittee. Some of these are legislative \ninitiatives that began in the 1st session and others are things that we \nshould be doing everyday.\n  The first thing we need to do is restore the United States to its \nrightful position of leading the world in liberalizing global trade. We \ncan do this by granting the President new trade negotiating authority. \nThe failure to pass fast track last year was harmful to American \nworkers, American farmers and American consumers.\n  Why? Free trade not only creates new, high-paying jobs/it helps \npreserve existing jobs. When high trade barriers prohibit U.S. \ncompanies from exporting to a foreign market, the company will choose \nto relocate in that other country in order to sell its product.\n  The United States has one of the most open economies in the world. \nOur average tariff is about 2.8 percent. The world average is 12 \npercent. Fifty years ago it was 48 percent. Many other countries have \nvirtually closed markets. According to the World Bank, for instance, \nChina's average tariff is 23 percent. Thailand's is 26 percent, the \nPhilippines 19 percent, Peru almost 15 percent, and Chile has a flat 11 \npercent tariff.\n  It can be difficult for American companies to export to a country \nlike China, that places a 23 percent tariff on our goods. The tariff \nprices our goods out of the market. So these companies move their plant \nto China and avoid paying the tariff.\n  The preferred alternative--for American workers--is negotiating with \nChina to lower its tariffs. Bring their tariffs down to our level. Then \nthe companies can stay here--employ American workers--and export their \ngoods to China. It's a ``no-brainer.''\n  But we can not negotiate these tariffs down without fast track \nauthority. That is why fast track is so important. It leads to lower \ntariffs in foreign countries and the preservation of American jobs.\n  Fast track also leads to the creation of new jobs. Exports already \nsupport 11 million jobs in the U.S. Each additional $1 billion in \nexports creates between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs. These jobs pay 15 \nto 20 percent higher than non-export related jobs. And, in Iowa, \ncompanies that export provide their employees 32 percent greater \nbenefits than non-exporters.\n  All of this is in jeopardy without fast track. And it is the American \nworker who will suffer.\n  Mr. President, what I am most concerned about is the vacuum of \nleadership on international issues that is left by the United States \nrelinquishing this traditional role. Ever since the first Reciprocal \nTrade Agreements Act of 1934, the United States has led the world in \nreducing barriers to trade. And we have benefitted greatly from this \nleadership.\n  American workers are the most productive, highest-paid workers in the \nworld. American companies produce the highest quality products. And \nAmerican consumers have more choices of goods and pay less of their \nincome on necessities, such as food, than consumers of any other \ncountry. These are the benefits that we have enjoyed because we've been \nwilling to lead on trade.\n  This leadership is now being questioned by our trading partners. They \nare moving on without us. They're forming regional and bilateral \ntrading arrangements that don't include the United States.\n  What are the consequences for the United States? The European Union, \nJapan and developing countries will have a greater influence in shaping \nworld trade policies. Should we trust Japan and the European Union to \nadvance our interests? How hard will they push for opening markets?\n  I ask my colleagues who voted against fast track because of labor and \nenvironmental concerns, how hard do you think other nations will push \nfor raising these standards? I ask my colleagues from rural states, do \nyou trust the European Union and Japan to push for open markets at the \n1999 WTO agriculture talks?\n  Only our President can advance our interests. Only the United States \ncan influence other countries to improve their environment and labor \nstandards, to improve human rights, and to embrace democracy through \ninternational trade. That is why the President should renew his effort \nfor fast track authority and Congress should pass it this year.\n  Congress also included a reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program in the Senate's fast track bill. This program \nassures that every American who loses their job due to a free trade \nagreement receives the job training and assistance they deserve. No \nAmerican will be left behind by our participation in the global \neconomy. My second initiative is to secure passage of the TAA this \nyear.\n  MY third priority is to keep markets open the troubled Southeast \nAsian countries. I support IMF assistance of the nations in crisis. But \nas part of the economic reforms that the IMF requires, we must insist \nthat the Asian countries open their markets to our exports.\n  Countries have a natural inclination to close their markets in time \nof crisis. But this only accelerates the downward spiral they find \nthemselves in. For their own good, they should resist the temptation to \nraise trade barriers.\n  Also, some of these countries will attempt to increase their exports \nto our\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\nmarket in order to help their economies. If that's the case, they have \na moral obligation to open their markets to our exports. And I will \nwork to make sure that happens.\n  Last week I joined with 19 of my fellow senators on a letter led by \nSenators Roberts and Baucus requesting a meeting with Treasury \nSecretary Rubin to discuss the pervasive trade barriers that remain in \nthe Asian countries. Hopefully, that meeting will lead to a cooperative \neffort between Congress and the administration to remove these \nbarriers.\n  The fourth area I will be focusing on in 1998 persuading our trading \npartners to live up to the commitments they have made in prior trade \nagreements. Getting a good agreement is one thing. But we must demand \ncompliance with our agreements on a daily basis. Many markets we \nthought we had opened are still closed.\n  I will monitor our existing agreements and strongly urge the \nadministration to bring enforcement actions when necessary. Trade \nagreements aren't worth the paper they are written on unless we put \nsome force behind them.\n  The last two initiatives I will pursue in 1998 involve agriculture \ntrade, which is so important to my state and many others. Exports now \naccount for over 30% of farm income in this country. Take away foreign \nmarkets, and we'd have to idle one-third of America's productive \ncropland.\n  In recognition of the importance of foreign trade to the agriculture \neconomy, last year Senator Daschle and I introduced S. 219 a bill \ncreating a ``Special 301'' process for agriculture. This new 301 \nprocedure requires the U.S. Trade Representative to identify and remove \nthe most onerous barriers to U.S. ag exports. It will put other \ncountries on notice that we are serious about gaining access to their \nmarkets.\n  This bill was made part of the fast track legislation that was on the \nfloor of the Senate at the end of last year. It is my intent to move \nthis bill again as a part of fast track legislation or independently, \nif necessary.\n  Finally, agriculture is preparing for another round of market access \nnegotiations at the World Trade Organization beginning in 1999. These \ntalks will lay down the rules on agriculture trade for the next \ncentury. I pledge to work with the administration to ensure the United \nStates sets the agenda for these talks.\n  Our trading partners do not necessarily want to remove their barriers \nto our ag exports. Because our farmers produce the highest quality \nproducts at the lowest cost. So American farmers will gain access to \nnew markets only if the United States leads these negotiations and \npersuades other countries to open their markets.\n  Mr. President, free and fair trade creates good, high-paying jobs. It \nraised the income of our farmers and the standard of living for our \nworkers and consumers. Trade has contributed significantly to our \nstrong economic growth and record low unemployment. I will continue to \npursue an agenda of free and fair trade through this Second Session of \nthe 105th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, the majority leader had programmed a \nshort talk but I don't see him, so I will go ahead with mine, if I may.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, may I ask my friend if he, \nin his request to speak, would add that I may speak for no more than 5 \nminutes following his remarks?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Is the request you may speak following my remarks? \nIt's absolutely fine with me, but as I said, the majority leader was \nsupposed to speak for 5 minutes. But if he's not here, that's fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If you want to amend it so he can, if he does arrive, \nspeak before I speak, that's not a problem at all. I will then withhold \nuntil he completes and take my 5 minutes at that time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S442-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S443-S444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ATTORNEY FEES AND THE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about \nattorney fees and the proposed Senate bill, S. 1570. The Public Health \nFunds Preservation Act, which is better known as the Tobacco Settlement \nAct, limits attorney's fees, and only if there is a tobacco settlement. \nIt limits their fees, the bill that I have introduced, to $125 per hour \nplus court-approved expenses. This is not something that we came upon. \nThis is the same rate that Congress set for lawyer fees in suits filed \nagainst the Federal Government. So this is an accepted and nationally \nknown attorney fee, $125 an hour.\n  For trial lawyers, this debate is not about public health, it is \nabout private greed. It is about creating instant billionaires. It is \nabout using the public funds to create instant billionaire trial \nlawyers. It's a huge pot of money, billions of dollars, and it is \nwanted to fund frivolous lawsuits far into the 21st century. As long as \nyou pay lawyers, you will have lawsuits. At the rate these are being \npaid, we will have lawsuits into infinity.\n  Let me mention a few cases that reveal the real motive of the trial \nlawyers. This is a typical example of how this group works. The trial \nlawyers negotiated a $349 million settlement with the tobacco companies \nin the so-called ``flight attendants case.''\n  These were flight attendants who said they had been affected by \nsecondary smoke. They won the $349 million: $300 million went to a new \nresearch foundation, and the lawyers took $49 million. Not one dime did \na single flight attendant get because of the lawyers in the suit--not a \ndime. The entire amount went to lawyers and the research foundation. It \nis clear what happened--lawyers, $49 million; clients, $0, and that is \nthe way the score usually turns out.\n  The litigation machine grinds on and on, long after settlements. More \nlawsuits, more billable hours and more attorney's fees. It goes on into \ninfinity.\n  The flight attendants' own lawyers sold them out for a quick buck--\n$49 million to be exact.\n  This is not an isolated case. The Texas Attorney General agreed to \npay lawyers close to $2.2 billion, 15 percent of the settlement that \nTexas was able to negotiate with the tobacco companies--$2.2 billion to \nthe lawyers.\n  The lawyers involved in the settlement of the Florida suit claimed \n$2.8 billion, 25 percent of the entire settlement. The settlement was \n$11.3 billion, the lawyers want $2.8 billion.\n  The judge in the Florida case said that their demands were \n``unconscionable.'' Certainly they are. They are unreasonable. But that \ndidn't stop the trial lawyers. They were not going to let a judge stand \nbetween them and $2.8 billion. They could see the red meat. That didn't \nstop the trial lawyers. They filed a lien to prevent the State from \ncollecting its first $750 million payment until they were paid. If they \ncouldn't get the big money for themselves, neither did they want the \nchildren of the State of Florida to have it.\n  One Mississippi lawyer is busy lining up a $1.39 billion payment. He \nadmits that he spent at most $10 million on the case. This lawyer says \nthat the fee might seem a little obscene. These fees have simply gotten \nout of control.\n  Mr. President, this is a pillaging spree and nothing more. These \ntrial lawyers rival Genghis Khan or any other raider that ever went \nafter a pile of money.\n  The trial lawyers are intent on plundering. They are now stealing \nfrom the public health trust. That is exactly what they are doing if \nthis Tobacco Settlement Act comes about. They are simply stealing from \nthe trust that we will be putting up for the public health and for the \nchildren. After all, some of them have already filed liens to prevent \nthe public health payments until they have been paid.\n  Mr. President, I say it is time to stop. This bill will do that. The \ntobacco settlement is a settlement to ensure medical care and future \nhelp of people who might have been affected by tobacco. It is not a \nlottery for trial lawyers. My bill makes sure the focus stays on \nchildren and not on lawyers. The trial lawyers want to play ``Wheel of \nFortune'' with our money. Well, I say, no, it is not their money. Let's \nstop the scrambling for dollars and the greed. Public health versus \nprivate greed--let's get on with the public health part of it and put \nsome restraints on the private greed. That is where we should draw the \nline.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S444]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to take 5 \nminutes out of the debate on this very important bill. I commend my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, for her leadership in explaining why it \nis important, when we legislate, particularly on a matter of science, \nthat we know exactly what we are doing and that we don't pass a bill \nthat will have unintended consequences which could lead to setting back \nhelp to people who need it who are ill. I just wanted to mention that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S443-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONDEMNING CLINIC BOMBING\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier today, I submitted a resolution, \nSenate Resolution 173. It is very straightforward. It condemns last \nweek's tragic bombing of a reproductive health services clinic in \nBirmingham, AL. As most of us know, this vicious and unprovoked attack \nkilled a police officer and critically injured a clinic worker. We \nalready know that clinic worker lost one eye, and I watched her \nanguished husband talk about the possibility that she might have an \noperation on the other eye as well.\n  I am very proud that this resolution that I have submitted is \nbipartisan. I submitted it on behalf of myself and Senator Chafee, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Mikulski, Senator Jeffords, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Murray, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator Collins and Senator \nMoseley-Braun.\n  Last week's attack was the first clinic bombing in the United States \nto cause a death, but, unfortunately, it was far from the first \nbombing. In recent years, reproductive health services clinics have \nbeen the targets of an unprecedented reign of terror. Last year alone, \nclinics in Atlanta, GA, and in Tulsa, OK, were bombed, resulting in \nmany, many serious injuries.\n  The reign of terror began with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in \nPensacola, FL, in 1993. A second abortion provider and his security \nguard were shot and killed the following year in Florida, and on the \nbloodiest day of the antichoice terror campaign, two clinic workers \nwere killed and five injured in vicious cold-blooded shootings in \nBrookline, MA.\n\n  All told--all told--over 1,800 violent attacks have been reported at \nreproductive health services clinics in recent years. If I succeed in \ndoing anything with this resolution, it is to make my colleagues aware \nthat the attacks and the level of violence in those attacks are \nincreasing every year.\n  I know that reproductive choice is a contentious issue. It was \ndecided by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. There are people \nwho agree with the decision; there are people who disagree with the \ndecision. And believe me, Mr. President, I have the deepest respect for \npeople who hold a view other than mine. Mine is a pro-choice view. Mine \nis a view that holds that Roe v. Wade was a balanced, moderate decision \nthat weighed the rights of everyone involved and basically says that \npreviability, a woman has this right to choose, it is a personal \ndecision and Government isn't involved, but postviability, indeed, the \nGovernment can come in and regulate as long as her life and her health \nare protected at all times.\n  But I think what is key here is that when someone explodes a bomb in \na clinic, this is a violent act. This is not about philosophy, because \nviolence is not a form of speech. Violence is not a form of speech. \nViolence is criminal. Violence maims, violence kills, and violence \nhurts the very people who are trying to carry out that cause in a \npeaceful manner.\n  I respect those with a different view, but I have no respect for \nanyone in this country, regardless of their view, who ever resort to \nviolence as a form of speech. This resolution is not about choice, it \nis about violence.\n  I know that there is not a single one of my colleagues who believes \nthat murder, bombing and terror and acts of intimidation are \nappropriate ways to express political views. I know that, Mr. \nPresident. This Congress stands firm on saying if you commit one of \nthese acts, it is a Federal crime. These bombings are part of a \nterrorist campaign, a campaign designed to destroy a woman's right to \nchoose through violence, making her afraid to go to a clinic maybe just \nto get a Pap smear. Maybe it is her only line of health care. Maybe she \nwants to find out how she can conceive, so she goes to a clinic. Or \nmaybe she is exercising her right to choose, which is the law of the \nland.\n  The U.S. Senate must condemn these attacks as strongly and \nunequivocally as we condemn other acts of terrorism. When we hear about \nother acts of terrorism, whether in America or around the world, we are \ndown here with a resolution of condemnation. Well, we should be down \nhere now.\n  I am proud of the number of cosponsors I have. I invite my colleagues \nwho may be listening to please join in. You need to be on the side of \nprotecting the people whom you represent as they exercise their \nconstitutionally given rights.\n  In addition to condemning this attack, this resolution expresses the \nsense of the Senate that the Attorney General should fully enforce \nexisting laws to protect the rights of American women seeking care at \nthese reproductive health care clinics. Again, we passed a law. It is a \nFederal crime to do violence at these clinics. We need to enforce that \nlaw. We need to protect these clinics. We need to devote more \nresources.\n  Here is a policeman, alone, unsuspecting, getting caught up in a \nbombing of a clinic, dying, leaving his family, all alone, watching a \nclinic, and being the victim of an explosive device, a bomb. It may \nwell be that the people who perpetrated this, perpetrated other \nattacks. We don't know that for sure, but we do know one thing. There \nwas a written message that this isn't where they are going to stop. \nThere can be no quarter for these people in this country. It is \ncowardly to do what they did.\n  We have a law that says it is a Federal crime to do what they did. We \nneed to prevent these things from happening by devoting more resources, \nand I call on the Attorney General to do that. We can't leave policemen \nalone facing these terrorists. We can't leave clinic workers alone \nfacing these terrorists. We can't leave patients alone facing these \nterrorists. We need the help of the Federal Government. We pay taxes \nfor that. This is an explosive device. This is not only breaking one \nFederal law, but more than one Federal law.\n  So I am proud, again, to be joined by my distinguished colleagues in \noffering this resolution. I plan to speak with both leaders, Leader \nLott and Leader Daschle, about setting aside some time to condemn this \nviolence, to stand up for the people of this country and say, whatever \nyour view, we respect it; however, violence will not be tolerated in \nthis country.\n  I think if we did this in a bipartisan way, it would send a clear \nsignal to anyone in our country who would even consider making violence \na form of speech.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S444-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S444-S446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. MACK. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to S. 1601.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to begin my comments by making it clear, like I suspect \neveryone in the U.S. Senate, that I am against human cloning. I have \nnot really found too many people who have come forward with a statement \nsaying that they are for human cloning. I am opposed to human cloning. \nSo, let me make that clear at the beginning of the discussion. But, \nthere is much more to this debate than as to whether one is for or \nagainst human cloning, and I think it is important that we get beyond \nthat.\n  I agree with those who have indicated earlier in the day that, \nfrankly, we need to delay this debate, we need to delay this \nlegislation. You might say, ``Well, why?'' Certainly the individuals \nwho engaged in producing the legislation are thoughtful, serious \npeople. I do not question that, nor do I question their intentions. But \nwhat\n\n[[Page S445]]\n\nthey have proposed I think has tremendous risks.\n  I will read from just a couple of letters that I have received from \nNobel laureates. One of the letters indicates--and this is from Dr. \nPaul Berg, Stanford professor, Nobel laureate, chemistry, 1980. In his \nletter he says:\n\n       The bill sponsored by Senators Bond, Frist, Gregg and \n     others, if passed, would be the first to ban a specific line \n     of research.\n\n  A specific line of research. Not the end result, but the specific \nline of research would not be permitted.\n  And he goes on to say:\n\n       I believe this is a serious mistake, one that we could \n     regret because of its unintended implications for otherwise \n     valuable biomedical research.\n\n  He goes on in the letter to say:\n\n       At the same time, any legislation should not impede or \n     interfere with existing or potential critical research \n     fundamental to the prevention or cure of human disease.\n\n  In another letter, from J.M. Bishop, Nobel laureate, university \nprofessor, University of California, San Francisco:\n\n       The fundamental flaw in this legislation is the prohibition \n     of a technology irrespective of its application. Such \n     prohibition forecloses on any benefit from the technology, \n     even if that benefit were in no way objectionable. Many well-\n     intentioned people fail to understand that somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer is not limited to cloning an organism. There \n     are many examples of possible future applications of this \n     technology to produce healthy tissue for therapeutic \n     purposes, such as skin grafts for burn patients, or even to \n     create insulin-producing cells for diabetics. There may also \n     be applications for cancer patients who need a bone marrow \n     transplant for whom a match cannot be found.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest that if time had permitted and if there had \nbeen greater warning that this legislation was going to come to the \nfloor, I could virtually fill up the Congressional Record with those \nindividuals who have serious concerns about what this legislation would \ndo. And the same group of people would make the statement they are \nopposed to human cloning.\n  I must admit that I have more than just a casual interest in this \nlegislation. I have been deeply involved in trying to understand basic \nresearch as it relates most specifically to finding cures and better \ntreatments for cancer. I am terrified at the thought that this \nlegislation could move forward without the opportunity for there to be \nin-depth scientific debate before committees of the Congress of the \nUnited States about what this legislation would do.\n  I just say to people that, if you go back into the early 1970s, 1971, \nI believe, regarding the issue of recombinant DNA, there were horror \nstories that were told about recombinant DNA research. There were all \nkinds of fears that were created. And there were places in the country \nwhere bans were actually put into place.\n  Well, fortunately, the Congress never passed a ban like they are \ntalking about here, because if they had, just to use one disease--\ncystic fibrosis--think about what it would be like if you were the \nparent of a child with cystic fibrosis that had been denied a treatment \nthat was developed as a result of going forward with recombinant DNA.\n\n  What was developed enhanced the ability of the lung to function as a \nresult of the discovery. Back in 1971, no one had even an idea where \nthat research might have taken us. But in retrospect we can see that \nthe foundation has been built for the future research that may in fact \nfind better treatments, whether that is cancer, whether that is \ndiabetes, whether that is Parkinson's disease, whether that is AIDS, \nwhether that is sickle-cell anemia. And I could go on and on and on.\n  So, Mr. President, all I am saying here today, and to my colleagues, \nis that if there is not a change in this legislation, then I am going \nto have to oppose the legislation. I understand that the majority \nleader will be coming to the floor shortly to file a cloture motion. I \nwould have to vote against cloture if this legislation is not changed. \nI frankly believe that the most significant thing we could do would be \nto delay so that in fact we could hear from both sides on this issue.\n  Again, the debate really isn't whether there should be human cloning. \nI think most people in this country clearly have said we should not do \nthat, that it should be banned. But what we are debating is the \npotential outcome of the language that is put into legislative form \nthat would limit the scientists of our country, limit them in their \nability again to find cures, possibly, and certainly better treatments \nfor the diseases that face our families, our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  So, Mr. President, I sincerely hope that either we find some way to \ncorrect the legislation before us or that we delay this so that not \nonly the scientific community can have an opportunity for input but \nalso for patient groups. I think they ought to have an opportunity to \ncome before the Congress at our hearings and let them raise their \nconcerns about what might be done to maybe one area of hope that they \nhave about better treatment or a cure.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation to place \na permanent ban on the unethical, immoral pursuit of human cloning.\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, that the fact that a thing is \npossible makes it desirable. The study of ethics is filled with things \nwe can do, but should not do. The subject of cloning presents an \nobvious example along these lines. And I believe it is necessary for us \nto face the problem head-on.\n  Genetic research has been crucial to saving thousands upon thousands \nof lives all over the world. It continues to be an important part of \nmedical research as we look for cures and treatments for cancer and \nother dreaded diseases. But there are certain things we cannot do, even \nas we seek, in the long run, to save lives. As shown by recent scandals \nconcerning studies at Tuskegee Institute and elsewhere, in which people \nwere denied treatment for serious ailments in the name of science, most \npeople, most of the time, recognize the moral limits to scientific and \nmedical research.\n  But we cannot always trust in the good judgment of the scientist. In \nsome extreme cases we, the people's legislature, must see to it that \ncertain practices are not undertaken. Human cloning is one of those \npractices. No man or woman, not even a scientist, has the capacity to \nmanipulate the very nature and existence of human life in a moral \nmanner. Plants, animals and even discrete human cells may be the proper \nsubjects of research, but to attempt to create a human being, as the \nproduct of scientific experiment, risking that that product may be seen \nas something other than a living, sentient human being, is simply not \nacceptable.\n  Mr. President, we are not now, nor will we ever be, morally capable \nof manufacturing life, or of making experiments on the human soul.\n  It is because I value life, each and every human life that comes into \nthis world, that I have joined with my colleague from Missouri in \nsponsoring this legislation to ban, now and for the future, any attempt \nat human cloning.\n  Now is not the time, Mr. President, for our Nation to create, or \nrather add to, an atmosphere in which human life is valued for anything \nother than itself. Each of us is unique and uniquely valuable. Our laws \nrecognize this, providing as they do for due process and equal \nprotection of every one of us. Our religions are based on this \nunderstanding of the individual as the creature of God. We must see to \nit that our science also recognizes the intrinsic value of every human \nlife.\n  Science has been of great service to mankind. It will continue to \nimprove, protect and save lives, so long as we recognize our duty to \nsee that scientists abide by their duty to serve, and not manipulate, \neach and every human being.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the Senate has already had a \nhealthy debate on the cloning legislation and I thank Senators Bond, \nFrist, Gregg and others for their leadership on this issue. I find it \nunfortunate that our democratic colleagues have chosen to block \nconsideration of legislation at this time, even a motion to proceed.\n\n[[Page S446]]\n\n  Clearly, this is an issue that has America's attention. The idea that \nso much progress has been made in the cloning area, and that we have \ndoctors or scientists already threatening to clone human beings, is a \nvery serious matter from a scientific, medical, moral and ethical \nstandpoint. I don't think we can afford to set this issue aside without \nsome immediate consideration and some immediate attention.\n  I am very pleased that the Senators that are involved on both sides \nof the aisle are obviously very concerned, very thoughtful, and would \nlike to get an agreement.\n  I am particularly pleased that one of the leaders on our side of the \naisle is Dr. Bill Frist of Tennessee, one of the Senators who knows the \nmost about questions of science. He would never want us to sacrifice \nappropriate advancements in science and medical achievement in any way. \nThe difference is he really knows what he's talking about. So, while \nthere are some disagreements about how far to go, what would be \nappropriate, what would not be appropriate, a lot of good work has been \ndone.\n  It seems to me that the thing to do is to go forward. Let's have a \ncontinued debate in addition to what we have already heard from a half \ndozen or seven Senators or so. Let's have other Senators become \ninformed, read the debate we have already had, think about this issue, \nstudy the bills, and make recommendations. If there are amendments by \nthe Senator from California, I think they should be offered. Let's \ndebate them and let's think about them.\n  This is an issue whose time has come--maybe sooner than we would have \never dreamed, and maybe in a lot of ways we had not anticipated this. \nBut if we don't act, what could be the result? Do we want to allow the \npossibility of human cloning to go forward? I don't think so. Leaders \nin the scientific and medical communities, and others, have already \nindicated their concerns about that. The President of the United States \nhas made it very clear in an early statement that he wanted to make \nsure that this human cloning did not occur. So I urge the Senate--we \ncan go forward with deliberate speed, which is always the case, but we \nshould go forward and not have this pigeon-holed somewhere in the \nbowels of the building for weeks or months while time and events pass \nus by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S444-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, earlier this month, our colleague Senator \nKennedy made his first ever visit to Northern Ireland.\n  On Friday, January 9, in the Guildhall, in the City of Derry, Senator \nKennedy delivered the first Tip O'Neill Memorial Lecture, sponsored by \nthe University of Ulster, the City Council of Derry, and the U.S. \nConsulate in Belfast.\n  Senator Kennedy's leadership on this issue and his longstanding \nefforts to reach out to both Protestants and Catholics in Northern \nIreland were evident in his remarks and in the warm reception he \nreceived from both sides of the community during his visit.\n  For many years, Senator Kennedy has been at the forefront of this \ncountry's commitment to do all it can to end the violence in Northern \nIreland and achieve a lasting peace for that troubled land. I believe \nall of us in Congress share that commitment.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy for his contribution to the current peace \ninitiative. I believe that his eloquent address will be of interest to \nall of us in Congress and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Address of Senator Edward Kennedy--``Northern Ireland--a View From \n                               America''\n\n\n  tip o'neill memorial lecture, university of ulster, magee college, \n      incore, guildhall--derry, northern ireland--january 9, 1998\n\n       I want to thank Professor Lord Smith and the University of \n     Ulster's Initiative on Conflict Resolution and Ethnicity, the \n     home of the Tip O'Neill Chair in Peace Studies and the Tip \n     O'Neill Fellowship, for inviting me here today. Let me also \n     thank the Deputy Mayor, Joe Miller and everyone at Derry City \n     Council for welcoming me to this beautiful city. I'm grateful \n     to Dr. Maurice Hayes for his generous introduction, and I \n     commend him and the Ireland Funds for establishing this \n     living memorial to a great man, a great friend of mine, and a \n     great friend of Ireland.\n       I'm especially honored that Mr. and Mrs. Restorick and Mr. \n     and Mrs. McGoldrick have traveled from Peterborough in \n     England and from Craigavon to take part in this occasion. In \n     the face of great personal tragedy, these two families refuse \n     to hate. They honor their sons Stephen and Michael most by \n     their resolve that no other family shall have to suffer what \n     they endure. Their lives every day are as eloquent as their \n     words here today.\n       I'm honored as well that the U.S. Ambassador to the U.K., \n     Philip Lader, is with us today. Ambassador Lader has close \n     personal and professional ties to President Clinton, and I \n     have great respect for his skill and judgment. He is perhaps \n     best known in America for his ability to bring people \n     together, and he's an excellent choice to represent President \n     Clinton here at this auspicious and hopeful time.\n       And I'm delighted that my sister Jean is here. My family \n     has a great love for this island from which we come and which \n     for us will always be a home. Jean visited Ireland in 1963 \n     with President Kennedy and I know he would be proud--as all \n     the Kennedys are--of the extraordinary work she has done as \n     our Ambassador to Ireland.\n       A President of Harvard is reported to have said that the \n     reason universities are such great storehouses of learning is \n     that every entering student brings a little knowledge in--and \n     no graduating student ever takes any knowledge out.\n       But I'm sure that's not true at the University of Ulster.\n       This institution teaches, in many different ways, the most \n     important lesson of all--that all knowledge is universal and \n     all men and women are brothers and sisters.\n       It was here, in the Guildhall, in November 1995 that \n     President Clinton inaugurated the Tip O'Neill Chair in Peace \n     Studies. As he said on that occasion, ``peace is really the \n     work of a lifetime.''\n       In that spirit, I come here to give the Tip O'Neill \n     Memorial Lecture. And it is fitting that I do so in this \n     place, because Tip's ancestral home on his grandfather \n     O'Neill's side was just down the road in Buncrana.\n       Throughout Tip's life, Ireland was one of his greatest \n     loves. His Irish smile could light up a living room, the \n     whole chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the \n     whole State of Massachusetts.\n       One of Tip's most famous stories was about a gift by Henry \n     Ford to help build a new hospital in Ireland. His gift was \n     $5,000, but a local newspaper the next day reported that it \n     was $50,000. The editor apologized profusely for the mistake, \n     and said he'd run a correction right away, explaining that \n     the actual gift was only $5,000. It took Henry Ford about one \n     second to realize what was happening, and he said, ``No, no, \n     don't run the correction. I'll give the $50,000, but on one \n     condition--that you install a plaque over the entrance to the \n     hospital with this inscription--``I came unto you, and you \n     took me in.''\n       Tip was scrupulously neutral in the American presidential \n     campaign of 1980, when I was running for President against \n     Jimmy Carter. But Tip told me that every night, before he \n     went to sleep, he was secretly praying that we would have \n     another Irish President of the United States. The prayer was \n     a little ambiguous--but Tip's Irish friend Ronald Reagan, who \n     eventually won that election, was very grateful.\n       This doesn't quite feel like my first visit to Derry, since \n     I've known John Hume for so long, and I've heard him sing \n     ``The Town I Love So Well'' so many times.\n       I first met him a quarter century ago, in the fall of 1972. \n     I was troubled by what had been taking place here, and people \n     I knew well in Massachusetts told me to get in touch with \n     him. I was traveling to Germany for a NATO conference in \n     November of that year. So I called John and he agreed to meet \n     me in Bonn. We had dinner at the home of Ireland's Ambassador \n     there, Sean Ronan. When I signed the Ambassador's guest book, \n     I wrote that I hoped to see him again when there was peace in \n     Ireland. I see Ambassador Ronan here today, so I'm more \n     hopeful than ever that lasting peace is finally very close.\n       In the following years, John Hume came to Washington often, \n     and we would sit together and talk about the Troubles. He has \n     been a constant voice of reason, an often lonely champion of \n     non-violence, a stalwart advocate of peace.\n       In 1977, because of John, four Irish-American elected \n     officials--Tip O'Neill, Senator\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Governor Hugh Carey of \n     New York, and I--joined forces to condemn the support for \n     violence that was coming from the United States, and to \n     insist that dollars from America must never be used to kill \n     innocent men and women and children in Northern Ireland. And \n     so the Four Horsemen were born, and over the years, we acted \n     together on many occasions to do what we could to advance a \n     peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n       Forty-four million Americans are of Irish descent. It is no \n     accident that America has an abiding interest in the island \n     of Ireland--and in the current generation, an abiding \n     commitment to peace and justice in Northern Ireland. Over the \n     years, we have welcomed many leaders of Northern Ireland--\n     from politics, business, churches and communities. We have \n     listened to all and tried to be a friend to all.\n       When President Clinton took office in 1993, it was clear \n     that America had a President who would go the extra mile for \n     peace--and an opportunity soon arose. In December 1993, the \n     Irish and British Governments issued their Downing Street \n     Declaration, which gave birth to the current peace \n     initiative. Soon thereafter, President Clinton was faced with \n     a critical decision--whether the goal of ending the violence \n     would be enhanced by granting a visa for Gerry Adams to visit \n     the United States. I had been receiving reports for several \n     months from a delegation led by journalist Niall O'Dowd that \n     the IRA was serious about silencing the guns. My sister Jean \n     had heard the same reports.\n       John Hume and Jean both said that a visit by Gerry Adams to \n     the United States could be very important in achieving a \n     ceasefire by the IRA. So I and others in Congress urged \n     President Clinton to act favorably. He made the bold and \n     courageous decision to grant the visa, despite advice from \n     some quarters in Congress and the Administration that he \n     should deny it. The visa was given, the ceasefire followed, \n     and a new and hopeful period in the history of Northern \n     Ireland was born.\n       Since then, there have been setbacks along the way. But \n     America's interest has not faltered, and President Clinton \n     has provided continuing encouragement. His visit to this \n     island in November and December of 1995 was a powerful \n     demonstration that America cares about peace--and the \n     outpouring of affection that greeted him from Protestants and \n     Catholics alike was an unmistakable sign to political leaders \n     on both sides that peace was the people's priority.\n       Today, we stand at a defining moment in the modern epic of \n     this land. The talks that are about to resume offer both a \n     challenge and an opportunity. In the coming crucial weeks, \n     the parties will determine whether this is a genuine way \n     forward, or just another failed station on the way of \n     sorrows.\n       To Nationalists who have suffered decades of injustice and \n     discrimination, I say ``Look how far you've come''. One need \n     only look around to see the success of the Nationalist \n     community--what John Hume has done for the peace process and \n     for new investment in Derry--what Seamus Heaney, Seamus \n     Deane, Brian Friel, Frank McGuinness, and Phil Coulter have \n     done for the spirit of Ireland--North and South. Ireland has \n     its first ever President from Northern Ireland. Gerry Adams \n     and other Sinn Fein leaders have been to Downing Street. You \n     have come so far. Have faith in yourselves and in the future.\n       And to Unionists who often feel afraid of what the future \n     may bring, I recall that you are descendants of the pioneers \n     who helped build America, and now you can be the pioneers who \n     build a better future for this island.\n       Everyone is well aware of the numerous contributions of \n     Irish immigrants--mostly Catholic--who came to America in the \n     19th century, fleeing famine. Many of those famine ships left \n     from Derry. But it is often forgotten that more than half of \n     the 44 million Americans of Irish descent today are \n     Protestants.\n       Most of that Protestant immigration came in the 1700's and \n     early 1800's. As far back as the late 1600's, persecution of \n     Scottish Presbyterians led many to leave Ulster and seek \n     religious freedom in the American colonies. The father of \n     American Presbyterianism was born only a few miles from here. \n     Magee College, our host today, was in fact a training \n     college for Irish Presbyterianism. Historically, the very \n     hallmark of that faith is respect for differences. The \n     Presbyterian tradition helped endow America with that \n     respect. It is one of our greatest strengths. That same \n     basic value--respect for differences--is now the key to a \n     better future here as well.\n       The impact on America of Scotch-Irish settlers from what is \n     today Northern Ireland was profound. Large numbers joined our \n     fight for independence. Five signed the Declaration of \n     Independence. John Dunlap of Strabane printed the \n     Declaration, and also established the first daily newspaper \n     in America.\n       In the years that followed America's independence, these \n     settlers were instrumental in founding the Democratic Party \n     in the United States. They helped assure the election of two \n     of our greatest Presidents, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew \n     Jackson.\n       Jackson himself was of Ulster Presbyterian stock and proud \n     of it. As he said on a visit to Boston in 1833, ``I have \n     always been proud of my ancestry and of being descended from \n     that noble race. Would to God, Sir, that Irishmen on the \n     other side of the great water enjoyed the comforts, \n     happiness, contentment and liberty that they enjoy here.''\n       Eleven other Presidents of the United States were of \n     Scotch-Irish heritage, including President Clinton.\n       In ways such as these, Protestants of Irish descent have \n     made indispensable contributions to America as a land of \n     freedom and opportunity for all. You are part of our heritage \n     and history. We are brothers and sisters, not enemies. The \n     vast--vast--majority of Irish Catholics in America bear you \n     no ill will. Our hope is that as your ancestors did for \n     America, you will lead the way to peace and justice for \n     Northern Ireland.\n       It is an apt coincidence that the goal for the peace talks \n     is to reach a successful conclusion in this year that marks \n     the two hundredth anniversary of the United Irishmen \n     Rebellion of 1798. As 1998 begins, we can all salute the \n     idealism and courage of those leaders two centuries ago--\n     Catholics, Presbyterians, and Anglicans as one. Their brave \n     doomed uprising took its immediate inspiration from the \n     French Revolution and its call for liberty, equality, and \n     fraternity. But Wolfe Tone, Samuel Neilson, Thomas Russell, \n     William Drennan and other members of the United Irishmen were \n     also well aware of the Irish role in the American Revolution.\n       For some, the United Irishmen will be remembered primarily \n     as courageous and independent-minded ancestors. Others will \n     celebrate the political philosophy they created. The point is \n     that all traditions can draw current inspiration from the \n     vision that guided their struggle. They believed that the \n     different traditions in Ireland were not destined to be \n     enemies, but had a profound shared interest in championing \n     and guarding each others' rights.\n       So I hope that the participants in the current all-\n     important talks can draw inspiration from all these streams \n     of our common heritage, and succeed in devising new \n     arrangements for this land that will at last give true effect \n     to our shared ideals.\n       Many people have already taken risks for peace. John Hume \n     laid the groundwork over many years for the current progress, \n     and is one of the shining apostles of non-violence in our \n     century. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness impressively led \n     the way to the IRA cease-fire of 1994 and its restoration \n     last summer. David Trimble demonstrated genuine leadership in \n     bringing the Ulster Unionist Party to the peace table. John \n     Alderdice deserves credit for his efforts to bridge the gap \n     between the two communities. The representatives of the \n     Loyalist paramilitaries--David Ervine, Gary McMichael and \n     others--helped achieve the Loyalist cease-fire and have \n     made ceaseless efforts to maintain it. The Women's \n     Coalition deserves admiration and support for \n     participating and persevering--and for demonstrating anew \n     the rightful place of women at the highest level of \n     politics.\n       The Governments of Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair have carried \n     the process forward with skill and wisdom. Mo Mowlam is \n     tireless in her commitment. George Mitchell's transatlantic \n     shuttle diplomacy is America's special gift to the peace \n     process --living daily proof that the United States not only \n     cares, but can be scrupulously even-handed too. John de \n     Chastelain and Harri Holkeri deserve credit for their \n     leadership and patience. And numerous others--church leaders \n     such as Father Alex Reid and Reverend Roy Magee--community \n     workers such as Geraldine McAteer and Jackie Redpath--have \n     worked hard and well at building bridges.\n       Above all, the people of Northern Ireland deserve credit \n     for never giving up their dreams of peace, and for constantly \n     reminding political leaders of their responsibility to \n     achieve it. As Yeats wrote, ``In dreams begins \n     responsibility.''\n       There are some who seek to wreck the peace process. They \n     are blinded by fear of a future they cannot imagine--a future \n     in which respect for differences is a healing and unifying \n     force. They are driven by an anger that holds no respect for \n     life--even for the lives of children.\n       But a new spirit of hope is gaining momentum. It can banish \n     the fear that blinds. It can conquer the anger that fuels the \n     merchants of violence. We are building an irresistible force \n     that can make the immovable object move.\n       In 1968, at a time of unconscionable violence in America, \n     my brother Robert Kennedy spoke of the dream of peace and an \n     end to conflict, in words that summon us all to action now:\n       ``It is up to those who are here--fellow citizens and \n     public officials--to carry out that dream, to try to end the \n     divisions that exist so deeply in our country and to remove \n     the stain of bloodshed from our land.''\n       It is not my plan or place to address the details of the \n     talks--that is for the participants. But comments from \n     observers may prove useful as a source of perspective and \n     reflection, as a way to dispel distortions and \n     misunderstandings and to create possibilities for peace--and \n     above all, to demonstrate as powerfully as we can that \n     America truly cares.\n       Irish Americans are anything but indifferent to what is \n     happening. We have a long-enduring desire to see peace and \n     prosperity take root here. Our commitment embraces the \n     welfare of all the people of Northern Ireland--and when we \n     say ``all,'' we mean all.\n       Whoever we are, wherever we come from, whatever our \n     differences--there is one self-evident, fundamental, enduring \n     truth. There must be no return to violence. Killing produces \n     only more killing. Endless, escalating\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\n     cycles of death and devastation have brought unspeakable \n     human tragedy, deeper division between and within the two \n     great traditions, and painful stagnation and failed \n     prosperity for Northern Ireland.\n       It does not have to be that way. Addressing the Irish \n     Parliament in 1963, President Kennedy quoted the famous words \n     of George Bernard Shaw: ``Some people see things as they are \n     and say, `Why?' But I dream things that never were, and I \n     say, `Why not?''' May those words inspire the search for \n     peace today.\n       The present must learn from the past. As the Joint \n     Declaration states: ``the lessons of Irish history, and \n     especially of Northern Ireland, show that stability and well-\n     being will not be found under any political system which is \n     refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a \n     significant minority of those governed by it.''\n       Equality and mutual respect are the twin pillars of peace. \n     It is clear that the Nationalist community will never accept \n     a role of subservience to Unionism. And the Unionist \n     community will never accept a role of subservience to \n     Nationalism.\n       The obvious and inescapable conclusion is that these two \n     traditions can find a stable relationship only on a basis of \n     equality and mutual respect. A successful outcome must mean \n     no second-class citizens on this island, and no second-class \n     traditions either.\n       The peace process does not mean asking Unionists or \n     Nationalists to change or discard their identity and \n     aspirations. It means using democratic methods, not bombs and \n     bullets, to resolve the inevitable differences and tensions \n     between them.\n       However far into the future, whatever the color of the \n     flags, there will be two communities, each with its own \n     character and its own pride, sharing this beautiful piece of \n     earth.\n       The heritage of America offers a hope and a lesson. The \n     motto of America--to which John Hume has often referred--is \n     the Latin phrase ``e pluribus unum''--out of many, one--the \n     whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The diversity of \n     America is America's greatest strength, and the diversity \n     here can be your greatest strength as well.\n       As you travel the road together, the choice is whether it \n     will be as wary adversaries forever fearful of each other, or \n     as friends and neighbors who agree on fair rules for the \n     journey ahead, willing to meet and master fateful challenges \n     together.\n       At its core, the conflict is about each side cherishing its \n     noble ideals, and fearing the other may damage or destroy \n     them.\n       If the true goal for each side is the protection of its \n     rights and aspirations, rather than the denial of the rights \n     and aspirations of the other, then surely there is a high and \n     common ground. Protecting the rights of both sides, based on \n     principles of equality and mutual respect, is the surest \n     path--perhaps the only path--to peace.\n       I appeal to the talks participants to ask nothing for their \n     own side they are not prepared to grant to the other--and to \n     ask nothing from the other side they would not accept for \n     their own. Let us make that principle the Golden Rule for the \n     road to peace--to do unto others as we would have them do \n     unto us.\n       I urge everyone involved in the peace process to approach \n     the talks with a view to giving as much as they can, rather \n     than as little as they think they can get away with. In the \n     words of Seamus Heaney, you must ``walk on air, against your \n     better judgment.''\n       As we come to a new century, the three basic \n     relationships--within the North, between North and South, and \n     between Britain and Ireland--can be transformed. Hatred and \n     injustice can be replaced with respect and equality.\n       Taking full advantage of this unique opportunity will bring \n     lasting peace, and a genuine place in history for all those \n     who make it happen. Failure to grasp this opportunity will be \n     devastating. History will harshly judge any who fail the test \n     and waste the decisive moment.\n       I particularly encourage the young people of this island to \n     become involved in the work for peace. For it is you --even \n     more than your parents and your grandparents--who have the \n     most to gain, and the most to lose.\n       As you extend yourselves to reach agreement, the United \n     States will exert itself to build more bridges. Personal \n     bridges. Political bridges. Economic bridges. And be assured, \n     I will do all in my power to see that the U.S. assumes a \n     central role in providing economic assistance to implement \n     the agreement that is reached.\n       In the closing pages of the Iliad, Priam, the elderly king \n     of Troy, goes to Achilles to beg for the return of his son \n     Hector, whom Achilles has slain in the war. Achilles, in an \n     act of simple humanity, gives the old man the body of his \n     son.\n       The last lines of Michael Longley's eloquent poem \n     ``Ceasefire'' draw an analogy with Northern Ireland. Priam \n     speaks these words:\n       ``I get down on my knees and do what must be done\n       And kiss Achilles' hand, the killer of my son.''\n       The two communities in Northern Ireland must reach out and \n     do what must be done--and join hands across centuries and \n     chasms of killing and pain.\n       And there is great pain in both communities. Families --\n     Protestant and Catholic-- have been denied the bodies of \n     loved ones to bury. Families--like those whose loved ones \n     were killed on Bloody Sunday--have been denied the truth. \n     Families --like those whose loved ones died at Enniskillen--\n     have been denied justice. Families--enduring generations of \n     unemployment --have been denied opportunity. Families--\n     harassed by security forces--have been denied dignity. \n     Families--victims of punishment beatings--have been denied \n     justice. Children--Catholic and Protestant--have been denied \n     their future. It is time to say enough is enough is enough is \n     enough. It is time to replace hate with hope.\n       My prayer today is that individuals, families, and \n     political, religious, business, educational and community \n     leaders across Northern Ireland will show the forgiveness and \n     compassion and humanity that John and Rita Restorick showed--\n     that Gordon Wilson showed--that Joyce McCartan showed--that \n     Michael and Bride McGoldrick showed--that everyone must show.\n       Like so many of you here, my family has been touched by \n     tragedy. I know that the feelings of grief and loss are \n     immediate--and they are enduring. The best way to ease these \n     feelings is to forgive, and to carry on--not to lash out in \n     fury, but to reach out in trust and hope.\n       So in closing, let me share with you a letter my father \n     wrote in 1958 to a friend whose son had died. Fourteen years \n     earlier, my oldest brother Joe had been killed in World War \n     II. Ten years earlier, my oldest sister Kathleen had been \n     killed in an airplane crash. My father wrote to his grieving \n     friend:\n       ``There are no words to dispel your feelings at this time \n     and there is no time that will ever dispel them. Nor is it \n     any easier the second time than it was the first. And yet, I \n     cannot share your grief because no one could share mine. When \n     one of your children goes out of your life, you think of what \n     he might have done with a few more years and you wonder what \n     you are going to do with the rest of yours. Then one day, \n     because there is a world to be lived in, you find yourself a \n     part of it again, trying to accomplish something--something \n     that he did not have time enough to do. And, perhaps, that is \n     the reason for it all. I hope so.''\n       Too many lives of too many sons and daughters of this land \n     have been cut short. We must dedicate ourselves to accomplish \n     for them what many ``did not have time enough to do''--a \n     lasting peace for Northern Ireland.\n       Thank you, and may God bless the work ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S447-4", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S449-S450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NOMINATION OF DR. DAVID SATCHER, TO BE U.S. SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nDr. David Satcher for U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for \nHealth. I have examined his qualifications and achievements, and I \nbelieve he has the capacity to serve this country well in the important \nrole of the nation's top physician.\n  On Tuesday of this week, I, along with Senators Graham and Jeffords \nand Representatives Moran and Leach, announced the formation of the \nCongressional Prevention Coalition. Former Surgeon General C. Everett \nKoop was kind enough to join us at the press conference.\n  During the course of his remarks, it struck me how greatly we have \nmissed having a national spokesperson on health issues the past three \nyears. Dr. Koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed by \ntobacco use, lack of exercise, and poor diet. He didn't pull any \npunches--he gave a stern lecture to all of those present on the dangers \ninherent in the so-called couch potato lifestyle.\n  I have reviewed Dr. Satcher's statements before the Senate Labor \nCommittee, and he clearly is anxious to start in along the same lines. \nAt his confirmation hearing, Dr. Satcher stressed the importance of \ndisease prevention and health promotion. As he put it, ``Whether we are \ntalking about smoking or poor diets, I want to send the message of good \nhealth to the American people.'' And I was delighted to learn that one \nof his top priorities in this role would be to put the health of our \nchildren and grandchildren in the national spotlight. To my view, all \nof these matters fall directly within the job description of a U.S. \nSurgeon General.\n  As I said, we have been without a Surgeon General for three years \nnow--a period of time when we have been confronted with a staggering \narray of public health issues. The need for a Surgeon General has never \nbeen greater, as we are seeing an increase in smoking among high school \nseniors, widespread substance abuse, continuing struggles with AIDS, \nand a startling rate of obesity among youngsters. And as we consider \nthe potential consequences of human cloning research, I know that I, \nfor one, would benefit from the perspective that a Surgeon General \ncould bring to this issue.\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\n  Several of my colleagues have expressed their misgivings about this \nnomination. Some have raised concerns about Dr. Satcher's views on late \nterm abortions. Others have questioned his role in a series of AZT \ntrials that were conducted in Africa. As Senator Jeffords, the Chairman \nof Labor Committee, and Senator Frist, the Chairman of the Public \nHealth and Safety Subcommittee, stated during the debate on the \nnomination yesterday, however, these are not new charges. Indeed, each \nof these issues was raised by the Committee during Dr. Satcher's \nconfirmation hearing, and it's my understanding that he responded \nsatisfactorily. Indeed, his answers on these and other matters have \nbeen available to all Senators and the American people for some months \nnow via the internet.\n  Dr. Satcher's participation in many aspects of the health care \nsystem--provider, scientist, public and private administrator--give him \nthe extensive knowledge and experience necessary to fulfill his role as \nthe U.S. Surgeon General. He has dedicated his career to improving \npublic health.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of Dr. Satcher's \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S449-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to provide for taxpayer recovery of costs, fees, and \nexpenses under section 504 of title 5, United States Code, and section \n2412 of title 28, United States Code, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         the equal access to justice for taxpayers act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Equal Access to \nJustice for Taxpayers Act of 1998. I am pleased that the Senator from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, is joining me as an original sponsor of \nthis important legislation.\n\n  Like so many Americans, I was disgusted by the evidence that surfaced \nof so many abuses of the IRS at recent hearings by the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I followed the hearings very closely, and I heard taxpayer \nafter taxpayer come before the Finance Committee recounting horror \nstories and trying to fight against unjustified action by the IRS that \ncost them thousands of dollars and countless hours of emotional \ndistress. These average taxpayers told of frustration and despair \ncaused by rogue IRS personnel who used the awesome resources of that \nagency to punish them.\n  Probably the saddest part about what we heard was that these good \nAmericans, taxpayers, felt powerless to even question or fight back \nagainst their own Government. I believe, as many of my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle do, that Congress needs to reform the IRS and \nstop these abuses from ever happening again.\n  Unfortunately, current law hamstrings taxpayers who challenge the \nIRS. Our legislation would change that by giving taxpayers, for the \nfirst time ever, a cause of action under the existing Equal Access to \nJustice Act (EAJA). Under our bill, taxpayers may exercise their rights \nunder the EAJA to win awards of legal fees, expert witness fees and \nother costs against the IRS when that agency takes substantially \nunjustified action against them. Thousands of citizens have won \nvindication against unjust governmental action under the EAJA, and \ntaxpayers should be able to do the same thing.\n  Today, most taxpayers feel that if the IRS comes after them, even if \nthey think it is unjustified, they don't dare fight it because it will \ncost more in lawyers, accountant fees, and so on. Under our act, if \nthey prove it was unjustified action, the Government pays them for \ntheir lawyer fees and for their accountant's fees. This was done by \nCongress to help individuals, partnerships, and corporations in other \nadministrative actions involving the Government. We should do the same \nwith the IRS.\n  In 1981, Congress enacted the EAJA to help individuals, partnerships \nand corporations seek review of, or to defend against, unjustified \ngovernmental action because of the expense involved in securing the \nvindication of their rights in civil actions and in administrative \nproceedings. The EAJA permits citizens who prevail in these actions in \nproceedings against federal agencies to recover their costs when the \ngovernment acted unjustly. Its purpose is to deter abusive actions and \noverreaching by the government and to enable individuals to vindicate \ntheir rights, regardless of their economic circumstances.\n  But court decisions have interpreted the EAJA to exempt all civil \nactions and administrative proceedings in connection with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) from its protections. Instead, taxpayers must \nseek review of, or defend against, unjustified actions by the IRS under \nprovisions in the Internal Revenue Code. These Internal Revenue Code \nprovisions make it much harder for average taxpayers to recover against \nunjust IRS actions.\n  The recent report of National Commission on Restructuring the \nInternal Revenue Service agreed that the Internal Revenue Code fails to \nprovide taxpayers with adequate legal rights to recover attorney's fees \nand other costs against unjust IRS actions. The Commission recently \nproposed numerous reforms to make the IRS more effective and responsive \nto taxpayers. I commend Senators Kerrey and Grassley, who served on \nthis bipartisan commission, for introducing legislation to implement \nmany of its recommendations. I am a cosponsor of the IRS reform bill \nthat they have introduced, and I hope the Senate's majority leadership \nwill allow this bill to come to a vote soon to put these taxpayer \nprotections in place as rapidly as possible.\n  The Commission's report found that: ``While the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights legislation made great strides to allow taxpayers to recover \ndamages for IRS malfeasance, current provisions do not provide adequate \nrelief. In addition, there are many cases in which taxpayers are not \nable to obtain review of IRS actions.'' The Commission concluded that: \n``Congress must provide taxpayers with adequate and reasonable \ncompensation for actual damages incurred for wrongful actions by the \nIRS.''\n  What I am saying is this: If the IRS comes after a taxpayer, and if \nthey use draconian methods in an unjustified action, that not only is \nthe taxpayer going to win but the taxpayer is going to get their costs \nof defending back. So that at least we are going to have the potential \nof an equal playing field so that we will not have taxpayers who feel \nthat they are being attacked in an unjustified fashion. We will not \nhave them think, ``I will either pay the lawyers or I am going to pay \nthe IRS. I might as well surrender, even though I have done no wrong.'' \nNow they can defend their rights.\n  It is time for Congress to heed this advice and give taxpayers the \nsame rights that other citizens now have to seek review of, or to \ndefend against, unjust governmental action. The IRS should be treated \nlike every other federal agency under the law--no better and no worse.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to provide taxpayers \nwith the same rights as all other citizens who are subject to unjust \ngovernmental action.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Leahy, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, in introducing a bill today that gives American taxpayers \ngreater ability to recover attorneys fees and other costs against the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) for unjustified civil actions and \nadministrative proceedings under the Equal Access To Justice Act \n(EAJA).\n  Clearly, there is a need for such legislation in light of recent \nhearing testimony that average taxpayers have lost thousands of dollars \nin actual damages defending themselves against unjustified IRS actions. \nAs the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue \nService reported, current Internal Revenue Code provisions do not \nprovide adequate relief for unjust IRS\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\nactions, much less enable many taxpayers to obtain review of IRS \nactions at all. I am pleased to join the Senator from Vermont in this \neffort to help level the playing field and help the American taxpayer \nrecover when the IRS acts improperly.\n  Like other citizens who seek review of, or defend against, \nunjustified governmental action by federal agencies, taxpayers who \nsuccessfully defend against the IRS should be able to recover attorneys \nfees and other costs against when the situation warrants such an award. \nBy providing such relief to taxpayers under the EAJA, not only does \nthis bill help individuals recover the cost of their defense, but also \nhelps deter future abusive actions by the IRS. The Equal Access to \nJustice Act has helped American citizens and small businesses recover \nagainst other federal agencies and this bill makes the IRS accountable \nunder EAJA, just like the rest of the federal government.\n  My interest in the Equal Access To Justice Act predates my election \nto this body, dating back to my tenure as a State Senator where I \nworked on the Wisconsin version of EAJA. In addition to working on the \nWisconsin EAJA, I have introduced in a previous Congress, and will do \nso again today, separate legislation to update and streamline the \nexisting federal EAJA--to make the process of recovery less cumbersome \nand to help ensure that people are made whole when the government \ncannot defend their actions.\n  The federal EAJA was originally enacted in 1980 and made permanent in \n1985. The Act was intended to make taking on the federal government in \ncourt less intimidating and I was specifically aimed at helping average \ncitizens and small businesses that prevail against unjustified \ngovernmental actions. In my view, EAJA is an effective and valuable \ncheck on the virtually limitless power of the federal government.\n  One would assume that the typical American taxpayer is protected by \nthe EAJA. However, this is not the case as the Act exempts all civil \nactions and administrative proceedings in connection with the IRS from \nits protections. In addition, court decisions have consistently \ninterpreted the tax code as providing the only relief for taxpayers \ntreated unjustly. The current system is inadequate and this legislation \nwill help to change that untenable situation.\n  I want to commend my friend and colleague from Vermont for his \nleadership on this important issue. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is only one step in reforming the Internal Revenue Service and \nmaking that agency more accountable to the American people. However, it \nis an important and essential step in that process. The American people \nshould not have to squander their hard earned money defending against \nunjustified actions by federal agencies--including the IRS. I look \nforward to working with Senator Leahy and the other concerned Members \nof this body as this legislation moves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1613. A bill to reform the regulatory process, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equal \nAccess to Justice Reform Amendments of 1998. This legislation contains \nnecessary improvements to existing law, the Equal Access to Justice \nAct, which will streamline and improve the current process of awarding \nattorney's fees to private parties who prevail in litigation against \nthe government of the United States. I am introducing this legislation \nfor the second consecutive Congress because I believe the reforms \nembodied in this legislation are important steps in reducing the \ngovernment generated burden under which many individuals and small \nbusinesses currently operate.\n  Over the past few years, certainly since the elections of 1994, many \nMembers of the Senate have taken to the floor and spoken about the \nimportance of ``getting government off the backs of the American \npeople.'' We often hear about the need to reform government in very \nfundamental ways that effect people all across this nation. I agree and \nthe legislation I propose here today deals directly with some aspects \nof the concerns we have heard in this chamber, by assisting everyday \nAmericans who face legal battles with the federal government and \nprevail.\n  At the outset, it is important to understand what the Equal Access to \nJustice Act is, and why it exists. The premise is very simple, EAJA \nplaces individuals and small businesses who face the United States \nGovernment in litigation, on equal footing by establishing guidelines \nfor the award of attorney's fees when the individual or small business \nprevails. Quite simply, EAJA acknowledges that the resources available \nto the federal government in a legal dispute far outweigh those \navailable to everyday Americans. This disparity is resolved by \nrequiring the government, in certain instances, to pay the attorney's \nfees of successful private parties. By giving successful parties the \nright to seek attorney's fees from the United States, EAJA seeks to \nprevent small business owners from having to risk their companies in \norder to seek justice.\n  My interest in this issue predates my election to the Senate and \narises from my experience both as a private attorney and a Member of \nthe Senate in my home state of Wisconsin. While in private practice, I \nbecame aware of how the ability to recoup attorney's fees is often the \ninitial inquiry which must be made when deciding whether or not to seek \nredress in the courts. The significance of this factor should not be \nunderestimated. Upon entering the State Senate, I authored legislation \nmodeled on the federal law. Today, section 814.246 of the Wisconsin \nstatutes contains provisions similar to the federal EAJA statute.\n  It seemed to me then, as it does now, that we should do what we can \nto help ease the burdens on parties who need to have their claims \nreviewed and decided by impartial decision makers. To this end, I have \nreviewed the existing federal statutes with an eye toward improving \nthem and making them work better. I believe that my legislation does \njust that. The bill I am introducing today, does a number of things to \nmake EAJA more effective for individuals and small business men and \nwomen all across this country.\n  One provision of my original bill that I introduced previously, \nraising the hourly attorneys fee cap to $125 from $75, has already been \nenacted as part of the Small Business Fair Treatment Act signed into \nlaw during the 104th Congress. While I am pleased that significant \nchange was adopted, my legislation goes further by eliminating the \nexisting ``special factors'' language which allowed the fee cap to be \nincreased in certain circumstances. I believe the $125 level is \nconsistent with the going rate and obviates the need for ``special \nfactor'' language which often serves to slow the recovery process. \nFurther, my legislation explicitly establishes a formula for \ncalculating cost-of-living adjustments for awards and eliminates the \noften time consuming evaluation that was previously required in the \nabsence of a specific standard. Both of these changes, coupled with the \nfee increase will work to make EAJA more efficient and effective for \nAmericans.\n  Another significant factor of my legislation is the elimination of \nthe language which allows the government to escape paying attorneys' \nfees even if it loses a suit but can provide a substantial \njustification for its action. I believe that if an individual or small \nbusiness battles the federal government in an adversarial proceeding \nand prevails, the government should pay the fees incurred. Imagine the \nscenario of a person who spends countless time and money dueling with \nthe government and prevails, only to find out that they must now \nundergo the additional step of litigating the justification of the \nunderlying governmental action. For the government, with its vast \nresources, this additional step poses no difficulty, but for the \ncitizen it may simply not be financially feasible. A 1992 study \nprepared by University of Virginia Professor Harold Krent on behalf of \nthe Administrative Conference of the United States found that only a \nsmall percentage of EAJA awards were denied because of the substantial \njustification defense and that while it is impossible to determine the \nexact cost of litigating the issue of justification, it is his opinion, \nbased upon review of cases in 1989 and 1990, that while the substantial \njustification defense may save some money awards, it\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\nwas not enough to justify the cost of the additional litigation. In \nshort, eliminating this often burdensome second step is a cost \neffective step which will streamline recovery under EAJA.\n  The final point in regard to streamlining and improving EAJA is \nlanguage designed to encourage settlement and avoid costly and \nprotracted litigation. Under the bill, the government is provided the \nability to make an offer of settlement up to 10 days prior to a hearing \non a fees claim. If the government's offer is rejected and the \nprevailing party seeking recovery ultimately wins a smaller award, that \nparty is not entitled to attorneys' fees and costs they incurred after \nthe date of government's offer. Again, this will speed the process and \nthereby reduce the time and expense of the litigation.\n  We all know that the American small business owner has a difficult \nroad to make ends meet and that unnecessary or overly burdensome \ngovernment regulation can be a formidable obstacle to doing business. \nIt can be the difference between success or failure. The Equal Access \nto Justice Act was conceived and implemented to help overcome the \nformidable power of the federal government. In this regard it has \nhelped many Americans do just that. The legislation I am offering today \nwill make EAJA more effective for more Americans while at the same time \ndeterring the government from acting in an indefensible and unwarranted \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1613\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require a permit for the making of motion picture, \ntelevision program, or other form of commercial visual depiction in a \nunit of the National Park System or National Wildlife Refuge System; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE IMAGE PERMIT FEE ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that gives our \nNational Park Service the authority to require fee-based permits for \nthe use of the parks in the making of motion pictures, television \nprograms, advertisements or other commercial purposes.\n  Our national parks are among our nation's most valuable resources. My \n``National Park Service Image Fee Permit Act'' would help us to protect\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\nthem and ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy their \nbeauty by making sure the parks are reimbursed for their commercial \nuse.\n  The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service already have a \nsimilar permit and fee system for commercial filming on public lands. \nRocky Mountain National Park in my home state of Colorado has had \ntwenty-five commercial filming operations take place between 1996-1997. \nAccording to park supervisors many individuals in the entertainment \nbusiness are shocked at the fact that they are not currently charged \nfor the use of our great national parks.\n  It makes no sense that our national parks' lands, that have been \ndeemed to be even more precious by their designation, should be used \ncommercially for free. This is especially important now when taxpayers \nare facing increased fees to enter the national parks and more and more \npeople are enjoying our natural wonders every year in record numbers.\n  As the Vice-Chairman of the Parks, Historic Preservation and \nRecreation Subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I am concerned about the maintenance backlog that exists in \nmost of our national parks. It is also no secret that the amount of \nfederal tax dollars available for that maintenance has been dwindling \nfor some time now.\n  I offer this bill as a funding vehicle for our parks to reimburse \nthem for the administrative costs they incur by allowing the images of \nour precious national parks to be used in commercial ventures. This \nbill will not provide all of the funds needed to address the \nmaintenance backlog in our parks, nor do I intend it to, but it will \ndefray the real costs associated with making our parks available for \ncommercial enterprises such as the motion picture industry.\n  We can all understand why Hollywood or book publishers want to use \nthe spectacular beauty of our national parks as backdrops for their \nproductions. My bill simply allows the National Park Service to recover \nthe real costs of allowing such use and devoting those fees to the \nparks for their preservation. Common sense directs us to do this, and I \nbelieve this bill is fair for the commercial users of our parks and \nmore importantly, for the American taxpayers.\n  This bill is similar to legislation introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by my friend and colleague from Colorado, Congressman \nHefley.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the National Parks and \nConservation Association that has reviewed and endorsed this \nlegislation. I look forward to working with the Association, other \ninterested parties and, of course, the Committee, to deal with the \nmaintenance backlog at our national parks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation letter of support and my bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: I am writing to applaud your efforts \n     to resolve a small but nettlesome issue affecting both the \n     national parks and the American taxpayer.\n       For years, Hollywood and Madison Avenue production \n     companies have been able to avail themselves of the unique \n     resources of the national parks at well below market prices. \n     In fact, film production companies have been required to \n     cover only the physical cost of monitoring their activities \n     and any remediation necessary after they leave the site. In \n     many cases, this amount has totaled in the hundreds of \n     dollars, compared with production budgets that total in the \n     tens of millions of dollars and more.\n       At a time when the Congress has directed the National Park \n     Service to do more in collecting entrance and recreation fees \n     from park visitors, the current requirements for film \n     production fees are patently unfair and must be changed. Your \n     legislation represents a step forward in this regard and will \n     contribute substantially to this issue as it is debated in \n     this congress.\n       Again, I want to thank you for your efforts. With your \n     help, the parks will finally enjoy a more balanced financial \n     relationship with private film production companies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n        Glenn):\n  S. 1615. A bill to present a gold medal to Len ``Roy Rogers'' Slye \nand Octavia ``Dale Evans'' Smith; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL LEGISLATION\n\n   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today we are introducing \nlegislation which would authorize presentation of a Congressional Gold \nMedal to Len ``Roy Rogers'' Slye and Octavia ``Dale Evans'' Smith. \n``Heroes are made every little while,'' Will Rogers once said, ``but \nonly one in a million conduct themselves afterwards so that it makes us \nproud that we honored them at the time.'' The gold medal we propose \nwould honor two American heroes for the wholesome entertainment they \nhave given the world for six decades and for the shining example they \nhave set as role models for America's youth. I am pleased to be joined \nby the distinguished cosponsors, Senators Coverdell, Helms, and Glenn.\n\n  For generations of Americans, Roy Rogers has been the symbol of the \nWestern hero--a man who combines\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\ncourage with honesty and impeccable integrity--who always righted wrong \nthrough straight talk and square-dealing. When asked about the roles he \nplayed on-screen, Roy once answered that he did ``what I was supposed \nto do. I played myself. * * * When I talk about my image, there isn't \nanything that isn't really me. I always try to be the best that I can \nbe.'' In all that we have seen or heard or read about Roy Rogers, on \nscreen or off, the persona and the man are indeed one and the same--and \nin Roy Rogers we see what is best about America.\n  Dale Evans counts among her highest honors the Cardinal Terrence Cook \nHumanities Award and the California Mother of the Year. Both are \ntributes to two of her greatest gifts--her generosity of spirit and her \nstrong family values. Together she and Roy have raised nine children, \nand they have sixteen grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren. And the \nfact that most of them live near Roy and Dale's ranch outside of \nVictorville, California, is a testament to their devotion and strong \nfamily ties. Dale is the author of 25 books. Her most famous, ``Angel \nUnaware'', chronicles the life and death of Dale and Roy's daughter, \nRobin, who died from complications of Down's syndrome. The book is \nabout loss, but it is also about the capacity to love--a quality which \nboth Dale and Roy have in abundant measure.\n  Roy and Dale are an American institution--and their fans span the \nglobe. Together they have achieved the pinnacle of success in the \nentertainment industry. Their movies were No. 1 at the box office. \nTheir television series was the highest rated of its time. The episodes \nhave been translated into every major language, and they can still be \nseen here in America and in markets abroad. Between the two of them \nthey have set appearance records in every major arena in the world, \nincluding Madison Square Garden, the Los Angeles Coliseum, the Chicago \nStadium, the Harringay Arena in London, and Toronto's Canadian National \nExhibition. Roy once sold out Madison Square Garden 29 straight nights, \nand he still holds the record for the largest crowd ever to see an \nindoor rodeo.\n  It has been said that we make a living by what we get, but we make a \nlife by what we give. Both Roy and Dale's careers have been an \nunqualified success, as their world-wide appeal attests. But this tells \nonly half the story. Their appeal--which reaches to all four corners of \nthe globe--is also the result of the values, the ethics, and the \nuncompromising principles by which they have lived their lives.

A bill to authorize the exchange of existing Federal oil and \ngas leases in the State of Montana, located in the Lewis and Clark \nNational Forest and the Flathead National Forest, for credits in future \nFederal oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                          exchange legislation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a Bill \nthat would provide the Secretary of the Interior with the authority to \nexchange oil and gas leases in the Badger Two-Medicine area, in the \nState of Montana, for credits that could be applied toward bidding or \nroyalty payments in Montana and the Gulf of Mexico.\n  The area involved in this legislation is located along the Rocky \nMountain Front, an area whose rich natural beauty I care deeply about. \nIt lies south of one of the ``Crown Jewels'' of the National Park \nsystem, Glacier National Park. Also adjoining this area is the \nBlackfeet Indian Reservation and the uniquely wild and pristine Bob \nMarshall Wilderness Area. The Badger Two-Medicine area is undeveloped \nwilderness and contains many sites sacred to the Blackfeet Nation. The \nlocation of this area, its cultural value, and its undeveloped natural \ncondition has been the focus of the decade-long debate over whether or \nnot the oil and gas resources of the area should be developed. I myself \nbelieve that we should protect this special place for our children and \ngrandchildren, and I have fought to do just that.\n  We are no closer today to resolving the question of development of \nthe resources of this area than we were a decade ago and it is time to \nresolve these conflicts. During this time the ten leaseholders in the \narea have made investments in anticipation of being able to exercise \nthe option of developing wells under their leases. The time has come to \nbreak this stalemate that only costs the leaseholders, the citizens \nconcerned with protecting the area, and the government time and money \nwithout resolution. The bill that I am introducing today is fair for \nthe landowners, the citizens of Montana and the Nation, and fair for \nthe leaseholders.\n  Chevron, the largest leaseholder in the area, stated ``While we would \nhave liked to have developed our well in the Badger Two-Medicine area, \nwe understand that the public had concerns about our proposal. Senator \nBaucus' bill breaks the deadlock and allows everyone to get on with \ntheir business''.\n  Today I am introducing this legislation, a common sense solution to a \nlong-standing controversy, to allow all the parties to leave this \ndispute as winners. The Secretary of the Interior would work with \nleaseholders, who have made investments over the years, to determine \ncredits for their expenses. These credits, allowing for reinvestment in \nMontana, can be applied to lease bids or royalty payments in other \nlocations where they already have active wells or where development is\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\nmore likely to occur. The citizens who are concerned about the cultural \nand resource effects of development would see the integrity of this \narea maintained. The government would be able to refocus the use of its \nlimited financial resources on management activities that have a more \ndirect positive result than continuation of the current disputes.\n  This bill focuses on resolving Montana problems while looking out for \nthe economic and natural resource interests of this State. Creating and \nmaintaining jobs in Montana is very important to me. This bill helps \nsave jobs. As Richard Jackson, owner of an outfitting business in the \nBadger Two-Medicine recently said, ``This bill isn't just about saving \nsome of our most precious wildlands; it's about saving our wildlands \nand Montana jobs''. Montana has a unique recreational industry that has \nsustainable jobs that are dependent on wild untamed lands. We need to \ncare for this wildness. I look forward to continuing work with the \nGovernor and the Montana Delegation on innovative ideas to stimulate \nappropriate development of the State's rich mineral heritage while \nprotecting its wildness and uncomparable natural beauty.\n  I encourage my esteemed colleagues to support this bill and look \nforward to working with them in their consideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MTM-\n     53314, in Teton County, Montana.\n       (c) Amount.--The amount of the credits shall be based on \n     investments made in the acquisition and development of the \n     leases before the date of enactment of this Act and agreed to \n     by the Secretary of the Interior and the leaseholder.\n       (d) Withdrawal From Mineral Laws.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights not relinquished, the exchange area described \n     in subsection (b)(1) is withdrawn from location and entry \n     under the mining laws and from leasing under the mineral \n     leasing laws.\n       (e) Effect of Use of Credits.--If a person that receives a \n     credit under subsection (a) uses the credit to pay any rental \n     or royalty due under any Federal oil and gas lease on Federal \n     land within the State of Montana, the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall pay the State of Montana, from amounts \n     received from oil and gas leases on Federal land that, but \n     for this subsection, would be deposited in the Treasury of \n     the United States under section 35 of the Act of February 25, \n     1920 (commonly known as the ``Mineral Lands Leasing Act'') \n     (41 Stat. 450, chapter 85; 30 U.S.C. 191), the amount that \n     the State would have received under applicable law if the \n     amount of the royalty or rental had been paid in cash.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S451-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 260\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n(Mr. Enzi) was added as a cosponsor of S. 260, a bill to amend the \nControlled Substances Act with respect to penalties for crimes \ninvolving cocaine, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 859\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Florida (Mr. \nMack) was added as a cosponsor of S. 859, a bill to repeal the increase \nin tax on social security benefits.\n\n\n                                 S. 990\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n990, a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish the \nNational Institute of Biomedical Imaging.\n\n\n                                S. 1352\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Leahy) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1352, a bill to amend Rule \n30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to restore the stenographic \npreference for depositions.\n\n\n                                S. 1365\n\n  At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the name of the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1365, a bill to \namend title II of the Social Security Act to provide that the \nreductions in social security benefits which are required in the case \nof spouses and surviving spouses who are also receiving certain \nGovernment pensions shall be equal to the amount by which two-thirds of \nthe total amount of the combined monthly benefit (before reduction) and \nmonthly pension exceeds $1,200, adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n                                S. 1605\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from Washington \n(Mrs. Murray) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1605, a bill to establish \na matching grant program to help States, units of local government, and \nIndian tribes to purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement \nofficers.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 65\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 65, a concurrent resolution calling for a United States \neffort to end restriction on the freedoms and human rights of the \nenclaved people in the occupied area of Cyprus.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 71\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, his name was withdrawn as a cosponsor of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 71, a concurrent resolution condemning \nIraq's threat to international peace and security.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 155\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Warner) and the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) were added \nas cosponsors of Senate Resolution 155, a resolution designating April \n6 of each year as ``National Tartan Day'' to recognize the outstanding \nachievements and contributions made by Scottish Americans to the United \nStates.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 170\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) was added as a cosponsor of Senate \nResolution 170, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that \nthe Federal investment in biomedical research should be increased by \n$2,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S456-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S456-S457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 173--RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF REPRODUCTIVE \n                        HEALTH SERVICES CLINICS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerrey, Ms. Collins, and Ms. \nMoseley-Braun) submitted the following resolution;

Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution condemning \nlast week's tragic bombing of a reproductive health services clinic in \nBirmingham, Alabama. This vicious and unprovoked attack killed a police \nofficer and critically injured a clinic worker.\n  Last week's attack was the first clinic bombing in the United States \nto cause a fatality, but unfortunately, it was far from the first \nbombing. In recent years, reproductive health services clinics have \nbeen the targets of an unprecedented terror campaign. Last year alone, \nclinics in Atlanta, Georgia and Tulsa, Oklahoma were bombed, resulting \nin many serious injuries.\n  This reign of terror began with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in \nPensacola, Florida in 1993. A second abortion provider and his security \nguard were shot and killed the following year in Florida. And on the \nbloodiest day of the anti-choice terror campaign, two clinic workers \nwere killed and five injured in vicious, cold-blooded shootings in \nBrookline, Massachusetts.\n  All told, over 1,800 violent attacks have been reported at \nreproductive health services clinics in recent years. I hope my \ncolleagues are aware that the attacks and the level of violence in \nthose attacks are increasing every year.\n  Reproductive choice is a contentious issue. I know that many of my \ncolleagues feel very strongly that abortion should be outlawed in \nAmerica, and although I strongly disagree, I respect their views and I \nhope they respect mine. But this resolution is not about choice; it is \nabout violence. I know that not a single one of my colleagues believes \nthat murder, bombing, terror and acts of intimidation are appropriate \nways to express political views.\n  These bombings are a part of a terrorist campaign--a campaign \ndesigned to destroy a woman's right to choose through violence. The \nUnited States Senate must condemn these attacks as strongly and \nunequivocally as we condemn other acts of terrorism--both here and \naround the world.\n  In addition to condemning the attack, this resolution expresses the \nSense of the Senate that the Attorney General should fully enforce \nexisting laws to protect the rights of American women seeking care at \nreproductive health services clinics.\n  I am proud to be joined in this effort by a distinguished, bipartisan \ngroup of Senators. I hope the Senate can move quickly on this \nresolution and pass it as early as today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S456-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I commend his consistent drive and aggressive encouragement \nto improve the quality of life for his fellow citizens.\n  William has held many officer roles as well as been a member of many \norganizations. To name a few, he has been involved in the Board of \nDirectors of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, New Hampshire \nBusiness Committee for the Arts, and New Hampshire Better Business \nBureau. He also devotes a great deal of time to civic and charitable \nendeavors including the Eastern Seal Society, Junior Achievement, The \nHumanities Council and Bishop of Manchester's Summer Reception Fund \nCommittee. These are just a few organizations with which he has spent \ncountless hours and dedicated service. This impressive list goes on and \nhe should be very proud of these contributions.\n  William has enthusiastically worked with more than twenty \norganizations, countless residents and employees, and developed a \nconsiderable portfolio of citizenship. Four words come to mind that \nbest represent what William is trying to strengthen: community, \nteamwork, partnership, and development. These are terms that bind all \nAmericans together and strengthen the unity of this great country.\n  These words best exhibit the tools he employs to bring about positive \nchange and as a leader, encouraging others to rise to the calling of \ncitizenship.

FRAIN JR., GREATER MANCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CITIZEN OF \n                                THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate William T. Frain Jr., a distinguished individual, for \nbeing named Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year \nfor 1997. I commend his consistent drive and aggressive encouragement \nto improve the quality of life for his fellow citizens.\n  William has held many officer roles as well as been a member of many \norganizations. To name a few, he has been involved in the Board of \nDirectors of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, New Hampshire \nBusiness Committee for the Arts, and New Hampshire Better Business \nBureau. He also devotes a great deal of time to civic and charitable \nendeavors including the Eastern Seal Society, Junior Achievement, The \nHumanities Council and Bishop of Manchester's Summer Reception Fund \nCommittee. These are just a few organizations with which he has spent \ncountless hours and dedicated service. This impressive list goes on and \nhe should be very proud of these contributions.\n  William has enthusiastically worked with more than twenty \norganizations, countless residents and employees, and developed a \nconsiderable portfolio of citizenship. Four words come to mind that \nbest represent what William is trying to strengthen: community, \nteamwork, partnership, and development. These are terms that bind all \nAmericans together and strengthen the unity of this great country.\n  These words best exhibit the tools he employs to bring about positive \nchange and as a leader, encouraging others to rise to the calling of \ncitizenship. Yet, William is not just a great citizen, but a defender \nof companionship and a visionary of better communities.\n  William's commitment to each organization he represents is extremely \nsolid and substantial. He gives it his all and inspires others to \nfollow his lead. His actions and beliefs have become a catalyst for \nsignificant change resulting in profound achievements. Mr. President, I \nwant to congratulate William for his outstanding work and I am proud to \nrepresent him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S457-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           VERMONT OLYMPIANS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor the twenty-two Vermonters who will be representing our country \nthis week at the XVIIIth Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Perhaps \nChris Graff of the Associated Press said it best when he noted in an \narticle that appeared in the Rutland Herald that Vermont produces more \nthan its share of Olympians, ``. . . a fact that should surprise no \none. There is something about Vermonters and the Vermont spirit that is \nso keenly associated with the Olympic spirit.'' Maybe it is the mix of \nsevere weather, Yankee stubbornness, and that New England work ethic \nthat instills in Vermonters an appreciation for hard work and \nperseverance.\n  Representing Vermont on the U.S. Men's Ice Hockey Team is the now \nfamous John LeClair from St. Albans. LeClair may play professional \nhockey for the Philadelphia Flyers, but he has never forgotten his \nroots in the small city of St. Albans. John donates his time and \nexpertise to the people of Franklin County throughout the year. His \nskill and All-American image have brought civility and a touch of New \nEngland neighborliness to the most unlikely of sports. For the first \ntime ever, the National Hockey League is competing in the Olympics. \nVermonters are rooting for John LeClair to leave a lasting impression.\n  If there is one thing Vermonters excel at it is getting through snow, \nso it makes sense that Vermont is well represented on the U.S. Olympic \nCross Country Ski Teams. Four Vermonters will be on the team; Marc \nGilbertson and Laura Wilson of Montpelier, Kerrin Petty from Townshend, \nand Suzanne King of East Warren. This is Marc's first time as a member \nof a U.S. national team and I admire his grit in going after his \nOlympic dream. Laura, Kerrin and Suzanne will bring experience to the \nwomen's team and are aiming to show the world what Vermont women are \nmade of.\n  The Nordic Combined event has Norwich native Tim Tetreault competing. \nTim's parents Tom and Anne will be going to Japan this week to watch \ntheir son, who has been skiing since he was five, compete in his third \nOlympic games. The Freestyle U.S. Ski teams also include four skiers \nand a head coach from Vermont. Ann Battelle from Williston got hooked \non skiing during her years at Champlain Valley Union High School and \nhas never looked back. Jim Moran of Stowe and Evan Dybvig of Turnbridge \nwho have both spent many cold hours conquering the slopes of Stowe, \nwill also be competing. Donna Weinbrecht, another team member, knows \nwell all the steep trails and sharp twists at Killington mountain. The \nfour will be joined by coach Jeff Good from Williston.\n  Skiing comes naturally for Vermonters, but add a rifle and you have a \nsport Vermonters can really get behind! Seven Vermonters will be doing \njust that on the U.S. Biathlon teams--Dan Westover from Colchester, \nRobert Rosser of Underhill, Kristina Viljanen-Sabasteanski of Richmond, \nDeborah Nordyke from Jericho, Kara Salmela of Bolton Valley, Algis \nShalna (head coach) from Williston, and Timothy Derrick (assistant \nCoach) of Jericho. Head Coach Shalna brings with him Olympic experience \nhaving competed for the Soviet Union's Gold Medal winning team in the \n1984 Winter Olympics. The group has been training at a state-of-the-art \nVermont National Guard facility in Jericho--which will be hosting the \nWorld Junior Biathlon Championships just after the Olympics.\n  New to the Olympics but familiar to Vermont is snowboarding. As the \nbirth place of this sport and home to Jake Burton's renowned snowboard \ncompany, it is appropriate that Vermont will be sending three talented \ncompetitors as part of the first U.S. Snowboarding Team. Ross Powers \nfrom South Londonderry, Ron Chiodi of Rochester, and Betsy Shaw of East \nDorset will be traveling to Nagano this week. Ross knows all about \ntravel since snowboarding has taken him all over the world. He will \ncelebrate his nineteenth birthday on February 10th and be joined by his \nmother, Nancy, in Japan. East Dorset will be cheering for their \nneighbor, Betsy, who has ``surfed'' mountains all over the globe but \nknows the ones in Southern Vermont best. Ron too will bring his Vermont \nexperience at Stratton Mountain with him to the Olympics.\n  Also going to Nagano, Japan is Vermonter Kathryn Vigesna Lipke of \nBelvidere. She will be serving as one of five international jurors who \nwill judge the snow-sculpting competitions. Having lived in the \nmountains of Belvidere with its snowy peaks and dense woods, Kathryn \nwill make an excellent judge of cold weather beauty.\n  I am truly proud of the athletes Vermont is sending to the Olympics. \nI commend them for their hard work and the example they set for \nVermonters and for athletes everywhere, and join all Vermonters in \nwishing them the best in the 1998 Winter Olympics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S458-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S458-S459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PROTECTION OF THE AMERICAN FLAG FROM PHYSICAL DESECRATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Hatch, \nCleland, and others in cosponsoring the proposed constitutional \namendment to grant the States and Congress the power to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States. Our flag \noccupies a truly unique place in the hearts of millions of citizens as \na cherished symbol of freedom and democracy. As a national emblem of \nthe world's greatest democracy, the American flag should be treated \nwith respect and care. I have long held that our free speech rights do \nnot entitle us to consider the flag as merely personal property, to be \ntreated any way we see fit, including its desecration for the purpose \nof political protest. I want to commend Senator Hatch for once again \nleading us in this very worthwhile cause.\n  Mr. President, with the introduction of this resolution, we resume \nour effort to protect the greatest symbol of the American experience. \nThere is no more powerful symbol of freedom, democracy, and our \ncommitment to those principles that the American flag, and it is \naltogether just that we try to ensure that it is publicly displayed \nwith pride, dignity, and honor. Make no mistake, Mr. President, the \nflag is not merely a visual symbol to us, nor should it be. Too many \nAmericans have contributed too much of their labor, their passion, and \nin some cases their very being for it to be so simply regarded. For the \nflag permeates our national history and relays the story of America in \nits simplest terms. Indeed, knowing how the flag has changed--and in \nwhat ways it has remained constant--is to know the history and hopes of \nthis country.\n  More than 220 years ago, a year after the colonies had made their \nhistoric decision to declare independence from Britain, the Second \nContinental Congress decided that the American flag would consist of 13 \nred and white alternating stripes and 13 white stars in a field of \nblue. These stars and blue field were to represent a new constellation \nin which freedom and government of the people, by the people and for \nthe people would rule. As we all know, the constellation has grown to \ninclude 50 stars, but the number of stripes has remained constant. In \nthis way, the flag tells all who view it that no matter how large \nAmerica may become, it is forever rooted in the bedrock principles of \nfreedom and self-government that led those first 13 colonies to forge a \nnew nation.\n  Equally important is the fact that the flag also represents our \ncommitment to these ideals. This commitment has exacted a high human \ntoll, for which many of America's best and brightest have given their \nlast full measure of devotion. It is in their memories and for their \ncommitment to America's ideals that I am proud to support the amendment \nintroduced yesterday.\n  The amendment is necessary because the Supreme Court, in its 1990 \nU.S. verses Eichman ruling, held that burning the flag in political \nprotest was constitutionally protected free speech. No one holds our \nright to free speech more dearly than I do, Mr. President, but in my \nview, the Eichman decision unnecessarily rejects the deeply held \nreverence in which millions of Americans hold our flag. With all the \nforums for public opinion available to Americans every day, from \ntelevision and radio, to newspapers and internet chat rooms, Americans \nare afforded ample opportunity to freely and fully exercise their \nlegitimate, constitutional right to free speech, even if what they have\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\nto say is overwhelmingly unpopular with a majority of American \ncitizens. Simply put, protecting the flag from desecration poses no \nserious threat to the exercise of free speech in America.\n  We must also remember that this constitutional amendment is carefully \ndrafted to simply allow the Congress and individual State legislatures \nto enact laws prohibiting the physical desecration of the flag, if they \nso choose. It certainly does not stipulate or require that such laws be \nenacted, although many States and the Federal Government have already \ndemonstrated widespread support for doing so. In fact, prior to the \nSupreme Court's rulings on this issue, 48 States, including my own \nState of Maine, and the Federal Government has anti-flag-burning laws \non their books for years. So really what we do with this resolution is \ngive the American flag the protection that almost all the States, the \nFederal Government, and a large majority of the American people have \nalready endorsed.\n  Protecting the flag also enjoys widespread support in Congress. \nDuring the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly \npassed a flag protection resolution, and 63 Senators supported a \nresolution identical to this one. Just last year, the House or \nRepresentatives, to its credit, reaffirmed its commitment to the \nsanctity of the American flag by once again passing a flag protection \nresolution with ease. Now it is time for the Senate to show a similar \ncommitment.\n  Whether our flag is flying over Fenway Park, a military base, a \nschool, or on a flag pole on Main Street, the stars and stripes have \nalways represented the ideals and values that are the foundation of \nthis great Nation. Our flag has come to not only represent the pride we \nhave for our Nation's past glories, but also to stand for the hope we \nall harbor for our Nation's future. Mr. President, it is with this \npride and hope that I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S458-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S459-S460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PAYMENT OF AN EQUITABLE CLAIM TO DR. BEATRICE BRAUDE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with good news. We \nhave at long last seen a measure of justice in a case which brings back \nmemories of an awful time in our nation's history.\n  In 1953 Dr. Beatrice Braude, a linguist, was wrongfully dismissed \nfrom her position at the United States Information Agency and was \nsubsequently blacklisted by the Federal government as a result of \naccusations of disloyalty to the United States. The accusations were \nold. Two years earlier the State Department's Loyalty Security Board \nhad investigated and unanimously voted to dismiss them. The Board sent \na letter to Dr. Braude stating ``there is no reasonable doubt as to \nyour loyalty to the United States Government or as to your security \nrisk to the Department of State.'' Despite this, her name was not \ncleared.\n  Dr. Braude was terminated one day after being praised for her work \nand informed that she would probably be promoted. She was told that her \ntermination was due to budgetary constraints, but the truth was that \nshe was selected for termination because of the old--and answered--\ncharges against her. Because she did not know the real reason for her \ndismissal, she was denied certain procedural rights, including the \nright to request a hearing.\n  Over time she grew suspicious. When she was unable, over the course \nof several years, to secure employment anywhere else in the Federal \ngovernment--even in a typing pool despite a perfect score on the typing \ntest--she became convinced that she had been blacklisted. The Privacy \nAct of 1974 enabled her to obtain her government files and confirm her \nsuspicions. She invested much time and energy fighting to regain \nFederal employment and restore her reputation. She was partially \nsuccessful. In 1982, at the age of 69, she was hired as a language \ninstructor in the CIA. Sadly, she still had not been able to clear her \nname by the time of her death in 1988. The irony of the charges against \nDr. Braude is that she was an anti-communist, having witnessed first-\nhand Communist-sponsored terrorism in Europe while she was an assistant \ncultural affairs officer in Paris and, for a brief period, an exchange \nofficer in Bonn during the late 1940's and early 1950's.\n  Mr. President, I have reviewed the charges against Dr. Braude before \non the floor of the Senate, but I think that they merit repeating \nbecause they are illustrative of that dark era and are instructive to \nus even today. There were a total of four charges. First, she was \nbriefly a member of the Washington Book Shop on Farragut Square that \nthe Attorney General later labeled subversive. Second, she had been in \ncontact with Mary Jane Keeney, a Communist Party activist employed at \nthe United Nations. Third, she had been a member of the State \nDepartment unit of the Communist-dominated Federal Workers' Union. \nFourth, she was an acquaintance of Judith Coplon.\n  With regard to the first charge, Dr. Braude had indeed joined the \nBook Shop shortly after her arrival in Washington in 1943. She was \neager to meet congenial new people and a friend recommended the Book \nShop, which hosted music recitals in the evenings. I must express some \nsensitivity here: my F.B.I. records report that I was observed several \ntimes at a ``leftist musical review'' in suburban Hampstead while I was \nattending the London School of Economics on a Fulbright Fellowship.\n  Dr. Braude was aware of the undercurrent of sympathy with the Russian \ncause at the Book Shop, but her membership paralleled a time of close \nU.S.-Soviet collaboration. She drifted away from the Book Shop in 1944 \nbecause of her distaste for the internal politics of other active \nmembers. Her membership at the Book Shop was only discovered when her \nname appeared on a list of delinquent dues. It appears that her most \nsinister crime while a member of the book shop was her failure to \nreturn a book on time.\n\n  Dr. Braude met Mary Jane Keeney on behalf of a third woman who \nactively aided Nazi victims after the war and was anxious to send \nclothing to another woman in occupied Germany. Dr. Braude knew nothing \nof Keeney's political orientation and characterized the meeting as a \ntransitory experience.\n  With regard to the third charge, Dr. Braude, in response to an \ninterrogatory from the State Department's Loyalty Security Board, \nargued that she belonged to an anti-Communist faction of the State \nDepartment unit of the Federal Workers' Union.\n  Remember that the Loyalty Security Board investigated these charges \nand exonerated her.\n  The fourth charge, which Dr. Braude certainly did not--or could not--\ndeny, was her friendship with Judith Coplon. Braude met Coplon in the \nsummer of 1945 when both women attended a class Herbert Marcuse taught \nat American University. They saw each other infrequently thereafter. In \nMay 1948, Coplon wrote to Braude, then stationed in Paris and living in \na hotel on the Left Bank, to announce that she would be visiting \nshortly and needed a place to stay. Dr. Braude arranged for Coplon to \nstay at the hotel. Coplon stayed for 6 weeks, during which time Dr. \nBraude found her behavior very trying. The two parted on unfriendly \nterms. The friendship they had prior to parting was purely social.\n  Mr. President, Judith Coplon was a spy. She worked in the Justice \nDepartment's Foreign Agents Registration Division, an office integral \nto the FBI's counter-intelligence efforts. She was arrested early in \n1949 while handing over notes on counterintelligence operations to \nSoviet citizen Valentine Gubitchev, a United Nations employee. Coplon \nwas tried and convicted--there was no doubt of her guilt--but the \nconviction was overturned on a technicality. Gubitchev was also \nconvicted but was allowed to return to the U.S.S.R. because of his \nquasi- diplomatic status.\n  Judith Coplon was a spy. Beatrice Braude was not. We know that Judith \nCoplon was not alone as a Soviet spy; though there were not as many as \none might have imagined given the American response. In 1956, Edward A. \nShils captured the overreaction to Communist activities in the United \nStates in his fine, small study, The Torment of Secrecy: The Background \nand Consequences of American Security Policy. ``The American visage \nbegan to cloud over,'' Shils wrote. ``Secrets were to become our chief \nreliance just when it was becoming more and more evident that the \nSoviet Union had long maintained an active apparatus for espionage in \nthe United States. For a\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\ncountry which had never previously thought of itself as an object of \nsystematic espionage by foreign powers, it was unsettling.''\n  The larger society, Shils continued, was ``facing an unprecedented \nthreat to its continuance.'' In these circumstances, ``The fantasies of \napocalyptic visionaries * * * claimed the respectability of being a \nreasonable interpretation of the real situation.'' A culture of secrecy \ntook hold within American government, while a hugely divisive debate \nraged in the Congress and the press.\n  The public now divided. There were those who perceived of treason on \nevery hand, and so we witnessed the spectacle of Senator Joseph \nMcCarthy making such accusations of George C. Marshall. Charges and \ncounter-charges of Communist conspiracies proliferated.\n  A balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear, but at \nthe time, the American government and the American public was \nconfronted with possibilities and charges, at once baffling and \nterrifying. A fault line appeared in American society that contributed \nto more than one political crisis in the years that followed.\n  The first fact is that a significant Communist conspiracy was in \nplace in Washington, New York, and Los Angeles, but in the main those \ninvolved systematically denied their involvement. This was the mode of \nCommunist conspiracy the world over.\n  The second fact is that many of those who came to prominence \ndenouncing Communist conspiracy, accusing suspected Communists and \n``comsymps,'' clearly knew little or nothing of such matters. And in \nmany instances, just as clearly were not in the least concerned. And so \nwhile there were spies like Coplon who were caught, there were also \ninnocent people who, having been accused, were unable to remove the \nstain. Dr. Braude is one such.\n  My involvement in Dr. Braude's case dates back to early 1979, when \nshe came to me and my colleague at the time, Senator Javits, and asked \nus to introduce private relief legislation on her behalf. In 1974, \nafter filing a Freedom of Information Act request and finally learning \nthe true reason for her dismissal, she filed suit in the Court of \nClaims to clear her name and seek reinstatement and monetary damages \nfor the time she was prevented from working for the Federal government. \nThe Court, however, dismissed her case on the grounds that the statute \nof limitations had expired. On March 5, 1979, Senator Javits and I \ntogether introduced a bill, S. 546, to waive the statute of limitations \non Dr. Braude's case against the U.S. government and to allow the Court \nof Claims to render judgment on her claim. The bill passed the Senate \non January 30, 1980. Unfortunately, the House failed to take action on \nthe bill before the 96th Congress adjourned.\n  In 1988, and again in 1990, 1991, and 1993, Senator D'Amato and I re-\nintroduced similar legislation on Dr. Braude's behalf. Our attempts met \nwith repeated failure. Until at last, on September 21, 1993, we secured \npassage of Senate Resolution 102, which referred S. 840, the bill we \nintroduced for the relief of the estate of Dr. Braude, to the Court of \nClaims for consideration as a congressional reference action. The \nmeasure compelled the Court to determine the facts underlying Dr. \nBraude's claim and to report back to Congress on its findings.\n  The Court held a hearing in November 1995 and on March 7, 1996 Judge \nRoger B. Andewelt issued his verdict that the USIA had wrongfully \ndismissed Dr. Braude and intentionally concealed the reason for her \ntermination. He concluded that such actions constituted an equitable \nclaim for which compensation was due. Forty-three years after her \ndismissal from the USIA and 8 years after her death, the Court found in \nfavor of the estate of Dr. Braude.\n  Justice Department attorneys reached a settlement with lawyers \nrepresenting Dr. Braude's estate concerning the monetary damages. In \ndue time, $200,000 in damages were appropriated by Congress.\n  I am happy to report that Beatrice Braude's estate has just received \na check from the Department of Justice. Fully forty-five years after \nher wrongful dismissal and ten years after her death, Beatrice Braude's \nreputation has been restored and the United States government has paid \nher estate for the damages it inflicted during a dark period of our \nhistory. The money will be donated to Hunter College, the institution \nfrom which Dr. Braude received her bachelor's degree. Happily, students \nat Hunter College are now learning a more balanced history of the Cold \nWar. We are now not in the least concerned about the infiltration of \nthe government by ideological enemies. With the end of the Cold War we \nare able to learn much more of the facts of the Communist threats we \nfaced. Our response to that threat was certainly mixed and I am pleased \nthat we have been able to set the matter of Beatrice Braude to right.\n  Senator D'Amato and I wish to express our profound gratitude to Joan \nL. Kutcher and Christopher N. Sipes of Covington & Burling, two of the \nmany lawyers who have handled Dr. Braude's case on a pro bono basis \nover the years. It is thanks to their tireless dedication that history \nhas been made and Dr. Braude's name has been cleared.\n  I ask that an article appearing in the January 26, 1998 issue of the \nWashington Post, ``45 Years Later, U.S. Pays Up,'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 26, 1998]\n\n                           Update on The News\n\n                            (By Cindy Loose)\n\n\n                      45 years later, u.s. pays up\n\n       It has taken awhile for the $200,000 U.S. government check \n     for Beatrice ``Bibi'' Braude to show up--45 years, reckoned \n     from the time she was fired from the United States \n     Information Agency, where she translated French newspapers.\n       It has been 23 years since the Freedom of Information Act \n     opened government files and she was able to confirm her \n     suspicions: that the Office of Security recommended that she \n     be fired, citing a report from an FBI informant that Braude \n     was in contact with a communist in November 1946 and that she \n     had visited a leftist book store.\n       A decade has passed since Braude died at the age of 75. \n     Most of the government officials involved in her firing are \n     also dead.\n       Braude was among 1,500 federal employees dismissed for \n     similar associations and accusations from 1953 to 1956, and \n     6,000 others resigned under pressure of security and loyalty \n     inquiries, according to experts. No one, however, fought back \n     as long and as hard as Braude.\n       A lawsuit she filed bounced around various courts for years \n     until the U.S. Claims Court ruled that the statute of \n     limitations had run out. She then persuaded New York Sens. \n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D) and Alfonse D'Amato (R) to \n     sponsor legislation that mandated review of the case by the \n     U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n       The Justice Department fought the case, saying that the \n     government should not be judged by today's standards and that \n     perhaps Braude had failed to find employment for years \n     because she was a woman, and over age 40.\n       However, Judge Roger B. Andewelt ruled about two years ago \n     that Braude was a loyal American who had been unlawfully \n     persecuted and that she had an ``equitable claim'' based on \n     tort law, which recognizes moral wrongdoing. He ordered the \n     Justice Department to negotiate an award with attorneys from \n     Covington and Burling, a D.C. law firm that continued to \n     fight Braude's case pro bono after her death.\n       The lawyers settled on $200,000, and in November, Congress \n     approved the funds as part of a spending bill for the Justice \n     Department.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nBoy Scouts of America (BSA) on the occasion of the 88th Anniversary of \nits founding on February 8, 1998.\n  At the turn of the century in England, Robert Baden-Powell, an \noutdoor enthusiast and a veteran of the British Army's campaigns in \nAfrica, published a nature skills book intended for young people to \nexpose them to the rewards offered by a working knowledge of nature. \nThe book was titled ``Scouting for Boys'' and was based on survival \nmanuals Baden-Powell authored during his military career. Shortly after \nthe book's publication, Baden-Powell led a group of 22 boys on a \nscouting exhibition on Brownsea Island, off the coast of England, for \nthe purpose of applying the principles contained in the book.\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\n  From that original group of 22 sprang forth a movement which now \nboasts over 5 million members in this country alone, and continues to \ngrow each year. In my home state of Minnesota, the Viking Council of \nthe Boy Scouts of America serves over 57,000 youths between the ages of \n5 and 20, making it the 21st largest of the 335 Boy Scout Councils in \nthis country.\n  Participation in the Boy Scouts of America gives young people a sense \nof self-worth and satisfaction that is the product of setting and \naccomplishing goals, and being a part of a winning team. Such \nexperiences cultivate discipline and a sense of responsibility that are \nassets for life.\n  By cooperating with peers to achieve a common end, Scouts learn \nvaluable lessons in leadership. Countless civic, professional, and \ncommunity leaders throughout our Nation were involved in the Boy Scouts \nof America as youths, including 302 members of the 104th Congress.\n  Through programs like the ``Urban Scouting Emphasis,'' which has over \n4,300 participants in urban Minneapolis, the Boy Scouts of America is \nbringing its valuable life lessons to inner city youth who are \nparticularly at risk of falling victim to the entrapments of the \nstreets. The Boy Scouts of America offers a place where young people \ncan gain a sense of belonging and loyalty that they may otherwise seek \nto find in street gangs. Furthermore, the importance of programs like \n``Urban Emphasis'' is amplified when considering the annual cost per \nyouth served by Viking Council is $58.31, whereas the cost of housing a \njuvenile offender is $100.00 per day.\n  Of course all the forementioned would hardly be possible without the \nadult volunteers who are the foundation of the Boy Scouts of America. \nCurrently there are over 1.3 million men and women nationwide who, in \nthe spirit of Robert Baden-Powell, graciously give their time and \ntalents to ensure that the youth of society grow into well-adjusted \nadults. Adult volunteers touch the lives of young people by serving as \nexcellent role models and teachers, as well as caring friends.\n  The Boy Scouts' objectives are defined in the ``Aim of Scouting'' as \nbeing character development, citizenship training, and personal \nfitness. On the surface, these aims may seem simplistic, yet many have \nforgotten the importance of these principles. Thankfully, these \nprinciples continue to prosper in the Boy Scouts of America.\n  Mr. President, for 88 years the Boy Scouts of America has been \nteaching the value of community, Nation, and Creator to our Nation's \nyouth. This is truly grounds for celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S460-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION TO PROHIBIT FLAG DESECRATION\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nSenate Joint Resolution 40, introduced yesterday by my distinguished \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch, proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration \nof the American Flag.\n  From the birth of our nation, the Flag has represented all that is \ngood and decent about our country. Whether it be the battlefields of \nBunker Hill and Gettysburg, the trenches of Flanders Field, the shores \nof Normandy, the rugged terrain of Korea, the jungles of the Mekong, or \nthe desert of Kuwait--the Stars and Stripes led young Americans into \nbattle. Proud young soldiers would carry it high, and if they should \nfall another would be right there to pick up Old Glory and carry it \nforward. It may have been tattered by the battle and singed by fire of \nwar, but the American flag burned as a guiding beacon of hope and \nfreedom for our young men and women. For those who paid the ultimate \nprice for our nation, the Flag blanketed their journey and graced their \nfinal rest place.\n  You see, Mr. President, the Flag is not just a piece of cloth. The \n``broad stripes and bright stars'' shining through the ``rockets' red \nglare'' inspired Francis Scott Key to write the Star Spangled Banner. \nIt is a symbol so sacred to our nation that we teach our children not \nto let it touch the ground. It flies over our schools, our churches and \nsynagogues, our courts, our seats of government and homes across \nAmerica. The Pledge of Allegiance unites all Americans regardless of \nrace, creed or color. The flag is not just a symbol of America, it is \nAmerica.\n  Those who oppose this legislation say that it impinges on freedom of \nspeech and violates our Constitution. In my view this is a hollow \nargument. There are many limits placed on ``free speech,'' including \nlimiting yelling ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Other freedoms of \nspeech and expression are limited by our slander and libel laws.\n  In 1989 and 1990 the Supreme Court of this great nation struck down \nflag protection laws by narrow votes. The Court has an obligation to \nprotect and preserve our fundamental rights as citizens. However the \nAmerican people understand the difference between freedom of speech and \n``anything goes.''\n  When our citizens disagree with our national policy, there are a \nnumber of options available to them other than destroying the American \nFlag to make their point. Let them protest, let them write to their \nnewspaper, let them organize, let them march, let them shout to the \nrooftops--but we should not let them burn the Flag. Too many have died \ndefending the Flag for us to allow it to be used in any way that does \nnot honor their sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, in a day where too often we lament what has gone wrong \nwith America, it's time to make a stand for decency, for honor and for \npride in our nation. Just as the Flag has wrapped itself around the \nhearts and souls of our nation, let us now wrap the protection of our \nConstitution around the Flag.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S461-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, in conclusion, before I take the Senate out \nfollowing the statement of Senator Kennedy, I want to briefly comment \non some statements that have been made today and yesterday here and in \nother arenas and forums. There are those saying we should immediately \nbring up the ISTEA highway bill.\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\n  First, I want to remind the Senate that I urged the House and the \nSenate and interested parties to do this bill last year when it should \nhave been done, because it expired last year. That is No. 1. No. 2, \nbecause it was not an election year and I knew, if we waited until this \nyear, we would have less time and more pressure as we try to decide how \n$175 billion or more is fairly distributed across the country.\n  I remind the Senators of that, and they know now and they knew then \nthat I was right. I stood right here and filed not one, not two, not \nthree, but four cloture motions to try to bring to a conclusion \nunrelated debate and delays based on pure politics, if I may suggest, \nbut for an unrelated issue. I kept saying we need to deal with this \nbill, and others kept saying, ``Until you agree to what we want on an \nunrelated issue, we are not going to let you bring up ISTEA.''\n  That was a mistake. The Senate made a mistake. Now some of the same \npeople not voting to bring it up last year are saying, ``Where is it? \nPlease bring it up,'' demanding that it be brought up right away.\n  Well, the world is different now. A lot has happened. For one thing, \nwe find that we may actually have a little more money than we \nanticipated last year. There are very few Senators that have a longer \nhistory of having voted to spend the highway trust fund for the purpose \nit was intended--highways. There are very few places where I think the \nGovernment should be involved in spending money. Defense is one and \nbudding infrastructure is the other. This is a place where people can't \ndo it by themselves. The Government has to do its part.\n  So I want this. I want more money. But I also have a responsibility \nas majority leader to look at this from the standpoint of how does it \nrelate to the overall budget? How is it going to affect all these other \nprograms? And what we did last year--we stood out here in the rotunda \nand said that we had reached an agreement with the President of the \nUnited States on a balanced budget, on how to control taxes and how to \ncontrol spending. We entered into an agreement. We entered into an \nagreement in every category across the board. We said we will spend \nthis much on transportation, this much on education, this much on \nhousing, interior, energy, right across the board.\n  Now, if we open the year up by raising spending, without looking at \nhow it will affect everything else, we could break the dam and have \nanother avalanche of spending. I am not saying it will happen. I am not \nsaying how it should happen. I am just saying we should take our time \nand see what's going to happen before we charge forward. Why does the \nSenate need to do this when the House is not going to act? They are not \ngoing to act this month and not until at least the end of next month. I \ntried to get the Senate to show leadership and to lead and go first. \nThe Senate would not do it. Now, let's act in concert.\n  Let's work with the House. Let's do this together. Nobody wants to \nbring this up more than I do. But my responsibility as majority leader \nis to make sure that we have thought it through and know what the \nimpact will be on a budget agreement that we gave our word to the \nAmerican people on. I intend for us to keep it, and I will do \neverything I can to get that result.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S461-5", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

SATCHER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to express the \nappreciation of all of us to the majority leader for scheduling this \nnomination promptly in this session. I thank the majority leader for \nscheduling this Satcher nomination, and also for filing the cloture \nmotion.\n  We had an opportunity to make the presentation, and the excellent \npresentation by Senator Frist yesterday, which I thought was just so \ncompelling. There were those who took some issue with the record of Dr. \nSatcher. But I do believe that at the end of the day yesterday the \nmembership would be convinced of the quality of this extraordinary \nnominee and the incredible opportunity that all America has for his \nservice when he is confirmed, which I expect will be on Tuesday next.\n  So we look forward to the opportunity to vote and to hopefully see \nDr. Satcher in that important position.\n  In response to questions raised yesterday, I also am including a copy \nof a letter from Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National Institutes \nof Health, to Senator Ashcroft regarding studies of maternal-to-infant \ntransmission of HIV in developing countries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these materials be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, National \n           Institutes of Health,\n                                   Bethesda, MD, February 3, 1998.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: Your ``Dear Colleague'' letter \n     criticizing Dr. David Satcher's support for studies of \n     maternal-to-infant transmission of HIV in developing \n     countries has been brought to my attention. I am writing to \n     offer a different view of the situation from my perspective \n     as the Director of the National Institutes of Health, a \n     sister agency in the Department of Health and Human Services \n     that also conducts studies to prevent transmission of HIV in \n     the developing world.\n       Virtually all parties involved in this difficult issue \n     acknowledge that there are many factors to be considered in \n     determining whether to use a placebo-controlled group in a \n     clinical trial; several of these factors are discussed in an \n     attached article from the New England Journal of Medicine, \n     co-authored by Dr. Satcher and me a few months ago. For the \n     trials in question, the general design of the studies was \n     carefully considered by the World Health Organization and the \n     Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, and the specific \n     studies we support have been reviewed and approved by duly \n     constituted Institutional Review Boards in the United States \n     and in the countries in which the studies are being \n     performed.\n       The essential point is that the studies are designed to \n     provide information useful to the management of HIV infection \n     in the countries in which the studies are done; to act \n     otherwise and generate knowledge applicable only in wealthier \n     parts of the world would, in my opinion, be exploitative of \n     the subjects of the study. Viewed in this context, it is \n     entirely appropriate that we are supporting studies in the \n     developing world that would not be conducted in the United \n     States.\n       The article to which you allude in your ``Dear Colleague'' \n     letter, by Dr. Marcia Angell, the Deputy Editor of the New \n     England Journal of Medicine, presents a view that is not \n     generally accepted in the medical community. Indeed her views \n     have been strongly contested by many knowledgeable \n     physicians, scientists, and ethicists, including some members \n     of the Editorial Board of the Journal who have offered their \n     resignations in protest. (The enclosed essay by Dr. Satcher \n     and me was also written in response to Dr. Angell's article.)\n       Finally, I must take issue with the contention that the \n     current CDC- and NIH-supported trials are similar to the \n     infamous Tuskegee study. In that study, the course of a \n     disease (syphilis) was observed without attempts to \n     intervene, and informed consent was neither sought nor \n     obtained from the research subjects. In the current studies, \n     the goal is to find useful means to prevent transmission of \n     HIV, the studies are closely supervised by many knowledgeable \n     people, and informed consent has been obtained from each \n     enrolled individual. The analogy to Tuskegee is inappropriate \n     and distracting.\n       I appreciate that there are legitimate concerns about the \n     ethical conduct of clinical trials in developing countries, \n     but the debates need to be described in a fashion that gives \n     due consideration to the arguments on both sides. \n     Furthermore, Dr. Satcher's position on these trials should \n     not, in my opinion, constitute grounds for opposing his \n     nomination to be Surgeon-General of the United States. \n     Indeed, even Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, one of the \n     strongest critics of the position Dr. Satcher and I have \n     taken, is an ardent supporter of Dr. Satcher's nomination.\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\n       I offer these comments on your letter in hopes that they \n     will be useful to you and your colleagues in considering Dr. \n     Satcher's nomination to this important post.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Harold Varmus, M.D.,\n     Director, NIH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/05/senate-section/article/S462-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Byrd and others \nwho were speaking today in support of prompt action on an issue of \nmajor importance to the country--the ISTEA reauthorization that will \nset the country's course for the next six years on transportation \npolicy and investments.\n  I noticed the majority leader had indicated that there were some \ndifferences about the consideration of that proposal last year.\n  But the fact of the matter remains that when I look over what we are \ninvolved in outside of the Dr. Satcher nomination, it seems that we \ncertainly would have the opportunity for the consideration of the ISTEA \nreauthorization. And looking over the anticipated schedule, I would \nthink that we could deal with this, and deal with it appropriately, \ncertainly before the February recess. I don't know what else has been \nplaced on the schedule prior to that time next week. Certainly we would \nmake time for any kind of consideration or resolution on the issues of \nIraq. But barring that, it would seem to me that reauthorization could \nbe dealt with by that particular time.\n  This debate has major ramifications, not only for the Nation's \ntransportation system, but for the economy and the environment.\n  What Congress does with this legislation will, in many ways, define \nthe degree to which communities across the country will be able to take \nfull advantage of the possibilities for economic development and growth \nin the years ahead. Without a modern, safe and efficient transportation \nnetwork, America's businesses can't compete as efficiently, America's \ncities can't be revitalized as effectively, and America's families will \nlose valuable time in the daily struggle to move from home to work, and \ncarry out all the other responsibilities of daily life.\n  This legislation will also have a major impact on the environment, as \nwe debate what direction the law should take. A major goal is to \npreserve and strengthen the innovative intermodal approach established \nunder the original ISTEA, including special emphasis on public transit, \nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, bikeways and other \ninitiatives that enhance the quality of life in our communities.\n  I hope we will be able to build on the original ISTEA law, sustaining \nits innovative programs and laying the foundation for greater economic \ngrowth. To do that, we need to make a substantially larger investment \nthat will address the many urgent transportation needs facing the \ncountry, and also facing my own State of Massachusetts that has some \nvery special needs.\n  I commend Senator Byrd for his extraordinary leadership on all of \nthese vital infrastructure issues. The amendment he proposed last fall \nwill make a significant difference for all states, enabling us to meet \nall of the new challenges more effectively.\n  I think he makes a compelling case. Let the Senate make its \njudgments. Let the Senate decide. It is difficult to justify and say we \nare not going to let the Senate decide because we might have the votes \nfor a particular position, which is at least partly delaying the \nopportunity to consider the legislation.\n  We can't afford to have this important debate drag on into the months \nahead. The country's transportation needs are urgent and can't wait. We \nshould take up the ISTEA legislation and complete action on it \npromptly, to avoid paralysis in critical ongoing work involving \ntransportation construction, public transit operations, traffic safety \nprograms, and other issues that demand attention.\n  Mr. President, I may have more to say on this subject.
