Mr. President, I would like to just talk briefly about \ntwo\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nshort items today, the first of which is the Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation, which we hope the Senate will take up perhaps as early as \nthis week. Some suggest that there isn't a need for legislation to \nensure the quality of care provided by managed care plans. They \nbelieve, I suppose, as some insurance companies do, that things are \njust fine in managed care and health care in this country. But others, \nand that includes most of the American people, know better. They worry \nthat health care in this country is now often directed not by doctors \nor other medical professionals but by some accountant in an insurance \noffice 500 or 1,000 miles away from where the patient is.\n  Let me describe, as we have nearly every day for some weeks, a case \nthat illustrates why the American people are so anxious about what is \nhappening in our health care system. This is the example of Mr. Vaughn \nDashiell. Vaughn Dashiell is one more reason why HMO reform, or managed \ncare reform, in the form of the Patients' Bill of Rights, should be \nbrought before the Senate.\n  Vaughn lived with his wife, Patricia, and their three children in \nAlexandria, VA, not too far from the U.S. Capitol. He owned and \noperated his own printing company. On November 20, 1996, Vaughn stayed \nhome from work. He had awakened that morning sick, suffering from a \nsore throat, a dry mouth and tunnel vision that limited his sight to \nonly 18 inches. He tried to get an appointment to see a doctor within \nhis HMO network but was told there were no appointments available at \nhis designated facility. He was able to speak only to an HMO-employed \nnurse on duty over the phone. She could have told Vaughn to go to an \nemergency room for treatment, but instead she told him to make a \nregular appointment, even though none were available. So here is \nsomeone who has health care coverage, wakes up ill, calls the HMO, \ncan't speak to a doctor, instead speaks to a nurse, and the nurse says, \n``Make an appointment,'' but no appointments are available.\n  As Vaughn's symptoms worsened, he called his HMO again requesting \npermission to see a doctor somewhere, or to go to a nearby emergency \nroom for treatment. He was told only to wait and that he would receive \na call back from a doctor on duty. When the doctor on duty was \nconsulted, he agreed that Vaughn should go to an emergency room, but \nneither made a call himself, nor followed-up to see that Vaughn was \ncontacted. And that night Vaughn Dashiell was not contacted--not by the \nnurse, not by the doctor, or by any other HMO staff regarding his \ncondition and the request he had made for health care.\n  The next morning, Patricia Dashiell found her husband incoherent, \nwith his eyes rolling. She hurriedly called the HMO hoping for an \nanswer to Vaughn's problem, and they advised her to call 911. She \ncalled 911 and Vaughn arrived at the hospital at 9:18 a.m. in a \ndiabetic coma. His blood sugar level was more than 20 times greater \nthan the normal level. Just 2 hours after being rushed to the emergency \nroom, Vaughn was dead from hyperglycemia. He was 39 years old. He had \nhealth insurance coverage, but he couldn't get care when he needed it, \nand he died.\n  This should not happen in this country. Health insurers should not \nput profits ahead of patients. And too often these days, they do. \nVaughn Dashiell's condition would have and could have been treated if \nhis health plan had enabled him to get care when he needed it. But all \nover this country, we are hearing of patients who need health care and \nare told by those who have covered them with health insurance, ``It is \nnot now available.''\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights we have offered in the Senate is very \nsimple. This legislation says that people who have health insurance \ncoverage ought to get the health care they need when they have an \nurgent need for it. They ought to be able to seek emergency room care \nif a reasonable person would consider it an emergency. They ought to be \nable to see the doctor they need for the health care problem they are \nexperiencing. Patients have a right to know all of the options for the \ntreatment of their problem, not just the cheapest, and there are a \nwhole series of other provisions to ensure that medical care will be \npracticed in a doctor's office or a hospital room, not an insurance \noffice 1,000 miles away.\n  I have told, often, of the woman who, having fallen from a horse and \nhitting her head severely, was in an ambulance, with her brain \nswelling, on the way to the hospital. She had the presence of mind to \ntell the ambulance driver that she wanted to be driven to the hospital \nfurther away rather than to the nearby hospital. And when she \nrecovered, she was asked why she had insisted, as she was lying there \ninjured in the back of the ambulance with her brain swelling, on being \ntaken to the hospital further away. She said it was because she knew \nthe reputation of the closer hospital, and she knew that it was a for-\nprofit institution with a reputation for being interested in its profit \nand loss margin than its patients' care. She did not want her body \ndelivered to an emergency room where she would be looked at in terms of \ndollars and cents.\n  That story and the tragic story of Vaughn Dashiell and so many others \nlike it that we have presented to the Senate daily now for so many \nweeks, describes the anxiety and concern people have in this country. \nWe have the best health care in the world in many respects, but it is \navailable to people in need of health care only if they are able to \naccess the kind of doctors they need when they have need for that \nmedical specialty.\n  It is available only if they are able to get to an emergency room \nwhen they have need for emergency care. When we have American \ncitizens--thousands and thousand and thousands of them--who are denied \ncare because someone in an office 500 miles away said, ``Well, gee, \nthat care is not needed, it is not to be delivered, it is not \navailable,'' then the American people have a right to say, ``What on \nEarth kind of health care system is this?''\n  One of the stories we presented earlier on the floor of the Senate \nwas of a young boy with cerebral palsy whose managed care officials \ndetermined that he had only a 50 percent chance of being able to walk \nby age 5. And because he had only a 50 percent chance of being able to \nwalk by age 5, plan officials decided that was a minimal benefit and \nthey would withhold it from that young child; it was not cost \neffective. It was a minimal benefit to have a 50 percent chance of \nbeing able to walk when you are 5 years old.\n  Shame on the people who make those judgments. Shame on them.\n  We are saying with the Patients' Bill of Rights that those who need \nmedical treatment in this country have certain rights, and those who \ndeliver medical treatment certainly should be cost conscious, but cost \nought not take precedence over quality. Those who have coverage for \ntheir health care needs ought to be able to expect to get their needs \ntaken care of and responded to adequately. That is, regrettably, not \nthe case in many parts of our country today.\n  We are led to believe that perhaps this week we will take up some \nform of the Patients' Bill of Rights. If that happens, it will be the \nright subject to be debated. It is a subject Americans expect to be \naddressed. I, as a cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of Rights, feel, as \nwill many of my colleagues, that it is time for us to address this \nimportant issue on behalf of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8019-8", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8020-S8022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make some remarks on the subject \nof the farm crisis that exists in North Dakota and other parts of the \ncountry, and discuss some legislation a number of us intend to offer in \nthe coming days and weeks dealing with that issue.\n  As a way of describing that issue, the New York Times had a front-\npage story yesterday that talks about it. The article reports, ``As the \nnational economy is booming, lawmakers have begun to focus on one of \nthe few places in the country where times are bad--the northern plains \nwhere wheat and livestock prices have plunged and many farmers are \ndesperate.''\n  The story goes on to describe the condition in North Dakota and some \nother States where we have a serious agricultural crisis. Collapsing \nprofits in agriculture mean that we are seeing family farmers going out \nof business at a record pace.\n  Let me describe that with one chart for those who watch these \nproceedings. In my home State of North Dakota, net\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\nfarm income has dropped 98 percent in 1 year. That's right; a 98-\npercent drop in net farm income in 1 year.\n  Then ask yourself what this statistic means. Ask yourself what would \nbe the result for you, your neighbor, or your community, if you \nexperienced a 98-percent drop in net income? That is what the farmers \nof North Dakota are facing because of collapsed grain prices and the \nworst crop disease in a century. The primary crop disease they face is \ncalled scab, or fusarium head blight, and it has devastated wheat and \nbarley crops and some others. The combination of crop disease and a \ncollapsed grain price has produced a farm crisis that is very, very \nserious and to which this Congress must respond.\n  In the same New York Times article, it says some who wrote the \ncurrent farm bill two years ago--which I did not support and voted \nagainst it--say that a free-market agricultural policy is the best. It \nquotes the authors of the farm bill as saying ``Farmers can best be \nhelped by people staying out of their hair and promoting export \nmarkets.''\n  I want to describe part of the problem that farmers face with this \nkind of free-trade philosophy. There really isn't free trade for \nfarmers. There isn't a free market for farmers. On both ends, they are \npinched badly and hurt badly. On one end where they are trying to sell \ntheir product, they are trying to sell up through the neck of a bottle. \nThe iron fist around the neck is the grain trade firms, the millers, \nthe railroads where three, four, or five firms control virtually all of \nit and they squeeze back down resulting in increased costs for farmers \nand depressed farm prices. So there is no free market moving up.\n\n  How about on the back side of it all? Is there a free market in \ntrade? No; through our backdoor comes a flood of Canadian grain which \nis unfairly subsidized in my judgment, and undercuts our farmers and \ntheir prices.\n  While that happens every day, I want to read another news story. It \nsays: ``Official's Beanie Babies Stir Furor.'' I don't know what page \nthis was on in the paper. It was a fairly large story about Beanie \nBabies--Beanie Babies, mind you. No offense to people who collect them \nand like them, but I have not spent a nanosecond of my life thinking \nabout Beanie Babies.\n  This story is about the U.S. Trade Ambassador who came home from \nChina and apparently had purchased some Beanie Babies in China. She \ndiscovered, I guess to her embarrassment, that you can't bring 40 \nBeanie Babies into this country from China. The Beanie Babies are made \nin China for an American firm. They make the Beanie Babies in China, \nand then they ship the Beanie Babies back to the United States for sale \nin the United States. But you can't buy 40 Beanie Babies in China and \nhaul them back here. Apparently, visitors are restricted to one Beanie \nBaby from China to the United States. I am told also you are restricted \nto one Beanie Baby from Canada to the United States.\n  Those of us who live up near the Canadian border see a lot of things \ncoming in from Canada. I went up to the Canadian border one day with \nEarl Jensen of Bowbells, ND. We had a little 2-ton orange 10-year-old \ntruck. We tried to take a few bushels of durum wheat into Canada. All \nthe way up to the border, we met 18-wheelers coming from Canada to the \nUnited States full of Canadian wheat. We saw truck after truck after \ntruck after truck, all full of wheat, all the way to the border.\n  Earl and I got to the border with this little 10-year-old orange \ntruck. Do you think we could get one quarter-truckload of durum into \nCanada? They said: No, you can't do that. You can flood the market in \nthe United States with Canadian grain, but you can't get one little \norange truckload of durum wheat into Canada.\n  When it comes to restricting imports to the United States, we say one \nBeanie Baby. Boy, we're tough on Beanie Babies. And if you exceed one \nBeanie Baby, you're apparently in huge trouble. But you can ship all \nthe durum wheat, all the spring wheat and barley you want, and nobody \nis going to pay any mind at all. Nobody is going to care. In fact, if \nthey unfairly subsidize it, as I am convinced they are doing, it still \ndoesn't seem to matter. When we send auditors up to Canada to get into \nthe books and records of the Canadian Wheat Board to check it out, the \nCanadian Wheat Board says, ``Go fly a kite, we don't intend to show you \nany information; we intend to give you no records about our trade into \nthe United States.''\n  I say to those quoted in the New York Times and those in this Chamber \nwho say, ``Gee, what we should do is rely on this free-market stuff,'' \nthat there is no free market. There is no free market on either end, \nnot the top end through which farmers market their products and not the \nback end through which they are facing unfair competition coming into \nthis country with unfairly subsidized grain.\n  We have farmers going broke in record numbers. We face a very serious \nfarm crisis. A new farm bill was written 2 years ago. When that farm \nbill was written, it was written by folks who said, ``Let's have the \nfarmers operate in whatever the free-market system is.'' Some of us \nsaid the problem is, there isn't a free market and if farmers run into \nprice collapse, we are in a situation where they will not be able to \nget over that pricing valley. When they hit a price collapse, there \nneeds to be a bridge over that price valley. If you don't help family \nfarmers over that valley, then they go broke.\n  Some people say, ``That's okay, it doesn't matter, we don't care if \nwe have family farmers.'' I suppose some people don't. They don't care \nif we end up with big farms, agrifactories, farming from the west coast \nto the east coast. Does it matter? It seems to me it matters.\n  For those who haven't been on a farm, if you look out the plane at \nnight and you see the yard lights dotting the landscape, each of those \nlights is a family living on a family farm.\n  These family farmers take more risks than almost anyone else in this \ncountry doing business. They risk whether they will get a crop. They \nput all their money in their crop, including the cost of seed and \nfertilizer, as they plant their fields in the spring. They have no idea \nwhether there will be a dozen or more weather-related events that might \ndestroy their crop. There is the threat of insects, the threat of hail, \nthe threat of drought, the threat of too much moisture, among other \nthings. Yet, if they are fortunate enough to get a crop, they might \nwell end up seeing the market as it exists today with collapsed prices.\n  And they are facing big interests that clap about that. They say, \n``Gee, that's great. We love collapsed prices.'' The big grain millers, \nthey think that is just fine. Only four firms control almost sixty \npercent of the flour milling in this country. I suppose the grocery \nmanufacturers think that is just fine, because they seem to love low \nfarm prices.\n  The problem is family farmers can't survive. They are the seed bed of \nAmerican enterprise and the home of family values that have always \nnurtured and flowed from family farms to small towns and into big \ncities. It is these family farmers, who are the ones that we lose.\n  This is not just about dollars and cents. It is about something much \nmore important to this country's future than just dollars and cents. \nAnd that is why during this week, next week and beyond, we feel the \nneed and the urgency to propose some changes here on the floor of the \nSenate. We must deal with farm policy in a way that addresses the issue \nof trade, in a way that addresses the issue of the misplaced priorities \nwithin a system that worries about Beanie Babies on the same day that \nnobody seems to care much about family farmers.\n  We think there are some things that can be done to extend a helping \nhand to family farmers, and to say, that they matter in this country's \nfuture. When we offer legislation on the floor of the Senate, I expect \nthere will be those who say, as they did 2 weeks ago, that the current \nfarm bill is working just fine. I dearly wish we could give them a deed \nthis afternoon and say, ``Here. You think it's working fine? Here is \nyour farm. We'll give you 1,000 acres. Buy some fuel and fertilizers \nand seed, and farm until you go broke. When you go broke--and you \nwill--you come back and tell us how well your farm policy works.'' I \njust wish we could do that. But, of course, there is not time because \nthis crisis requires action on a much more immediate basis.\n  Mr. President, we expect to have a substantial debate about that in \nthe coming days. I hope that Republicans\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nand Democrats will understand the merit, the value, and the worth of \nfamily farming in this country's future. I hope that we will decide to \nembark upon a farm policy that says to family farmers that when prices \ncollapse and when you are ravaged by the worst crop disease of the \ncentury, we want to help you over those price valleys. We want you to \nbe a part of this country's future.\n  We need a farm policy that tells family farmers that they matter from \nthe standpoint of social and economic policy. Here we are in a country \nthat produces the most wholesome quality food at the lowest percent of \ndisposable income of anywhere in the world. Family farmers do matter in \nthis country's future. I hope that will be the result of the debate we \nhave here in the next month or two in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Brian Day, one \nof my law clerks, have floor privileges during the pendency of the \nproperty rights debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the people of Utah, and indeed, of all of \nour States, have felt the heavy hand of the government erode their \nright to hold and enjoy private property. I have authored and \ncosponsored many bills in the past that would protect private property \nfrom the jaws of the regulatory state.\n\n  Our opponents on the left and the radical, so-called environmental \ngroups, however, have been successful so-far in derailing the \nconsideration of more needed reform measures. But I believe we have the \nopportunity to pass a narrower yet meaningful piece of legislation. The \nsubstitute we are considering today, S. 2271, the ``Property Rights \nImplementation Act,'' narrows H.R. 1534, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives on October 23, 1997, by a 248 to 178 vote. After the \nHouse passed bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee, we met with \nlocal, environmental, and governmental groups in an effort to meet \ntheir concerns. The product of those meetings is the S. 2271 \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will allow us to proceed to \nconsideration of this bill. How can we work to further improve this \nbill if your colleagues will not let us proceed to vote. This is a \nworthwhile bill that resolves many problems. I call on my colleagues to \nvote for cloture so that we may address those problems on the merits.\n  The purpose of S. 2271, is, at its root, primarily one of fostering \nfundamental fairness and simple justice for the many millions of \nAmericans who possess or own property. Many citizens who attempt to \nprotect their property rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the \nConstitution are barred from the doors of the federal courthouse.\n  In situations where other than Fifth Amendment property rights are \nsought to be enforced--such as First Amendment rights, for example--\naggrieved parties generally file in a single federal forum without \nhaving to exhaust state and local procedures. This is not the case for \nproperty owners.\n  Often they must exhaust all state remedies with the result that they \nmay have to wait for over a decade before their rights are allowed to \nbe vindicated in federal court--if they get there at all. Moreover, the \nfederal jurisdiction over property rights claims against federal \nagencies and Executive Branch Departments is in a muddle. In these \ntypes of cases, property owners face onerous procedural hurdles unique \nin federal litigation.\n  The Property Rights Implementation Act, if we are allowed to even \nconsider it, primarily addresses the problem of providing property \nowners fair access to federal courts to vindicate their federal \nconstitutional rights. The bill is thus merely procedural and does not \ncreate new substantive rights.\n  Consequently, the bill has two purposes. The first is to provide \nprivate property owners claiming a violation of the Fifth Amendment's \ntaking clause some certainty as to when they may file the claim in \nfederal court. This is accomplished by addressing the procedural \nhurdles of the ripeness and abstention doctrines which currently \nprevent them from having fair and equal access to federal court. S. \n2271 defines when a final agency decision has occurred for purposes of \nmeeting the ripeness requirement and prohibits a federal judge from \nabstaining from or relinquishing jurisdiction when the case does not \nallege any violation of a state law, right, or privilege. Thus, S. 2271 \nserves as a vehicle for overcoming federal judicial reluctance to \nreview takings claims based on the ripeness and abstention doctrines.\n  The second purpose of the bill is to clarify the jurisdiction between \nthe Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., and the regional \nfederal district courts over federal Fifth Amendment takings claims. \nThe Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims exclusive \njurisdiction over takings claims seeking compensation. Thus, property \nowners seeking equitable relief must file in the appropriate federal \ndistrict court.\n  This division between law and equity is archaic and results in \nburdensome delays as property owners who seek both types of relief are \n``shuffled'' from one court to the other to determine which court is \nthe proper forum for review. S. 2271 resolves this matter by simply \ngiving both courts concurrent jurisdiction over takings claims, thus \nallowing both legal and equitable relief to be granted in a single \nforum. I will address this conundrum of the ``Tucker Act shuffle'' in \nmore detail in a later speech.\n\n\n                         I. how the bill works\n\n  Let me briefly explain how the procedural aspects of the bill, \ndesigned to assure fairness, work. One of the hurdles property owners \nface when trying to have their Federal claim heard on the merits is the \ndoctrine of abstention. Federal courts routinely abstain their \njurisdiction and refer the case to state court, even if there is no \nState or local claim alleged. This is true only for property rights \ncases.\n  The bill would clarify that a Federal court shall not abstain its \njurisdiction if only Federal claims are alleged. To protect State's \nrights, the bill allows an unsettled question of State law that arises \nin the course of the Federal claim to be certified in the highest \nappellate court of that State, under whatever certification procedures \nexist in that State. Federal courts would retain their jurisdiction, \nbut the unsettled State law question would be answered in State, not \nFederal court. In\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nthe few States where no certification procedures exist, property owners \nwould be unable to benefit from that expedited procedure.\n  The second hurdle the bill would resolve is the problem of \n``ripeness''. Current law requires a property owner to get a ``final \ndecision'' from the land use agency to which he or she has applied \nbefore their Federal claim can be heard in Federal court. S. 2271 \nsimply provides an objective definition of a ``final decision'' so that \nboth parties in a land use dispute will know when ``enough is enough.'' \nThe bill outlines the steps a property owner must take to resolve a \ndispute at the local level before a final decision by the agency in \nquestion has been reached.\n  The process clarified by the bill protects both States rights and the \nindividual rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. Before a land use \ndecision is defined as ``final'': A property owner must make a \nmeaningful application for a land use to the agency. If the application \nis denied, the property owner must make an appeal or seek a waiver of \nthe denial. If rejected a second time, a final decision has been \nreached unless there is an elected local body with the authority to \nreview land use appeals. In that case the property owner must submit \nanother application and be denied a third time before a decision is \ndefined as final.\n  The bill provides yet another layer of local decision making. In \nrejecting the property owners land use application, the agency may \nchose to provide a written explanation for the denial and explain the \nuses, density, and intensity of development that would be permitted on \nthe property in question. If such an explanation is provided, the \ndecision will not be considered final until the property owner \nresubmits a new application taking into account the conditions of the \noriginal denial. If the property owner is again rejected, and rejected \non appeal, the decision is considered final.\n  In all instances, the property owner is exempted from making an \nappeal or seeking a waiver if no such appeal or waiver exists, or if \ndoing so would be futile. The concept of ``futility'' is established in \nexisting case law. The purpose of this exemption is to ensure that \nproperty owners are not trapped in a futile situation where time and \nmoney is wasted seeking such relief where the prospect is virtually \nnonexistent.\n  In short, the bill is very simple and protects the rights of \nlocalities by requiring that property owners comply with local \nprocedures before they seek relief in Federal court.\n\n\n           II. the Need for Legislation--the ripeness problem\n\n  Mr. President, let me amplify why this legislation is desperately \nneeded. The first part of the bill deals with the ripeness doctrine, a \ndoctrine which has been misused in a manner that prevents property \nowners from vindicating what, after all, is a Federal right in Federal \ncourt.\n  Let me begin by reminding my colleagues that the Fifth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution protects individuals from having their \nprivate property ``taken'' by the Government without receiving just \ncompensation. A complex body of law has developed from the Takings \nClause of the Fifth Amendment and is used by Federal courts to \ndetermine whether a ``taking'' has occurred.\n  In conjunction with this complex body of takings law, an equally \ncomplex set of procedural doctrines has also developed for use by \nFederal courts to determine whether the core substantive issues \ninvolved in the takings claim are ready to be heard. These procedural \ndoctrines are known as the doctrines of ``ripeness'' and, I might \nadd, ``abstention.''\n\n  Under current case law, a takings claim must be ``ripe'' in order to \nbe heard in Federal court. In a key decision entitled Williamson County \nPlanning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), \nthe Supreme Court attempted to clarify the principles of the ripeness \ndoctrine.\n  The Court stated that a takings claimant must show: (1) that there \nhas been issued a ``final decision regarding the application of the \nregulations to the property at issue'' from ``the government entity \ncharged with implementing the regulations,'' and (2) that the claimant \nrequested ``compensation through the procedures the State has provided \nfor doing so.'' [Id. at 194.] A takings plaintiff must meet both \nrequirements before the case will be considered ripe for federal \nadjudication; if either has not been met, then the claimant will be \nprocedurally barred from bringing such a claim in Federal court.\n  Unfortunately, the lower court decisions which subsequently have \nattempted to apply the ripeness principles set forth in Williamson \nCounty have only served to create much confusion over when a claim \nbecomes ripe. Property owners have been left with no clear \nunderstanding of how many proposals or applications must be submitted \nbefore their takings claim would be considered ripe.\n  For example, in Southview Assocs. v. Bongartz, 980 F.2d 84, 92 (2d \nCir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 987 (1993), the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit decided a takings claim was not ripe \nbecause the landowner ``did not attempt to modify the location of the \nunits or otherwise seek to revise its application.'' The court failed \nto decide how many reapplications would be necessary to reach the \nmerits.\n  In Schulze v. Milne, 849 F.Supp. 708 (N.D. Cal. 1994), aff'd in part, \nrev'd in part on other grounds, 98 F.3d 1346 (9th Cir. 1996), property \nowners submitted a total of thirteen (13) revised plans over three \nyears to renovate their home. Each time they submitted a plan ``in \ncompliance with all applicable zoning laws,'' local officials \nnonetheless ``refused to approve the plan, and instead informed \nplaintiffs that there were additional requirements, not found in any \nzoning or other statutes, which plaintiffs had yet to meet.'' [ Id., \n849 F.Supp. at 709.] This is happening in many areas around the \ncountry.\n  These examples poignantly illustrate the current confusion concerning \nwhen a claim becomes ripe. The current state of disarray that Federal \njudges and private landowners alike find themselves in can be fixed by \nthe establishment of a set of objective criteria so that all parties \nwill be able to easily discern when a government land use decision is \nfinal. This bill will bring that confusion to an end by clearly \ndefining when a Federal takings claim becomes ripe for adjudication and \nhow many final decisions are required before the claim may proceed in \nFederal court.\n  Additionally, much confusion has existed over the second prong of \nWilliamson County: namely, the requirement that a property owner must \nexhaust all compensation remedies available under State law. This prong \nacts to prevent Federal courts from reaching a final decision until the \nState court definitively rules that it will not entertain a \ncompensation remedy.\n  This problem is exemplified in Santa Fe Village Venture v. City of \nAlbuquerque, 914 F.Supp. 478 (D.N.M. 1995). There, the local city \ncouncil established a building moratorium to preclude any development \non lands near a national monument site. Plaintiff had an option to \npurchase land within areas subject to the moratorium, but never \nexercised that option because of the total land use restriction. \nRather, plaintiff filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court seeking \njust compensation from the local government for its inability to \ndevelop the property.\n  The first suit was dismissed on ripeness grounds because the property \nowner never sought a compensation remedy in State court. In other \nwords, exhausting State compensation procedures was necessary to make a \nFederal claim ripe for resolution. The property owner then filed a \nsecond action for inverse condemnation in State court. This case was \nalso dismissed--this time for lack of standing. Plaintiff returned to \nFederal court raising only Federal claims but had its case dismissed \nagain on ripeness grounds because the Federal claims were not raised in \nState court despite the State court's previous adjudications. These \ntype of situations will be resolved by the bill by remedying the \nconfusion of the State exhaustion requirement.\n  As you can see in these Federal land use cases from 1983 to 1988, the \nred part of this, 94.4 percent, is where judges failed to reach the \nmerits of the case--in other words, had ripeness problems--and the 5.6 \npercent of cases were decided on the merits, where they found that they \nwere ripe. As you can see, the owners of property are just not being \ntreated fairly and this is a constitutional privilege provided for in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nfifth amendment of the Constitution, so this is wrong.\n  Let me just note, this is a recent study prepared by the law firm of \nLinowes and Blocher of Silver Spring, MD, and incorporated into the \nRecord for this bill.\n  Over 80 percent of the takings cases originating in U.S. district \ncourts between 1990 and 1997, as shown on this chart, were dismissed \nbefore the merits were ever reached due, again, to the ripeness \ndoctrine.\n  The 81 percent in red is where judges failed to reach the merits of \nthe case because of ripeness problems, and the green is decided on the \nmerits. In those cases where they were decided, they averaged 7 years \nof total litigation. So you can imagine how the rights are not being \nprotected.\n  Many of these dismissals were tantamount to the termination of the \nclaim because the landowner lacked the adequate financial resources to \nform an appeal. For those landowners who could afford the high expenses \nof an appeal, the survey showed that more than half of the takings \nclaims were still dismissed.\n  The red is where judges failed to reach the merits of the case, \nagain, due to ripeness problems. The green is cases, between 1990 and \n1997, decided on the merits, and they averaged 9.5 years of litigation.\n  Just think about that. For those landowners who could afford the high \nexpenses of an appeal, the survey showed that more than half of the \ntakings claims were still dismissed. Of those appellate cases that did \nnot pass the ripeness test, 60 percent were remanded for more \nlitigation on the merits. These results underscored the need for this \nlegislation.\n  Further adding to the problem, a Federal court may also abstain from \nhearing a takings case under the judicially created doctrine of \n``abstention.'' This doctrine allows Federal judges to exercise \ndiscretion in deciding whether or not to accept cases that are properly \nunder the Federal court's, in this case, jurisdiction. Federal courts \nare reluctant naturally to adjudicate State political and judicial \ncontroversies, so a Federal court will usually abstain anytime that a \nclaim presents a Federal question that would not need to be resolved if \nan underlying challenged State action of an unsettled State law issue \nwere determined. This is underscored by the Supreme Court case of \nRailroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941). \nFederal courts also abstain from hearing cases which touch on sensitive \nState regulatory issues which are best left to the state courts. \nBurford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), is an example of this \nsituation.\n\n  Additionally, federal judges often use the abstention doctrines to \nrefer takings cases back to state courts before reaching the merits of \nthe Fifth Amendment claims. This bill remedies the current abuse of \nabstention by requiring that Federal courts adjudicate the merits of an \naggrieved property owner's claims where those claims are solely based \non federal law. On the contrary, if a property owner also raises claims \ninvolving state constitutional, statutory or common law claims pendent \nto the federal claims, then the property owner may not use this bill \nand the federal court may properly abstain in that type of situation.\n  I have to emphasize that control over land use lies and will remain \nin the hands of local entities. Private property owners must submit a \nland use proposal to the local agency for approval which, for many \napplicants, is the beginning of a negotiation process regarding the \npermitted land uses. This process, however, can take years for property \nowners who are left in regulatory limbo due to the local entities' \nfailure to make a final decision as to what land use is permitted. \nConsequently, property owners are not able to use or develop their land \nand are effectively denied their fifth amendment rights.\n  While this result could be construed as a fifth amendment taking, I \nmust point out that the applicant is, for all practical purposes, \nunable to file a claim in Federal court to enforce these constitutional \nguarantees because local land use authorities do not want to be sued in \nFederal court and can abuse the system by purposely withholding a final \nagency decision. To further frustrate the problem, the federal court \ndecisions interpreting the Supreme Court's ``ripeness'' definition are \nconflicting and confusing, providing little guidance to property owners \nas to when a case is ``ripe'' for federal adjudication.\n  Moreover, Federal judges are often reluctant to get involved in land \nuse issues. Instead, they usually dismiss takings cases back to state \ncourt based on the abstention doctrines or the lack of ripeness. \nUnfortunately, the overwhelming majority of property owners do not have \nthe time and money necessary to pursue their case through the state \ncourt and then re-file it in Federal court. The extensive use of the \nabstention doctrines by the Federal courts to avoid land use cases, \neven ones involving only a Federal claim, has created a blockade \ndenying aggrieved land owners access to the Federal court system.\n  This problem is exemplified by the situation presented in Suitum v. \nTahoe Regional Planning Agency, 80 F.3d 359 (9th Cir. 1996), vacated \nand remanded, 117 S.Ct. 1659 (1997). Bernadine Suitum, a retiree, was \nbarred from building on her land by a regional planning agency. For \nseven years, the Federal courts steadfastly refused to consider whether \na taking of her property by the government had occurred until the U.S. \nSupreme Court ruled in an unanimous decision that she will have the \nright to argue her case in Federal court. This elderly woman's plight \nhas resulted in years of expensive litigation just to have the \nopportunity to present the merits of her case to a Federal judge. \nUnfortunately, this situation is far from rare for many takings \nclaimants.\n  Another procedural tool that has been used to construct a barrier to \nproperty owners seeking remedies in Federal court has been the use of \nthe doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel by Federal \njudges. Res judicata, also known as claim preclusion, acts as a bar to \nfurther claims brought by a party on the same claim where a final \njudgment on the merits has already been reached. Claim preclusion \nprevents parties from relitigating claims that were already raised or \ncould have been raised in an earlier lawsuit. Similarly, collateral \nestoppel, also known as issue preclusion, prevents a plaintiff from \nrelitigating issues that were already decided by a state court.\n  Consequently, a Federal court could preclude a property owner from \nbringing an otherwise ripe claim in Federal court because a final \ndetermination had already been reached in a State court proceeding. \nThat is, a strict adherence to the Williamson County prongs could prove \ntantamount to the nails in the coffin box of the property owner's ripe \ntakings claim. Nevertheless, by removing the state exhaustion \nrequirement from the ripeness landscape, this bill effectively solves \nall res judicata and collateral estoppel problems.\n  Interestingly, claimants alleging violations of other fundamental \nrights do not encounter these same procedural barriers when attempting \nto bring meritorious actions in Federal court. In those situations, \nripeness, abstention, and res judicata are often inapplicable.\n  This places fifth amendment claimants in an inferior position to \ntheir first amendment counterparts. But, the Supreme Court has \nexpressly stated that the fifth amendment is ``as much a part of the \nBill of Rights as the first amendment or the fourth amendment.\n  Look what the Court said in Dolan v. City of Tigard:\n\n       We see no reason why the takings clause of the fifth \n     amendment, as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the first \n     amendment or fourth amendment, should be relegated to the \n     status of a poor relation . . .\n\n  The Court, I hope, means what it says.\n  In any event, I certainly concur. The rights of the fifth amendment \nshould not be inferior to the rights of the first amendment or to any \nother fundamental guarantee contained in the Bill of Rights.\n  This bill seeks to address these procedural blockades and offer \nproperty owners more certainty as to the Federal adjudicatory process \ngoverning takings claims. More specifically, the bill accomplishes this \nby defining when a final agency decision takes place and prohibiting \nFederal judges from invoking the abstention doctrine to avoid cases \nthat involve only fifth amendment takings claims.\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\n  In other words, this bill does not impugn or prevail upon any State \nrights. It only is triggered when we have fifth amendment \nconstitutional rights invoked.\n  Additionally, S. 2271 maintains the traditional interpretations of \nthe abstention doctrine which keep the federal courts free from being \nthrust into controversies surrounding state and local issues by \nlimiting its scope only to actions involving federal claims. As the \nproposed language indicates, usage of this Act by a claimant is \noptional.\n  That is, the bill allows a claimant the opportunity to bring a claim \nin Federal court if she so chooses, but does not mandate such an avenue \nof jurisdiction. S. 2271 simply allows every citizen her right to bring \na Federal takings claim into Federal court to be decided on the merits. \nIt is important to note that if a claimant brings a takings claim that \nis joined to other State claims, a Federal court would be able to \nabstain: for example, a takings claim accompanied by a State \nconstitutional claim, a claim of ultra vires conduct, or abuse of \ndiscretion would not be able to reach the merits in Federal court \nwithout a State court first deciding the merits of the State claims.\n  Let me refute the critics and assert that S. 2271 accomplishes its \ngoals in a manner that will not crowd the Federal dockets. Under the \nprovisions of this bill, a claimant is required to obtain as few as \nthree and as many as five decisions by local entities before that \nclaimant's claim will be ripe for review by a federal court. Thus, the \nclaimant must spend adequate time pleading her case before the local \nauthorities and must obtain the necessary denials from them; until she \nsatisfies these prerequisites, her claim will be barred from the \nFederal courts.\n  Some have argued that the second prong of Williamson County mandates \nas a matter of constitutional law that property owners exhaust State \ncompensation remedies before seeking federal court redress. This \nconclusion is buttressed by their claim that a taking does not occur on \na State or local level until the State or locality has had the \nopportunity to afford compensation to the property owner.\n  I disagree with both these contentions. First, Williamson County was \ndecided before the remedy for a Federal taking was clarified. It is, \nindeed, outdated. When Williamson County was decided in 1985, the Court \nviewed the remedy for takings to be invalidation of the offending \nstatute or rule. In other words, compensation was not considered the \nremedy for a taking under the U.S. Constitution. That changed in 1987, \nwith First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of \nLos Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), where the Supreme Court finally held \nthat the Federal remedy for a taking is compensation. Now that this \nFederal remedy has been clarified, there is no reason to compel a \ncitizen to litigate State court remedies in State court first.\n  Second, and consequently, the second prong of Williamson County is \nnow merely prudential in nature. This conclusion is buttressed by the \nSupreme Court's most recent takings and ripeness decision, where the \nCourt described Williamson County's requirements as ``two independent \nprudential hurdles * * *.'' Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, \nthe 1997 case I cited before, makes that case, 117 S. Ct. 1659, 1666 \n(1997). In other words, the requirement of exhaustion of State or local \ncompensation procedures is a court-created barrier which Congress may \nalter. Simply put, initial State court litigation is not compelled by \nthe Constitution.\n  Third, the Williamson County second prong is only dicta, and, \ntherefore, not binding authority. The main issue in Williamson County \nconcerned the first element of ripeness, that is, whether the land use \nagency rendered a ``final decision.'' The ensuing discussion on \ncompensation ripeness was neither essential nor necessary to support \nthe decision. Thus, it was mere dicta.\n  Fourth, the text of the Takings Clause does not require that property \nowners must exhaust State or local compensation procedures. The \ndrafters and ratifiers of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the \nFederal Constitution did not intend such a result: The text of the \ntakings clause states: ``[N]or shall private property be taken for \npublic use, without just compensation.'' Those are words right out of \nour beloved constitution.\n  Thus, the fifth amendment clearly creates a Federal remedy for a \ntaking. There is no basis to believe that the drafters and ratifiers \nintended State court litigation as a prerequisite to vindicate that \nFederal remedy. State court litigation puts the cart before the horse: \nCompensation is simply a computation of the amount owed for a taking. \nIt makes no sense to sue in State court first, until liability for the \nFederal taking has been determined.\n  Fifth, preclusion doctrines, as mentioned above, bar any Federal \ntakings suit in Federal court if a plaintiff must sue in State court \nfirst. A property owner in this circumstance would never get to Federal \ncourt to vindicate the property owner's rights. It is doubtful that \nthis was the intent of the drafters and ratifiers who promulgated and \nadopted Federal rights amendments and established the Federal forums to \nprotect them. Yet being barred from the Federal courthouse is exactly \nwhat happened in Dodd v. Hood River, in 1998, 136 F.3d 1219 (9th Cir. \n1998). That is a ninth circuit court case.\n  The minority views accompanying H.R. 1534, the bill voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee, completely misstates the Dodd case. Dodd stands \nfor the reverse of what the minority views represent. The minority \nclaims that, one, ``most federal appeals courts allow claimants to \n`reserve' federal constitutional claims so that the federal courts may \naddress those claims once the state court litigation has ended.'' This \nis not true. This can be seen from what happened in the various Dodd \ncases.\n  After being allowed to reserve their Federal takings claim in Dodd IV \n[(59 F. 3d at 862)], the Dodds were denied the right in Dodd V to raise \nit in Federal court under the ``issue preclusion'' doctrine of \ncollateral estoppel. [See Dodd V, 136 F.3d at 1227 (9th Cir. 1998).]\n  The same thing happened to a takings claimant in Wilkinson v. Pitkin \nCounty Bd. of County Comm'rs, a tenth circuit case in 1998, where the \ncourt concluded that ``the Williamson ripeness requirement is \ninsufficient to preclude application of res judicata and collateral \nestoppel principles in this case.'' Moreover, in a candid footnote, the \ncourt acknowledged:\n\n       We do note our concern that Williamson's ripeness \n     requirement may, in actuality, almost always result in \n     preclusion of federal claims, regardless of whether a \n     reservation is permitted. It is difficult to reconcile the \n     ripeness requirement of Williamson with the laws of res \n     judicata and collateral estoppel.\n\n  Contrary to the minority's misrepresentation of the law, Dodd and \nWilkinson confirm that, without the referenced remedial legislation, \ncitizens bringing fifth amendment takings claims in Federal court are \nin a Catch-22 situation. They must first go to state court, but when \nthey do, they are barred from ever litigating their claim in Federal \ncourt. Meanwhile, municipal defendants in such cases are free to seek \nremoval of the case from State to Federal court. This removal procedure \nwas upheld recently by the Supreme Court in City of Chicago v. \nInternational College of Surgeons.\n  I must observe that other constitutional rights hinge on State or \nlocal issues, but do not require initial State litigation. Many \nprovisions in the Bill of Rights also hinge on the resolution of issues \nconcerning State or local law. There are no similar ripeness barriers \nrequiring citizens to go to State court first to address the \nconstitutionality of Government actions that infringe upon the speech, \nreligion, or privacy rights protected in the Constitution.\n  Furthermore, the Supreme Court in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan \nCATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 437, n. 15 (1982), held that takings could \noccur regardless of whether the property has increased in value. In \nthis case the Court found a taking where cable was laid pursuant to a \nNew York statute, which undoubtedly increased the value of the \nbuilding. The Supreme Court found a taking and remanded the \ncompensation issue to the lower court.\n  I believe that this holding is contrary to the position of the bill's \ncritics that takings analysis require, as a matter of law, that \ncompensation be determined before a governmental action can be \nconsidered an unconstitutional taking. Under Loretto, a court could \nfind that there has been a taking--a significant interference with \nproperty rights--yet\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\naward no compensation. It is still considered an unconstitutional \ntaking. Consequently, the compensation requirement of the Takings \nClause is merely a remedy that may or may not be awarded in a state or \nfederal court, depending on the fairness of the situation.\n  Buttressing this conclusion is the recent Supreme Court decision in \nPhillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, No. 96-1578 (June 15, 1998). \nIn Phillips, the Court held that interest accruing from interest \nbearing lawyers trust accounts, that is, Interest On Lawyers Trust \nAccounts, or IOLTAs, as they call it, that that is property within the \nmeaning of the fifth amendment. Although the Court left open whether \nthe adequacy of compensation must be determined before a constitutional \ntaking is considered to occur, [Phillips slip op. at 7, n.4], it is \ninteresting to note that as a practical matter the Court first \ndetermined whether there was a property interest and, thereafter, \nremanded the case to determine whether there was a taking, and if so, \nthe amount of just compensation to be paid for such taking.\n  The Court in effect applied a three-part test: (1) whether a property \ninterest exists; (2) whether the property interest has been \nsignificantly interfered with; and (3) if a property interest has been \ntaken, the determination of just compensation. The Committee believes \nthat this approach belies the argument that a federal court cannot hear \ntakings claims before a state determines compensation. Indeed, this was \nthe position of the dissent, who argued that the issue of compensation \nis not separate and distinct from the issue of disposition and use of \nproperty. [Phillips, slip op. at 4 (Souter, J., dissenting).]\n  Furthermore, in Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, No. 97-42 (U.S. June \n25, 1998), decided on the next to last day of the 1997-1998 Supreme \nCourt term, the Court faced the issue of whether the Coal Industry \nRetiree Health Benefit Act--called the ``Coal Act''--which established \na mechanism to fund health care for retirees, could be applied \nretroactively to a company that no longer mined coal and had withdrawn \nfrom the Coal Act funding scheme pursuant to terms of a prior \nnegotiated agreement.\n  Four Justices, Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Scalia, \nand Thomas, held that the application of the Coal Act violated the \nTakings Clause of the fifth amendment. [Eastern Enterprises, slip op. \nat 1-37 (Plurality opinion of O'Connor, Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas, \nJ.J.)]. One Justice, Justice Kennedy, held in concurring opinion that \nretroactive application of the Act violated the Due Process Clause. \n[Eastern Enterprises, slip op. at 1-7 (Kennedy, J., concurring and \ndissenting in part)].\n  In reaching its conclusion, the plurality grappled with the ripeness \nissue of whether a litigant, such as the petitioner in this case, is \nbarred from seeking equitable relief in federal district courts. The \nTucker Act confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Court of Federal \nClaims to hear claims for compensation under the Takings Clause of the \nfifth amendment, and it was argued, much like critics of this bill, \nthat a claim for equitable or other relief under the Takings Clause is \nhypothetical until compensation is first determined by a court. The \nSupreme Court noted that the Court of Appeals, the various courts of \nappeals, were divided on the issue and that the Supreme Court's \nprecedents were seemingly contradictory. [Eastern Enterprises, slip op. \nat 19 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.)].\n  For instance, the Supreme Court in First Evangelical Lutheran Church \nof Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 314 (1987), \nobserved that ``the fifth amendment does not prohibit the taking of \nprivate property, but instead places a condition [just compensation] on \nthe exercise of that power.'' Yet in Duke Power Company v. Carolina \nEnvironmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 70 n. 15 (1978), the \nSupreme Court held that a district court may exercise jurisdiction over \ndeclaratory judgment actions pursuant to a Takings Clause claim, even \nwhen no attempt to seek compensatory relief has been made in the Court \nof Federal Claims.\n  Significantly, the Eastern Enterprises plurality noted that the \nSupreme Court had granted equitable relief without discussing the \napplicability of the Tucker Act, and, thus, decided the issue sub \nsilento that an unconstitutional taking could occur without a \ndetermination of compensation. [Eastern Enterprises, slip op. at 19-20 \n(plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.), citing Babbitt v. Youpee, 519 U.S. \n234, 243-245 (1997); Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal. v. Construction \nLaborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U.S. 602, 641-647 (1993); \nHodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 716-718 (1987)].\n  Based on the foregoing, I believe that a federal court may decide \ntakings issues before compensation is ascertained. Indeed, the Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit in In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F. 3d 478, \n492 (2d Cir. 1995), characterized the contrary language in First \nEvangelical Lutheran Church, mentioned above, as obiter dicta.\n  Finally, I want to note that federal courts have more than adequate \nexperience in the appraisal of value as the many takings and inverse \ncondemnation claims heard by these courts demonstrate. Consequently, \nfederal courts, as well as state courts, are appropriate forums to \ndetermine compensation. Indeed, this was the intent of the framers and \nratifiers of the fifth and fourteenth Amendments.\n  In conclusion, let me point out that James Madison, in his celebrated \nEssay on Property, wrote that the very purpose of government is to \nprotect private property.\n  Madison's own words in Essay on Property:\n\n       Government is instituted to protect property of every sort \n     . . . this being the end of government. That alone is a just \n     government, which impartially secures to every man whatever \n     is his own.\n\n  Let me also point out the admonition of John Adams, who, in his \nDefense of the Constitutions of Government, cautions that:\n\n       The moment the idea is admitted into a society that \n     property is not as sacred as the laws of God, and there is \n     not force of law and public justice to protect it, anarchy \n     and tyranny commence.\n\n  That is John Adams' Defense of the Constitutions of Government.\n  Mr. President, let us heed the advice and warnings of the wise \nFounders of this Republic. It is the duty of Congress to assure that \nthe constitutional rights of all Americans are protected. This is \nespecially true when, as here, the courts fail to do their job of \nsafeguarding constitutional rights. In such a situation, Congress must \nstep to the plate.\n  With passage of this bill, Congress will have hit a home run. The \nright to own and possess property will have been vindicated. Fairness \nto property owners will have been guaranteed by resolving the egregious \ndelays and costs associated with the ripeness issue. Property owners \nwill have been afforded fair access to the federal courts to vindicate \ntheir constitutional rights. Justice will no longer have been delayed \nnor denied.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, good to see a fellow Mainer. I was so \nintent and engrossed by the discussion of the senior Senator from Utah, \nI did not notice who was in the chair.\n  What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is debating a motion to proceed to \nSenate bill 2271. The cloture vote will occur at 5:45 p.m. Time is \ndivided equally between now and then.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is due to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 100 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I am amazed on this issue. I look at the schedule \nset by the distinguished Speaker of the House, and we have so very few \nlegislative days remaining that now we have this as a top priority--a \nbill to strip zoning and land use decisions from small towns and cities \nand counties--instead of passing important funding bills.\n  I do know the law requires us to have a budget by April 15; it also \nrequires us to file our taxes bill April 15--we demand every person in \nthe country do that. But it seems that the majority of the Republican \nleadership did not find\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nit in their heart to obey their own law to pass the budget by that \ntime.\n  I am not sure we have passed the budget. We passed one in the Senate; \nthe House, months later, passed one; I don't believe it has been \nconferenced.\n  Anyway, these are things we cannot seem to find time to do, that the \nlaw requires us to do. The law requires us to file our income tax \nreturns. The law requires the House and Senate to pass a budget by \nApril 15. But the other body, at least, never got around to doing that.\n  We weren't able to find time to pass a tobacco bill, so there is not \none that might be different from exactly what the tobacco companies \nwant. We certainly haven't found time to pass legislation to increase \npatients' rights. We found it impossible to find time to pass \nlegislation on campaign financing. But now we seem to be looking for \nthe time to consider a bill that will take power away from State and \nlocal government. That power that we take from State and local \ngovernment will go to the Federal courts.\n  This is the same U.S. Senate, Madam President, which has found it \ndifficult to perform its constitutional duty to fill the scores of \nvacancies in the same Federal courts. On the one hand, we are saying we \nwill not fill the vacancies; we will leave 75 to 100 vacancies in the \nFederal court. The U.S. Senate can't find time to confirm the people \nwho are pending, like Sonia Sotomayor and others. But we have time to \nsay we don't care what the States think in their courts. We don't care \nwhat counties and municipalities think in their courts. We will take \ntheir power away from them and dump them in the Federal court. Now, we \nare not going to have enough judges in the Federal court to handle the \ncases, because we will give the Federal courts a whole lot of \njurisdiction they never asked for and don't want, in an unprecedented--\nunprecedented--exercise in antifederalism and unprecedented exercise of \nthe Federal Government reaching into the States and stripping away \ntheir power and dumping into a Federal court. That is what we are \nspending our time on.\n  Maybe I made a mistake in reading some of the rhetoric that went with \nthe Contract on America that my good friends on the other side of the \naisle proposed which talked about giving power back to the States, back \nto the communities. They said: We have to get the Federal Government \noff your back. And yet now we have a piece of legislation which says: \nWhoops, we are going to take all your power away from you and give it \nto the Federal courts. Well, well, well.\n  This is a bill that would federalize local zoning decisions. This is \na bill which goes against everything that the Republican Party has said \nthey stood for, certainly everything that the people in my State, \nRepublicans and Democrats, stand for, and that is giving power to local \npeople. This goes against it. Why? Because its unabashed purpose is to \ngive wealthy developers increased power to short-circuit communities' \ndecisions, those decisions made through the public processes of local \ngovernment.\n  Basically, what this is, it is a bill to instill the golden rule, \nsaying, if you have got the gold, you are going to make the rules. That \nis basically what it is. If you have got plenty of money, don't worry \nabout pesky little things like a State court or zoning court or the \nthings a community has a stake in; ignore those, because you can make \nyour decision from your corporate headquarters 2,000 miles away, and \nyou could care less what the people of Bar Harbor, ME, or Burlington, \nVT, might think because you have got the money and you have got the \nbill.\n  S. 2271, the so-called Private Property Rights Implementation Act, \nwill give developers greater access to Federal courts and less \naccountability to local governments than any other citizens have. In \nfact, this legislation elevates the rights of property owners above \nother constitutional rights, such as civil rights. It goes back almost \nto a time when we were forming this country where they said: If you \nhave a lot of property, you should be the only ones with rights; you \nshould have the votes; you should make the laws if you have a lot of \nproperty and a lot of money. And we said, no, no, no, no, we had a \nlittle matter of fighting the Revolution so that wouldn't happen. We \ncall it democracy--not anarchy, not monarchy, but democracy.\n  I have received letters from Governors, State attorneys general, and \ncounty commissioners opposing this assault on local decisionmaking.\n  In fact, the National Association of Counties passed a resolution \nopposing this effort, stating that these types of decisions are best \nmade at the local level with ample opportunity for all parties to seek \nnonjudicial solutions.\n  Then the National Conference of State Legislatures recently said, \n``The only certain result would be an additional centralization of \npower in an unelected Federal judiciary at the expense of the States.''\n  The National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors are \nalso concerned that this effort would lead to significant property tax \nincreases. Mayor Giuliani, Republican mayor of New York, is worried \nabout the unfunded mandates in the bill. He said, ``It remains to be \nseen where the resources will come from to pay for these added burdens \n. . . on local governments that would have to defend themselves in \nthese proceedings.''\n  The Justice Department advises us that this effort will interfere \nwith local governments' ability to have a say in how close garbage \ndumps, liquor stores, adult bookstores and noisy industrial plants can \nbe to schools, homes, and churches. What it says is, if your town \ndoesn't want a porno shop next to your church or your school, the \ndeveloper could say, ``We are going to put it there, and you don't even \nhave a say in it anymore. We are going into Federal court.''\n  The National Association of Towns and Townships, representing 11,000 \nlocal governments and many tens of thousands of local elected \nofficials--Republicans and Democrats alike--stresses that the bill \n``would involve Federal courts in those disputes well before local \ngovernments and landowners have had the opportunity to fully consider \nthe range of development alternatives . . . . Clearly, communities want \nto keep factories away from residential areas and adult stores away \nfrom schools.'' I hope so. I hope the U.S. Senate would not pass a bill \nto make it easier for porno shops to go next to grade schools or \nchurches.\n  Mayor Giuliani calls these measures a fundamental intrusion upon his \ncity's authority over local land use decisions, and he has written to \nme opposing this bill in the strongest terms. A recent Washington Post \narticle described his efforts to eradicate strip clubs, X-rated video \nstores, and peep shows in the Times Square area. Make no mistake about \nit. If you vote for this bill, you are voting for a bill that would be \na roadblock to those efforts.\n  The contradictions presented by this bill are startling. Instead of \ntrusting local mayors, councils, planning and zoning commissioners, and \nGovernors to know what is best for its citizens, this bill short-\ncircuits the local process and it turns local land use disputes into \nFederal cases. I point out that the mayor of New York City is better \nequipped to handle the legal expenses this bill would impose than are \ncountless small towns I could mention in Vermont or other States, \nincluding my own small town of Middlesex, VT. But even New York City--\nwith many, many times the population and wealth of my State of \nVermont--says the burden this bill would impose would be onerous.\n  Can you imagine--whether it is a town of 500, or 1,000, or 2,000--the \nlittle town of Strafford, VT, which I had the privilege to visit on the \nFourth of July, has just a few hundred people. One of them was Senator \nMorrill, a former Senator--Senator Morrill of the 19th century, one of \nthe longest serving Senators from Vermont--that was his homestead and \nhis home--who came out of that little town having some sense of \neducation and the need for education in small States and small towns, \nbegan the Land Grant Act. Look what we have benefited by that--every \nState in this Union. But that little town would be totally wiped out if \nsomebody wanted to come in and destroy their whole character and say, \n``You can't do anything to stop us.''\n  The mayors have told me the chilling effect the bill would have on \ntheir entire planning process by the specter of paying takings damages \nand attorney fees to developers, merely because a Federal judge sitting \nin a court somewhere distant disagrees with the wisdom of a particular \nuse policy that\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\nwould result in a wholesale retreat for local zoning decisions.\n  As Mayor Larry Curtis of Ames, IA, testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee, ``You only have to look at budgets of our small towns to see \nhow S. 2271 would be tipping the scales of justice in favor of wealthy \ndevelopers.''\n  The top four developers in the United States have annual revenues in \nexcess of $1 billion per year. Just four developers represent over $1 \nbillion a year in revenues. Most of our small towns generate less than \n$10 million a year, and some way less than $10 million a year, in tax \nrevenues. Ninety-percent of cities and towns in America have less than \n10,000 people. They couldn't hire a lawyer to fight a well-entrenched \ndeveloper. Of course not.\n  In my State, with a median community of around 2,500 people--my own \ncommunity of Middlesex, VT, has 1,500 people--you can see these towns \nneed their revenues to pay for police officers, teachers, safer streets \nand schools, and not spend the time in Federal court fighting huge \ndevelopers. How can we expect small towns to protect the rights of \ntheir residents against a $1 billion developer who can hire all the \nlawyers they want? I would rather be paying that money for teachers, or \nnurses, or police officers, and for the protection of our \ncommunities. But, unfortunately, the House of Representatives has \nalready made the decision that we will take power away from the States, \nwe will take power away from our communities, we will give that power \nto major developers, who may be, coincidentally, major contributors to \npolitical action committees. They will take the power away from our \ntowns and our cities.\n\n  How that flies in the face of the rhetoric when they talk about \ngiving power back to our communities. But it is now the responsibility \nof the Senate to step through with some common sense to safeguard the \njurisdiction of the budgets of our towns from a barrage of lawsuits, \nfrom special interests, and allow them to focus on community needs.\n  By giving land speculators and developers this huge new club to wield \nin their dealings with local officials, this bill would also remove the \npublic from what should be a democratic process to decide what goes on \nin our communities' backyards. In Vermont, we have been fighting our \nown backyard battles over the last year--battles against the towers on \nthe hillsides of our Green Mountains. One of our primary tools to \nprotect Vermont from being turned into some kind of a giant pincushion \nwith 200-foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain \nand valley, within the protections of our own State law, Act 250 has \nbecome basically the anti-pincushion law. It has resolved over 15,000 \ncases, and it has been done with local people and with our own sense of \nour State and our own people making the decision, not some out-of-State \nfat-cat corporation. And the resolutions of these cases have been \ninstrumental in retaining the character and natural resources and the \nheritage of my native State of Vermont--the heritage that makes it \nunique.\n  S. 2271 would have allowed developers to drag each and every one of \nthose 15,000 cases into Federal court instead of allowing the people of \nVermont to make the decisions. It might have been people from a huge \ncorporation in Houston, or California, or somewhere else, against the \npeople of Vermont. As the former State's attorney in Vermont, I cannot \nimagine having to fight this many legal battles on an annual State \nbudget of less than $10 million, which is for fighting all of the \nState's legal battles.\n  This legislation will allow developers to avoid local and State \nauthority to drag local communities into Federal court, where they \nwon't even have the resources and where they might as well give up and \nsay:\n       Here are our choices. We could protect the people of our \n     community, we could protect the people of our State, we could \n     protect our heritage, we could do what the people of the \n     State want us to do, but in even trying to do it, we face the \n     risk of bankrupting the town or the State. So we want to \n     protect your heritage. We want to protect the reasons you \n     live here, but we can't bankrupt you, and we are just going \n     to have to surrender.\n\n  Why have we lost all the power in our local communities? Why have we \nlost the power of our States to stand up for the interests of our \npeople, and the power of our communities to stand up for the interests \nof their people? Because the people in Washington, DC, in the House and \nSenate, were more interested in the needs and whims of a few fat-cat \ndevelopers. They sold away our rights and our interests. They sold away \nour heritage. They sold away what makes our communities what they are.\n  Now, Madam President, I have spoken many times on the floor of the \nSenate on how I feel about my own State of Vermont. I have heard the \nPresiding Officer speak of the pride in her own State of Maine, one of \nthe most beautiful States in this country. Each of our States is \ndifferent. I kind of like it that way. But when we go home as Senators, \nevery one of us has to feel the tug of our State and the feel of being \nthere.\n\n  When I left my farmhouse in Middlesex, VT, this morning, I drove down \nthe dirt road. Mist was coming out of the fields, a deer had just run \nacross one of the fields, and the sun was shining. The sun rose on Mt. \nEllen. I drove down along the Winooski River heading to the airport. It \nwas so beautiful. A farmer was out tilling the field. I saw a hawk \nflying over one of the fields. My wife pointed to a place she likes the \nmost as we drove along. It is a little spot, a tiny pond alongside the \nroad, in an area that has been kept open for agriculture and \nrecreation. The people in the community decided not to develop it, even \nthough it would be prime development land. She said, ``Let's see if it \nis there.'' And it was. There is almost always a great blue heron \nstanding in there. We can almost count on it in the morning as we head \nto the airport and drive up French Hill and come over the top and see \nthe Champlain Valley and Burlington, and our really nice lake, Lake \nChamplain is out there. And I thought: How beautiful this is.\n  There are parts of the State I remember from when I was a child, and \nthat is part of it. My father used to tell me that most of the \nmountains were open land and fields throughout at different times of \nour history. Now most of them are forests. Some of the areas had been \nfarmland and are now developed. But it was done carefully, in the way \nwe wanted it to be done in Vermont. Our Act 250 was put through the \nlegislature by a conservative Republican Governor, Dean Davis. But, \nlike me, he was a native Vermonter who wanted to keep the best of our \nState.\n  Has it worked perfectly in every case? Probably not. I am sure we \ncould look back where something might have been done slightly \ndifferently, but for the vast majority of cases it has worked so well, \nand Vermont is a better place to live and a more beautiful State as a \nresult. But we made our choices.\n  Now some out-of-State, wealthy developer might say to us, ``But if \nyou had only let us come in here, if you had knocked out that pond \nwhere that great blue heron is--who knows, maybe one in a hundred cars \ngo by--we could have put a building there, and you would have had tax \nrevenues from it. You may even have had some jobs.''\n  You know, they are probably right. It probably might have even \nincreased the per-capita income of our State. But do you know what, \nMadam President? The people of Vermont said that the beauty of that \narea is more valuable to us. And shouldn't we make that decision?\n  Now, every year, we have some developer from out of State who will \ncome in and look at these magnificent views--views that we have \npreserved, sometimes at great sacrifices, as Vermonters, we have \npreserved. They come in and say, ``Oh, if we can just develop here, we \nwill make millions for you and we will make even more millions for us. \nSomeday you are going to be gone anyway, so what difference does it \nmake?'' We say, ``No; we kind of like it this way.''\n  I think of the home that I have in Vermont. My parents bought it 41 \nyears ago this summer. They bought it as a summer place. We have turned \nit into a year-round home. There is a field on it. This field has one \nof the prettiest views in central Vermont. It looks at Camel's Hump and \nat Mt. Ellen, and it is gorgeous.\n  About 3 weeks after my father bought the whole place, with a couple \nhundred acres, back in the late fifties, a man called him up and said, \n``I would like to buy that field. I understand there is about 8 or 10 \nacres there out of\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nthe 200 that you bought.'' Dad said, ``That's right.'' He said, ``I \nwill offer you for that field what you paid for the whole farm.'' My \nfather said he wasn't interested. The man kept calling back every week, \nand the amount went up and up and up. He finally offered my father \nmany, many times what he paid for the whole 200 acres for that 8 to 10 \nacres. And dad said, ``I won't sell.'' He said, I guess to impress my \nfather--and my mother and father had a small printing business in \nMontpelier--he said, ``I will come up there in my private plane, and I \nwill offer you enough money that you will sell.'' And dad said, ``I \nwould hate to have you waste the time. I am not going to sell.'' He \nsaid, ``Well, why won't you?'' And my father made a comment that was \nactually prophetic because my wife and I do the same thing today. He \nsaid, ``Every so often we like walking up that field around sunset time \nand we like looking out there and seeing the Sun set.'' And he said to \nmy dad, ``If that's all you want, sell it to me and you can come there \nand watch the Sun set anytime you want.'' My father said, ``No. It \nwouldn't be the same.''\n\n  Now, we take that attitude about many things in Vermont, Madam \nPresident. Somebody will say, ``Well, if we put up this huge tower or \nthis bowl, it would improve your ability to get Baywatch'' or whatever \nelse the 12 channels on which 12 different folks will tell you if you \nsend contributions to them, they have a direct line to God and will get \nyou a blessing, or a blessing bigger than money. And we say, ``No, we \nkind of like it the way it is.''\n  But we make that decision. And then an out-of-State \ntelecommunications company can't come in and say, ``Oh, we are going to \nset you aside and we will go in there,'' because they are trying to do \nthat under the Telecommunications Act now. Or somebody says, ``If we \nput this factory outlet right here, you know, if people come to see \nthis great view here and they see the factory outlet, they will go down \nthere.'' And we say, ``No, we kind of like the view the way it is.''\n  Just as years ago Vermont became the first State to ban billboards \nalong its highways. Everybody said, ``Oh, my God. Your tourism will \ndisappear; your businesses will disappear. You will become an economic \nwasteland.'' You know what happened. Tourism skyrocketed up because \npeople kind of liked seeing the views and not seeing the billboards. \nBut we made that decision. Under this law, the billboard company could \ncome in and say, ``You can't make that decision because we are just \ngoing to come through and we are going to take over.''\n  Now, I know there are examples of citizens who want to develop their \nland and should have been allowed to develop it without pushing cases \nthrough the courts for years, but the U.S. Supreme Court has decided \nsome recent cases in favor of landowners saying you have to make your \ndecision. You can't tie it up forever. You do have to make your \ndecision.\n  And that is fine. That is the way case law develops, and we make our \ndecisions accordingly. But it does not justify rewriting Federal law to \nencourage developers to sue local governments for local zoning \ndecisions. It does not justify a bill that will allow the filing of \nthousands of suits to prevent local governments from zoning out gas \nstations or incinerators or a 20-story building next to your house.\n  We need only to look at the list of actual takings claims that \nconfront local governments to see what is wrong with this bill. In \nTampa, FL, and Mobile, AL, officials were sued when they tried to \nrestrict topless dancing bars. A chemical company challenged a Guilford \nCounty, NC, denial of a permit to operate a hazardous waste facility. \nThe county said, ``We don't really want your hazardous waste \nfacility.'' They took them to court. A landfill operator contested a \ncounty's health and safety ordinance prohibiting the construction of \nadditional landfills, even though people worried about their water \nsupply. An outdoor advertising company challenged a Durham, NC, \nordinance that limited the number of billboards in order to preserve \nthe character of the city. A gravel mine operation challenged a \nHempstead, NY, ordinance prohibiting excavation within 2 feet of the \ngroundwater table that supplied water for the town.\n\n  I know how I would feel if I was a parent living in that town and my \nchildren were drinking that water.\n  An essential part of land use policy is weighing one resident's \nconcern over another to arrive at a decision in the community interest. \nWe need to balance the rights of property owners with those of others \nin the same community.\n  Remember that all of us live downstream, downwind, or next door to \nproperty where pollution or unsuitable activities can harm our health \nor our safety or our property values.\n  This new challenge to local government is more dangerous than the \nlegislation we defeated last Congress. Take a look at the groups \nopposing this legislation. These are the groups in opposition. Every \nmajor State and local government organization opposes this bill: \nNational Governors' Association; National Association of Counties; \nNational League of Cities; U.S. Conference of Mayors; National \nAssociation of Town and Townships; National Conference of State \nLegislatures; the Judicial Conference of the United States; religious \norganizations: United States Catholic Conference; National Council of \nChurches of Christ; Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism; \nEvangelicals for Social Action; the League of Women Voters; Alliance \nfor Justice; Physicians for Social Responsibility; National Trust for \nHistoric Preservation; National Wildlife Federation; League of \nConservation Voters; the Sierra Club; the National Environmental Trust, \nand on and on and on and on.\n  Every major conservation group opposes this bill. Civil rights \ngroups, religious groups, labor groups, public interest groups, \npreservation groups, all oppose this bill.\n  Let's not overlook the threat to our court system when we are looking \nat the threat to our State and local government. As I said earlier, S. \n2271 could significantly boost the workload of our already overburdened \nFederal court system. By making a Federal case out of local zoning \ndecisions, we are going to rush zoning decisions into the Federal court \nbefore the local public process has even had a chance to work out some \nkind of alternative the community might want. Instead of allowing our \ncommunities to try to work it out themselves, we say, whoops, it is out \nof your hands entirely; we are going to turn it over to a Federal \njudge.\n  And think of the cost of dramatically increasing the workload of \nFederal courts. It is going to cause a lot greater delay in existing \nFederal court workload, even if the Senate did do its duty and confirm \nthose dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of judges waiting \nconfirmation. And, of course, that is why the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States, the Conference of Chief Justices, and 38 State \nattorneys general all oppose this bill.\n  The contradictions presented by this bill, contradicting what the \nmajority leadership of this Senate says they want, are amazing. The \nlegislation turns the goal of increasing local jurisdiction and \ndecisionmaking on its head. It seems to abandon the respect for local \ndecisions that so many in this body espoused during the takings debate \nduring the 104th Congress.\n  Statements were made just last year--is our memory so short as \nSenators that we forget that last year statements were made that \nlegislation should only apply to the Federal Government and not impact \nState or local zoning laws? This legislation directly threatens local \nauthority.\n  Another seemingly obvious contradiction this legislation offers is to \nthe ``judicial activism'' rallying cry of some in the matter of \njudicial appointments--just a matter of how selective some of those \nsame people can be about judicial activism unless, of course, we think \nthey might act on behalf of our supporters.\n  Rebutting their own criticism of activist judges, this bill will \nencourage judges to intervene in problems that belong in legislatures \nor city councils.\n  So with all of these contradictions and with the overwhelming \nopposition to this dangerous legislation, why is Congress considering \nsuch sweeping changes to the balance of power between local officials \nand developers?\n  That is a question being asked of us across the country. The \nManchester, NH, Union Leader, not considered the most liberal newspaper \nin America--in fact, usually considered the most conservative--posed \nthat question to the\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\nHouse when it took up the bill, when they said this bill is a \n``conservative flip-flop,'' and they said ``let's not federalize local \nzoning disputes.''\n\n  They thought, and they said it is ``. . . a good guess that this bill \nwill die quietly in the Senate, enabling House conservatives to tell \ntheir backers we `gave it our best shot.' ''\n  Well, there they go again, because now we are wasting valuable floor \ntime on a bill the President has pledged to veto. This legislative \nproposal is unwarranted. It is unwise. We have to do a lot better for \nour local towns and communities and for local homeowners.\n  I have a statement of administration policy and a letter. I ask \nunanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n          S. 2271--Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 2271 because it \n     would shift authority over local land use issues away from \n     local communities and State courts to Federal courts. The \n     bill would subject local communities to the threat of \n     premature, expensive Federal court litigation that would \n     favor wealthy developers over neighboring property owners and \n     the community at large. The President will veto S. 2271 or \n     any similar legislation.\n       S. 2271 would harm neighboring property owners, weaken \n     local public health and environmental protections, and \n     diminish the quality of life by undermining local land use \n     planning. Through radical changes to the existing legal \n     doctrine of ripeness, the bill would give developers \n     inappropriate leverage in their dealings with local officials \n     by making it easier to sue local communities far earlier in \n     the land use planning process. S. 2271 also purports to allow \n     takings claimants to circumvent State courts altogether.\n       The bill would violate constitutional limits on \n     congressional power if read, as its supporters intend, to \n     allow for a ruling that an uncompensated taking has occurred \n     even where the claimant fails to pursue available State \n     compensation remedies. The bill also would prohibit Federal \n     courts from ``abstaining'' or deferring to State courts on \n     certain delicate issues of State law. It would lead to poorly \n     informed decisions by allowing claimants to bring claims in \n     Federal courts without an adequate factual record, the very \n     claims that the courts themselves have said are unripe for \n     resolution.\n       S. 2271 would empower the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to \n     invalidate Federal statutes and rules and grant other \n     injunctive relief in a broad category of cases. This grant of \n     authority to a non-Article III court raises a host of serious \n     constitutional and policy concerns.\n       The bill provides that, by including a property rights \n     claim, any litigant against the United States could ensure \n     that the entire case would be reviewed on appeal by the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, an approach that \n     would promote inappropriate forum-shopping. This would \n     dramatically increase the legal influence of the Federal \n     Circuit at the expense of other circuits, thereby disrupting \n     settled interpretations of important areas of the law.\n       S. 2271 also could override the ``preclusive review'' \n     provisions found in many Federal statutes, including major \n     environmental laws. These provisions allow for the swift and \n     orderly resolution of challenges to Federal actions. S. 2271 \n     would deprive affected businesses and the public of the \n     regulatory stability needed to plan their actions.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Governors' Association, National Association of \n           Counties, National Conference of State Legislatures, \n           National League of Cities, United States Conference of \n           Mayors,\n                                                    July 10, 1998.\n       To All Senators: On behalf of the nation's governors, state \n     legislators, and local elected officials, we are writing to \n     express our strong opposition to S. 2271, the ``Private \n     Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998.'' We believe the \n     proposed legislation, including the proposed technical \n     amendments, would fundamentally interfere with and preempt \n     the traditional and historic rights and responsibilities of \n     state and local governments and would mandate significant \n     new, unfunded costs for all state and local taxpayers.\n       State and local elected officials are as deeply committed \n     to protecting private property rights as are members of \n     Congress. A review of the most recent proposed revisions to \n     the legislation makes clear that those changes do not address \n     our fundamental problems with the bill. We continue to \n     believe that S. 2271 goes far beyond its stated objectives.\n       If passed, the bill would undermine state and local \n     government authority over land use and regulatory decisions \n     by allowing developers and property owners to take their \n     grievances directly to federal court, circumventing legal \n     remedies at the state and local level. Such an ``end run'' \n     around the processes established by our state laws runs \n     counter to the foundations of federalism that this Congress \n     purports to endorse. The bill preempts the traditional system \n     for resolving local zoning, land use, and regulatory \n     disputes; it creates a disincentive for developers to \n     negotiate with localities in order to reach mutually \n     agreeable solutions; and it puts federal judges in the \n     position of micromanaging purely local affairs. We believe \n     that large-scale developers will use the expedited access to \n     federal courts under S. 2271 as a ``club'' to intimidate \n     local officials who are charged with acting in the best \n     interests of the community as a whole.\n       The framers of the Constitution never intended federal \n     courts to be the first resort in resolving community disputes \n     between local governments and private parties. In our view, \n     these issues should be settled locally, as close to the \n     affected community as possible. S. 2271 violates our \n     cherished principles of federalism and state and local \n     sovereignty. We urge you to oppose floor action on S. 2271.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor George V. Voinovich,\n       Chairman, National Governors' Association.\n     Senator Richard Finan,\n       President, Ohio Senate, President, National Conference of \n     State Legislatures.\n     Commissioner Randy Johnson,\n       Hennepin County, Minnesota, President, National Association \n     of Counties.\n     Mayor Deedee Corradini,\n       Salt Lake City, Utah, President, U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n     Council Member Brian O'Neill,\n       City of Philadelphia, President, National League of Cities.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have some other items, but I see the \nvery distinguished Senator from Louisiana on the floor, and I do not \nsee others seeking recognition. I will yield to my colleague and friend \nfrom Louisiana, but before I do that, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 65 minutes remaining on his \nside.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand the Senator from Louisiana wanted time from \nSenator Hatch. If we could wait just one more moment for him to come \nback?\n  But while we are waiting for Senator Hatch to come back, let me just \ntake a moment to offer what is really an example of the profits this \nbill will give to developers and the downfall it will be to homeowner \nrights.\n  One thing I heard from every mayor and local official about this bill \nis the fear of battles with large corporate developers with deep \npockets. Instead of waging these battles, most mayors concede they will \nprobably settle the cases and give in to the developers. It will be a \nfield day for land speculators who buy land zoned for, let's say, \nfarming and then sue in Federal court to have the land rezoned for \ncommercial or residential purposes, because now they suddenly change \ntheir mind the day after buying it and say they no longer want to be \nfarmers; they just want to make millions as developers.\n  One Senate staffer who works on this issue came across a timely \nexample. He was visiting his boyhood hometown in Cortland County, NY, \nover the Fourth of July weekend. He told me about a pertinent \nsituation.\n  A farm adjacent to about 25 homes on a small lake, Little York Lake, \nwas recently sold for $2,000 per acre for a total of $65,000. A \nspeculator bought the land which he wants to now sell for $30,000 per \nacre to make a quick profit of around $1 million. To do that, he has to \nevade local zoning and health requirements. The speculator knows the \nland, sold as farmland, is worth about $2,000 per acre. But if you sell \nit for residential or business development, it could be worth 15 times \nmore. But, of course, it would greatly reduce the property values of \nneighboring homeowners living in the community. They would be hurt by \nit, but one speculator would benefit if he is able to change the rules.\n  The persons who sold the land to the speculator might have wished \nthey had thought about just avoiding local land-use regulations. They \ncould have made a whole lot of money if they did it themselves, but \nthey didn't want to. They wanted to obey the rules.\n  This bill would allow the speculator to get into Federal court. It \nwould certainly be futile for him to apply for\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\nconstruction permits for business, since the land is not zoned for that \nuse. So why bother to work with the local governing body? Why bother to \nfind a solution that might be acceptable to everybody? Instead, under \nthe bill he could just sue them for taking the hoped-for profits or \nhave his attorney make them change their zoning requirements. \nIncidentally, the land is located on the aquifer that provides the \nwater for the community.\n  Well, Madam President, I don't want to see this example replicated \nacross the country. Fighting for the Department of Agriculture programs \nto help conserve our Nation's farmland, I don't want to say we passed \nS. 2271, which throws that out.\n  Madam President, I understand that Senator Hatch has said if I want \nto yield time to the Senator from Louisiana--how much time would my \nfriend like?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 15 minutes of the time of the distinguished \nSenator from Utah to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I have not often found myself at odds \nwith my distinguished colleague from Vermont whom I have come to \nrespect and admire a great deal in every aspect of his work. But I do \nrise in support of this bill, in opposition to the comments made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  I will, however, agree with him on one point, and that is we most \ncertainly need to have our positions in our Federal courts filled in a \ntimely manner. This is not the only issue in our country that needs \nattention. This is not the only issue where people, individuals and \nparties, are aggrieved and need their grievances remedied in a timely \nmanner. So I do join him and thank him for his valiant efforts to try \nto get the nominations of many qualified individuals, nominated for our \nFederal bench, certified and voted on so that these matters can be \nhandled in a more timely fashion.\n  But I am pleased to rise in support of S. 2271, to join my \ndistinguished colleagues from Utah and Georgia. The reason I rise to \nsupport this bill is because this is about fairness. It is about access \nto justice for the rich and for the poor, for people who have a lot of \nproperty, for people who have little property. In fact, this is a bill \nfor people who don't own any property yet, but one day hope or dream or \nhave planned or have saved, or perhaps inherit some property, perhaps \nthe first ever owned in generations in their family, from having their \nrights of ownership trampled on. It is what I think the Democratic \nParty is about. It is why I am a Democrat. It is about the fundamental \nprinciples that the Democratic Party of which I am so proud stands for, \nand which I have spent, as have many on our side, a great deal of our \nlives and our political careers--fighting for the principles of these \ncornerstones of fairness and justice.\n  I know my distinguished colleague pointed out corporate America. I am \nnot sure exactly this is the picture he had in mind, because this is a \npicture, here, of Ann and Richard Reahard from Lee County, FL. I \ndon't--perhaps he does, but I don't--see a corporate headquarters here \nin this picture or cell phones or limousines or Christian Dior suits. I \njust see two people who look like they love each other and have worked \nhard. They inherited 40 acres of land in Florida.\n  I will not go through all the heartache that is listed here, but the \npoint is, this is not corporate America. These are two people from \nFlorida who inherited some land, and because of the lack of clearness \nin this law, in this unconstitutional law, have literally lived a \nnightmare since 1984, even with the most reasonable suggestions made to \nthis county about what to do to develop their property.\n  But the point is, this is not about the rich. This is, in fact, about \nthe poor and the rich, and about people who have property and people \nwho one day hope to. This bill is not just important because it \npromotes these worthy goals. It is important because it provides \npractical relief for the small landowners of Louisiana and across the \ncountry.\n  Opponents of this legislation assert that the bill will only help \nlarge developers and will put small localities at a disadvantage. To \nview S. 2271 that way is to actually put this situation on its head. \nLarge land developers do not need our help to enforce their rights. \nThey are the only plaintiffs that can actually afford to go all the way \nthrough the State court and then to Federal court, because under the \ncurrent situation, you need to have plenty money, plenty time and \nplenty patience.\n\n  Even so, large developers are not likely to be the people bringing \nthese cases. If you are a development corporation with a half dozen \nprojects in a certain area, what sense does it make for you to \naggravate the local authorities by challenging their decision in \nFederal court? None, because it makes no sense.\n  This bill is not about corporate America, large landowners, rich \nlawyers. Its much more likely scenario is a large developer will use \nits economic power and leverage to sail through the approval process, \nas complicated as it is, free from any trouble from local authorities, \nand they often do. The people who need this bill are private \nlandowners, small business persons, small landowners who don't have a \nlot of money, who don't have economic clout, who can't hire a 100-\nperson law firm to defend their rights in court and who don't have the \nresources that are at the disposal of some of our large developers.\n  If your greatest asset is your home--and that is the greatest asset \nof the vast majority of people in our country who own nothing else; if \nthey own something, they own their home and their land--they simply \ndon't have the resources necessary to defend their constitutional \nrights against a local, State or Federal agency determined to delay and \nwait out your court claim.\n  That is why I assert that this bill is about fairness. We change no \nsubstantive law under the fifth amendment. You have the same rights \ntoday as you will have when this bill passes. They will, however, be \nmore clear. The change occurs with respect to the process by which you \ncan enforce those rights. As it stands now, if I am a small property \nowner and I believe my land has been taken, I will be forced into a \nmorass of administrative and legal procedures which studies show will \ntake on the average of 9\\1/2\\ years.\n  Let me repeat that: 9\\1/2\\ years to be resolved; not 3 months, not 6 \nmonths, not 2 years. There are not too many people who can afford an \nattorney for several months, let alone for 9 years. If you are a \nmultimillion-dollar development corporation, you can afford to wait, \nbut if you are a family building a business for the first time or \nbuilding your first family home, you will be financially ruined in that \namount of time.\n  Which brings us to the second principle upheld by this legislation: \naccess to justice. A 1997 study by Linowes and Blocher showed that even \nif you had spent the necessary time and money to go to local hearings \nand State court, in 81 percent of the cases brought to Federal court, \nthe judges will still decline to hear the case on procedural grounds. \nIn 81 percent of the cases they are being declined, not on the merits \nor the substance of their claim, but on procedural cases because the \nlaws are so unclear in the jurisprudence, and that is what we are \nhoping to remedy today. Essentially, property owners have a \nconstitutional right which they have no practical way of exercising.\n  Everyone, Madam President, is entitled to their day in court. I \nstrongly support access to the courts for environmental concerns. I \nsupport municipalities who use the courts to enforce their zoning \nordinances. But it would be hypocritical of me, I say to my colleagues, \nto turn my back on the other side of the argument and allow property \nowners to go without any remedy for their legitimate complaints.\n  Small property owners and large municipal governments, county \ngovernments and State governments--everyone--needs to have their day in \ncourt, and that is what this bill does, nothing more, nothing less.\n  The central principle which underlies this bill is that we do not \nhave a two-tiered system of constitutional rights. Chief Justice \nRehnquist stated that the fifth amendment should not be the forgotten \nstepchild of the Bill of Rights. However, that is precisely the \nsituation we confront.\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\n  Under the fifth amendment, it states that private property shall not \nbe taken for a public purpose without just compensation. To repeat: The \nfifth amendment says that private property shall not be taken for \npublic use without a just compensation.\n  Nevertheless, we have inadvertently, I believe, constructed a system \nwhich precludes the vast majority of people from ever seeing the inside \nof a Federal court to defend their rights and to give meaning to these \nwords. They are actually useless without proper procedures to allow \nsomeone to state their claim.\n  The free enjoyment of property is not only enshrined in the \nConstitution, it was one of the core motivations of our American \nRevolution. The difficulty is that while we have created a national \nright, the essence of land use and decisions are local, as they should \nbe. For that reason, we have worked very hard to craft a bill which \naddresses the problems of property owners while maintaining the local \ndecisionmaking structures.\n  This bill does not affect--although the opponents have said it from \nday one--it does not affect local zoning. It grants no new rights. It \npreserves the authority of zoning boards and city councils. \nSpecifically, I point to page 16, lines 1 through 4 that establish \nclearly in this bill that no one is entitled, when this bill passes, to \nchallenge the authority of a local government to set local zoning \nordinances as enabled by their State constitution or State laws or the \nlaws of their territory. I want to be very clear, because the opponents \nhave argued that this upsets local zoning laws, and it does not.\n  In short, this is no overarching bill which will change land use \nlaws. Rather, we will provide a chance for people who have real \ngrievances to get their day in court in a timely manner.\n  This bill, in fact, Madam President, reminds me a great deal of the \nIRS reform bill, which this body just passed 98 to 2. When you put all \nthe cards in the hands of an administrative agency, you ensure abuse. \nThat is what is occurring in these land use cases today.\n  If you had read the horror stories that I have, you would feel the \nsame outrage that compelled this Chamber to pass the IRS reform bill \nnearly unanimously.\n  From my own State, let me just share one of these stories. Dean and \nRita Beard of Lafitte broke ground 2 years ago. They began building \ntheir dream home. They put all their savings into it and picked out a \nspot that had been pastureland for more than 100 years. The Beards \nhoped to turn this property over to their children and their \ngrandchildren.\n  What ensued, however, was their worst nightmare, as the Army Corps of \nEngineers put their dream on hold by taking 10 acres of land for \nmitigation projects due to projects elsewhere. Now the nearly completed \nhome of the Beards, which they were ready to enter, sits as a monument \nto the failure of our land use process.\n  The Beards' attorney advises them it may be 10 years before this \nissue is resolved. They may have a case, they may have a claim, they \nmay have been harmed, but it will take them 10 years because of the \ncomplications of when the administrative decision is final is not \nclear.\n  In the meantime, they have invested their life savings into an \nunusable home and every extra penny has gone towards lawyers. I doubt \nafter 9 years they will have, considering their situation, any money \nleft.\n  That, Madam President, is what this bill is trying to address. It is \nnot going to say how the courts should rule, it is just to say that \nthis family, who built their dream home in hopes of turning it over to \ntheir children and grandchildren, can get their day in court more \nquickly after exhausting their local remedies.\n  This bill is important to the Beards, it is important to my State, it \nis important to the implementation of our Constitution. I hope my \ncolleagues will take a close look--I know this vote is going to be very \nclose today--I hope that they will take a close look at what is \nactually in this bill to see past the outlandish rhetoric thrown about \nby its opponents.\n  Should this bill pass, it will not be a panacea to all the problems \nand regulations faced by landowners and the difficulties faced by \nmunicipalities in zoning. However, it will be a negotiating tool that \nproperty owners do not now have. And it will take a small step in the \nright direction. It is a modest step.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. May I please have additional time as I may require, \nanother 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly, from Senator Hatch's time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you. Another 5 minutes.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support cloture so that we can get to the \nmerits of this legislation and debate it, to give it a full debate, \nbecause it most certainly is necessary.\n  In closing, let me just say a few words. My distinguished colleague \nfrom Vermont painted a most beautiful picture of the way Vermont looks. \nI hope to get to see it for myself someday. I sure have seen it in \npictures, and I want to take my children there. Now, myself, I have \nspent many days on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and flying over the \nmarshes of Louisiana, seeing the beautiful sunsets, and have spent time \non the west coast and on the east coast. And just this past weekend I \nwas at a beautiful place in Maryland. I am well aware, as all of our \ncolleagues are, how beautiful this land is and how grateful we should \nbe to God for the land that He has given us.\n  But I do not think there is anything really, Madam President, that is \nmore beautiful than the Constitution of the United States, and \nparticularly the Bill of Rights. And I just want to remind our \ncolleagues of the beautiful words of the amendments, the 10 amendments \nthat make up the Bill of Rights, of which this is one that we speak \ntoday--the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right of \npeople to peacefully assemble, the right of people to petition their \nGovernment for redress of grievances, the right to life, liberty, and \nproperty, due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for \npublic use without just compensation.\n  These are beautiful words. And it is our job to make sure that these \nwords have meaning, that they are not just written on a piece of paper \nto be talked about or referred to in speeches, but that they actually \nwork. And that is what this bill is--a modest attempt to clarify \nsomething that most certainly needs clarification.\n  Let me quote from the Washington Post editorial that my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont also referred to, an editorial opposing this \nbill. It takes exceptions with this bill. Actually, when I read this \narticle, I thought it was a great example or outlined the three points \nof why this bill should be passed. And I would like to quote:\n\n       Current takings law is murky [the Washington Post says], \n     but its murkiness strikes a useful balance, allowing \n     government to implement zoning, environmental and other rules \n     that can restrict the use of private property while still \n     permitting compensation where that property is physically \n     invaded or grievously devalued. That balance [it says] should \n     not be altered [because it is murky].\n\n  Madam President, I do not think our constitutional rights should be \nmurky. I do not think people in America think that our constitutional \nrights should be murky--the right of free speech, the right of free \npress, the right to own your own property. And if it is taken from you, \nand totally eliminated of its value, you should be compensated. And \neveryone in America has their right for their day in court. I do not \nbelieve, Madam President, that our rights should be murky.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture later this afternoon.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the Sunday Washington Post \neditorial ``Takings Exception'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 12, 1998]\n\n                           Takings Exception\n\n       For all their professed commitment to federalism, \n     congressional Republicans frequently seem eager to pass laws \n     dumping quintessentially local matters into federal courts. \n     The latest such effort is the Property Rights Implementation \n     Act of 1998, which the Senate is now poised to consider. A \n     version of this bill was already passed by the House of \n     Representatives; it was a bad idea then, and it's no better \n     now.\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n       The principal component of the proposal would give property \n     owners quicker access to federal courts in their disputes \n     with local governments over contrasts on the use of private \n     land. The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids \n     governments to take private property without providing just \n     compensation, and battles over such local matters as zoning \n     sometimes erupt into takings clause litigation. \n     Traditionally, federal courts have not deemed takings claims \n     ripe for review until avenues for negotiation with local \n     officials are exhausted and plaintiffs have first sought \n     compensation from state courts. The federal judiciary also \n     has sought to avoid interpreting questions of state law in \n     takings cases. The Senate bill would change the rules of \n     takings litigation, allowing property holders into federal \n     court earlier in the process of negotiations with local \n     officials. It also would curtail the abstention authority of \n     the federal courts. It would, in other words, make federal \n     cases out of a whole class of property fights now treated as \n     local matters.\n       The other prong of the legislation would give those \n     claimants who are suing the federal government a wider choice \n     of venues in which to do battle than they now enjoy. \n     Currently, those who feel their property rights are being \n     infringed can sue in federal district court seeking to have \n     the federal agency stopped, or they can sue in the Court of \n     Federal Claims for compensation for an alleged taking. The \n     current proposal would give both courts jurisdiction over \n     both types of claim. This is an invitation for abusive venue-\n     shopping by plaintiffs, and the Justice Department has warned \n     that it also poses constitutional problems.\n       The department has said it will recommend that President \n     Clinton veto this bill, and he should certainly do so if it \n     passes. Current takings law is murky, but its murkiness \n     strikes a useful balance, allowing government to implement \n     zoning, environmental and other rules that can restrict the \n     use of private property while still permitting compensation \n     where that property is physically invaded or grievously \n     devalued. That balance should not be altered.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield such time as the distinguished senior Senator from \nRhode Island might need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from Vermont for \npermitting me to proceed.\n  Madam President, I oppose the motion to proceed to consider S. 2271, \nthe so-called Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against cloture. Quite simply, S. 2271 is a bad bill \nand we should not be spending any further time on this legislation, in \nmy judgment.\n  The bill would put Federal courts in the position of second-guessing \nlocal land management decisions. It would make it significantly more \ndifficult for State and local governments to implement zoning \nrestrictions, preserve neighborhoods, or protect environmentally \nsensitive areas.\n  Madam President, this bill is opposed by virtually every national \norganization representing State and local governments--the National \nGovernors' Association, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational League of Cities, the Conference of Mayors, the National \nConference of State Legislatures, amongst others.\n  The Nation's largest environmental groups are also strongly opposed \nto this legislation. I might say, Madam President, if anybody wonders \nwhether this is an environmental vote, it is. And I know that many \naround here say that the environmentalists are not very fair in their \nscoring. Well, here they have given clear notice that this is an item \nthat resonates deeply with them. They are strongly opposed to this \nlegislation, the environmental groups.\n  The administration is strongly opposed. The Attorney General and the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the EPA and the \nChairwoman of the Council on Environmental Quality--all of them oppose \nthis.\n  Madam President, I do not know whether these letters have been put in \nthe Record previously, but I would just like to read, if I might--I \nwish the Senator from Utah were here, but perhaps he will be back. But \nI am going to just read, if I might, a couple of these letters.\n  This is from the National Governors' Association, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nthe National League of Cities, the United States Conference of Mayors. \nThis is dated July 10, 1998. This isn't some old letter we dragged out; \nthis is dated July 10--3 days ago.\n\n       To all Senators: On behalf of the nation's governors, state \n     legislators, and local elected officials, we are writing to \n     express our strong opposition to S. 2271, the ``Private \n     Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998.'' We believe the \n     proposed legislation, including the proposed technical \n     amendments, would fundamentally interfere with and preempt \n     the traditional and historic rights and responsibilities of \n     state and local governments and would mandate significant new \n     unfunded costs for all state and local taxpayers.\n       State and local elected officials are as deeply committed \n     to protecting private property rights as are members of \n     Congress. A review of the most recent proposed revisions to \n     the legislation--\n\n  Your legislation, I say to Senator Hatch. I thought you might be \ninterested in what the Governors and others have to say about it. They \nsay your most recent revisions:\n\n     . . . do not address our fundamental problems with the bill. \n     We continue to believe that S. 2271 goes far beyond its \n     stated objectives.\n       If passed, the bill would undermine state and local \n     government authority over land use and regulatory decisions \n     by allowing developers and property owners to take their \n     grievances directly to federal court, circumventing legal \n     remedies on the state and local level. Such an ``end run'' \n     around the processes established by our state law runs \n     counter to the foundations of federalism . . . The bill \n     preempts the traditional systems for resolving local zoning, \n     land use, and regulatory disputes; it creates a disincentive \n     for developers to negotiate with localities in order to reach \n     mutually agreeable solutions; and it puts federal judges . . \n     .\n\n  Imagine this: the Federal Government, Federal judges, the very group \nwe are so warned about frequently on this floor. And what is more, they \nare labeled frequently as activist Federal judges. Suddenly we are \nputting them in charge. I am shocked by this.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me finish and I will give you a chance.\n  I know the Senator from Utah is deeply concerned about these activist \nFederal judges. That is why I find it sort of out of character----\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I will clarify.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. For him to want to turn these matters over from the \nlocals to the activist Federal judges, to the courts. The framers of \nthe Constitution never intended Federal courts to be the first resort \nin resolving community disputes between local governments and private \nparties.\n  This letter is signed by--well, who do we have here?--by the mayor of \nSalt Lake City.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Deedee Corradini, president of the U.S. Conference of \nMayors.\n  Mr. HATCH. As a matter of personal privilege, since the Senator \nraises my mayor, if the Senator will yield for a question, is the \nSenator aware in S. 2271 we have solved all those problems? The \noriginal bill did not participate, in the eyes of some of the mayors, \nbut S. 2271, is the Senator aware, affects only Federal claims being \nbrought before Federal court; that State and local claims, claims based \non State or local law, are not affected by S. 2271, which is fairly \ncontrary to what the distinguished Senator has been saying here?\n  The fact that the constitutional claims can arise from the actions of \nlocal governments does not make them any less a Federal claim, any more \nthan a violation of first amendment rights are Federal claims, whether \nit is a Federal or local official doing the violating.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I believe it is my time, is it not, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me finish, if I might.\n  I have here a letter, dated July 10, as I was saying just before the \nSenator from Utah came in. This is not some musty letter I dragged out \nof the files from a couple of years ago. This was written 3 days ago.\n  In it, it says:\n\n       We believe the proposed legislation, including the proposed \n     technical amendments [i.e. those you have been referring to] \n     would fundamentally interfere with the preemptive traditional \n     and historic rights.\n\n  And who signed it? Well, the Governor George Voinovich, chairman, \nNational Governors' Association; Richard Finan, president, Ohio State \nSenate and president, National Conference of State Legislatures; Randy \nJohnson,\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\npresident, National Association of Counties; Councilmember Brian \nO'Neill of Philadelphia, president, National League of Cities; and \nthen, of course the mayor of Salt Lake City. Here is her signature, \nDeedee Corradini.\n  I am sure she is a very able, intelligent, and fine lady, and an \nexcellent administrator. So she directs this to all Senators. I am sure \nthe Senator has received a copy.\n  Now, Madam President, let me just say this. In each of our cities and \neach of our States, we have a system for resolving zoning problems, for \nexample. The way it works in my State--it might be entirely different \nin the State of the Presiding Officer or the State of the principal \nproponent of this legislation--if my property is zoned residential and \nI want to put a gas station next to my house and I think that would be \na real winner, I could make a lot of money from that gas station--now \nit is true that 30 other houses on the plat might not like it, but I \nlike it, so I go before, in our State, I go before the zoning board of \nreview. I go before the zoning board. I would seek a variance. I \npresume I might well be turned down. Then I go to the zoning board of \nappeals. In other words, I take the second step.\n  Now, under this legislation, if I took that first step before the \nzoning board and was turned down and then I went to the zoning board of \nappeals, I wouldn't even have to wait for a decision. All I have to do \nis go before that, take that second step--in other words, one appeal--\nand then I can say, ``This is taking too long,'' and ``I want to go \ninto the Federal court,'' and I can go into the Federal court. Then the \nFederal court, under this legislation, takes up the matter.\n  I just don't think that is what we want. So many times on the floor \nof this Senate we inveigh, all of us have, against one size fits all. \nYet that is exactly what we are doing here. We are saying, no, no, no, \nwe don't like your system that you have in Maine, in Bangor, the way \nthey are handling these appeals. We will let that person go into that \nFederal court and there is no incentive to negotiate, to come up with a \ncompromise. When it is done on a city level or town level, as it is in \nmy State, having the zoning board say, can't you people work this out, \na gas station, that sounds like a little much, but talk with your \nneighbors and see what they say. Perhaps in some other area you can \nwork this out, but we want to negotiate.\n\n  That is not true when you get this thing in the Federal court. They \nthen come down with a decision and they direct the zoning board--issue \na permit for such and such. Is that really what we want?\n  I find this an astonishing proposal. I certainly hope that we are not \ngoing to get in this situation where powers that--200 years, these \npowers have resided in the local communities. Because somebody said, \n``Oh, they take too long, we don't like those long delays, so we are \ngoing to make it so you can go into the Federal court.'' Well, \napparently the people who live there don't think it is taking too long \nor they would change it. We are not helpless in our local communities, \nand wherever one is, whether it is each Greenwich, RI, or Ellsworth, \nME, the people don't like the situation, they can change it. That is \nperfectly possible.\n  What the law is saying, we don't like the way you are doing things \ndown there, you are taking too long, so we will have those activist \nFederal judges that we have heard Senators on the floor inveigh against \nso often--I certainly hope that this cloture will not be invoked on \nthis matter.\n  I might say, this issue isn't whether private property owners should \nbe protected or whether private property owners are entitled to just \ncompensation if their property is taken for public use. The fifth \namendment already provides for that. You can get into the Federal court \nunder the present system. You don't need this legislation. You have to \npermit the case to ripen. That is what the courts have been saying. In \nother words, exhaust your remedies on the local level before you can go \ninto the Federal courts.\n  I greatly hope, as I said before, that for the sake of the locals and \nthose who believe that powers should be at the local level, that a \nsystem that has been in place for the past 200 years is not arbitrarily \nchanged as is proposed by this legislation here. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I never cease to be shocked at some of \nthe arguments made around here. A gas station in a 30-home residence \narea is going to rise to the dignity of what we are talking about \nhere--give me a break. Houses of prostitution near places of worship--\ngive me a break. Nobody is arguing about things like that. The State \nand local areas certainly have total control over those.\n  I am well aware this bill is opposed by the Department of Justice, \nmany localities, some interstate governmental associations, and certain \nenvironmental groups. Almost knee-jerked in many respects. I believe \ntheir concerns that the bill would hinder local prerogatives and \nsignificantly increase the amount of Federal litigation are not only \nhighly overstated but highly misunderstood by them. The bill is \ncarefully drafted to ensure that aggrieved property owners must seek \nsolutions on the local or State level before filing a Federal claim. It \nsets a limit on how many procedures localities may impose.\n  I don't consider just a few months reasonable procedure. The average \ncase is taking 9\\1/2\\ years. If you are some poor little property \nowner, or even a developer, if you want to use some of the language \nthat has been thrown around here and you have a just reason to bring up \na takings claim because the State or local or Federal Government has \ntaken your property, you have to have pretty deep pockets to be able to \nlitigate for 9\\1/2\\ years. The reason you do is some of these \nlocalities are acting improperly and using the law to allow these cases \nto never ripen so that they can be heard.\n  I personally believe that the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island \nwould change his mind if he just looked at the case and realized we are \ntalking about true Federal issues here that should be in Federal court \nand should be there promptly, not after years of delay by local \nmunicipalities and/or other agencies, throwing up logjam after logjam \nto stop reasonable people from getting reasonable results under the \ncircumstances. This bill will do that.\n\n  Now, when we originally wrote this bill, when it came from the House, \nit had provisions in there that caused some angst among people who are \ntruly thoughtful in this area. So we, being truly thoughtful, made \nchanges that aren't just technical, but changes that basically, I \nthought, solved every problem being raised on the floor today. It is \nextremely difficult. Let me just say that.\n  Moreover, I seriously doubt that there will be a rush of new \nlitigation flooding Federal courts. This was the conclusion of none \nother than the Congressional Budget Office contained in the cost \nestimate section of the committee report accompanying H.R. 1534. \nAlthough CBO was unable to ascertain the increase in costs if large \nclaims were allowed to proceed in Federal courts, it did note, after \nconsulting legal experts, that ``only a small proportion [of State \ncases] would be tried in Federal Court as the result of this H.R. 1534. \n. . .''\n  It is extremely difficult to prove a takings claim, and this bill \ndoes not in any way redefine what constitutes a taking. These claims \nare also very expensive to bring. Like I say, the average, over the \nlast 10 years, has been 9\\1/2\\ years to bring even the most simple \nclaim to fruition or conclusion. That is not what the Founding Fathers \nthought when they did the fifth amendment allowing and putting in the \ntakings provision. These claims are expensive to bring. Paradoxically, \nlocalities' defense of Federal actions may be lessened by the bill, \nbecause localities already must litigate property rights claims on \nFederal ripeness grounds, which take years to resolve. It costs \nlocalities more money than they should have to pay.\n  Let me restate this. By providing certainty on the ripeness issue, \nthe bill may very well reduce litigation costs to localities. \nSubstantive takings claims, unless they are likely to prevail on the \nmerits, are simply too hard to prove and too expensive to bring in \nFederal court. And the issue of ripeness will have been removed by the \nbill from the already-crowded court dockets.\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\n  Madam President, it is interesting to note that once many State \nofficials, localities, and State and trade organizations really examine \nthe measure, they rapidly become supporters of the bill. Those \nsupporting the bill or increased vigilance in the property rights arena \ninclude the Governors of Tennessee, Wisconsin, Virginia, New Mexico, \nNorth Dakota, and South Carolina. They also include the American \nLegislative Exchange Council, which represents over 3,000 State \nlegislatures, and trade groups such as America's Community Bankers, the \nNational Mortgage Association of America, the National Association of \nHome Builders, the National Association of Realtors, and the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, the organ of small business in \nthis country. They are sick and tired of small businesses being taken \nadvantage of by some of these people in some of these local areas and \nState areas, and even the Federal areas, in taking their property \nwithout just compensation. Then they have to go 9\\1/2\\ years to \nvindicate their claims. By the time they get there, the property is not \nworth anything anyway, or the interest has been consumed by attorney's \nfees.\n  People who support this bill also include agricultural interests, \nsuch as the American Farm Bureau, the American Forest and Paper \nAssociation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National \nGrange Association, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Just as important, let me point out that 133 House sponsors of the \nHouse-passed bill--and that is a bill different from this one, and that \nbill is subject to some of these criticisms--we have reformed that. The \n133 House sponsors of the House-passed bill were former State and local \nofficeholders. They are not stupid. They feel just as deeply about \nState and local office concerns as anybody on this floor.\n  I find it rather amusing that the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland is so solicitous of State and local areas, having argued on the \nother side on almost every other issue that has come before the Senate. \nLet's stop and think about it. I don't believe that these 133 former \nState and local officeholders would have voted for the bill if it \nconflicted with local sovereignty. The fact is that it does not \nconflict with local sovereignty. The fact is that it gives plenty of \nreasons and plenty of avenues for the local and State and other \nmunicipalities to solve these problems.\n  We have bent over backwards trying to accommodate those expressing \nconcern about the bill which passed out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. We met with city mayors, representatives of local \ngovernmental organizations, attorneys general, and religious groups, to \nname a few. Some of these have signed these recent letters. I am not \nsure they understand any of these issues, let alone how much we have \nmade in changes to this bill.\n  We held group meetings and asked for suggestions and changes to the \nbill, which would alleviate opposition and concerns. I thank Senators \nAbraham, Ashcroft, DeWine, Specter, Thompson, and respective staffs, \nfor negotiating and drafting changes to the bill designed to meet the \nconcerns of particularly certain localities. These changes alleviate \nmunicipalities' concerns that the bill would become a vehicle for \nfrivolous and novel suits. They remove any incentive the bill may have \nfor property owners to file specious suits against localities. They \nfoster negotiations to resolve problems, and these changes recognize \nthe right of the States and localities to abate nuisances without \nhaving to pay compensation.\n\n  First of all, we created a new section dealing with the award of \nattorney's fees. In this section, we amended section 1988(b) of title \n28 of the U.S. Code, which allows a court to award litigation costs and \nattorney's fees to the prevailing party in civil rights actions. This \nchange allows a district court to hold the party seeking redress liable \nfor reasonable attorney's fees and costs if the takings claim is not \nsubstantially justified. This section was created to address the \nlocalities' concerns that they would have to defend expensive, \nfrivolous cases in Federal Court, wasting taxpayers' money. This \nsection eliminates those concerns.\n  I think that the mayor of Salt Lake might have had a different \nopinion--or other mayors that the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland has cited, or the other Governors that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island has cited. I have reason to believe that they haven't \nseen this current substitute that we have here, or they would change, \nlike so many others are changing.\n  The problem is that you get these old bills out--and, yes, there were \nproblems with the old bills, but that is what the legislative process \nis designed to correct. That is what we are doing here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am a little bit agitated right now, and I want to finish \nsome of these thoughts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, I don't want to add to the agitation of the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will just say that the distinguished Senator very seldom \ndoes.\n  Another amendment to the bill requires a party seeking redress for a \ntaking of real property to give any potential defendant written notice \n60 days prior to a commencement of action in district court. This was \nadded to address the localities' concerns that they will have \ninsufficient time to negotiate with parties seeking redress before a \nFederal action was filed. This delay, I might add, acts as an \ninducement to seek compromise.\n  In addition, we added a nuisance provision to the purpose section of \nthe bill that confirms State power to prevent land uses that are \nnuisances. I suspect that a house of prostitution would be a nuisance \nalongside a church or some other place. Perhaps there are many in this \nbody that might agree with me that it is a nuisance, period. Under \nexisting law, States have authority to abate nuisances and zone for \ncommercial or residential uses. The Supreme Court, in Lucas v. South \nCarolina Coastal Council, held that such State actions require no \ncompensation to affected landowners.\n  This change in the bill thus makes clear that State prerogatives are \nnot altered. The bill, in any event, changes no substantive law and \nmerely allows property owners fair access to the Federal courts after \nhaving gone through a variety of procedures in the State courts. And \nreasonable procedures at that, but not after 9\\1/2\\ years of being \njerked around by some of the State courts, and Federal courts, by the \nway, because the Federal courts have been jerking them around, too, \nrefusing to hear some of these cases on the doctrine of rightness, and \nthe other doctrines that I have mentioned.\n\n  All this belies the bizarre and false allegations, such as the one \ncontained in the Minority Views of the H.R. 1534 Committee Report, that \nif the bill passes localities may not prohibit gas stations in \nresidential areas unless compensation is paid.\n  Give me a break.\n  Finally, to narrow the scope of the ripeness provision, we limited \nthe term ``property owner'' to include only ``owners of real \nproperty.'' This change greatly narrows the procedural effects of this \nbill because the provisions of the bill that expedite access to the \nfederal courts now will only encompass real property and, thus, will \nnot apply to suits involving personal or intellectual property.\n  So we have solved that problem, which was a legitimate question, \nalthough really we ought to be protecting all property since this is a \nfundamental right of the fifth amendment of the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America, one that is ignored most of the time in our \ncountry.\n\n\n  the states rights issue: why s. 2271 does not impact states' rights\n\n  S. 2271 affects only federal claims being brought before federal \ncourt. State and local claims, claims based on state or local law, are \nnot affected by S. 2271. The fact that constitutional claims can arise \nfrom the actions of local governments does not make them any less a \nfederal claim, any more than a violation of First Amendment rights are \nfederal claims whether it is a federal or local official doing the \nviolating.\n  The Supreme Court has long held that the Eleventh Amendment makes \nstate governments acting under state law immune from suits filed under \nU.S.C. section 1983. In other words, state governments are already \nimmune from suits filed on constitutional\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\ngrounds by established Supreme court precedent, and S. 2271 does \nnothing to change that.\n  Local governments, however, are not immune from lawsuits claiming \nthat constitutional rights have been violated. Again, it is the Supreme \nCourt, not S. 2271, that has made local agencies subject to federal \nclaims by individuals alleging their rights have been violated.\n  All S. 2271 does is ensure that when a suit is filed in federal \ncourt, the case can be heard on the merits, rather than spending time \nand money to determine whether the case is ``ripe.''\n  State and local agencies will have all the authority and power they \ncurrently have to make land use decisions--for zoning, environment, \netc. S. 2271 does not change any substantive law. But, if local \nagencies violate Fifth Amendment rights when making land use decisions, \nS. 2271 helps a property owner get a more expedient hearing on the \nmerits without the 10-year ripeness battle, which is one of the most \nfutile experiences anyone can go through.\n  The property owner, under S. 2271, will still have to make at least \none meaningful appeal to the agency in question before bringing a \nlawsuit. That means agencies have at least two cracks at making a \nbalanced decision that protects the environment and public health while \nprotecting the rights of private property owners. In the real world, \nproperty owners will likely try repeatedly, because the chances of \ngetting a favorable ruling in court on the merits is extremely slim--\nand S. 2271 offers no help there.\n  The reason the bill refers to a property owner being rejected on \n``one meaningful application'' and ``one appeal or waiver'' before a \ndecision is considered final is to create some objective criteria so \nboth the property owner and the land-use agency in question know when \n``enough is enough.'' The language actually codifies a body of federal \ncases requiring that a property owner make ``one meaningful \napplication'' to the relevant land-use decision making body to ripen a \nConstitutional claim. (e.g. Eastern Minerals Int'l Inc. versus United \nStates; Kawaoka versus City of Arroyo Grande; Unity Ventures versus \nLake County.) The point is that property owners should not be forced to \nnegotiate away portions of his or her constitutional rights in a series \nof re-applications and appeals as a condition of gaining access to \nfederal court with a Constitutional claim. The fact that different \ncities or states may have varying procedures or multiple steps for \nmaking a final determination on land use is not at issue in this bill. \nThe bill does not define what a ``meaningful application'' is, because \nit recognizes that different states and cities handle land use \napplications differently--the bill tries to be respectful of those \ndifferences and allow state and local officials determine that \nquestion.\n  If there is a threshold question of state or local law that is \nessential to the merits of the federal claim, and it is patently \nunclear or confusing, the federal court can, under S. 2271, have that \nquestion certified in state court under whatever procedures the state \nhas in effect for certifying questions for a federal court.\n  In other words, if a federal claim involves an important issue of \nstate law, the state courts will have first crack at it under S. 2271. \nThe only difference is that the property owner will not get turned away \nfrom federal court and forced to file the whole claim again in state \ncourt, and go through a 10-year delay process that literally is \nsubverting the very constitutional provisions that we are sworn to \nuphold.\n\n  This bill is pretty well thought out, and, frankly, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a whole raft of letters from various people who are in \nsupport of this bill ranging from these various groups and so forth be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Associated General Contractors of \n     America (AGC) supports H.R. 1534, the Private Property Rights \n     Implementation Act. This legislation will provide access to \n     justice for private property owners subject to takings by the \n     federal government.\n       The legislation defines what is a final administrative \n     decision by the federal government under the ``ripeness \n     doctrine.'' For private property owners, the bill determines \n     what the last administrative appeal is, triggering an owner \n     filing for compensation when the government has taken or \n     devalued property. Recent private property cases heard by the \n     Supreme Court were merely decisions allowing private property \n     owners to pursue a ``takings'' claim under the Constitution's \n     5th Amendment protections. Property owners have been \n     prevented from going to court regarding a takings claim when \n     a lower court rules the administrative appeals process has \n     not been exhausted. In this legislation, Congress will \n     prevent further costly, unnecessary litigation by providing \n     access to courts, ensuring federal courts will hear takings \n     cases.\n       AGC urges you to support this legislation. This will \n     prevent lengthy administrative cases and allows private \n     property owners immediate and appropriate redress of a \n     takings claim.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Loren E. Sweatt,\n\n                                 Director, Congressional Relations\n     Procurement and Environment.\n                                  ____\n\n                            American Forest and Paper Association,\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Senate will have the opportunity as \n     early as Monday, July 13, to cast a vote in support of \n     private property owners by voting in favor of S. 2271, the \n     ``Property Rights Implementation Act'' on the Senate floor. \n     On behalf of the American Forest & Paper Association, and the \n     9 million woodlot owners in this country, we urge you to vote \n     ``yes'' to invoke cloture and on final passage of this bill. \n     A vote in support of S. 2271 will be considered a key vote on \n     behalf of our membership.\n       S. 2271 is a moderate, balanced, bipartisan effort to \n     ensure that private property owners have their day in court. \n     The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states that private \n     property should not be taken by the government for public use \n     unless the owner is paid just compensation. However, recent \n     studies have shown that property owners attempting to protect \n     their property rights in federal court are rejected on \n     procedural grounds over 80% of the time without ever getting \n     a hearing on the merits of their case. Those who do get their \n     day in court are forced to spend an average of nearly 10 \n     years in litigation and procedural hurdles.\n       S. 2271 is strictly a procedural bill--it does not define a \n     ``taking'' or mandate compensation. The bill:\n       Helps property owners obtain federal court relief more \n     quickly and more affordably to preserve their \n     Constitutionally-protected property rights.\n       Does not change substantive law. Property owners still must \n     have the facts and prove their case. The bill does not create \n     any new cause of action for property owners to give federal \n     courts more power and authority than they have already.\n       Does not destroy the current exercise of state authority to \n     determine land use, but does require states to use their \n     procedures in a fair and constitutional way.\n       Affects only Federal claims. Federal courts will still be \n     able to send unresolved state claims back to state court for \n     certification before the federal courts go forward.\n       Streamlines the federal court docket by simplifying the \n     federal procedures for constitutional takings claims.\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this important \n     legislation. We strongly urge you to support S. 2271 on the \n     Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John H. Dressendorfer,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I listened with interest to my good \nfriend, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah. He said that \nperhaps some of those who are opposed to this may not understand the \nbill. There is a reason for this. The bill we are discussing is S. 2271 \nwhich was introduced just last week. We never had a hearing on S. 2271. \nWhile we had a hearing on H.R. 1534 this bill is significantly \ndifferent from S. 2271. S. 2271 was just printed late last week and \nmany Members may not have had an opportunity to carefully review it.\n  This new bill just came bouncing in here. We haven't had one single \nhearing on this particular bill. My good friend from Utah talks of the \ncare that went into it. This arrived full-blown, full-grown on the \nSenate floor--not one single Senate hearing on this bill. In fact, the \nbill on which we did hold a hearing, H.R. 1534, apparently bothered \nthem enough that it was significantly changed. We haven't done a report \non S. 2271. One was done on H.R. 1534 but not on S. 2271. Madam \nPresident, no\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\nSenator can point to 30 seconds of Senate hearing on S. 2271. No \nSenator can point to a two-sentence report on this bill.\n  A lot of Senators probably did not even have a chance to look at S. \n2271. Apparently, they thought H.R. 1534 should be changed. But this is \na new bill that many of us feel is worse than its predecessor. But \nthere have been no hearings on the changed text. There is no report on \nS. 2271, and under some new streamlined process the bill was just sent \nto the floor. We will vote on S. 2271, and then we will debate it \nlater. It is like Alice in Wonderland. You have the sentencing first, \nand the trial later. This is not the way the U.S. Senate should act.\n  I think that is why the National Governors' Association, the National \nLeague of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the National Conference of State Legislatures \nall stated their opposition to this new bill. Just 3 days ago, they \nsaid:\n\n       A review of the most recent proposed revisions to the \n     legislation makes clear that those changes do not address our \n     fundamental problems with the bill * * * The framers of the \n     Constitution never intended federal courts to be the first \n     resort in resolving community disputes between local \n     governments and private parties. In our view, these issues \n     should be settled locally, as close to the affected community \n     as possible.\n\n  In fact, some would say H.R. 1534, the earlier bill, would be better \nthan S. 2271. S. 2271 is more burdensome to local governments than \nearlier versions.\n  First, the revised bill goes even further in limiting Federal judges' \nability to abstain from cases dealing with local land use decisions. \nMaybe they have to abstain because we don't fill the vacancies of \nFederal courts. But assuming there is a Federal court and a Federal \njudge who has been lucky enough to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, \nthey have a limited ability to abstain. In S. 2271 a Federal judge in \nmany circumstances cannot abstain from or relinquish jurisdiction to a \nState court because the plaintiff ``brings a prior or concurrent \nproceeding before a State, territory, or local tribunal.''\n  This revision effectively turns the earlier version of this provision \non its head. Rather than leaving room for abstention when a State law \nclaim is asserted, the revised version specifically states that a \ndistrict court shall not abstain when there is a State law claim.\n  I don't know when we have ever done anything like this. This is an \nunprecedented big-foot action on the part of the Federal Government of \nstepping in and telling local citizens and state courts, ``You don't \ncount,'' as far as the U.S. Senate is concerned.\n  Rather than reducing interference with State court resolution of \nState and local law issues, the revised version of the bill actually \nwould maximize Federal court interference with State courts.\n  Second, the revisions make the bill worse from a local government \nstandpoint by eliminating the authority conferred on local governments \nin the bill as reported by committee to define a ``meaningful \napplication.''\n  Instead, the revised bill would allow Federal courts to get into \nlooking at local land use requirements and applications. Other changes \nin the bill are either harmful, cosmetic or without significant effect.\n  As a general matter, the bill would introduce new vague terminology \nwhich could lead to years of litigation over the meaning of this new \nlanguage. And, of course, we are asked to enact S. 2271 without even a \nreport. Enactment of the new legislation would make land use litigation \nprocess more time-consuming.\n  Look at the insertion of the phrase ``one meaningful application to \nuse the property . . . within a reasonable time.'' This change \nostensibly addresses the concern that H.R. 1534, as reported, suggests \nan applicant only had to initiate a local application or waiver \nproceeding, but not necessarily await the outcome of the proceeding \nbefore suing in Federal court.\n  The change to ``within a reasonable time'' simply confirms that in \nsome circumstances a developer would be able to proceed to Federal \ncourt without first obtaining local decisions. Many States and local \ngovernments already have specific time limits for administrative \ndecisions. That seems to throw it out of the window.\n  I have said over and over again that when property is taken, the \nlandowner should be compensated. That is what our Constitution \nrequires--it requires just compensation. That is what local, State and \nfederal Governments are doing. Certainly, there has been no need for \nsuch sweeping legislation demonstrated.\n  I wish we had an opportunity to work with the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to have a better bill. It is his prerogative not to \nhave a hearing on this particular bill or to have a detailed report on \nit.\n  And we have instances where my friend from Utah says that this bill \napplies only to owners of property, but it defines owner as the owner \nor possessor of property or rights in property. That is more expansive \nthan the normal meaning of the word owner. Somebody who steals property \nis a possessor of property. An adverse possessor of property is by \ndefinition in possession of the property. As I said, we have a case \nhere where something is not broken, but we are about to fix it anyway.\n  Madam President, I withhold the balance of my time. I ask the Chair, \nhow much time remains to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 39 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withhold that time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Utah \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 22 minutes 48 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this, that we have held hearings through \nthe years on similar bills, and we have held hearings on the underlying \nbill. We made four changes, which I outlined in my last remarks. So the \nhearings were held and the changes were made to accommodate some of the \nconcerns of those who have been critical of this bill. So this is not \nwithout hearings, and it is not without an understanding.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank you. I thank my colleague for \nyielding.\n  I would like to say that I think comments made today are living proof \nof the old adage that no good deed ever goes unpunished. The plain \ntruth is that we have had numerous hearings on the issue of private \nproperty and takings. Our colleague from Utah has been a leader in this \neffort. We are considering this bill today because he has continually \ntried to accommodate people who oppose the underlying amendment that he \nhas so effectively championed.\n  The issue before us today is not an issue of technicalities. It is \nnot an issue of whether or not a certain number of mayors or Governors \nor locally elected officials think one thing or think another. The \nissue before us is, are we going to effectively enforce the \nConstitution of the United States?\n\n  What an incredible paradox it is that if we had similar legislation \nbefore the Senate to enforce our first amendment rights to freedom of \nreligion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of the right \nto assemble, and to address the Government about our grievances, we \nwould have 100 Members of the Senate here demanding that the Senator's \nbill be adopted. If the Senator from Utah was simply trying to \nguarantee our freedom of speech and religion by setting out a clear \ncourse where ordinary people could have a day in court in determining \nwhether their first amendment rights had been respected or abused, we \nwould have 100 Members of the Senate supporting this bill.\n  The real issue before us is that there are many Members of the \nSenate, many Governors, many locally elected officials who do not \nsupport our fifth amendment rights. The fifth amendment to the \nConstitution says, ``Nor shall private property be taken for public use \nwithout just compensation.''\n  We all know, and it is the reason that this amendment is before us, \nthat every day in America private property is being taken without just \ncompensation. We all know in the name of endangered species, in the \nname of wetlands, in the name of numerous other public purposes, \nprivate property rights are being trampled on and people are finding \ntheir property taken or\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\ndramatically reduced in value because of some public objective. The \nopposition to this amendment is not based on technicalities. The \nopposition to this amendment is not based on some letter signed by some \nlocal officials or some State legislators. The opposition to this \namendment is based on the fact that there are many in the country and \nmany in the Congress who would like the fifth amendment guarantees of \nprotecting private property to be gone. These guarantees stood up very \nwell until the Depression era when the Supreme Court basically started \nto rule against private property. The Supreme Court and the lower \ncourts have now moved back toward recognizing and respecting the fifth \namendment. But the problem is that a lot of ordinary people have \ntrouble getting their day in court. They often find themselves \nshuffling between the district court and the Court of Claims trying to \nuphold their rights.\n  So what does the bill before us do? It sets out a very simple process \nwhereby people who believe that their private property rights have been \ntrampled on can go into Federal court and have their day in court and \nhave a decision made. I believe that private property is at least as \nimportant as the right of freedom of religion and speech. Our Founding \nFathers understood that if your property is not secure, your right to \nfreedom of religion and your right to freedom of speech can be \nabridged. Our Founding Fathers understood that private property is not \nonly a human right; it is the basic human right. It is a foundation \nright of the American Republic. And, more important, it has been a \nfoundation right of every great civilization in history.\n\n  Will Durant, in talking about Rome and the rise of Rome says, ``Never \nwas there a day when private property did not exist in Rome.'' The \nfoundation of ancient Athens was private property, and the respect for \nprivate property. It cannot be a happy day in America when private \nproperty rights are trampled upon. Those who oppose the fifth amendment \nsay, ``If you made the Government pay people when we took their \nproperty for these good purposes, then we wouldn't be able to take \ntheir property for these good purposes.'' They say, ``Surely it is \nworth it to protect the wetlands and endangered species and thousands \nof other objectives to be able to take people's property. And if we had \nto compensate them, we couldn't promote these public purposes.''\n  I would just conclude by making two points. No. 1, why should the \nproperty owner, and the property owner alone, be forced to bear the \ncost of promoting these public objectives? And, second, when the \nFounding Fathers wrote, ``Nor shall private property be taken for \npublic use without just compensation,'' is it not clear that they were \nnot just talking about taking your property to build a road across, \nthey were talking about Government action that profoundly lowered the \nvalue of land in use or exchange?\n  So, this is not a debate about technicalities. It is not a debate \nabout letters signed by local officials or State officials. It is a \ndebate about the Constitution and about the fifth amendment. Those who \nbelieve in private property, those who support private property rights, \nwill vote for this amendment. And those who do not support private \nproperty, those who believe that public purpose is more important than \nprivate property and that taking property without compensation to \npromote some public good--as they would define it--will vote ``no'' on \nthis amendment.\n  Many will try to confuse the voter about what the issue is. The issue \nis the fifth amendment. The issue is whether or not we respect private \nproperty and private property rights in America. I respect private \nproperty and private property rights in America. That is why I am for \nthe pending bill. I hope my colleagues will vote ``yes.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have another matter pressing. I am \ngoing to leave the remainder of my time in the hands of the Senator \nfrom Washington. I know the Senator from Rhode Island and others still \nwant to speak. There will be time. I believe I have close to 40 minutes \nleft--30-some-odd minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I now yield to the Senator from Washington such time as \nshe may need, and she would then reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent a fellow from my office, Micki \nAronson, be granted the privilege of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to S. 2271, \nthe bill before the Senate this evening. I do so knowing that I have \nthe support of the vast majority of Washington State voters who, 3 \nyears ago, soundly defeated a radical and dangerous referendum that is \nvery similar to the bill that is before us today. In 1995, the people \nof Washington State overwhelmingly rejected a referendum that would \nhave put developers and resource exploiters ahead of the rest of us. \nThey defeated this proposal because they knew it really only amounted \nto one thing: a massive tax increase on regular people. Developers and \ntheir supporters would have us pay for the right to a high quality of \nlife and strong communities, whereas today we enjoy these things as a \nresult of basic zoning laws and environmental standards.\n  While the measure before us differs somewhat from Referendum 48, its \nunderlying motive does not. Developers somehow believe that they are \nbeing denied their property rights by having to work through local and \nState land use laws. And, to be fair, there have been some isolated \ncases in which a maze of laws has thwarted reasonable environmentally \nsensitive projects. I personally will continue to urge local and State \ngovernments to streamline their processes to fix these occasional \nproblems.\n  But, basically, the system works. It is simply not broken, and this \nbill is not necessary.\n  Mr. President, the most objectionable provision in this bill is that \nit allows developers to short-circuit local administrative, zoning, and \nother land use procedures. This promises to send increased litigation \nagainst already strapped local and State governments. This means more \ntaxes, both to fund the court battles and, if local governments lose, \nto pay off developers to protect our quality of life. In addition, \nsimply the threat of a Federal court may drive a town to acquiesce to a \ndeveloper's demands, because they cannot afford to go to court and \nfight to protect their local land use decisions.\n  Frankly, I am surprised at the support this bill has gotten from \nthose who traditionally would defer to local government making \ndecisions on how best to use land and instead give that decision making \nauthority to Federal courts. This seems like quite a reversal. Frankly, \nit seems particularly odd, given the Senate's backlog in filling \nFederal court vacancies.\n  While we have moved two of our Washington State candidates--Margaret \nMcKeown and Ed Shea--both Senator Gorton and I are pushing very hard to \nget another circuit court nominee, Ron Gould, and a district court \nnominee, Bob Lasnik, heard and confirmed. Another district court judge \nis set to retire in the near future, creating another vacancy. I have \nto ask, Why is the Senate increasing Federal caseloads with this bill \nwhile simultaneously not filling empty seats?\n  That issue aside, this bill is not what this country needs. We do not \nneed to undermine our Nation's laws that protect public health, safety, \nand the environment. There are usually very good reasons why \ndevelopment is prohibited in certain areas. It could be safety; the \narea could be prone to flooding or to landslides. It could be \nprotection of water quality. It might be protection of threatened \nendangered species or ecosystems. And, in those cases where a local, \nState, or Federal entity does unreasonably and actually take a private \nperson's property for a public good, we have a well-established legal \nsystem to provide compensation. And that system is working.\n  Let me close by reminding everyone that the Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the National Conference of State \nLegislators oppose this legislation. In addition, every conservation \ngroup I am\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\naware of opposes this. This is simply not good public policy.\n  I am committed to keeping the Pacific Northwest beautiful. I am \ncommitted to ensuring my constituents have the power to enact \nreasonable zoning ordinances to protect their water and environmental \nresources. I do not believe their taxes should be used to pay off \ndevelopers.\n  I pledge to my constituents to work to ensure that the reasons we are \nall so proud to call Washington home remain intact. This bill would \nlimit our ability to protect the things we hold precious, and I will \nvigorously oppose it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of cloture on \nS.2271, the Property Rights Implementation Act. Put simply, this bill \nis a modest effort to help property owners get their day in court.\n  Currently, it is very difficult for many landowners to get into \ncourt. When a landowner wishes to develop property, he must seek \napproval from local land use authorities, who should quickly evaluate \nthe request and make a decision. However, local bureaucracies may take \nyears to make a decision or may require the landowner to make countless \nreapplications. There is nothing the landowner can do because the \ncourts will wait on a final administrative determination before taking \nany action.\n  Under this bill, the courts eventually must act if the bureaucracy \nrefuses to make a final decision. The fundamental role of local \nauthorities in property development decisions does not change. A \nreasonable administrative determination of a claim is still required \nbefore the owner can go to court. In other words, the locality will \nstill have the upper hand, but it will not hold all the cards.\n  After a negative administrative decision, the bill allows a landowner \nto choose to go to Federal court rather than state court, but only \nunder certain limited circumstances. If a landowner brings any claims \nunder state law, even if the state claims are secondary to the Federal \nclaims, the case must proceed in state court. It is only if the \nlandowner brings solely a Federal claim for a Constitutional taking \nthat the landowner must be permitted to proceed in Federal court if he \nwishes. Moreover, once in Federal court, if an unsettled question of \nstate law arises in the case, the question must be certified to the \nstate court where possible.\n  Some opponents to this legislation have said that it will result in a \ngreat shift in public power to regulate land. They say that property \nowners will be put at a great advantage over state and local \nauthorities who are charged with controlling development, causing \nproperty owners to win many more claims. This argument will not prove \nto be correct. It cannot because the bill does not change the standard \nfor determining a property rights claim. The legislation does not \nprovide property owners any more rights than they have today, even \nthough the rights they now have are limited and uncertain under case \nlaw. It is very difficult for a property owner to show that property \nhas been taken for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, and that will not \nchange under this bill.\n  The legislation only makes it easier to get to Federal court for a \ntakings claim. It simply gives landowners a fair opportunity to get a \ndecision. It does not make it any easier for them to win.\n  A limited option of Federal court access should exist when someone is \ntrying to adjudicate their property rights secured by the Constitution. \nWhen other Constitutional rights are violated, such as the right to \nfree speech, the person can go immediately to Federal court for relief. \nWhy should the right to just compensation for a taking be any \ndifferent? Indeed, for free speech issues involving obscenity, the \ncourt must look to the standards in the local community, but the \nclaimant can still go immediately to Federal court. As Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist has written for the Court, ``We see no reason why the \nTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a part of the Bill of \nRights as the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment, should be relegated \nto the status of a poor relation.''\n  I agree with the Supreme Court. This bill would solve that major \nproblem. Yet, it makes only modest changes in the current system. I \nhope my colleagues will support this small but important step for \nfairness in property rights.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition \nto S. 2271.\n  On the face of this bill, it sounds like the proponents are seeking \nto make some ``procedural'' changes in federal court jurisdiction that \ndo not go as far as last Congress' unsuccessful attempts to change the \nstandards for granting compensation under the Fifth Amendment.\n  But no one should be mistaken. This bill would dramatically change \nthe standards--known as abstention and ripeness--which guide the \nresolution of claims for ``just compensation'' against local \ncommunities in local zoning disputes. The impact of these so-called \nprocedural changes would be very significant, making it far easier to \nseriously undermine local land-use decisions. As a New York Times \neditorial stated with respect to the related House bill: ``(The bill) \nis a dangerous piece of work that would threaten local zoning laws, \nreshape time-honored principles of federalism and make Federal judges \nthe arbiters of land-use decisions everywhere. It would be a dream come \ntrue for developers but a nightmare for rational community planning.'' \nI believe that conclusion would apply with equal force to the bill \nbefore us.\n  That is why the bill is opposed by the National Governors \nAssociation, the League of Cities, the United States Conference of \nMayors, the National Association of Counties, the Judicial Conference \nof the United States, 40 Attorneys General, major religious groups, the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation and a broad array of \nenvironmental and public interest groups.\n  For my State, this type of proposal is particularly contrary to what \nour citizens are seeking. There is no bigger issue right now in the \nState than the desire to preserve open space from development. Our \nGovernor, John Rowland, has initiated a major program to preserve open \nspace and the State Legislature has strongly supported these efforts. \nConnecticut is not unique: all over the country, states and localities \nare making preservation of open space a top priority.\n  This bill would seriously undermine these efforts by greatly \nexpanding the volume of land-use litigation against local communities. \nEqually important, the heightened threat of litigation would \nsignificantly increase the leverage of developers over local \ncommunities in negotiations over land use issues. The existing \nauthority of local governments to resolve local land use issues in \ntheir community would be undermined, and the ability of the public to \nparticipate in land-use decisions affecting their communities would be \ngreatly diminished. In short, the end result of this legislation would \nbe to undercut the ability of our nation's localities to protect zoning \nand land use regulations which average homeowners depend on to protect \ntheir investments.\n  In reviewing the Committee and Minority views on the bill considered \nby the Committee, I was particularly struck by a comment by Senator \nDeWine during the markup. He stated: ``The bill would in effect, leave \nlocal land use planners with two bad options--acquiesce to developers \nby making lenient decisions, or do whatever they think necessary to \nprotect the local community and then face multiple suits in Federal \ncourt without having much negotiating ability with property owners.'' \nSenator DeWine is right and with respect to the bill before us, too.\n  What is striking about this bill is the direct attack it makes on the \nability of local and state governments to determine what is best for \ntheir communities, despite the fact that there is no evidence that \nlocal governments are incompetent or routinely deal in bad faith with \ndevelopers. Nor is there any record to support the proposition that \nstate courts cannot deal fairly with local land use zoning disputes.\n  Mr. President, I cannot see any reason why this Senate should pass \nlegislation that is a wholesale attack on the\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\nability of our localities and states to protect the values and fabric \nof the communities in which we live. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the cloture motion.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2271--the \nProperty Rights Implementation Act of 1998.\n  As a landowner, businessman, and Senator, I have long been concerned \nthat the imposition of too many regulations adversely impact \nindividuals and businesses. For too long, bureaucrats have exercised \nbroad authority over local citizens and oftentimes trampled on their \nconstitutional rights. It is time to bring even more comprehensive \nprotections of property rights to the Senate floor for debate and a \nvote, and S. 2271 provides those missing or abused protections.\n  I am proud to say that I joined many of my colleagues last year in \nco-sponsoring S. 1204, Senator Coverdell's Property Owners Access to \nJustice Act of 1997. That bipartisan legislation--very similar to that \nwhich we are debating today--simplified access to the federal courts \nfor private property owners whose rights may have been deprived by \ngovernment actions.\n  As we all know, the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides \nour nation's citizens with certain protections against the taking of \ntheir property. In cases where a taking is required, the Constitution \nensures that the property owner is provided just compensation. \nUnfortunately, that is almost never the case and I doubt anyone in this \nchamber would claim the contrary. In the name of the ``public good,'' \ngovernments often either take property or deem it unusable for \nvirtually any productive purposes. Too often, property owners are then \nleft with a worthless piece of land for which there is no use or little \nresale value.\n  Property owners are then forced to navigate their way through a maze \nof bureaucratic red tape and unending local and state roadblocks in \nfighting any unjust action. They are forced to exhaust any and all \nstate or local remedies prior to having their claim heard in federal \ncourt. Because most property owners do not have the resources or the \ntime to fight a taxpayer-subsidized army of lawyers and hurdles, they \nmerely give up--unafforded their constitutional rights.\n  I am aware that the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, and a whole host of State Attorneys General are opposed to S. \n2271--but why? Because S. 2271 may actually force them to consider the \nrights of property owners before taking action. If the property in \nquestion is truly needed for the public good, then they should use \neminent domain and acquire the property rather than leaving the owner \nholding the bag.\n  It is important to remember several points regarding S. 2271. First, \nS. 2271 does not circumvent local governments. Property owners must \nattempt to work through local procedures and be denied at least twice \nprior to seeking federal court action. S. 2271 does not preempt local \nzoning. Any use of the land by the property owner must be consistent \nwith local zoning requirements--if not, S. 2271 does not apply. \nAdditionally, S. 2271 does not require compensation or remove the \nburden to proof from the property owner in proving harm or the \njustification for compensation.\n  Similar legislation--authorzied by Congressman Gallegly--was \nintroduced in the House last year. It quickly gathered the support of \n237 co-sponsors and passed the House last October by a vote of 248 to \n178. Likewise, S. 1204 was introduced in the Senate last September with \nSenators Landrieu and Dorgan as cosponsors. Both bills received \nsignificant bi-partisan support upon introduction and throughout the \nlegislative process.\n  Mr. President, it is time we provide property owners with certainty. \nIt is time we provide property owners with avenues for action. And it \nis time we provide property owners with the rights guaranteed them \nunder our Constitution. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the \ncloture petition for S. 2271.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the important issue \nof private property rights and to support the Property Rights \nImplementation Act of 1998, S. 2271.\n  Private property rights have been the cornerstone of our free \nsociety. The fifth amendment of our Constitution states, ``private \nproperty shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.'' \nCurrently, too many Americans are being denied fair access to Federal \ncourts in order to uphold their fifth amendment constitutional rights.\n  S. 2271 would expedite access to the federal courts for individuals \nhurt by a government ``taking'' of private property. At the same time, \nit protects states rights by ensuring that any question of state or \nlocal law that is unclear to the fundamental merits of a case is to be \nsent back to the state courts before a federal court can continue.\n  Mr. President, the right of the people to be represented and heard is \nthe basis of our government.\n  S. 2271 gives us the opportunity to ensure that the people of our \nnation are not ignored. It allows an individual citizen to exercise \ntheir fifth amendment rights provided to them by our founding fathers \nwithout costing them thousands of dollars and without taking 8 or 10 \nyears of court proceedings to maintain these rights. As we've all heard \nbefore, ``justice delayed is justice denied.''\n  S. 2271 only re-enforces the constitution and the intent of our \nfounding Fathers who understood the value of private property from the \nstandpoint of individual political freedoms and individual economic \nfreedoms. Those who would argue in opposition are supporting more \ngovernment control by not allowing an individual to care for their own \nproperty. I believe each individual land owner can and should be \nresponsible for their property without breaking current environmental, \nfederal, state, or local laws. This bill does not create special rights \nfor property owners; it simply allows them the same access to federal \ncourts as other plaintiffs claiming a violation of their constitutional \nrights.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons I stand in support of S. 2271 and \nhope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will do the same. I \nalso want to thank Mr. Lott and Mr. Hatch for bringing this important \nlegislation to the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion \nto proceed to consideration of S. 2271, the Property Rights \nImplementation Act of 1998. This bill, introduced by the senior Senator \nfrom Utah, incorporates provisions of the bipartisan bill I introduced \nlast year along with the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, on \nthis same subject.\n  Our legislation, the Property Owners Access to Justice Act, was \nintroduced to simplify access to the federal courts for private \nproperty owners. S. 2271 would accomplish the same objective. The \nConstitution requires that when the government takes private property \nfor a public purpose, the property owner must receive just \ncompensation. This ``takings clause'' guarantee is one of the strongest \ndefenses we have against arbitrary government.\n  Yet in many cases property owners must navigate a time-consuming and \nexpensive procedural maze to protect their rights. Federal courts do \nnot consider a takings case ``ripe'' for their consideration until all \nstate law issues have been resolved and all administrative remedies \nexhausted. For property owners this can mean years of court battles and \ntens of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to win the right to \nhave a federal court hear the merits of their case. One study found \nless than 6% of takings claims filed between 1983 and 1988 were ever \ndeemed ripe for federal court adjudication.\n  Small landowners, first-time home buyers, and family farmers simply \ncannot afford this process. They deserve to have their claims heard and \ntheir rights in their own property settled.\n  S. 2271 sets a clear standard for when a claimant has exhausted all \nadministrative remedies by defining when a ``final decision'' has been \nreached for purposes of ripeness doctrine. It also allows property \nowners to choose whether to assert their Fifth Amendment rights in \nstate or federal court.\n  The supporters of S. 2271 believe that property owners deserve the \nsame access to justice as persons defending their rights to free \nspeech, freedom of religion, due process, or any other freedom \nprotected by the Constitution. If your rights under the First Amendment \nare infringed by the government,\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\nyou are not told to endure endless administrative hearings before \nseeking to uphold your rights in court. Fifth Amendment rights deserve \nthe same degree of protection. Under the S. 2271, private property \nowners will no longer be turned away at the courthouse door.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that S. 2271 is strictly \nprocedural in nature. It does not change substantive law. It does not \ndefine a ``taking'' or establish a trigger for when compensation is \ndue. It does not give property owners any special access to the federal \ncourts. On the contrary, it allows property owners the same access to \nfederal courts that other claimants currently have.\n  The property owner would still shoulder the burden of proving that he \nor she has been injured and deserves compensation. The bill gives \nproperty owners a choice of how and where to assert their property \nrights under the Constitution. If the property owner wants to pursue \naction against a local or state agency that has infringed on his or her \nrights, the property owner can sue in state or local court, as he would \nnow. Or, if the property owner wants to reject that route and instead \npursue a Fifth Amendment takings claim, the case can be heard in \nfederal court.\n  We should note that the provisions of this bill only apply to Fifth \nAmendment constitutional claims. Issues relating to state law or local \nordinances or regulations would be resolved in state court. This bill \ndoes not bring state law claims into federal court.\n  Opponents of this legislation have claim that it will abolish local \ncontrol over zoning decisions or will federalize zoning law. \nSuggestions that this bill intrudes on the prerogatives of local \ngovernments are simply wrong.\n  Under the bill, a property owner must submit a land use application \nto the local entity with authority to make land use decisions. If an \napplication is denied, the applicant will have to either reapply or \nfile for an appeal. If the local land use authority explained the \ndenial and how to change the application so that it would be approved, \nthe applicant must reapply taking into account the suggestions in the \nnew application. If the second application is denied, the applicant may \ngo to the next step--the applicant must appeal or request a waiver of \nthat land use decision to the administrative body with the power to \nreview those decisions. If a local elected body exists in the locality \nwhich has the power to review appeal decisions or land use decisions, \nthe applicant must seek review from that body. If that review is \ndenied, then a final decision for purposes of ripeness has been reached \nand the applicant may then file a claim in federal court.\n  There are at least three and up to five opportunities for the local \nland use agencies and governments to make critical decisions regarding \nland use applications in their community before an applicant would be \nable to file a claim in federal court. Anyone who runs that gauntlet \nand still wants to file a federal claim may or may not prevail on the \nmerits, but the claim will certainly not be frivolous.\n  S. 2271 applies to claims filed in federal court which involve only a \nfederal Fifth Amendment taking claim. A federal court may still dismiss \nthe case or send it back to state court if there is a pending state \nclaim based on the same set of facts, the claim asserts state law \nclaims, or the claim involves a state regulatory matter. But the \nfundamental purpose of this bill is to enable citizens to defend their \nfederal constitutional rights in federal court. This in no way \ndenigrates the lawful authority of local governments over land use, \nbecause all levels of government must obey the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, S. 2271 is a narrowly targeted but vitally important \nstep toward restoring full protection of a fundamental constitutional \nright. I urge support for the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments to state \nmy opposition to S. 2271, the Private Property Rights Implementation \nAct of 1998.\n  First, Mr. President, on behalf of my constituents, I want to \nindicate my strong concerns about the manner in which this bill has \ncome to the Senate floor, and indicate why I opposed cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to this bill. If necessary, I will return to the \nfloor to discuss my concerns about this legislation in greater detail. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, upon which I serve, reported H.R. 1534, \nthe Citizen's Access to Justice Act of 1997, with amendments. I voted \nagainst reporting that measure.\n  In an effort to address concerns raised in Committee debate when the \nbill was reported, the Chairman and Senior Senator from Utah (Mr. \nHatch) announced that he would work with Committee members to seek \nnecessary improvements. The bill now before us embodies what the \nChairman would have offered on the floor as a substitute amendment to \nH.R. 1534 as reported. Not only do I take exception to the result of \nthis attempt to ``improve'' the bill but I am also alarmed at the speed \nwith which this measure has been brought to the floor. The resulting \nbill number shuffle and procedural debate over whether or not the \nproponents would be offering a substitute amendment has left my \nconstituents, on both sides of this issue, frustrated and confused.\n  This extremely technical and complicated matter is of critical \nimportance to a wide variety of interests in my state who have followed \nthis legislation since the early days of this Congress. Thus, I had \nhoped to act with greater concern for those constituents interested in \nthe outcome of this measure as we sought to move it to the floor.\n  Procedurally, I am also concerned, Mr. President, that S. 2271 \ndiffers significantly from the legislation the Judiciary Committee \nreported. Members, for the first time, have heard about the substance \nof this bill through floor debate today. Given the potential impact of \nthis legislation on both the federal government and local governments' \nfinancing and regulatory structures that we should have given members \nboth a comprehensive written description of the changes contained in S. \n2271 and additional opportunities to discuss this legislation with \ntheir constituents.\n  I voted against this measure in Committee and oppose the bill \ncurrently before the Senate for a number of reasons. First, this bill \nwill result in a increase in litigation over local zoning matters in \nfederal courts. As a result of the Listening Sessions I hold in every \nWisconsin county every year I have worked with constituents on a number \nof regulatory red tape issues. It is clear that the last thing \nWisconsinites want or need is a bill that ``takes'' scarce resources \naway from local governments by exposing state and local officials in \nour state to threat of federal liability in their attempts to control \nlocal land use and follow federal law.\n  As my colleagues have pointed out, this bill creates an opportunity \nfor clever lawyers to profit at the expense of local ordinances to \nwhich we in the Judiciary Committee, and in this body, normally claim \nto defer. Certainly, this bill is not consistent with any claim of \ndeference to state and local authority. It is an explicit transfer of \npower to the federal government.\n  This bill purports to lessen the impact upon the prerogatives of \nlocal governments, but it continues to allow broad exceptions to the \nvery abbreviation of local land use processes which the bill itself \nmandates, a process which can be now be the subject of federal \nlitigation.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee (Mr. Leahy) has \nexplained that S. 2271 lowers two threshold barriers to bringing \ntakings claims against federal and local governments in federal courts. \nIt does so by legislating both the circumstances under which courts can \nabstain from hearing a case and dictating when a claim may be heard by \na federal court --known as ``ripeness.''\n  In the case of takings lawsuits against the federal government, a \ncase is ripe for adjudication when, as the bill defines it, a federal \nagency has made a ``final decision.'' A ``final decision'' exists when \nan either an application or an appeal to use the property has been \nsubmitted but not been approved ``within a reasonable time.'' Similar \nlanguage is incorporated to specify when suits can be brought against \nlocal governments, and that section is somewhat more deferential to \nlocal governments. The bill is more deferential to local land use \nregulatory bodies, unlike when a claim is brought against a federal \nagency, by arguably making it more likely that an initial application \nwill be filed.\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\n  Let me repeat that for colleagues, to make it clear. Under this \nlegislation in certain circumstances an individual is able to sue the \nfederal government for a taking without even submitting an application \nto a federal agency to determine whether the action they propose \nviolates federal law. The bill says that the party seeking redress \nunder this bill would not be required to submit an application or \nappeal if the district court holds that such actions would be futile. \nFutility is defined as the inability to seek or obtain approvals to use \nreal property as defined under applicable land use or environmental \nlaw. I would point out that while futility is defined for actions in \ndistrict courts, there is no definition of futility for the Court of \nClaims, though an individual making a claim against the federal \ngovernment has the option under this legislation, which also concerns \nthis Senator, to sue in either court. These provisions allow litigation \nnot when a Constitutional right is deprived, that is when the \ngovernment denies compensation for restricted use or condemnation of \nproperty, but rather when the use of the property itself has some \nconditions placed upon it.\n  I would like my colleagues to think for a moment about what kind of \nanti-regulatory and anti-compliance actions the futility exemption in \nthis legislation would encourage. Such language suggests that if one \nknew or might know, as an experienced developer, that a particular type \nof wetland filling activity would not be likely to be permitted under \nthe Clean Water Act, then one would be free to claim that requesting a \npermit for such an activity would be futile and sue the federal \ngovernment.\n  Even if the government dismisses that case, as I am sure the bill's \nsupporters argue it would, because there are no supporting facts and no \napplication, under the language of this bill the court isn't allowed to \nabstain. Aren't we sending the wrong message, Mr. President? In \nWisconsin, often my constituents are unaware when an action they have \ntaken requires them to interact with a federal agency, and my office \nhelps constituents in those circumstances. But this legislation \nexplicitly provides that if know that an action is prohibited, you may \nsue to be compensated being denied the right to do it anyway. And for \nthose who will argue that such suits won't happen, I'd reply by saying \nit's a genuine risk under this legislation. If an extreme suit against \nthe government is successful, the federal government is obligated to \npay the court costs of prevailing plaintiffs.\n  These same provisions apply to suits against local governments, \nthough courts can abstain if an initial application isn't filed and \nthere is some discretion given about whether prevailing plaintiffs \nwould have to be awarded court costs. I also want to make clear that \nthis bill applies to local land use decisions because I believe there \nmay be some Senators who are under the impression that this bill \napplies only to actions taken by federal agencies.\n  However, this is not the case. S. 2271 contains additional provisions \nwhich limit local decision making, expanding upon similar provisions \ncontained in the House-passed version of this legislation. For example \nit would require a land-use applicant to ``take into account'' any \nsuggestions given by the land use agency which denied the application \nwhen reapplying before the applicant pursues federal litigation. This \nlanguage is still unclear, and certainly local governments that will \nhave their hands tied by this bill share this view.\n  Second, I remain concerned that this bill applies to all forms of \nproperty. Proponents claim that it only applies to real property. It \nmay indirectly expand of the definition of private property. This will \nundoubtedly lead to creative lawsuits and increased costs for the \ntaxpayers.\n  This bill allows vindication of ``all interests constituting property \nrights, as defined by Federal or State law, protected under the fifth \nand fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.'' I would \nremind my colleagues that ``all interests constituting property'' is a \nmuch broader category than real estate. Moreover, the bill creates the \nright of access to federal court for any actions taken by federal \nagencies as described in Section 6 that ``infringe or take'' the rights \nto ``use and enjoy real property.''\n\n  Starting down the road of extending litigation rights to all forms of \nproperty, and all uses of property may lead the federal government to \nprotect interests we might otherwise not protect.\n  Take for example contractual rights to receive water from the federal \ngovernment. At present, there is no federal right to ``receive'' water \nexcept as provided by a contract, even though a supply of water clearly \nis related to the ability to produce crops on one's real property. The \nBureau of Reclamation delivers water in 17 Western states, pursuant to \ncontracts, for primarily agricultural purposes. Each year, it allocates \nwater based upon supplies available in reservoirs and other storage \nfacilities. Most contracts generally anticipate that delivered \nquantities may vary on an annual basis.\n  During the drought of 1993, the Bureau of Reclamation reduced the \nquantities of water supplied to the Westlands Water District. It \nallocated a portion of the limited water available to protect fish in \naccordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. When \nagricultural users received only 50 percent of their contract \nquantities, Westlands sued alleging that the liability limitations of \nthe contract were invalid and that the agricultural users were \nguaranteed a fixed quantity of water at a fixed price. They contended \nthat despite the liability limitations of the contract, the Bureau's \nwater allocation decisions improperly deprived them of water and \nentitled them to compensation.\n  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Westlands' claim, \nsustaining the federal government's contract defense. This legislation \nwould create an expedited procedure for bringing takings claims, and \nspecifically provides for causes of action when ``use'' is restricted, \nthus potentially compromising the federal governments' argument in the \nWestlands case that the government was in compliance with the contract. \nIn response to questions I submitted about last Congress's takings \nlegislation, which had similar definitions of ``use,'' then Counselor \nto the Secretary of the Interior Joseph Sax wrote explicitly about the \nAdministration's concerns with the potential for property rights \nlegislation to create a new category of federal water law:\n\n       Where Congress has recently restructured federal \n     reclamation projects to direct more economically and \n     environmentally sensitive management, as it has done for \n     example in California's Central Valley Project,. . .[a]ny \n     steps the Department of Interior takes to implement these \n     congressionally ratified improvements would doubtless result \n     in demands for compensation by affected interests if these \n     bills became law.\n\n  Other portions of the bill raise similar questions. For example, is \nit the intent of the language to suggest that any person taking an \naction that causes injury to a property right, but doesn't actually \ntake the property, creates the right of access to federal courts? Even \nif that action is supported or mandated by a local or state ordinance \nor statute? How would one substantiate an action which damages the \n``right to enjoy'' one's property? This is just another example of the \nkinds of problems this legislation poses. And what about the \ndistinction the bill makes by including special reference to ``real \nproperty'' without defining that term?\n  Wisconsin communities are deeply afraid of the litigation costs and \ngeneral erosion of the notion of community that will be implicit in the \nanswers to these questions. Mr. President, I have heard almost \nunprecedented levels of opposition to this legislation from local \ngovernments all over my state, from large cities like Milwaukee and \nMadison to small communities like the Village of Park Ridge near \nStevens Point and Cudahy, Wisconsin. Individuals of every political \naffiliation oppose this legislation, and editorials opposing similar \nbills have appeared all over my state.\n  To me, however, one of the best arguments against this legislation \nwas sent to me by the former Mayor of New London, Wisconsin, Gregory \nMathewson. After the H.R. 1534 passed the other body and was sent to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee former Mayor Mathewson wrote:\n\n       Our fear with this legislation is that it tilts the current \n     balance and increases the range of things a property owner \n     has a right to do. Meaning that communities no longer have \n     any clear authority to zone property or decide between \n     conflicting interests on the basis of the best interests of \n     the community as a whole.\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\n       We often have homeowners who do not wish to see apartments \n     of any type built near them, owners of large houses who do \n     not want small houses built near them, and we routinely have \n     to tell people that the City exists for all persons not a \n     few, and that the poor, the non-land owning and others shall \n     be welcome.\n       We fear now that these decisions will involve us in \n     continuous litigation in federal court, and all notions of \n     community will be eroded as the questions and issues will be \n     so generalized by the courts that local reasons, customs and \n     planning will be irrelevant.\n       I ask you to see that a balance is maintained, the \n     community ought to have rights balances against individual \n     rights. In its current form, H.R. 1534 appears to eliminate \n     this balance. Everybody seeks out places to live which offer \n     a high quality of life. It must be clear that there is no \n     quality of life if someone can do anything they want with \n     their property or sue over any perceived impact on their \n     property. In either case, the individual controls the \n     community and this is the operational definition of anarchy.\n\n  Mr. President, Wisconsin communities respect property rights, and \nwant to have well developed and well planned cities, towns, and \nvillages. This legislation goes too far in seeking not just to clarify \nbut to enhance the procedural rights of property owners to seek \ncompensation under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the \nConstitution. In doing it would have unintended consequences that might \nundo the unique character of towns across America and within my home \nstate. It is for this reason, and the others I have described, that I \noppose this legislation. I urge other Senators to join me in seeking \nits defeat.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation. Much of the \nbill is almost certainly unconstitutional, and all of it is \nunnecessary. States and municipalities already have adequate ways to \ndecide questions of property rights.\n  The goal of this misguided legislation is not to protect the \nconstitutional rights of property owners, but to create new rights for \nwealthy developers. It would alter the balance of power in their favor, \nand force local governments across the nation to accept a wide range of \nactivities that harm communities.\n  This legislation is a Pandora's Box of problems for local communities \nand the federal judiciary. It will force municipalities into federal \ncourt early in the land-use process. It will force federal judges to \naccept cases involving sensitive land-use issues that should be handled \nat the local or state level. It will add a new burden to federal \ncourts, at a time when they are already over-burdened. It will \nsubstantially--and unconstitutionally--broaden the jurisdiction of the \nCourt of Federal Claims.\n  The bill is the latest attempt by the Republican Congress to tip the \nbalance against neighborhoods and towns and in favor of developers. It \nisn't unreasonable to ask property owners to consider the health, \nsafety, and zoning needs of the local community. State and local \nplanning and zoning boards, and health and safety commissions, exist to \nprotect local needs, and balance them with the interests of property \nowners.\n  Each person's property rights are bounded by his neighbor's interests \nand limited by the public interest. It is not against the law for the \ngovernment to ``take'' private property for public use. It is only \nagainst the law to take it without compensation. Local involvement is \nnecessary to this process. Only at the local level can the proper \ndetermination of value be made and the necessary negotiations take \nplace. Once decisions are made at the local level and state courts have \na opportunity to reach a decision, property owners have the right to \nappeal to federal courts if they are dissatisfied with the local \ndecision. There is nothing wrong with the current law that this \nlegislation will fix.\n  By forcing federal courts into earlier stages of these local \ndecisions, it will give landowners an unfair ``big stick''--the threat \nof federal litigation.\n  And that threat is real. Currently, a federal judge may refuse to \nhear a case if it is not yet ``ripe'' for adjudication in a federal \nforum, or involves issues better dealt with in state courts. This bill \nwill allow big developers to force local planning issues out of local \nadministrative and judicial forums, where they belong, and into federal \ncourtrooms, where they don't belong.\n  The bill also undermines the principles enunciated by the Supreme \nCourt in the Williamson case, which held that remedies should be \npursued at the state level before being sought in federal court. As the \nCourt noted, ``Rejection of exceedingly grandiose development plans \ndoes not logically imply that less ambitious plans will receive \nsimilarly unfavorable reviews.'' In other words, a city can deny a \npermit to build a factory on a piece of land, but might well allow \nresidential development.\n\n  Most disputes about property are resolved by this back-and-forth \nprocess between local officials, neighbors and developers. Through this \nprocess, the community shapes the kind of growth it wants and can \nsupport. By allowing a developer to bring a city into federal court \nafter filing one proposal, this bill will promote litigation at the \nexpense of negotiated solution. Because municipalities are often small \nand federal lawsuits are costly, localities will be coerced into \nabandoning sensible land-use plans because they can't afford a lawsuit. \nThis bill will certainly interfere with necessary local efforts to \nprotect the quality of their communities, including the water, air, and \nopen space, and health and safety, too.\n  Most communities across the country are small. Very few have legal \nstaff. Yet these are the communities that will have to defend their \nregulations and zoning decisions in federal court if they don't \nsurrender to big developers' demands. Some of the cases that this bill \nwould affect could easily pose serious threats to the health and safety \nand well-being of our communities.\n  Finally, there are serious constitutional questions about the bill's \nproposed expansion of the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. \nThat court is an Article I court, not an Article III court. It has no \nauthority over Congressional or agency actions. It was created to hear \nmonetary claims against the federal government. Expanding its scope \nwill cause it to cross over into the realm of Article III courts.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States opposes granting the \nCourt of Federal Claims the power of injunctive and declaratory relief, \nand the authority to invalidate Acts of Congress or agency regulations. \nThe power to invalidate Acts of Congress and federal regulations has \nhistorically been part of an independent judiciary. The Court of \nFederal Claims does not have the tenure and salary protections of an \nArticle III court that ensure judicial independence. So this bill is \nlikely to be held unconstitutional under standard doctrines of \nseparations of powers.\n  Judicial efficiency in the already over-burdened federal court system \nwill also suffer, as more federal lawsuits are filed against zoning \nboards, land-use bodies and regulatory agencies. The cases this \nlegislation will unleash will burden the federal courts at a time when \nthere are over 70 judicial vacancies. The irony is obvious--our \nRepublican colleagues won't confirm more judges, but they're more than \nwilling to add to the current excessive workload.\n  These complex issues of local land use are currently being resolved \nat the appropriate level. Congress should reject this heavy-handed \nscheme to curry favor with developers at the expense of homeowners and \nneighborhoods across America.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the property rights \nlegislation we are currently considering. The question we have to \nanswer today is simple. Do we want to give to homeowners and farmers \nthe same rights to go to Federal court when their constitutional rights \nare infringed that we already give to flag burners and neo-Nazis who \npreach hate. For my Part, I think that hardworking farmers and \nhomeowners ought to have at least as many constitutional rights as \nNazis and flag burners.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I'd like to point out how this bill \nwould change current law to correct the outrageous preference that \nactivist Federal judges have given to flag burning over property \nrights. The current bill modifies the abstention doctrine, which \nprovides that Federal courts will decline to hear certain court cases \nif there is on-going litigation in State court or before a State \nadministrative agency.\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\n  Now, on its face, the abstention doctrine sounds good. I believe that \nFederal courts should decline to hear lawsuits when State governments \nor State courts are in the process of considering the same issues. This \nprevents the duplication of efforts and respects States' rights.\n  The property rights bill we're considering today would create an \nexception to the abstention doctrine for people who want to protect \ntheir constitutional right to own and control their property.\n  The thing to remember, however, is that the Federal courts have \nalready created exceptions to the abstention doctrine. Let's look at \nsome of the cases where the Federal courts have decided not to abstain. \nIn other words, let's look at some cases where Federal courts went \nahead and heard a court case even though a State government was in the \nmiddle of considering the same case.\n  In the case of Collins versus Smith, a Federal court decided not to \nabstain when a town in Illinois decided against issuing a parade permit \nto the American Nazi Party which wanted to march in a Jewish \nneighborhood. The Nazi Party couldn't afford to pay a fee which the \ntown required, and so the Nazi Party was not given a permit to have \nthis march. The Nazi Party challenged this decision as a violation of \ntheir constitutional rights and the town was considering whether to \nwaive the fee or not to waive the fee. But the Nazis got tired of \nwaiting and went to Federal court. And the court decided that it would \nhear the case even though there was a pending State proceeding.\n  So, the Nazi Party gets to protect their rights in Federal courts--no \nquestions asked and without having to wait for State proceedings to \nconclude. But property owners don't have that ability. They can't just \nrun into Federal court.\n  Mr. President, I think that's just plain wrong. I believe that \nhardworking Americans who own homes and hardworking farmers trying to \nwork their land ought to have at least as many constitutional rights as \nthe Nazi Party. If we pass this bill, we'll stop this unfairness.\n  Nazis aren't the only ones who get treated better than property \nowners. Flag burners have it pretty good as well. In Sutherland versus \nDeWulf, the city of Rock Island, Illinois tried to prosecute someone \nwho had burned an American flag. So the flag burners went straight into \nFederal court to sue the city government. Even though there were on-\ngoing State proceedings, the Federal court decided to hear the case and \nspecifically rules that it would not abstain until after the State \nproceedings were finished.\n  Again, this is unfair. It doesn't make sense to say that homeowners \nand farmers have to wait to have their day in court but flag burners \ncan get their day in court any time they want. I think that property \nowners ought to have at least as many constitutional rights as flag \nburners.\n  So, Mr. President, we have a chance today to correct this absurd \npreference for flag burners and Nazis. Why should they get a special \nkey to unlock the courthouse doors, while homeowners and farmers have \nto wait outside the courthouse for years until some Federal judge \ndecides it's okay to file a property rights case. For once, let's use \nsome common sense and pass this bill.\n  In the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee considered a \ncomprehensive property rights bill. That was a good bill, and the \nSenate should have passed it. But there was strong opposition from \nintellectual elitists of the far left who have no regard for the \nconcept of protecting private property rights. Those who spoke against \nthe last property rights bill said it was too broad.\n  So, this Congress, we have a more narrowly focused bill. But even \nthis more narrow bill isn't acceptable to the opponents of property \nrights.\n  Given what I've just pointed out about the preferential treatment \nthat flag burners and Nazis get in terms of access to the Federal \ncourts, I think that just shows how extreme and out-of-touch the other \nside is on this issue. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for 1 second? Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that after the Senator's remarks, I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Hatch for bringing \nthe Senate this important reform measure to safeguard Americans' \nproperty rights.\n  The concept of property is at the root of civilization as we know it. \nThe right of the individual to acquire, possess and use property is one \nof the natural rights that does not depend on government for its \nexistence; on the contrary, governments were formed in part to protect \nthat right. Our Founders also saw the right to private property as the \nkey to spurring individuals initiative and productivity that would \nensure national prosperity and security. For that reason, the concept \nof property and the importance of its protection permeates the \nConstitution--there are references to it throughout the document, in \naddition to the fifth amendment's prohibition against the taking of \nprivate property for the public good, without just compensation.\n  Unfortunately, however, all these rights aren't worth the paper they \nare printed on, unless they can be enforced. That principle applies \neven to the Constitution. Our Founding Fathers may have thought the \nfifth amendment would shield the people of this country from government \ntaking their property without just compensation. But for all too many \nAmericans the shield has no substance, the promise of protection is \nhollow, the Constitution's guarantee is an empty one--all because they \ncannot enforce it against government encroachment.\n  This is not an isolated problem for a few wealthy Americans. In \ncommunities across the nation it is ruining family businesses, \ndevaluing property of all kinds, preventing people from building homes \nand sometimes even from cleaning up pollution or hazards. In short, it \nis depriving citizens of all incomes from every state of one of the \nmost prized basic human liberties.\n  There are many aspects of the erosion of private property rights \nprotection and many ways to attack the problem. Chairman Hatch and I \nand others have tried in the past to enact a comprehensive solution. \nUnfortunately, that effort ran headlong into another political agenda, \nand for that reason, we have put it aside for the near term. Meanwhile, \nhowever, it makes sense to push ahead on a more limited--but still \nimportant--part of the solution.\n  The bill before us today, the Property Rights Implementation Act of \n1998, focuses on the judicial side of the equation. Currently, people \ntrying to vindicate their constitutionally guaranteed property rights \nface a procedural catch-22. They are forced to jump endless hurdles on \nthe way to court, and then are bounced from court to court to obtain \nrelief. At every step, the system is biased to the benefit of \ngovernment and against the citizen. The costs are often staggering.\n  If it were this difficult to enforce any other constitutional \nguarantee, we would have seen reform long ago. Even members of the \njudicial branch have acknowledged that clarification is seriously \nneeded in this area.\n  This bill would simplify the path to court and clarify the \njurisdiction of the courts. It doesn't grant any new rights but only \nattempts to clean up the procedural quagmire that presently frustrates \naccess to the courts. This is a precise and limited reform that would \nmake a big difference to the citizens who are forced to litigate in \norder to protect their property rights.\n  I know that local governments have been concerned that this \nlegislation may interfere with their areas of jurisdiction. However, \nthis bill does nothing to reduce the power of local governments to make \ndecisions with regard to property. Furthermore, this legislation \nactually exempts localities from paying attorneys' fees if they lose a \ntakings claim. If the case involves a critical question of state or \nlocal law that is unclear, that question will be sent back to a state \ncourt for decision before the federal case can continue. In short, the \nbill does nothing to take away power from state and local government, \nwhile it strengthens the protection of individual citizens' rights.\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\n  Mr. President, the House has already passed similar legislation by an \noverwhelming vote. S. 2271 is an important reform, and I urge all \nSenators to support its passage. Let's most this bill to conference and \nthen on to the President for enactment.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am pleased to stand with the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee today in support of S. 2271, the Property \nRights Implementation Act of 1998.\n  We can talk about constitutional rights, and we should; we can talk \nabout the very basic foundation of our economy, and we must. All of us \nare in favor of the environment, but some like to put the rights of the \ncollective over the right of the individual.\n  What we are trying to do here today is sort a little bit of that out, \nbecause, yes, people buy property for a variety of reasons. They buy it \nto hold as you would put money in a bank, hoping that some day in the \nfuture you might be able to use it as an investment purpose to retire. \nIt reminds me of a lady I met from Texas not long ago. She and her \nhusband had done so. They had bought a small piece of property a long \nways out of Dallas 30 years ago, hoping that some day it might be of \nvalue.\n  All of a sudden, the suburbs of Dallas reached the property. Her \nhusband is dead, and this is her retirement. The Federal Government, in \ncooperation with the municipal government, said that property can now \nnot be developed for a multitude of reasons. This lady only can go to \ncourt to redeem her values, but in this instance, she has no money.\n  While this particular legislation would not address that example, it \nwould go a long ways toward honoring our constitutional rights and, \nmost assuredly, would have allowed this individual her day in court. \nThat is one example.\n  In my State of Idaho, where there are people who have held property \nfor generations and like to continue to hold them for a variety of \nreasons--ranching or farming because it is their livelihood--only to \nhave the Federal Government step in and determine that certain uses may \nnot go on on that land or certain practices--or the land itself may be \nhabitat for a particular species of plant, animal or bird, the value of \nthat property is diminished because of the flexibility that the \nindividual has to manage and operate that property, not for investment \npurposes, but as an income property. Yet, in those instances, and in \nmost instances, the opportunity to recoup those kinds of losses are \ndenied.\n  There are a good many other examples, Mr. President, and my time is \nlimited this afternoon. I stand in strong support of this legislation \nand hope that my colleagues will join with me in gaining cloture for \nthe purpose of debating this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there has been considerable discussion \nthis afternoon about compensation and takings and so forth, but what \nthis really is all about is, are we going to permit the local \nauthorities to have the powers that they have had in the past to deal \nwith local zoning matters and matters similarly associated therewith.\n  What the proponents of this legislation are saying is that we don't \nwant that, we don't want to have a situation whereby you must exhaust \nyour local remedies. Even though that is recognized to apply in the \nfourth amendment where we are dealing with unlawful searches and \nseizures, for example--and there the courts have said you have to \nexhaust your local remedies--here is what they are also saying in \nconnection with these so-called property rights under the fifth \namendment.\n  For some peculiar reason that I haven't quite been able to fathom \nhere, those people who have long been stalwarts of the local authority \nand the powers of the locals--local elected officials, for example--are \nsuddenly saying, ``No, no, no, you don't know how to do this; we're a \nlot smarter than you are; we're Federal officials, we live inside the \nbeltway, this is where we make our decisions and we're going to tell \nyou how to run these matters on your local level.''\n  Even though the Supreme Court recognizes that, yes, there can be no \ntaking of private property without just compensation, they are saying \nthat, first, you must exhaust your local remedies, you must let this \nwhat they call ``ripen.'' We have gotten adjusted to that. For over 200 \nyears, this is the way this system has worked. But, ``No, no,'' say the \nproponents of this legislation, ``that's not fast enough. Your local \nofficials really don't know how to do this. What they are doing is they \nare holding up matters too long.''\n  It is true that you, the local voters, for example, from your town or \nyour city, your county, wherever it might be, you are tolerant of this, \nyou are satisfied with the way the system works.\n  But we are in Washington, DC. And we say, ``No, we don't like that. \nWe're going to change it for you. And, yes, your mayors can come to us \nand your Governors can come to us and your local legislators. We're \ngoing to dismiss you. We don't care what you want, we're going to tell \nyou how to do this. We're pretty smart here in the U.S. Government, and \nwe're going to straighten this thing out. No, we don't have to bother \nhaving any hearings. We'll tinker with this and change it all around \nand bring it to the floor. That's all right.''\n  As the senior Senator from Vermont has pointed out, there has not \nbeen 30 seconds of hearings on this bill we have before us, but they \nsay that is all right because we are all very, very smart around here \nand we know what is best. And so we are saying to the president of the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the president of the National Association of \nCounties, the president of the National League of Cities, and the vice \nchairman of the National Conference of State Legislatures, and so \nforth, this is the way we are going to do it.\n  We are going to say, ``You don't have to exhaust your remedies.'' All \nyou have to do in my State--I am not familiar how it works in every \nState; I know how it works in my State--if you want to make a dramatic \nchange in zoning where you live, you want to put a multifamily \nstructure up in a single family development, you say, ``I'm going to go \nto the zoning board.'' And you ask permission for this. And if the \nzoning board says no, then you file with the zoning board of review. \nAnd that is all you have to do. You do not have to do anything else.\n  You do not have to go through that. And you do not have to take the \nsteps and go to the State district court. Bang, you can go into Federal \ncourt. And there some federally appointed judge is going to tell you \njust how to straighten this thing out. He is going to tell you what to \ndo, not your local officials, not your elected members of the zoning \nboard or the zoning board of review. Not your mayor--he has nothing to \ndo with this. It is going to be a federally appointed judge. And we \nhave heard all --I do not know how many times on this floor we have \nheard about the dangers of activist Federal judges. And so we are going \nto have an activist Federal judge tell us what to do in East Greenwich, \nRI, or wherever it might be.\n  Mr. President, I do not think that is right. I can see why they \navoided having a hearing on this final bill, because it would have been \ntrash. And it came out on practically a straight party-line vote. It \nindicates the lack of support for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to make one more point. When we have these \nthings come up, a zoning request on the local level, there is great \neffort made to compromise it, to negotiate it in some fashion. ``All \nright. You want to fill in a wetland? No, you can't fill in that \nwetland. There's a place where you can work out a situation, restore a \nwetland just right up the road. And this is the way we will work it \nout.''\n  That is what local officials do. They know they are living there. \nThey are dealing with their neighbors and people they know. They are \nnot some Federal judge from some distant place who comes into town \nriding the circuit every now and then and says, ``This is the way it's \ngoing to be.'' But the problem is, you do not have that negotiation, \nthat attempt to compromise, that attempt to work these matters out.\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\n  I also might say, this has a very, very chilling effect on the local \nofficials, because if the local officials are in a situation where they \nknow they can be jerked into the Federal court--they make a decision on \nwhether it is the preservation of a wetland or the preservation of the \nzoning, the one-acre zoning, whatever it might be--they are going to be \nvery leery of making a decision against the wishes of the home \nbuilders, for example.\n  Why are the home builders so enthusiastic about this legislation? Are \nthey trying to preserve the environment or preserve some open space or \ndo what is best for the community? Well, it is totally understandable. \nThey are looking after their own interests. That is what they want. So, \nMr. President, they are going to be going right into the Federal court. \nThey have plenty of money.\n  If I come from a relatively small town, and my little town is jerked \ninto the Federal court--and we have a city solicitor--the town \nsolicitor, who isn't paid much, if he is going to start going to \nFederal court and have to answer to every request for a change in the \nzoning, it is going to be a big bill that he is going to submit to this \ntown.\n  Mr. President, I certainly hope that this so-called Property Rights \nImplementation Act of 1998, which is going to come before us in a half \nan hour on a question of cloture--I certainly hope that everybody will \nvote against cloture.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington for letting me \nspeak.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nfor up to 4 minutes on behalf of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator using time from either side or \nis this an additional request?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is an additional request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Washington for allowing me to use some time because I think there \nare a couple of other Senators who will be speaking on her side very \nshortly.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Hatch for his commitment to ensuring \nprotection of private property rights as required by our Constitution \nand for trying to do everything we can to assure the private property \nprovision of our Constitution is adhered to. People seem to overlook \nthe fifth amendment sometimes, which says that:\n\n       No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, \n     without due process of law; nor shall private property be \n     taken for public use without just compensation.\n  In spite of this unequivocal protection of private property in the \nBill of Rights, the Federal Government has often adopted laws that \nviolate these important rights. One law, for example, which has been \nimplemented to the detriment of private property rights in Texas is the \nEndangered Species Act. In the Texas Panhandle, the Endangered Species \nAct has been used to protect a bait fish called the Arkansas River \nshiner. To protect the fish in Texas, even though it thrives in New \nMexico, the water supply for cities such as Amarillo and agriculture in \nthe area are put in jeopardy. In Travis County, families who purchased \nresidentially zoned lots in good faith to build their homes are being \npenalized. In addition to the cost of their lots, they are forced to \npay $1,500 as an added fee to protect habitat for the golden-cheeked \nwarbler, in an area where 20,000 acres already are set aside for that \npurpose.\n  There are many other examples like this that demonstrate how laws can \nbe used to actually violate constitutional rights. For this reason, I \nsupport property rights protections. We tried in the 103d Congress and \nin the 104th Congress, to guarantee compensation to landowners whose \nprivate property was devalued due to government regulations. \nUnfortunately, we were unsuccessful in adopting these reforms. Today, \nwe are trying a new approach. Senator Hatch has put forward a new \napproach that adjusts our legal process to assure that constitutional \nrights are secured for the private property owners of our country.\n  Now, what Senator Hatch is doing is really mostly technical in \nnature. It is giving people the right to have their cases heard. I \ndon't think Americans should have to spend all of their money just \nseeking to challenge the violation of rights that are guaranteed to \nthem under the Constitution. I don't think that is due process. So I \ncommend this bill because I do think it will take one step in the right \ndirection toward protecting private property rights and helping private \nproperty owners at least have their cases adjudicated in court.\n  The bill does not speak to the real issue which is how we can \naccommodate environmental laws in a way that also protects the rights \nof private property owners. I hope this Congress will address the basic \nissue soon.\n  In the meantime, this bill at least will take us a step toward \nallowing people due process to protect their private property rights. I \nthink it is time that the American people who own property have the \nability to fully protect their rights guaranteed by the Constitution. I \nhope that we will all support this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, it will be \ndeducted equally from each.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might, the other side was last to \nspeak. If they have not called a quorum call, my understanding is the \ntime is still on their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is not correct. Under the \nprecedent, if neither side yields time, the time is deducted equally.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. There may have been \nanother unanimous consent request when I was off the floor.\n  If somebody had sought recognition and yielded time for that person \nto speak, they do not call the quorum call, and nobody else seeks \nrecognition subsequent to their speaking, does the time continue to run \nagainst whoever had been yielded time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Precedent is that the time is deducted from \nboth sides equally.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So if somebody sought recognition on their time and just \nstands there silently, while they are standing there silently, the time \nis running equally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If they are yielded for a set amount of time, \nthat time will be deducted from their side. Once they yield the floor \nand they sit down, the time is no longer charged to them, it is charged \nto both sides equally.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains to the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 4\\1/2\\ minutes, and \nthe Senator from Vermont has 21\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And the vote is set for quarter of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  We continue to hear what an improvement we have in the new bill, S. \n2271, as compared to H.R. 1534. Maybe it is, but maybe it isn't an \nimproved bill. I don't believe it is an improved bill but it is a \ndifferent bill.\n  Frankly, we have before the Senate a different piece of legislation \nin which there has not been 38 seconds of hearings. We have before the \nSenate a bill which, unlike other major legislation, does not have a \nspecific report before the Senate. We have a bill that is brought down \nin time for the Monday afternoon bed check vote, without a report, \nwithout a hearing.\n  Mr. President, we are asked to pass a piece of legislation that would \ndramatically encroach on the rights of the municipalities, counties, \nand States in our country. It would be a massive shift of power from \nthe local people and communities to the Federal courts.\n  I think one of the reasons it is being rushed through is that the big \ndevelopers who want it don't want the public to look at this very long. \nBut those\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\nwho have looked at it are opposed to it. That includes the National \nGovernors' Association, the National Association of Counties. Others \nwho oppose it include the National League of Cities, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National Association of Towns and Townships, \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures. The bill that was \nreported, H.R. 1534, was also opposed by those groups and the \nInternational Municipal Lawyers Association, 38 State attorneys \ngeneral, and the American Planning Association.\n  Among those opposed to having that unprecedented shift of power to \nthe Federal courts are the Judicial Conference of the U.S. Conference \nof Chief Justices and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  Among those religious organizations opposed to that bill are the \nUnited States Catholic Conference, the National Council of Churches of \nChrist, Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism, and the \nEvangelicals for Social Action.\n  Among the public interest groups that are opposed to it are the \nLeague of Women Voters, the Alliance for Justice, the Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, \nand the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  Among the conservation groups against it are the National Wildlife \nFederation and the League of Conservation Voters. Those who oppose it \ninclude the Sierra Club, the National Environmental Trust, the \nEnvironmental Working Group, the Center for Marine Conservation, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, the National Audubon Society, the Great \nLakes United, the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund, Izaak Walton League \nof America, the Scenic America, and the Wilderness Society, Natural \nResources Defense Council, the Rails to Trails Conservancy, and the \nNational Parks and Conservation Association, Friends of the Earth, \nDefenders of Wildlife, Appalachian Mountain Club, and the American \nOceans Campaign.\n  Among those who are opposed to it are the American Federation of \nState, County, and Municipal Employees and the United Steelworkers of \nAmerica.\n  For the same reason that this Vermonter is opposed to the new bill, \nS. 2271, the Vermont League of Cities and Counties, is also opposed. \nThey just wrote to me on the new bill saying:\n\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing you to express our strong \n     support for your actions in opposing S. 2271. * * *\n       Local governments are working very hard in Vermont to \n     exercise appropriate authority over land uses in their \n     communities. We are joined in this in very real fashion by \n     the Vermont legislature which this past session adopted \n     legislation clarifying our ability to regulate wireless \n     telecommunication facilities under zoning.\n       What would a volunteer part-time planning commission or \n     zoning board of authority do if a national wireless \n     telecommunications company came into town, not only with its \n     platoon of attorneys and engineers but also with the ability \n     to say, ``you take a wrong step and you're in federal \n     court?''\n\n  Continuing from their letter:\n\n       The chilling effect of that combination would be immense. \n     It is already hard to find people willing to serve on local \n     boards and commissions. With the threats proposed in the \n     Takings legislation, many good public servants at the local \n     level would simply give up.\n\n  That is from the Vermont League of Cities and Towns.\n  In an earlier letter, they asked me ``At what cost to the \ncommunities?'' This is a question being answered at the local level by \nlocal zoning boards of Charlotte, Hardwick, Cabot, and other towns \nthroughout the State. I think we ought to pay some attention to it. In \nthe Sunday Burlington Free Press, the homebuilders themselves made this \nstatement regarding urban sprawl:\n\n       Urban growth is not really Congress' purview. . . . I think \n     most Members of Congress recognize that planning ought to \n     take place at a local or State level.\n\n  Then I ask, why are they pushing this bill? They want the Federal \nGovernment to take authority away from our States. Do the homebuilders \nneed this for a win?\n  I said earlier that we Vermonters may differ in the way our State and \ncommunities should be handled as compared to how they would be handled \nby some large-scale, wealthy developer. That is our choice to make. I \nspoke of some of the most beautiful spots in our State that my wife and \nI love driving by. Each one has enormous developmental value, but we \nVermonters have decided not to develop it. Now, we Vermonters pay the \nprice for that. We get less tax revenue. We make less from our land; I \nknow I do from my own land.\n  I have 220 acres on my tree farm. We could earn a lot more if Vermont \nsuddenly zoned everything for commercial use. But I don't want to do \nthat. I like the quality of life in Vermont. I like not having to lock \nmy door. I like being able to walk through my fields and see a deer, or \nto ski down one of the logging trails on my property, as I have in the \nwintertime, and to see an owl floating on the thermals ahead of me by \nthe moonlight. I liked being awakened about 3 o'clock this morning by \nthe screech of a bear near my home. Frankly, I like that better than \nthe screech of brakes in a congested urban intersection.\n  They also told us we would lose a great deal in Vermont when we did \naway with billboards. But a couple out-of-State billboard companies \ndidn't do so well. The scenic vistas of Vermont were opened up and the \ntourism increased.\n  Mr. President, we ought to stop taking things out of the hands of \nsmall communities and counties in our States. We ought to let the \npeople of West Virginia make their decisions and the people of Vermont \nmake their decision and not say: We are going to yank this out of your \nhands and put it in Federal court.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Chairman \nHatch for his outstanding work on this very important issue that deals \nwith a constitutional right that is as fundamental as our right to free \nspeech. The Constitution says that the Government cannot take \nsomebody's property without paying just compensation for it. Let me \nrepeat that. Property cannot be taken without it being paid for.\n  Too often in America today, we have government agencies that would \nlike to take control of someone's property, but they don't want to pay \nfor it. So these agencies take property through the use of regulations \nand laws. Sometimes their actions are legitimate. For example, zoning \nregulations are often perfectly legitimate rules that we have to have \nif we are going to live together. But there often reaches a point in \nwhich the actions of a municipality, or a county, or a State, or a \nFederal Government--which is primarily what we are dealing with here--\ncan, in fact, take the beneficial use of that property without offering \nany compensation for it. That is wrong; it should not happen.\n  This bill is a modest, very reasonable step. Senator Hatch has \ncompromised and worked with those who have different views, and he has \ncrafted a bill that is logical, reasonable, realistic, and that will \nprotect our Constitutional property rights while not doing anything \nthat would deny our ability to protect our environment. To me, it is \nclearly wrong to say that passage of this legislation would in any way \nrestrict the environmental rights in this country. So I join in support \nof it. I think it is outstanding legislation. It simply provides a \nmechanism to protect our cherished fifth amendment constitutional \nrights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be deducted equally.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 11 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining for the Senator from Utah?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute thirty-six seconds. The vote will \ntake place at 5:49, which under the unanimous consent agreement was \nmoved from 5:45 to 5:49.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The vote is at what time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 5:49.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we can probably sit here on the floor and\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\nthink of some horror stories where a town made a mistake in holding \nsomething up. We could point somewhere to some local court where \nanother mistake might have been made, or to a few prosecutors out of \nthe thousands of our local prosecutors where one bad judgment call was \nmade.\n  But we don't have the arrogance in this body to say we will take over \nall our local courts, all our local communities, all our local \nprosecutors, and turn them over to the Feds because mistakes won't be \nmade. Because I can tell you right now that for every mistake made at \nthe local level I could point to a bigger one made at the Federal \nlevel. I think that is why the Judicial Conference says don't quickly \ntoss these matters into the Federal courts. The Federal courts can't \nkeep up with the cases that are there today, especially when the Senate \nwon't vote to confirm judges for the vacancies already existing.\n  Let's not do this. And let us say that the U.S. Senate, of all \nplaces, will protect the current state process and rights of local \ncommunities and local counties and States to make their own decisions.\n  Why do we want to say to our small towns that they can not decide to \nprotect a particular area? Why do we say they should not be able to \nstop a building from being built next to a particular scenic spot? If \nthey are willing to forego tax revenue by doing that, and they are \nwilling to pay the price themselves--why do we want to say that some \nbig developer from out of State could come in with a platoon of lawyers \nand endless pockets and say, ``Oh, the heck with you. We know better. \nWe can make a quick buck on that, and we will take you to Federal court \nif you do not let us do it\"?\n  Before the Congress bulldozes local and state jurisdiction, we need \nto ask ourselves what urgent problem is being solved by this bill that \ncould not be solved some other way? What is so urgent that we have to \nstep in right now and wipe out the local land use process of our towns, \nour cities, our counties or our States? What is such a pressing need \nbesides the current concerns of a couple of well-financed PACs? What is \nthe urgent concern in this country that we have to suddenly rewrite the \nrule books and say from the Federal Government, ``you people at the \nlocal government level don't know what you are doing, and we are going \nto step in and take it over\"?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute thirty seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me use part of that.\n  Let me say what the five truths of the bill are.\n  This bill does not affect State or localities or local rights, and it \nonly applies to real property.\n  No. 2, it does nothing to stop localities from zoning or passing or \nenforcing environmental measures.\n  No. 3, it does not increase Federal litigation against localities, \nbecause the bill does not create new law. And takings cases are \nexpensive to bring. The Congressional Budget Office agrees with that.\n\n  No. 4, what the bill does is it grants property owners their day in \ncourt, which is denied in many cases by local court procedures or by \nlocal procedures, which at times are like the Minotaur's Labyrinth.\n  No. 5, currently property owners must litigate on average 9\\1/2\\ \nyears before they can get a Federal court to reach a decision on the \nmerits. No other constitutional right is treated that way.\n  In fact, in Dolan v. City of Tigard, the Supreme Court said, ``We see \nno reason why the takings clause of the fifth amendment, as much of a \npart of the Bill of Rights as the first amendment, or fourth amendment \nshould be delegated to the status of a poor relation.''\n  We are trying to stop that. This bill will do it.\n  We have had hearings on it time after time over the years. We have \nadded on this substitute four additional matters, mainly to help people \nwho have raised concerns.\n  I hope our colleagues will support us on this motion to proceed.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the fact is we have never had a hearing on \nthis particular bill, S. 2271, not in the U.S. Senate. The fact is we \ndo not have a report on this bill. S. 2271 was rushed to us and stuck \non the calendar. It was just introduced last week. And without one \nsecond of hearings on this bill, without one word of a report, we \nSenators are asked to push forward and vote on it.\n  I am concerned that this bill radically changes a system which \nresolves thousands of land use decisions each week in thousands of \nAmerican communities and cities. The zoning system in this country is \nworking well. It is helping mayors, like Mayor Giuliani in New York, \nclean up their communities. Yet, as Mayor Giuliani said, the efforts he \nhas made to clean up crime and clean up porno shops and clean up a lot \nof other problems in New York City, could be swept aside by this \nlegislation.\n  I could show you stacks of letters from local citizens in Vermont, in \nPennsylvania, in North Carolina, and in many other States who are up in \narms about a provision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act that \noverrides local and State decisions involving cellular transmission \ntowers. That provision, and this bill, were the subject of a recent \narticle in Governing Magazine that was aptly titled, ``The National \nZoning Nanny.''\n  Do we really want to federalize these local decisions by booting them \ninto Federal court?\n  This bill is unwise, it is unsound, and it is unwarranted. We ought \nto be standing up here and defending our mayors, Governors, and our \nattorneys general, our towns and cities, and others in our States who \nunderstand the unintended consequences of this bill. We ought to stand \nup and say the people of Wyoming, Vermont, Utah, West Virginia, Rhode \nIsland, North Carolina, Missouri, Alabama, North Carolina, South \nCarolina, South Dakota, North Dakota, Indiana, and Washington State, as \nthe distinguished Senator from Washington State, Mrs. Murray said, know \nbest how to make their decisions. And these people do not need the U.S. \nSenate to suddenly give them some new unfunded mandate and to make them \nliable for lawyers fees. We ought to respect the ability of the States \nto make decisions about how they run their communities, to make a \ndecision of what is going to be built next to their schools or their \nchurches or what kind of digging will go on next to the aquifers in \ntheir towns. All of these things could be quickly put before federal \ncourts if we were to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, in one minute, we are going to be voting. I hope we \nwill vote not to proceed with this bill. We have never had a hearing on \nit. We never had a report on it. This issue is not ripe.\n  Mr. President, I yield any time I may have.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the hour of the vote having arrived, the clerk will report the \ncloture motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provision of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to the private property rights legislation:\n         Trent Lott, Orrin Hatch, Jon Kyl, Chuck Hagel, Tim \n           Hutchinson, Rod Grams, Pat Roberts, Pete Domenici, Dan \n           Coats, Michael B.

Mr. President, as all of our colleagues and most of America \nknow, tragedy has struck once again in Northern Ireland with the \nuntimely deaths of three young Catholic boys--Richard, Mark, and Jason \nQuinn. The Quinn brothers were burned to death early Sunday morning \nafter their home was firebombed by Protestant extremists. I join with \nPrime Ministers Blair and Ahern, President Clinton and others in \ncondemning this terrorist act. I also want to extend, and I am sure I \nam joined in this by all our colleagues, my deepest condolences to the \nQuinn family.\n  The murder of three innocent children is such a cowardly act that it \nis incomprehensible. Sadly though for those of us who watched the week-\nlong escalation of violence, after members of the Orange Order were \nprevented from going forward with a controversial parade through the \nCatholic neighborhoods, the outcome was predictable. Ironically, the \nQuinn family had absolutely nothing to do with the standoff between \nmembers of the Protestant Orange Order and the Catholic neighborhood of \nGarvaghy Road over whether a controversial parade route would be \nfollowed or whether some compromise plan could be devised. Far too \noften disputes in Northern Ireland has produced innocent victims--many \nof them children, and it occurred again on Sunday night.\n  Prime Minister Tony Blair and Northern Ireland's political leaders \nhave called for a halt to the current protest at Drumcree to permit a \nperiod of reflection with respect to recent events. I believe that \nmembers of the Orange Order should accede to that request. Was the \ndispute over parade routes really worth the lives of three young boys? \nI do not believe it was, nor do vast majority of the people of Northern \nIreland. It is time for Protestant and Catholic community leaders to \nput aside their excuses for not having a face to face dialogue. Only \nthey are capable of fashioning a compromise on matters that divide \nthem. Only they can end the senseless violence that threatens to \ndestroy the very foundation of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement \nbefore it even has a chance to become fully operational.\n  Mr. President, The Good Friday Peace Accords were strongly supported \nby the majority of Northern Ireland's Catholics and Protestants in the \nMay referendum. The agreement contains a workable plan for getting to \nthe root causes of decades of sectarian conflict, but it must be given \na fair chance to produce results. The most recent tragedy in Central \nBelfast has tested the resolve of Northern Ireland's political leaders \nto stay the course of peace. I hope they will remain resolute in \nsupport of peace. I pray as well that no more sons or daughters of \nNorthern Ireland parents lose their lives as a result of sectarian \nterrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd, \nhas pointed out, during the weekend, three young brothers--10 year old \nRichard Quinn, 9 year old Mark Quinn, and 7 year old Jason Quinn--were \nsenselessly murdered because they were Catholic.\n\n  Some time ago, an Independent Parades Commission, appointed by the \nBritish Government, ruled that members of the Orange Order--a \nProtestant organization that celebrates a centuries--old victory of \nProtestants over Catholics by staging trumphalist marches through \nProtestant and Catholic neighborhoods--could not march through a \nCatholic neighborhood in Portadown, Northern Ireland. But the Orange \nOrder refused to accept the ruling and vowed to force the march to \nproceed along the Garvaghy Road in a Catholic neighborhood. A stand-off \nensued--members of the Orange Order attempted to march through the \narea, but were not allowed past barricades erected by security forces. \nProtestant extremists have used the week-long stand-off as \njustification to carry out attacks on Catholic homes and members of the \npolice force.\n  Early Sunday morning, in Ballymoney, Co. Antrim, many miles from \nPortadown, the Young Quinn boys were asleep in their beds when their \nhome was firebombed by individuals who can only be described as \nterrorists. The boys were living in a Protestant neighborhood, and \ntheir home was targeted because their mother is Catholic.\n  Both sides deserve their share of the blame for the sectarian attacks \nthat continue in Northern Ireland. But this tragedy never had to happen \nand never should have happened. The Orange Order must recognize that \nits refusal to abide by the decision of the Parades Commission led to \nthe murder of the Quinn boys. As a card left at the site of the Quinn \nhome read: ``A price to great to pay for a 15 minute walk.''\n  Another contentious parade was conducted today in a civilized manner. \nDespite opposition by the local Catholic residents on the Ormeau Road \nin Belfast, the Parades Commission ruled that this parade should be \npermitted. The Orange Order conducted the parade within the bounds set \ndown by the Commission, and the residents of the area staged a \npeaceful, dignified protest, but did not attempt to block the parade.\n  Prime Minister Tony Blair and Northern Ireland's Secretary of State \nMo Mowlam deserve credit for not bowing to the pressure of extremists \nin the Orange Order. And I join with Protestant leader David Trimble, \nthe First Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, and Deputy \nFirst Minister Seamus Mallon in calling on those assembled in Portadown \nto end their confrontation in light of this tragedy.\n  This brutal fire bombing was the act of cowards. They do not \nrepresent the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland, \nProtestants and Catholics alike, who have voted for peace and an end to \ndivision. Everyone outraged by the murder of these three young boys \nmust redouble their efforts to support the peace process and to assure \nthat extremists bent on sabotaging that process do not prevail.\n  We all extend our deepest sympathies to the members of the family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed for 10 \nmore minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8050-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8050-S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the time moves on on the issue of our \nPatients' Bill of Rights legislation. Just 43 days remain in this \nsession. The time has come to end the abuses of the HMOs and managed \ncare plans. Families across the country know that too many medical \ndecisions today are being made by the insurance company accountants \ninstead of doctors. They know the company profits too often get \npriority over patients' needs and, too often, managed care is \nmismanaged care.\n  We have legislation--the Patients' Bill of Rights--to end these \nabuses. Included in the Patients' Bill of Rights is a section that \nallows ERISA-covered patients to hold their health plans accountable \nfor abusive actions that result in injury or death.\n  This provision seems to have drawn the strongest opposition from the \nRepublican leadership and their special interest allies. But an article \nin last Saturday's New York Times paints a poignant picture of the need \nfor reform.\n  Judges throughout the Federal judicial system have written decisions \nin which they implore Congress to take action to correct ERISA's gross \ninadequacies.\n  They have repeatedly ruled that their hands are tied--even in the \nmost egregious cases--from providing the patients or their families \nwith meaningful redress when an insurance company's actions result in \ninjury or death.\n  Mr. President, I will quote a few parts of this article.\n  I ask the Chair to remind me when 2 minutes remain.\n\n       . . . The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit, in New Orleans, reached a typical conclusion in a \n     lawsuit by a Louisiana woman whose fetus died after an \n     insurance company refused to approve her hospitalization for \n     a high-risk pregnancy. . . .\n       In dismissing the suit, the court said, ``The Corcorans \n     have no remedy, state or Federal, for what may have been a \n     serious mistake.''\n       The court said that the harsh result ``would seem to \n     warrant a re-evaluation of\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\n     ERISA so that it can continue to serve its noble purpose of \n     safeguarding the interests of employees.''\n\n  What they were pointing out is that there was no opportunity, after \nthe negligence involved in this case, for the defendant to be able to \nreceive any redress for the injuries they sustained, and the Federal \njudge was saying that Congress should act.\n  In a second case, Judge William G. Young of the Federal District \nCourt in Boston, and I point out that he is a Republican appointee, \nsaid--\n\n       ``It is deeply troubling that, in the health insurance \n     context, ERISA has evolved into a shield of immunity which \n     thwarts the legitimate claims of the very people it was \n     designed to protect.''\n       Judge Young said he was distressed by ``the failure of \n     Congress to amend the statute that, due to the changing \n     realities of the modern health care system, has gone \n     conspicuously awry,'' leaving many consumers ``without any \n     remedy'' for the wrongful denial of health benefits.\n\n  Next\n\n       . . . Judge John C. Porfilio of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the 10th circuit, in Denver, said he was ``moved \n     by the tragic circumstances'' of a woman with leukemia who \n     died after her HMO refused approval for a bone marrow \n     transplant. But, he said, the 1974 law ``gives us no \n     choice,'' and the woman's husband, who had sued for damages, \n     is ``left without a remedy.''\n\n  Again\n\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, \n     in St. Louis, said the law protected an HMO--against a suit \n     by the family of a Missouri man, Buddy Kuhl, who died after \n     being denied approval for heart surgery recommended by his \n     doctors. ``Modification of ERISA in light of the questionable \n     modern insurance practices must be the job of Congress, not \n     the courts,'' said Judge C. Arlen Beam.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, \n     in Cincinnati, said that the Federal law barred claims \n     against a ``utilization review'' company that refused to \n     approve psychiatric care for a man who later committed \n     suicide. Because of ERISA, the court said, people who sue an \n     HMO or an insurer for wrongful death ``may be left without a \n     meaningful remedy.''\n       Federal District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, in Worcester, \n     Mass., said that the husband of a woman who died of breast \n     cancer was ``left without any meaningful remedy'' against an \n     HMO that had refused to authorize treatment.\n       Federal District Judge Marvin J. Garbis in Baltimore, said \n     . . . whether ERISA should be ``reexamined and reformed in \n     light of modern health care is an issue which must be \n     addressed and resolved by the legislature rather than the \n     courts.''\n\n  The Ninth Circuit continues in another case, and it goes on and on \nand on.\n  This is what we are seeing across the country in the Federal district \ncourts, in the circuit courts, with judges that come from entirely \ndifferent traditions, Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  When they look at ERISA, they find out that there are grossly \ninadequate remedies for individuals who have suffered as a result of \nmalpractice, or because that HMOs have denied coverage for health \ntreatments recommended by their doctors.\n  So, Mr. President, this isn't just those of us who are supporting \nthis legislation that are saying it. Here we have the irrefutable \npresentations made by district court and circuit court judges across \nthe country that are inviting Congress to act to protect families in \nthe United States of America.\n  There is only one bill that provides that protection, and it is the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Every single day that we delay acting on it, \nthe circumstances we have discussed here tonight will be repeated and \nrepeated and repeated.\n  The insurers and corporations who fear they have something to lose if \npatients are able to hold plans accountable have used ginned up \nestimates to try scare people into thinking that offering this \nprotection would somehow result in dramatic premium increases. But tens \nof millions of patients--those who work for states and localities and \nthose who purchase health insurance on their own--have this right, and \na recent study confirmed that the cost associated with it is \nnegligible.\n  The independent and nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation hired \nCoopers and Lybrand to examine the costs of being able to hold plans \naccountable for their actions. And their study found that ensuring this \nright costs as little as three pennies per month. Three pennies per \nmonth to hold your plan accountable for its actions.\n  Now, we know that the insurance industry does not support that \nparticular proposal, and we know that the Republican leadership does \nnot support that proposal. But we are asking, when in the world will \nthe Republican leadership let us at least debate that issue here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate? They have denied us the opportunity to mark \nthe bill up in our committee. They have denied us the opportunity to \nhave legislation on the calendar and the opportunity to get that \nmeasure scheduled so we can debate it. Mr. President, that is wrong.\n  Now we listened to those on the floor of the U.S. Senate the other \nnight speaking for the Republican leadership saying, ``The Republican \nleadership will decide when we will schedule this measure, and we in \nthe majority are not going to schedule that measure until we are good \nand ready to do so.''\n  Well, we are saying that we are going to offer this measure on every \nsingle appropriate measure that comes before the U.S. Senate, and maybe \nthe leader does have the power to pull legislation down and stick it \nback on the calendar, but they are going to be really busy doing that \nbecause they are going to have to put every piece of legislation back \non the calendar because we are going to continue to offer this \ncommonsense proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I advise the Senator that 2 minutes remain.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to finally point out that the \nPresident's own blue ribbon nonpartisan commission, made up of a wide \nvariety of different personnel representing the industry--doctors, \npatients, nurses--looked at the issues around patients rights. They \nrecommended virtually unanimously that all patients should have the \nkinds of protections included in our Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation. That is the President's commission.\n  Now, if our Republican friends do not want the American people to \nhave these rights, let's get on the floor of the U.S. Senate and debate \nit. But they refuse to do so, Mr. President, and we will not be silent. \nWe will continue to make every effort to bring this legislation up so \nthat we can get about the business of protecting American consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this full article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 11, 1998]\n\n        Hands Tied, Judges Rue Law That Limits H.M.O. Liability\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, July 10--Federal judges around the country, \n     frustrated by cases in which patients denied medical benefits \n     have no right to sue, are urging Congress to consider changes \n     in a 1974 law that protects insurance companies and health \n     maintenance organizations against legal attacks.\n       In their decisions, the judges do not offer detailed \n     solutions of the type being pushed in Congress by Democrats \n     and some Republicans. But they say their hands are tied by \n     the 1974 law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. \n     And they often lament the results, saying the law has not \n     kept pace with changes in health care and the workplace.\n       The law, known as Erisa, was adopted mainly because of \n     Congressional concern that corrupt, incompetent pension \n     managers were looting or squandering the money entrusted to \n     them. The law, which also governs health plans covering 125 \n     million Americans, sets stringent standards of conduct for \n     the people who run such plans, but severely limits the \n     remedies available to workers.\n       In a lawsuit challenging the denial of benefits, a person \n     in an employer-sponsored health plan may recover the benefits \n     in question and can get an injunction clarifying the right to \n     future benefits. But judges have repeatedly held that the law \n     does not allow compensation for lost wages, death or \n     disability, pain and suffering, emotional distress or other \n     harm that a patient suffers as a result of the improper \n     denial of care.\n       Congress wanted to encourage employers to provide benefits \n     to workers and therefore established uniform Federal \n     standards, so pension and health plans would not have to \n     comply with a multitude of conflicting state laws and \n     regulations.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \n     in New Orleans, reached a typical conclusion in a lawsuit by \n     a Louisiana woman whose fetus died after an insurance company \n     refused to approve her hospitalization for a high-risk \n     pregnancy. The woman, Florence B. Corcoran, and her husband \n     sought damages under state law.\n       In dismissing the suit, the court said, ``The Corcorans \n     have no remedy, state or Federal, for what may have been a \n     serious mistake.''\n       The court said that the harsh result ``would seem to \n     warrant a reevaluation of the Erisa so that it can continue \n     to serve its\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\n     noble purpose of safeguarding the interests of employees.''\n       In another case, Judge William G. Young, of the Federal \n     District Court in Boston said, ``It is deeply troubling that, \n     in the health insurance context, Erisa has evolved into a \n     shield of immunity which thwarts the legitimate claims of \n     the very people it was designed to protect.''\n       Judge Young said he was distressed by ``the failure of \n     Congress to amend a statute that, due to the changing \n     realities of the modern health care system, has gone \n     conspicuously awry,'' leaving many consumers ``without any \n     remedy'' for the wrongful denial of health benefits.\n       Disputes over benefits have become common as more employers \n     provide coverage to workers through H.M.O.'s and other types \n     of managed care, which try to rein in costs by controlling \n     the use of services.\n       Here are some examples of the ways in which judges have \n     expressed concern:\n       Judge John C. Portfolio of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, said he was ``moved \n     by the tragic circumstances'' of a woman with leukemia who \n     died after her H.M.O. refused approval for a bone marrow \n     transplant. But, he said, the 1974 law ``gives us no \n     choice,'' and the woman's husband, who had sued for damages, \n     is ``left without a remedy.''\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, \n     in St. Louis, said the law protected an H.M.O. against a suit \n     by the family of a Missouri man, Buddy Kuhl, who died after \n     being denied approval for heart surgery recommended by his \n     doctors. ``Modification of Erisa in light of questionable \n     modern insurance practices must be the job of Congress, not \n     the courts,'' said Judge C. Arlen Beam.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, \n     in Cincinnati, said that Federal law barred claims against a \n     ``utilization review'' company that refused to approve \n     psychiatric care for a man who later committed suicide. \n     Because of Erisa, the court said, people who sue an H.M.O. \n     or an insurer for wrongful death ``may be left without a \n     meaningful remedy.''\n       Federal District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, in Worcester, \n     Mass., said that the husband of a woman who died of breast \n     cancer was ``left without any meaningful remedy'' against an \n     H.M.O. that had refused to authorize treatment.\n       Federal District Judge Marvin J. Garbis, in Baltimore, \n     acknowledged that a Maryland man may be left ``without an \n     adequate remedy'' for damages caused by his H.M.O.'s refusal \n     to pay for eye surgery and other necessary treatments. But, \n     Judge Garbis said, whether Erisa should be ``re-examined and \n     re-formed in light of modern health care is an issue which \n     must be addressed and resolved by the legislature rather than \n     the courts.''\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, \n     in San Francisco, ruled last month that an insurance company \n     did not have to surrender the money it saved by denying care \n     to a Seattle woman, Rhonda Bast, who later died of breast \n     cancer.\n       ``This case presents a tragic set of facts,'' Judge David \n     R. Thompson said. But ``without action by Congress, there is \n     nothing we can do to help the Basts and others who may find \n     themselves in this same unfortunate situation.''\n       Democrats and some Republicans in Congress are pushing \n     legislation that would make it easier for patients to sue \n     H.M.O.'s and insurance wrong decision, he or she can be sued, \n     said Representative Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, \n     but ``H.M.O.'s are shielded from liability for their \n     decisions by Erisa.''\n       Changes in Erisa will not come easily. The Supreme Court \n     has described it as ``an enormously complex and detailed \n     statute'' that carefully balances many powerful competing \n     interests. Few members of Congress understand the intricacies \n     of the law. Insurance companies, employers and Republican \n     leaders strenuously oppose changes, saying that any new \n     liability for H.M.O.'s would increase the cost of employee \n     health benefits.\n       Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, \n     said today that he had agreed to schedule floor debate on \n     legislation to regulate managed care within the next two \n     weeks. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic \n     leader, who had been seeking such a debate, said Mr. Lott's \n     commitment could be ``a very consequential turning point'' if \n     Democrats have a true opportunity to offer their proposals.\n       But Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant \n     Republican leader, said, ``Republicans believe that health \n     resources should be used for patient care, not to pay trial \n     lawyers.''\n       Proposals to regulate managed care have become an issue in \n     this year's elections, and the hottest question of all is \n     whether patients should be able to sue their H.M.O.'s. The \n     denial of health benefits means something very different \n     today from what it meant in 1974, when Erisa was passed. At \n     that time, an insured worker would visit the doctor and then, \n     if a claim was disallowed, haggle with the insurance company \n     over who should pay. But now, in the era of managed care, \n     treatment itself may be delayed or denied, and this ``can \n     lead to damages far beyond the out-of-pocket cost of the \n     treatment at issue,'' Judge Young said.\n       H.M.O.'s have been successfully sued. A California lawyer, \n     Mark O. Hiepler, won a multimillion-dollar jury verdict \n     against an H.M.O. that denied a bone marrow transplant to his \n     sister, Nelene Fox, who later died of breast cancer. But that \n     case was unusual. Mrs. Fox was insured through a local school \n     district, and such ``governmental plans'' are not generally \n     covered by Erisa.\n       The primary goal of Erisa was to protect workers, and to \n     that end the law established procedures for settling claim \n     disputes.\n       Erisa supersedes any state laws that may ``relate to'' an \n     employee benefit plan. Erisa does not allow damages for the \n     improper denial or processing of claims, and judges have held \n     that the Federal law, in effect, nullifies state laws that \n     allow such damages.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8050-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8052-S8053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EDUCATION: RECENT SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to mention a few topics \nvital to the educational success and safety of American children.\n  Mr. President, last week we saw some real success for American \nfamilies and students. The Higher Education Reauthorization Act made \nseveral improvements that can benefit from more attention; this bill is \na major victory for students and teachers across America. My daughter \nenters college this fall. I now get to experience first-hand the \nchallenges of entering higher education that millions of families each \nyear, and our actions last week were helpful.\n  Throughout the Labor Committee's efforts on this bill, I worked to \nstrengthen our Nation's commitment to providing the strongest training \npossible for K-12 school teachers. I am most pleased with the bill's \nfocus on teacher training, and in particular its emphasis on technology \ntraining.\n  The bill's provisions concerning student loans will make the dream of \nhigher education that much closer to reality for many potential \nAmerican college students. The campus safety and child care provisions \nwill make a difference in all our communities.\n  I specifically thank Senator Wellstone for his work on the TANF \namendment, so important for literacy instruction and lifelong learning. \nSince our debate on the welfare reform bill in 1996, I have worked with \nformer Senator Simon, Senator Wellstone, and other Senators to point \nout the vital importance of education and literacy to a person's \nsuccess in getting off of welfare. The passage of the Wellstone \namendment is the right thing to do for low-income working Americans.\n  Under the Higher Education Reauthorization Act, I believe that the \nfirst generation of the new millennium will benefit immensely from the \nefforts put forth over this past year. From increases in financial aid, \nto campus security improvements, to technology instruction, S. 1882 \nwill stand as a proud hallmark of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, on other education topics, we still have some large \nchallenges ahead. The House Appropriations Committee is set to have \nfull Committee mark-up of education appropriations this week. The Labor \nSubcommittee has cut education funding from the President's proposed \nlevels by $2 billion in discretionary spending, and ignored his \nproposals to improve school construction and class size reduction. This \nwould be the week for House members to eliminate these egregious cuts.\n  Let me list a few things the House has put at risk through cuts or \neliminations: improving children's literacy; opening school buildings \nup after hours to make them the hub of the community; getting extra \nhelp in reading and math to poor-achieving students; improving \neducation technology, including technology teacher training; getting \nfirst-generation students ready for college; and many others. The House \nhas ignored the priorities of the American people.\n  The American people care deeply about education. They are frustrated \nwhen their schools do not succeed, and they bristle at those who would \nmake it harder for the schools to succeed. This is not about just \nbricks and mortar, or about throwing good money after bad. This is \nabout priorities, common-sense solutions, and improving quality.\n  Do not try to fool the parents. The parents know that school \nimprovement has a cost--in hard decisions, and in hard cash. They know \nthat when Congress offers vouchers and expanded charter schools and \nbonuses for private schools and private businesses--the\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nCongress is turning its back on the public school.\n  They know that a cut is a cut, and that a block grant leads to a cut. \nThey know that nearly the entire discussion this year on education from \nthe other side of the aisle--and a time or two on this side of the \naisle--amounts to the empty words of a snake-oil salesman.\n  Well, now we have a chance to turn this all around, like the public \nhas forced the Congress to do in years past. Congress cuts the funding \nfor schools, the public groans in disbelief, and the Congress wises up. \nLet us not wait until September to do it. The House has a chance this \nweek to put back the money they've taken. The Senate will have its \nchance soon.\n  In America, you turn your back on the public school at your peril. \nWhat we need to do instead is meet the hard challenges head on.\n  The schools, in the inner cities, and in the rural areas, are \ncrumbling. The Congress can do something about it.\n  The classes are overcrowded, which adds to the school construction \nproblem. The Congress can take action.\n  The budgets have been cut and cut, and failing a local levy can mean \ndisaster for a school. The Congress can keep its hands off the school \nbudget, and restore these House cuts.\n  The Congress can increase national expenditures to more than the \nmeager 2 percent of the national budget it now sets aside for schools. \nAnd the Congress can set the right tone.\n  Rather than generating empty air that has the effect of chipping away \nat support for the local public school--the very foundation of \ndemocracy, citizenship, and community in this nation--the Congress can \nspeak the words that need to be said.\n  The responsibility of serving as a member of Congress, as a member of \nthe United States Senate, is weighty indeed. By our words, our \nsignature, and our actions, we can take steps to improve our nation's \nschools and our student's futures.\n  We can set an important tone, and say the hard things that the \nstudents, families, teachers, school officials, community leaders and \nothers need to hear. We can also talk of success.\n  But if we act and speak only to tear the fabric of support for the \npublic school--if the tone we set is only to chip, chip, chip at public \nconfidence in an institution they know personally to have value--then \nwe are abdicating part of our great responsibility as Senators.\n  Americans know that members of Congress can work together, and \nachieve results. They know we could take actions to improve their \npublic schools. And that is why it is so disheartening to me when \nRepublicans or Democrats put ideology or politics or mean-spiritedness \nin the way of success for our students. We must act together to do what \nis in the best interest of all children.\n  It is also important Mr. President that we conduct background checks \nand adequately screen our teachers to make sure they are qualified, \ncompetent and capable of providing our children with the quality \neducation they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8052-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8053-S8054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE CRIME IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment as a \ncosponsor of the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998. Mr. \nPresident, this is a bill that simply, but importantly, provides \nfunding to states and local communities so they can conduct quality \ncriminal background checks. This bill assures parents that dangerous \nadults will not be employed by their child's school or child care \nfacility.\n  There is no doubt that most children today head off to school or are \ndropped off at child care and are supervised by competent, qualified, \ncaring adults. But as our society becomes increasingly violent, parents \nneed the assurance that when their child is under another adult's care, \nsteps have been taken to assure that the care-giver is qualified and \ncompetent and safe to take care of their child.\n  Mr. President, we sit in outrage when television newscasters report \nyet another story of a child who has been abused or molested when \nparents thought they had found a safe place to take their child. \nNothing frightens a parent more than a report of a child who has been \nabused by a predator--molesters, abusers or pedophiles.\n  We do not have to sit and wait, Mr. President. We can and must do \nmore. We have the laws to better screen those who care for our \nchildren. Let us use them. We must protect our children and see to it \nthat they grow up in a safe environment. No child should ever suffer \nthese kinds of traumas. That is why Mr. President, I am cosponsoring \nthe Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998. I believe this bill is \na strong step to accomplish the type of protection that is needed.\n  We have a right to expect that those people to whom we entrust the \ncare of our children are decent, upright, trustworthy individuals. \nParents have a right to know that anyone who comes in contact with \ntheir children in an unsupervised environment has been appropriately \nscreened. We have a right to know that anyone with a criminal history \nof child abuse, molestation and sexual crimes against children will be \nprevented from being in a position where they have access to our \nchildren.\n  In this highly mobile society we live in, we know that abusers move \neasily across state boundaries seeking jobs in places where they think \ntheir past will not catch up to them. If schools or child care \nproviders only check in-state applicants for state criminal \nconvictions--and do not require a fingerprint check which can be \nscanned against a national clearinghouse of convicted criminals--they \nhave not adequately screened applicants before hiring them to oversee \nour children.\n  In fact, Mr. President, a case that prompted the passage of laws \nrequiring national criminal background checks in my home State of \nWashington, involved the arrest of a social worker who possessed \nhundreds of photos and videotapes of young boys engaged in sexual \nactivities. He was charged on 40 counts of possession of child \npornography.\n  The investigation began after one of the adolescents under his \nsupervision accused him of sexual abuse. When the social worker was \nhired, a background check of this man was ``clean'' and reported ``no \npast problems.'' However, he was previously employed by a state agency \nfar away, across state lines in Texas. Although the Washington state \nagency checked his references in Texas, they did not check to see if he \nhad a criminal history in any other state.\n  The background check did not extend beyond the borders of Washington \nstate. State officials at the time admitted they had no routine way of \ndetermining whether any state worker had ever run afoul of the law \noutside Washington's borders.\n  As a result of this incident, the Washington State Legislature closed \nthis loophole by passing laws requiring national criminal background \nchecks on workers and volunteers who deal with vulnerable populations \nsuch as children, the elderly and disabled.\n  More recently, at a Washington, D.C. day care center, a substitute \nsecurity guard was filling in for the regular guard, who was sick that \nday. That afternoon, the substitute guard was arrested on the \npremises--allegedly an accessory to murder a few months earlier.\n  In this case, the security firm failed to screen the worker \nadequately. He was a resident of Maryland and the firm only checked \nstate records which revealed no criminal record. However, the \nsubstitute guard had a long rap sheet in Washington D.C., which the \nsecurity firm did not check. The failure of this security firm to \nconduct a background check of the neighboring state's jurisdiction put \n70 children at tremendous risk.\n  It is imperative that we stop interstate movement and let abusers \nknow that their backgrounds will be checked, their applications will be \nscreened and national and state fingerprint checks will be conducted \nwhere appropriate. In addition, it is essential that we provide funds \nto the states so they can update their criminal history records and \nprovide timely information when it is requested.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, we live in a time that requires us to \nprotect our children by screening and checking the backgrounds of \nvolunteers and other people who have access to our children. Statistics \nreveal that 46 percent of child molesters are non-family members who \nare known to their victims. These are ``trusted'' adults, such as \nteachers, scoutmasters, coaches,\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nclergy, counselors and neighbors. As parents, we must be concerned \nabout the people who have access to our children. The bottom line is \nthat strict screening mechanisms and criminal background checks are \nvital to the safety of our children.\n  Mr. President, I am cosponsoring this bill because it provides grants \nto the States for programs for fingerprint-supported background checks \nfor non-criminal justice purposes. These purposes include screening \nyouth service employees, volunteers, and other individuals in positions \nof trust--if authorized by federal or state law and administered by a \ngovernment agency. This bill also promotes enhanced communication \nnationwide between local, state, and national computer systems for \ndomestic violence and sexual offender identification and registration \nsystems.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 is also important \nbecause it provides necessary funding to the States so they can upgrade \ntheir criminal history record systems and improve criminal \nidentification of sexual offenders.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an effective way to stop pedophiles from \nstalking our children under the guise of employment or volunteer \nactivity. It will also help States protect their children by letting \nsexual predators know that background checks and screening mechanisms \nwill be conducted wherever they move.\n  It is imperative that would-be employees not be able to avoid \ndetection during background checks by failing to report their criminal \npast. The Raleigh News and Observer reported on January 8, 1997 that \nTerry Dondrell Howie pled guilty to being an accessory to a murder, at \nthe same time he worked taking care of toddlers at a local day care \ncenter.\n  Howie was fired from his job at the day care center, three days after \nhe was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in a deadly car-\njacking. Although a state law that requires annual background checks \nwould have eventually caught his felony charges, day care employees \nfacing felony charges can escape detection for months.\n  There is no requirement that a lengthy background check be completed \nbefore a hiring because of the high turnover on day care center staffs.\n  This can be a fatal practice that must be changed. Take the tragic \ncase of 18-year-old Michelle Montoya, who--in 1997, as a senior in Rio \nLinda High School--was brutally raped and killed in the school's wood \nshop by a substitute janitor with a felonious past. The janitor was put \non-the-job before fingerprint tests were completed. He had served time \nfor voluntary manslaughter and just prior to the murder of Michelle, he \nhad been paroled. Although California has since passed legislation \nprohibiting school districts from hiring employees before background \nchecks are complete, the same is not true in every state.\n  As parents we expect our schools and day care centers to protect or \nchildren. We must provide the funding and the attention necessary to \ncorrect this problem so that other families do not suffer the same kind \nof horrible tragedy and loss as the Montoya family.\n  Mr. President, we cannot take any chances when it comes to protecting \nour children. We must do everything we can to ensure their safety and \nprotection which is why I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8053-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MRS. CATHY ABELL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mister President, I would like to recognize the \nprofessional dedication, vision and public service of Mrs. Cathy Abell \nwho is leaving the Army Senate Legislative Liaison Office to serve as \nthe Congressional Affairs Coordinator for the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. It is a privilege for me to \nrecognize the many outstanding achievements she has provided for the \nSenate, the Army, and our great Nation.\n  Cathy Abell worked for every Member of the Senate as the Secretary of \nthe Army's legislative liaison to the Senate. She was instrumental in \nfacilitating the exchange of information between our constituent \nservices offices and the Department of the Army. Mrs. Abell is an \nexpert at cutting through the red tape of the military bureaucracy and \nnever lost sight of the fact that taking care of the individual was \nparamount. I never knew of an instance in which Mrs. Abell would back \naway from doing the right thing for the Army, the soldier or family \nmember and the Senate offices she served.\n  Mrs. Abell earned the reputation as someone on whom we could rely on \nto respond to our inquiries in a responsive, professional manner. She \nalways provided informative, well researched responses to our \nconstituents. Cathy Abell was the ``go to'' person in the Army's Senate \nLegislative Liaison Office. When a Senate office had a really complex \ncase, the legislative assistants knew that they should direct the \ninquiry to her. Mrs. Abell would skillfully work through the complex \nmilitary regulations and determine how best to maintain the integrity \nof the Army's processes while permitting the soldier or family member \nto receive the relief required by their situation. She is able to \ncommunicate effectively with both military officials and Congressional \nstaff members and has developed superb working relationships with our \nstaffs. Her professional abilities and the excellent working \nrelationships earned her the respect and trust which served her, the \nArmy and the Senate so well.\n  Mrs. Abell recognized that many of our staff were not familiar with \nArmy organizations, processes and procedures. To address this lack of \nfamiliarity, she organized and implemented a series of trips in which \nour staffs were able to experience first hand the conditions under \nwhich military personnel are recruited, processed and trained. As a \nresult of her initiative, Senate staff members are able to more \naccurately explain Army procedures to constituents, in many cases \neliminating the need for a formal inquiry. Initiative, caring service \nand professionalism are the terms used to describe Mrs. Abell.\n  Mister President, Cathy Abell is a great credit to the Army and the \nNation. As she now departs to share her experience and expertise with \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, I \ncall upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize her \nservice to the Senate and wish her well in her new assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8054-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to discuss an important \nissue that should be addressed by House and Senate conferees meeting to \nresolve differences regarding the Higher Education Reauthorization Act.\n  Various institutions of higher education have tried for a number of \nyears to have the Age Discrimination in Employment Act amended to allow \ncertain types of early retirement plans for tenured faculty. Various \nMembers of\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nthis Body have traditionally viewed such an amendment with concern.\n  At the same time, some Members of this Body are concerned that \npotentially meritorious ADEA claims have faced statute of limitations \nproblems based on the application of the Supreme Court decision in \nLorance versus AT Technologies.\n  I understand there have been efforts to address these concerns, and I \nwould like to pose a question to my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy, is it your understanding that the \nHouse of Representatives has addressed one or both of these issues in \nits version of this bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The House of Representatives has addressed only one of \nthese issues. It has proposed a limited exception to the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act for tenured faculty. But you are \ncorrect that there is an additional concern regarding older workers and \ntheir ability to pursue claims under the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act, and that has to do, as you noted, with the application \nof the Supreme Court case, Lorance versus AT Technologies.\n  In 1991, Congress passed legislation that partially overturned \nLorance. Today, Lorance does not apply to claims brought under Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act. Unfortunately, Congress did not consider \nthe effect of the Lorance decision on other statutes, in particular, \nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, it is unfortunate. Lorance established an \nunworkable system for filing claims under the employment discrimination \nlaws. It held that when a seniority system was allegedly adopted with a \ndiscriminatory purpose, the time limit for challenging that system \nbegins to run on the date the system is first adopted--not the date it \nbegins to apply to the individual employee. This could be a ``catch-\n22'': by the time an employee is harmed and has standing to bring a \nclaim, the statutory time period for challenging the policy will often \nhave expired. Indeed, in some cases, no current employee would ever be \nable to challenge a long-standing, but discriminatory employment policy \nor system.\n  This is clearly contrary to the purposes of the age discrimination \nlaws. There is no justification for unfairly closing the doors of \njustice to victims of age discrimination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I concur with my colleague from Iowa. Before the Senate \naccedes to the House's provision on tenured faculty, this issue should \nbe discussed and hopefully resolved during the conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8054-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8055-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8055-S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5974.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under the Medicare Program of insulin pumps as \nitems of durable medical equipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               medicare insulin pump coverage act of 1998\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, diabetes is a serious and potentially \nlife-threatening disease affecting more than 16 million Americans at a \ncost of more than $137 billion annually. That is more than the cost of \ntreating any other disease. Moreover, since 3 million elderly Medicare \nbeneficiaries have been diagnosed with diabetes, and another 3 million \nare likely to have it but not realize it at this point, nowhere is the \neconomic impact of diabetes felt more strongly than in our Medicare \nProgram.\n  Treating seniors for the often devastating complications associated \nwith diabetes accounts for more than one-quarter of all Medicare \nexpenses. Therefore, helping diabetic seniors avoid the complications \nof their disease will not only greatly improve the quality of their \nlives, but also help reduce the economic burden that diabetes places on \nthe Medicare Program. This, Mr. President, is essential to the long-\nterm economic viability of Medicare.\n  While there is no known cure, diabetes is largely a treatable \ndisease. Many people who have diabetes can lead completely normal, \nactive lives as long as they stick to a proper diet, carefully monitor \nthe amount of their blood sugar or glucose, and take their medicine, \nwhich may or may not include insulin.\n  However, Mr. President, unfortunately, if a person with diabetes does \nnot follow this rather strict regimen, they put themselves at risk of \nblindness, loss of limbs and an increased chance of heart disease, \nkidney failure, and stroke. Therefore, appropriate preventive services \nfor diabetes have the potential to save a great deal of money that \notherwise would go for hospitalization or other acute care costs--not \nto mention a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering.\n  Mr. President, Congress recently took a number of important steps to \nimprove Medicare coverage of preventive care for individuals with \ndiabetes. Prior to enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \nMedicare covered diabetes self-maintenance education services in \ninpatient or hospital-based settings and in limited outpatient \nsettings, specifically hospital outpatient departments or rural health \nclinics.\n  Medicare did not, however, cover education services if they were \ngiven in any other outpatient setting, such as a physician's office. \nMoreover, while Medicare did cover the cost of blood-testing strips \nused to monitor the sugar in the blood, it did so only for type I \ndiabetics who required insulin to control their disease. Last year's \nBalanced Budget Act rightly expanded Medicare to cover all outpatient \nself-management training services as well as providing uniform coverage \nof blood-testing strips for all people with diabetes.\n  With the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, we made significant \nprogress toward improving care for Medicare beneficiaries with \ndiabetes. However, Mr. President, there is more that we can do.\n  External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be more effective at \ncontrolling blood glucose levels than conventional injection therapy \nfor many insulin-dependent diabetics. This helps them to avoid the \nexpensive complications and the suffering resulting from uncontrolled \ndiabetes. However, Mr. President, Medicare currently does not cover \nthese pumps, even in cases where they have been prescribed as medically \nnecessary by the Medicare beneficiary's physician. I am, therefore, \ntoday pleased to introduce legislation, the Medicare Insulin Pump \nCoverage Act of 1998, that would expand Medicare coverage to cover \ninsulin infusion pumps for certain type I diabetics.\n  External insulin pumps are neither investigational nor experimental. \nThey are widely accepted by health care professionals involved in \ntreating patients with diabetes. Moreover, studies such as the Diabetes \nControl and Complications Trial sponsored by NIH have established that \nmaintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible is the \nkey to preventing the devastating complications of diabetes.\n  For many patients, Mr. President, the use of an infusion pump is the \nonly way that optimal blood glucose control can be achieved safely and \neffectively. That is why virtually all other third-party payers--\nincluding most State Medicaid programs and CHAMPUS--cover the device. \nMoreover, there is precedent under the Medicare Program itself for \ncovering the pump. Medicare currently covers infusion pumps for \nnumerous cancer drugs as well as for pain control medications.\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\n  Mr. President, I first became interested in this problem because of \nthe experience of one of my constituents, Nona Frederich of Raymond, \nME. She is an example of the kind of Medicare patient who would benefit \nfrom the pump. She is currently, unfortunately, being denied what is \nfor her the most effective form of glucose control.\n  Nona has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since 1962. Because of \nher extremely volatile insulin sensitivity, her diabetic specialist \nplaced her on an insulin infusion pump in January of 1982. Until she \nreached age 65, the cost of the pump and operating supplies was \nunderwritten in large part by her insurer, Colorado Blue-Cross-Blue \nShield, and later by Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Maine.\n  In March of 1995, it became necessary for Nona to purchase a new \ninfusion pump. By now, however, she was older and on Medicare. Much to \nher surprise, Medicare refused to cover the pump, even though her \ndoctor had prescribed it as clearly being medically necessary to help \ncontrol her diabetes. Since then, with the help of my Portland office \nstaff, the Frederichs have worked their way through the Health Care \nFinancing Administration's system of appeals. Unfortunately, in January \nof this year, they received final notification of a negative decision \nby the Department of Health and Human Services. Their only option now \nis to file a civil suit, which they are simply not in a position to \npursue.\n  The Frederichs literally have notebooks filled with documentation of \nthe procedures they have followed and the evidence they have submitted. \nMoreover, they have personally paid close to $5,000 in original pump \ncosts and supplies for which they have received no reimbursement under \nthe Medicare Program. For a Medicare beneficiary with limited income, \nthese kinds of costs can be devastating. They can place the pump \ncompletely out of reach, even though the pump is medically necessary. \nIn such a case, such patients would be forced to return to or continue \nwith conventional insulin therapy which simply may not be as effective \nin controlling their blood sugar. As a consequence, these patients are \nadmitted to the hospital with complications over and over again. The \nirony is that then Medicare will pick up the bill, and a far higher \nbill it will be than if Medicare had paid for the pump in the first \nplace.\n  While potentially devastating for an individual, the financial cost \nto Medicare of expanding coverage to include the insulin-infusion pump \nwould be relatively minor. Under my bill, the pump would have to be \nprescribed by a physician and the beneficiary would have to be a Type-I \ndiabetic, ``experiencing severe swings of high and low blood glucose \nlevels.'' Of the estimated 3 million Medicare beneficiaries with \ndiabetes, only about 5 percent are Type-I, or insulin-dependent. Of \nthese, it is estimated the pump would be appropriate for only about 4 \npercent. But what a difference it would make in the lives of those 4 \npercent.\n  The American Diabetes Association, the American Association of \nClinical Endocrinologists and the American Association of Diabetes \nEducators, as well as officials at the Centers for Disease Control, \nhave all advocated expanding Medicare to cover insulin pumps for Type-I \ndiabetics who would otherwise have great difficulty in controlling \ntheir blood sugar.\n  I am very pleased to be introducing this legislation today to do just \nthat. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be entered into the record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2292\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce the Older \nAmericans Act Reauthorization Bill of 1998. I have 22 co-sponsors: \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, Senator James Inhofe, Senator Gordon Smith, \nSenator Lauch Faircloth, Senator Daniel Inouye, Senator Rick Santorum, \nSenator John Breaux, Senator Richard Durbin, Senator Max Cleland, \nSenator Edward Kennedy, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Senator Barbara Boxer, \nSenator Patty Murray, Senator Wendell Ford, Senator Ron Wyden, Senator \nPat Roberts, Senator Daniel Akaka, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Richard \nBryan, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Bob Graham, and Senator Charles \nGrassley.\n  The OAA expired in 1995, and we are entering the fourth year without \nan OAA reauthorization. The bill would reauthorize the OAA thru the \nyear 2001 using the language of the 1992 Act. This time frame would \ngive needed stability to OAA programs while allowing a full evaluation \nof the OAA to ensure it is relevant to our current and future seniors.\n  Reauthorization of the OAA is absolutely essential. It is the major \nvehicle for the delivery of such programs as: meals on wheels; \ncongregate meals; home care (personal care, homemaker, and chore \nservice); adult day care; senior centers; transportation; a job program \nwith skills training for low income seniors; a long term care \nombudsman; research and demonstration projects; and abuse prevention \nand elder rights.\n  In addition, this is the cornerstone of programs for elderly Native \nAmericans because it is the only federal program that allows tribes to \ndirectly plan for the needs of their elderly based on their own culture \nand traditions.\n  The OAA is a coordinated system of care that can work alone or hand \nin hand with Medicare and Medicaid services for those seniors in \ngreatest social and economic need. It also encourages public/private \npartnerships; promotes seniors volunteering to help one another; and \nspells out a planning and oversight mechanism that includes the seniors \nthemselves.\n  We all recognize and appreciate the hard work of the Sub-Committee on \nAging to get an updated, reauthorized bill to us during this Congress, \nand I will continue to work in support of their effort. However, with \nour condensed legislative calendar, the likelihood of completing the \nfull committee\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\nprocess is diminished. This legislation would provide a short term \nreauthorization in order to allow The Committee to continue its work to \nrewrite the 1992 law.\n  This bill is endorsed by 32 of the major national aging organizations \nand associations, a list is attached.\n  Mr. President, our nation's seniors and their families are very \nconcerned that these vital services will stop. It is time to reassure \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of groups \nsupporting the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                    Older Americans Act Endorsements\n\n       National Association of State Long Term Care Ombudsman \n     Programs.\n       National Silver Haired Congress.\n       National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services \n     Programs.\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n       Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc.\n       National Indian Council on Aging, Inc.\n       Texas National Silver Haired Congress.\n       National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse.\n       National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.\n       Council of Senior Centers and Services of New York City, \n     Inc.\n       National Council on the Aging.\n       National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform.\n       Arizona Association of Area Agencies on Aging.\n       Pima Council on Aging.\n       American Bar Association.\n       The Center for Social Gerontology.\n       American Bar Association Governmental Affairs Office.\n       American Association of Retired Persons.\n       The National Caucus and Center on Black Aged, Inc.

                           \n\n                  HUTCHINSON AMENDMENTS NOS. 3123-3125\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill (S. 2132) making appropriations for the Department of \nDefense for fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3123\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n                                TITLE IX\n\n                         HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n                 Subtitle A--Forced Abortions in China\n\n       Sec. 9001. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n     only to regulate the number of children, but also to \n     eliminate those who are regarded as defective in accordance \n     with the official eugenic policy known as the ``Natal and \n     Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China, including any official of the Communist \n     Party or the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     its regional, local, and village authorities (except the head \n     of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on credible \n     information, has been involved in the establishment or \n     enforcement of population control policies resulting in a \n     woman being forced to undergo an abortion against her free \n     choice, or resulting in a man or woman being forced to \n     undergo sterilization against his or her free choice.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to a national of the People's \n     Republic of China if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     no funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department of State for fiscal year 1999 for the United \n     States Information Agency or the United States Agency for \n     International Development may be used for the purpose of \n     providing travel expenses and per diem for the participation \n     in conferences, exchanges, programs, and activities of the \n     following nationals of the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) The head or political secretary of any of the following \n     Chinese Government-created or approved organizations:\n       (A) The Chinese Buddhist Association.\n       (B) The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.\n       (C) The National Congress of Catholic Representatives.\n       (D) The Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference.\n       (E) The Chinese Protestant ``Three Self'' Patriotic \n     Movement.\n       (F) The China Christian Council.\n       (G) The Chinese Taoist Association.\n       (H) The Chinese Islamic Association.\n       (2) Any military or civilian official or employee of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China who carried out \n     or directed the carrying out of any of the following policies \n     or practices:\n       (A) Formulating, drafting, or implementing repressive \n     religious policies.\n       (B) Imprisoning, detaining, or harassing individuals on \n     religious grounds.\n       (C) Promoting or participating in policies or practices \n     which hinder religious activities or the free expression of \n     religious beliefs.\n       (b)(1) Each Federal agency subject to the prohibition in \n     subsection (a) shall certify in writing to the appropriate \n     congressional committees, on a quarterly basis during fiscal \n     year 1999, that it did not pay, either directly or through a \n     contractor or grantee, for travel expenses or per diem of any \n     national of the People's Republic of China described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Each certification under paragraph (1) shall be \n     supported by the following information:\n       (A) The name of each employee of any agency of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China whose travel \n     expenses or per diem were paid by funds of the reporting \n     agency of the United States Government.\n       (B) The procedures employed by the reporting agency of the \n     United States Government to ascertain whether each individual \n     under subparagraph (A) did or did not participate in \n     activities described in subsection (a)(2).\n       (C) The reporting agency's basis for concluding that each \n     individual under subparagraph (A) did not participate in such \n     activities.\n       Sec. 9013. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China described in section 9012(a)(2) (except the \n     head of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014. In this subtitle, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives.\n\n         Subtitle C--Monitoring of Human Rights Abuses in China\n\n       Sec. 9021. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Political \n     Freedom in China Act of 1998''.\n       Sec. 9022. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``[a]buses include torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     incommunicado detention''.\n       (D) ``[p]rison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``[a]lthough the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``[n]onapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups * * * experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``[s]erious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia[, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``[o]verall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\n       Sec. 9023.

This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China, including any official of the Communist \n     Party or the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     its regional, local, and village authorities (except the head \n     of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on credible \n     information, has been involved in the establishment or \n     enforcement of population control policies resulting in a \n     woman being forced to undergo an abortion against her free \n     choice, or resulting in a man or woman being forced to \n     undergo sterilization against his or her free choice.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to a national of the People's \n     Republic of China if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     no funds appropriated or\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\n     otherwise made available for the Department of State for \n     fiscal year 1999 for the United States Information Agency or \n     the United States Agency for International Development may be \n     used for the purpose of providing travel expenses and per \n     diem for the participation in conferences, exchanges, \n     programs, and activities of the following nationals of the \n     People's Republic of China:\n       (1) The head or political secretary of any of the following \n     Chinese Government-created or approved organizations:\n       (A) The Chinese Buddhist Association.\n       (B) The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.\n       (C) The National Congress of Catholic Representatives.\n       (D) The Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference.\n       (E) The Chinese Protestant ``Three Self'' Patriotic \n     Movement.\n       (F) The China Christian Council.\n       (G) The Chinese Taoist Association.\n       (H) The Chinese Islamic Association.\n       (2) Any military or civilian official or employee of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China who carried out \n     or directed the carrying out of any of the following policies \n     or practices:\n       (A) Formulating, drafting, or implementing repressive \n     religious policies.\n       (B) Imprisoning, detaining, or harassing individuals on \n     religious grounds.\n       (C) Promoting or participating in policies or practices \n     which hinder religious activities or the free expression of \n     religious beliefs.\n       (b)(1) Each Federal agency subject to the prohibition in \n     subsection (a) shall certify in writing to the appropriate \n     congressional committees, on a quarterly basis during fiscal \n     year 1999, that it did not pay, either directly or through a \n     contractor or grantee, for travel expenses or per diem of any \n     national of the People's Republic of China described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Each certification under paragraph (1) shall be \n     supported by the following information:\n       (A) The name of each employee of any agency of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China whose travel \n     expenses or per diem were paid by funds of the reporting \n     agency of the United States Government.\n       (B) The procedures employed by the reporting agency of the \n     United States Government to ascertain whether each individual \n     under subparagraph (A) did or did not participate in \n     activities described in subsection (a)(2).\n       (C) The reporting agency's basis for concluding that each \n     individual under subparagraph (A) did not participate in such \n     activities.\n       Sec. 9013. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China described in section 9012(a)(2) (except the \n     head of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014.

Mr. President, Yesterday, The New York Times \nreported that Wall Street firms will turn their clocks ahead today to \nDecember 29, 1999, to begin mock trading in the widest ranging Year \n2000 (Y2K) test yet by any industry. The tests will investigate what \nmight happen to anyone trading stocks, options, or corporate and \nmunicipal bonds on December 30 and 31, 1999, and January 3 and 4, 2000 \n(January 1, 2000 falls on a Saturday).\n  As a member of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology, I \nam encouraged to see that the financial community is taking the Year \n2000 computer problem seriously. On Monday, July 6, Senator Bennett and \nI held a field hearing in New York to examine the progress of U.S. and \nforeign financial firms in addressing the Y2K problem. At the hearing, \nwe emphasized the importance of testing, and the need to begin testing \nby December of this year. Appearing on behalf of the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York, the First Vice President Ernest T. Patrikis said that \nhe ``does not think it is possible to over-emphasize the importance of \ntesting to help improve readiness.''\n  The hearing last week made it clear that Y2K is a serious and \npervasive problem confronting the domestic and international economy. \nThe Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of the New York \nStock Exchange, William A. Bautz, said that the Securities Industry \nAssociation (SIA) refers to solving the Year 2000 computer problem as \n``the biggest business-technology effort that the world has ever \nexperienced.''\n  I am pleased that SIA is sponsoring this industry-wide test and look \nforward to seeing the results. I only hope that the other industries \nfollow the lead of the financial community and start their testing \nsoon.\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\n  I ask that the article from yesterday's Times, ``Wall St. to Roll \nClock Ahead To See if Year 2000 Computes,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 12, 1998]\n\n       Wall St. to Roll Clock Ahead To See if Year 2000 Computes\n\n                         (By Barnaby J. Feder)\n\n       For computer wizards on Wall Street, tomorrow will be Dec. \n     29, 1999, a step into electronic time travel that will be \n     studied anxiously around the globe.\n       After months of preparation, the nation's leading brokers, \n     the major exchanges, clearinghouses and depository companies \n     will begin mock trading in the widest-ranging test yet by any \n     industry of how well computers will cope with the transition \n     to the next century.\n       The tests, sponsored by the Securities Industry \n     Association, are designed to help brokers and other key \n     players in the $270 billion industry figure out whether their \n     computer systems are ready to handle trades that will settle \n     on Jan. 3, 2000, the first business day of the new century. \n     Over the next two weeks, the industry will reset the clocks \n     on the test computers and investigate what might happen to \n     anyone trading stocks, options or corporate and municipal \n     bonds on Dec. 30 and 31, 1999, and Jan 3, and 4, 2000.\n       Not much has been left to chance. The multimillion-dollar \n     effort is supervised by Coopers & Lybrand following trading \n     scripts carefully developed by the participants with the help \n     of outside consultants.\n       Thus, Leonard De Trizio, the J.P. Morgan & Company vice \n     president in charge of the computers that support equity \n     trading, knows that he will be selling 800 shares of a \n     fictional Big Board company with the ticker symbol KDD at \n     9:30 tomorrow morning, and he knows that Morgan Stanley \n     will be buying it, while Merrill Lynch & Company will be \n     selling Home Shopping Network convertible bonds to Lehman \n     Brothers.\n       The participants are looking for signs of the millennium \n     bug, the catchall name for a variety of electronic foul-ups \n     that are likely to occur when computers fail to recognize \n     that the first days of the new century come after the last \n     days of the old one. The problem stems from the way many \n     microprocessors and computer programs use only two digits to \n     refer to the year in dates--98 for 1998, for example.\n       Many chips and programs do not accept a low number like 00 \n     for the year 2000, or 01 for 2001 as valid dates that follow \n     the 99 for 1999.\n       What complicates the problem is that computers often react \n     in unpredictable ways. Some spew inaccurate data. Others \n     appear to function normally but then cannot be restarted once \n     they have been shut down.\n       Computer specialists have talked about the millennium \n     problem for decades. But only recently have businesses and \n     public officials begun to recognize how widely dates are used \n     in computing and to take seriously warnings that the dawn of \n     the new century could see widespread disruptions in daily \n     life, at the very least, and deadly accidents or perhaps a \n     global economic recession if the problem is not tamed.\n       Because the securities industry is the first to conduct \n     tests involving connections between many computer users and \n     is publishing vast amounts of data about the results on its \n     World Wide Web site (www.sia.com), year 2000 experts say that \n     the results of these tests could have a huge effect on morale \n     in the rapidly growing legions of specialists working on the \n     problem.\n       ``It's good that they are setting a standard of openness \n     for the entire corporate sector,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief \n     economist of Deutsche Bank Securities. Mr. Yardeni has become \n     one of the highest-profile year 2000 pessimists, predicting a \n     70 percent chance of worldwide recession stemming from \n     computer problems related to the millennium.\n       ``If it goes badly, though, corporations may be more \n     reluctant to share information, and more people are going to \n     come around to my view of the risks,'' Mr. Yardeni said.\n       Those managing the securities tests are discouraging any \n     attempt to draw broad conclusions from them. The managers \n     point out, for example, that the tests will deal with very \n     small volumes of fictional securities, and they describe the \n     exercise as a mere dress rehearsal for high-volume tests \n     planned for next spring. Some major computer systems have \n     been completely excluded, including those that manage \n     dividends and interest, margin trading and client account \n     records. In addition, only the most common types of trades \n     and securities will be tested this week.\n       ``Dealing with this isn't rocket science, but there is a \n     mountain of details,'' said Donald Kittell, the association's \n     executive vice president. ``People don't realize that a trade \n     may go through 40 to 50 steps from start to finish.''\n       The securities companies participating in the test that \n     starts tomorrow account for about half the trading volume in \n     stocks, bonds, options and other financial instruments. Each \n     agreed to set up a discrete computer operation to run the \n     tests. In the United States alone, securities companies are \n     expected to spend $3 billion to $5 billion addressing year \n     2000 and related problems.\n       Yet, when the millennium arrives, Wall Street's ability to \n     function will depend not just on the internal systems it \n     began to test today but on the preparedness of markets \n     overseas, where many players offset any bets placed \n     domestically.\n       What is more, Wall Street's success at ushering in the \n     millennium will also depend heavily on the year 2000 \n     readiness of New York's power, water and telecommunications \n     utilities and of countless other systems that are beyond its \n     ability to test.\n       All of this underscores what many computer experts consider \n     one of the most troubling aspects of the year 2000 challenge. \n     Each phase of the problem--from identifying vulnerable \n     systems to figuring out remedies to testing fixes--has proved \n     more complicated, time-consuming and expensive than had been \n     expected. The emerging consensus has been that testing has \n     been the most widely underestimated challenge.\n       Consultants are consistently warning that very few \n     corporations, government agencies or other computer-dependent \n     enterprises will end up having enough time and resources to \n     do as much testing as they should.\n       ``It would be a setback if this doesn't go well,'' said \n     William Ulrich, a year 2000 consultant in Soquel, Calif., \n     ``because these guys are way out in front.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8066-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8067-S8068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HIGHER EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nsupport S. 1882, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. This bill \ncomes at a time when our nation's shifting job market has greatly \nincreased student demand for post-secondary education. However, for \nmany families in Kentucky and across the nation, the rising cost of \ntuition creates a real barrier to attending college. A majority of \ncollege students today rely upon some form of financial assistance in \norder to meet these escalating costs. For the first time in decades, \nloans constitute the largest part of student financial-aid packages. As \nthe loan burden increases, students and their families are seeking \ngreater choice in financial resources for higher education.\n  Making a college education more affordable has always been a priority \nof mine, and for the past several years I have introduced legislation \nto provide tax incentives to families who save for college. In fact, my \nlegislation, which allows tax-free education savings in state-sponsored \nsavings plans for education purposes, was included in the Parent and \nStudent Savings Account Plus Act, which Congress approved earlier this \nyear by a strong margin. The House and Senate approved this essential \nlegislation in response to growing public interest in federal policies \nthat facilitate personal planning and investment in education, and to \nprovide students with greater choices in both academic programming and \nfinancial aid resources. However, this measure and similar initiatives \nhave been heavily criticized by the Clinton Administration.\n  For example, throughout the HEA reauthorization process, President \nClinton has repeatedly tried to limit students' financial options by \ncreating a single-lender system run by the U.S. Department of \nEducation. Banks, credit unions, and other qualified lenders currently \nuse their financial expertise and experience in loan management to \nprovide college loans for students and parents through the Federal \nFamily Education Loan Program (FFELP), while the U.S. Department of \nEducation operates the Direct Lending program through participating \ncolleges and universities. The Clinton Administration heralded the \nconsumer benefits that would result from the competition between FFELP \nand the Direct Lending program during its original authorization in the \n1993 Budget. Now, President Clinton has turned away from his original \nadvocacy for greater choice in favor of making the U.S. Department of \nEducation the sole lender for student loans.\n  Since its creation, the Direct Lending program's reputation has \nbecome synonymous with slow, inefficient service. The Department simply \ndoes not have the personnel or experience necessary to efficiently \nprocess the high volume of loans demanded by students. For example, in \n1996, the processing of 900,000 student aid applications submitted to \nthe Department were delayed by severe management problems. Just last \nyear Congress was forced to pass the Emergency Student Loan \nConsolidation Act in response to the Department's stoppage in \nprocessing applications for direct loan consolidations. If students had \nbeen limited to one lending option, the Department's backlog and \norganizational problems\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nwould have denied many students access to the student loans necessary \nfor their enrollment in school.\n  Based on the Department's struggle to meet its responsibility to our \nnation's students, concerned members of the House and Senate have \nworked diligently to prevent another crisis in student access to \ncollege loans. Not all colleges and universities participate in the \nDirect Lending program, and the interest rate index adjustments \nsupported by the 1993 Budget threaten to eliminate private lenders from \nthe student loan market. Without the aid of private lenders, many \nstudents will be left without necessary financial assistance. S. 1882 \nrejects Clinton's repeated attempts to strangle consumer choice by \nrevising the interest rate index on student loans, and improves the \nservice and accountability standards of guaranty agencies who \nparticipate in the FFELP program.\n  The guaranty agency model included in this bill directs agencies to \nutilize the advantages of the Internet and other technological advances \nin order to increase the speed and efficiency of the student loan \nprocess. S. 1882 also increases the financial responsibility guaranty \nagencies must bear when a student loan goes into default. All lending \norganizations--public and private--should be held up to high standards \nof performance and fiscal integrity. By increasing agency \naccountability, this bill makes sure that students across the country \nhave access to qualified, responsible lending agencies. By streamlining \nthe loan process and weeding out irresponsible lenders, S. 1182 \nstrengthens the ability of reliable agencies to offer low-interest \nstudent loans.\n  S. 1182 increases institutional accountability not only for lenders, \nbut for institutions of higher education as well. A solid primary and \nsecondary education is the base upon which future academic success is \nbuilt, and a highly qualified teaching force is an essential component \nof a child's educational foundation. S. 1182 raises the bar with which \nwe measure teachers by holding institutions of higher education that \nprepare teachers for classroom instruction responsible for the caliber \nof teachers they graduate.\n  From early childhood through post-secondary school, a child has no \ngreater resource than a knowledgeable, skillful teacher in the \nclassroom, and S. 1882 holds both states and institutions of higher \neducation responsible for placing the best teachers in our public \nschools. Through the creation of Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants, S. \n1882 focuses on state-based reform of the teacher certification process \nto ensure that new teachers are qualified both in instructional skills \nand the subject matter which they teach, and to hold institutions of \nhigher education accountable for properly preparing teachers for the \nclassroom. These grants also give states the flexibility to financially \nreward teachers whose students have high levels of academic \nperformance, and the authority to remove unqualified teachers from the \nclassroom. In addition, S. 1882 allows states to develop alternative \ncertification options for college graduates and capable individuals \nfrom other professional and occupational backgrounds who are interested \nin teaching.\n  Students face many other barriers in addition to cost when preparing \nfor acceptance into a post-secondary school. Many first-generation and \nlow-income students have educational needs that are not met by routine \nclassroom instruction. S. 1882 provides support services and counseling \nprograms for these students through the reauthorization of federal TRIO \nprograms. For years, students across Kentucky have benefited from the \nUpward Bound program, which assists disadvantaged students in gaining \nentrance into higher education and completing a course of study. \nUnfortunately, many Upward Bound students are forced to choose between \nsummer educational programs and part-time employment. S. 1882 will \nenable these students to pursue challenging academic programs by \nexpanding Upward Bound to include summer work study. The Talent Search \nprogram is also expanded to introduce low-income students to careers in \nwhich students from disadvantaged backgrounds are under-represented. I \nam pleased that S. 1882 reauthorizes and strengthens these two programs \nwhich are highly valued by students throughout Kentucky.\n  The influence of institutions of higher education is felt far beyond \nthe classroom as many colleges and universities are providing long-term \nleadership for communities undergoing an economic transition. In \nKentucky, the higher education community has done an exemplary job of \nmolding its curricula to meet the economic needs of the Commonwealth. \nThe University of Kentucky and Louisville have established world-class \nresearch programs and have extended their community recruitment and \noutreach programs. Many of Kentucky's regional colleges and private \nschools are also implementing programs complimentary to the goals of \nexcellence outlined by their home communities and the state government. \nKentucky's community colleges and technical schools recently integrated \ntheir academic and training programs to create a seamless system of \npost-secondary education. Such efforts to achieve cooperation and \nquality in post-secondary education will produce great benefits for \nKentucky students in the years to come.\n  By recognizing the inextricable link between future economic \nviability and higher education, Kentucky is a prime example of the \ndirection in which higher education in the United States is headed. \nWith this bill, we have the opportunity to open the doors of higher \neducation to a greater number of students than ever before, at a time \nwhen post-secondary education is at a premium. As the summer draws to a \nclose, and another school year is about to begin, I am pleased that \nninety-five of my colleagues joined me in recognition of the important \nrole education plays in shaping our nation's future by supporting S. \n1882.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8067-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8068-S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICA'S GAME HAS A NEW LEADER\n\n Mr. CONRAD. On July 9, 1998, Major League Baseball selected \nBud Selig as its ninth Commissioner in the history of baseball.\n  After serving as the Chairman of Baseball's Executive Council for the \nlast six years, the owners picked from their own ranks and bestowed the \nformal leadership mantle on Alan H. ``Bud'' Selig.\n  For the last 28 years, Bud has been the driving force behind major \nleague baseball in Milwaukee, from bringing baseball back in 1970 to \nbuilding a new convertible stadium to open in 2000.\n  In September of 1992, Bud was picked to fill the void created by the \ndeparture of Fay Vincent. From the day he took the reins of the \nExecutive Council, he was faced with serious issues that had eluded \nsolutions. The first task was securing a new collective bargaining \nagreement with the Players Association. That agreement is an essential \nelement in the growing trust and cooperation that is now visible \nbetween the players and the owners.\n  If labor peace was not a big enough challenge, Bud was instrumental \nin securing a revenue sharing agreement, and in implementing the \npopular wild-card playoff system and interleague play that the fans \nhave found very exciting and enthusiastically attend. All of these \nimprovements have helped bring back fans in numbers that reflect a \nhealing of the game after the strike.\n  Those accomplishments are truly important but they merely set the \nstage for the agenda items that await the ninth Commissioner of \nBaseball. Most people who follow baseball believe Bud will have to \naddress several tough issues: realignment and scheduling; elimination \nof payroll disparity; and marketing and promotion of baseball both at \nhome and internationally. This last issue is one that also provides an \navenue to continue to work with the Players Association to grow the \ngame in a way that the fans, the players and the owners benefit.\n  Bud was responsible for bringing Paul Beeston from the Toronto club \ninto the management ranks of baseball as the Chief Operating Officer. \nWith Paul to tend to the day to day operations in the new and \nreorganized New York offices, Bud will be free to focus on the \nimportant tasks that lie ahead. The challenges that Bud now faces will \nrequire him to draw on the legendary consensus building skills that he \nhas so effectively used in the past to continue to provide the unified \nleadership that will put baseball on a path to move into the next \ncentury.\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\n  As a life long baseball fan, I wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8068-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       POSTAL WORKER RECOGNITION\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to say \n``thank you'' to a most diverse collection of government employees, \nunified by many factors but most of all, a commitment to service. Thank \nyou for the professionalism that you display which has allowed us to \ncome to expect value, reliability, and uniformity from one of the \nworld's largest businesses.\n  Who are these employees? They're truck drivers, engineers, janitors, \naccountants, detectives, customer service personnel, and letter \ncarriers. They're United States Postal Employees.\n  The United States Postal Service is a business with an unusual \npedigree, even though we commonly recognize the ``post office'' as a \ntraditional government entity. Yet while its origins can be traced to \nthe origins of our country, the Postal Service as we know it today is \nonly 27 years old. USPS went through an extensive revamping in the late \n1960s and early 70s. The Post Office Department was removed from the \nPresident's Cabinet and converted into a non-profit government \ncorporation. The result was an effective elimination of politicians \nfrom the management of postal affairs.\n  Congress passed the Postal Reorganization Act which created the new \nUnited States Postal Service on July 1, 1971. This month, we recognize \nan organization able to modernize, while maintaining the fundamental \nunifying factors required of such a massive global organization.\n  USPS has a unique set of privileges and responsibilities which serve \nto ensure uniform service and stable prices for mail delivery \nthroughout the United States. The Chair of the USPS Board of Governors \nannounced in late June that there would be no postal rate increase for \n1998. The next rate increase will take effect January 10, 1999. At that \ntime the price of a First-Class letter will increase by one penny, to \n33 cents.\n  USPS last increased rates on January 1, 1995. When the new rates take \neffect next year, it will be the second straight rate adjustment below \ninflation, in effect cutting the real cost of a First-Class stamp by \nseven percent since 1995. That makes the cost of a First-Class letter \namong the lowest in the industrialized world--a feat managed without \ntaxpayer subsidies. In Japan, the cost of a First-Class letter is $.57, \nin Great Britain it is $.42 and in Germany it is $.62.\n  Yet the success of USPS in its ability to reorganize, modernize, and \ncompete in a global marketplace is due to each individual postal \nemployee, because that's what comprises successful business \noperations--great employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8069-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO JUSTIN S. MORRILL ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, 1998 is an important year for \nVermont and the nation as it marks the 100th anniversary of the death \nof a great statesman, Senator Justin S. Morrill. Senator Morrill was a \nremarkable man; his authorship of the Land-Grant College Act gave, and \ncontinues to give, millions of Americans the opportunity to pursue \nhigher education. To recognize this accomplishment, the Stratford \nHistorical Society is holding a symposium on July 16 and 17, 1998 to \npay homage to Senator Morrill and his legacy.\n  Senator Morrill was one the most influential politicians in the mid-\nnineteenth century. During his 43 years in Congress, he introduced many \ninnovative bills and worked to improve the lives of millions of \nAmericans through higher education. The Land-Grant College Act provided \npublic lands for agricultural colleges and, in turn, set the standard \nfor American public universities. In addition to these accomplishments, \nSenator Morrill was also instrumental in the creation of the Washington \nMonument and the Library of Congress.\n  In fact, on November 4, 1997, I was honored to attend a ceremony at \nthe Library of Congress to unveil a plaque in the Great Hall of the \nJefferson Building honoring Senator Morrill. The plaque was presented \nto the Library on behalf of the people of Vermont by the Vermont Center \nfor the Book, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Jefferson \nBuilding. The plaque honors the vital role that Senator Morrill played \nin making the Jefferson Building a reality.\n  Mr. President, Justin S. Morrill was a dedicated statesman who spent \nhis life helping others. He revolutionized education and, as poet \nRobert Frost once noted, ``For me there is no greater name in American \neducation than that of Senator Justin Smith Morrill.'' Such an amazing \nman deserves recognition and, on this 100th anniversary of his death, I \npay tribute to him and his accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8069-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. 2294 introduced earlier today by \nSenator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2294) to facilitate the exchange of criminal \n     history records for noncriminal justice purposes, to provide \n     for the decentralized storage of criminal history records, to \n     amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to facilitate \n     the fingerprint checks authorized by that Act, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have introduced the National Criminal \nHistory Access and Child Protection Act of 1998. I am pleased to have \nbeen joined by the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, as well as by Senator DeWine and the distinguished Minority \nLeader, Senator Daschle, in introducing this legislation, which also \nhas the support of the Administration.\n  This important legislation addresses a critical issue--the access to \ncriminal history records for legitimate purposes other than use within \nthe criminal justice system. These records are frequently used today \nfor a wide variety of important purposes, such as employment background \nchecks for child care workers, health care workers, elder care workers, \nteachers, school bus drivers, security guards, and bar applicants.\n  Few disagree with the use of criminal history records to ensure that \nthose in important positions of trust with our children, elderly, and \npersons with disabilities do not have criminal backgrounds making such \ntrust inappropriate or even dangerous. Yet, currently, policies and \nprocedures on disseminating these records vary widely from state to \nstate.\n  This legislation addresses this issue, by enacting what has come to \nbe known as the Triple I (III) Compact. This proposed interstate and \nfederal-state compact is supported by the Administration, the FBI, the \nCriminal Justice Information Advisory Policy Board, and all state \ncriminal history repositories. It would establish ``rules of the road'' \nfor the interstate sharing of criminal history records for non-criminal \nhistory purposes, such as background checks for employees who work with \nchildren or who are in otherwise sensitive jobs. The compact provides \nfor state-to-state and federal-to-state sharing of records, through the \nInterstate Identification Index (III) and the National Fingerprint File \n(NFF).\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\n  Under the compact, requests for criminal history checks for non-\ncriminal justice purposes would be made between state records \nrepositories and between the state repositories and the FBI, which \nmaintains the III and NFF systems. Interstate dissemination policy \nwould be governed by the policy of the requesting state, but intrastate \ndissemination and use of records would still be governed by the law of \nthe state which owns the record. The primacy of use of records for \ncriminal justice purposes would be maintained, as would direct access \nto records already permitted under current law. Additionally, record \nchecks would have to be fingerprint supported to ensure accuracy, and \nthe privacy of records would be protected. The compact would be \nadministered and policed by a council comprised of state and federal \nofficials.\n  This legislation also includes improvements to the National Child \nProtection Act, which Congress enacted in 1993 to encourage the use of \ncriminal history records to screen volunteers who work with our \nchildren, elderly, and persons with disabilities. This provision amends \nthe NCPA to permit child care, elder care, and volunteer organizations, \nknown as ``qualified entities,'' to request background checks through \nstate agencies in the absence of state laws implementing the NCPA. The \n1993 NCPA and its 1994 amendments extending its coverage to elder care \nand disabled care workers conditioned part of state's Byrne grant \nfunding on the establishment of procedures for records checks for child \ncare and elder care workers and volunteers, but many states have not \ndone so. Qualified entities are not permitted to request a background \ncheck from states absent state establishment of procedures. This \nprovision is a modest change to current law, and permits qualified \nentities to request the background check, but does not override any \nstate laws regarding use or dissemination of records. The provision is \nbased on H.R. 2488, and is supported by volunteer groups, including the \nBoy Scouts and the Boys and Girls Clubs. This provision recently passed \nthe House of Representatives as an amendment to other legislation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a modest but important step in \nprotecting the most vulnerable in our society from those who would \nabuse unique access to prey on them. I appreciate the support of my \ncosponsors for this legislation, and urge its approval by the Senate.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be deemed read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2294) was deemed read a third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2294\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is \npassing, as an amendment to S. 2022, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Daschle \nFederal-State ``III'' Compact for exchange of criminal history records \nfor noncriminal justice purposes. This Compact is the product of a \ndecade-long effort by federal and state law enforcement officials to \nestablish a legal framework for the exchange of criminal history \nrecords for authorized noncriminal justice purposes, such as security \nclearances, employment or licensing background checks.\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\n  Since 1924, the FBI has collected and maintained duplicate state and \nlocal fingerprint cards, along with arrest and disposition records. \nToday, the FBI has over 200 million fingerprint cards in its system. \nThese FBI records are accessible to authorized government entities for \nboth criminal and authorized noncriminal justice purposes.\n  Maintaining duplicate files at the FBI is costly and leads to \ninaccuracies in the criminal history records, since follow-up \ndisposition information from the States is often incomplete. Such a \nhuge central database of routinely incomplete criminal history records \nraises significant privacy concerns.\n  In addition, the FBI releases these records for noncriminal justice \npurposes (as authorized by Federal law), to State agencies upon \nrequest, even if the State from which the records originated or the \nreceiving State more narrowly restricts the dissemination of such \nrecords for noncriminal justice purposes.\n  The III Compact is an effort to get the FBI out of the business of \nholding a duplicate copy of every State and local criminal history \nrecord, and instead to keep those records at the State level. Once \nfully implemented, the FBI will only need to hold the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III), consisting of the national fingerprint file \nand a pointer index to direct the requestor to the correct State \nrecords repository. The Compact would eliminate the necessity for \nduplicate records at the FBI for those States participating in the \nCompact. Eventually, when all the States become full participants in \nthe Compact, the FBI's centralized files of state offender records will \nbe discontinued and users of such records will obtain those records \nfrom the appropriate State's central repository (or from the FBI if the \noffender has a federal record).\n  The Compact would establish both a framework for this cooperative \nexchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes, \nand create a Compact Council with representatives from the FBI and the \nStates to monitor system operations and issue necessary rules and \nprocedures for the integrity and accuracy of the records and compliance \nwith privacy standards. Importantly, this Compact would not in any way \nexpand or diminish noncriminal justice purposes for which criminal \nhistory records may be used under existing State or Federal law.\n  Overall, I believe that the Compact would increase the accuracy, \ncompleteness and privacy protection for criminal history records.\n  In addition, the Compact would result in important cost savings from \nestablishing a decentralized system. Under the system envisioned by the \nCompact, the FBI would hold only an ``index and pointer'' to the \nrecords maintained at the originating State. The FBI would no longer \nhave to maintain duplicate State records. Moreover, States would no \nlonger have the burden and costs of submitting arrest fingerprints and \ncharge/disposition data to the FBI for all arrests. Instead, the State \nwould only have to submit to the FBI the fingerprints and textual \nidentification data for a person's first arrest.\n  With this system, criminal history records would be more up-to-date, \nor complete, because a decentralized system will keep the records \ncloser to their point of origin in State repositories, eliminating the \nneed for the States to keep sending updated disposition information to \nthe FBI. To ensure further accuracy, the Compact would require requests \nfor criminal history checks for noncriminal justice purposes to be \nsubmitted with fingerprints or some other form of positive \nidentification, to avoid mistaken release of records.\n  Furthermore, under the Compact, the newly-created Council must \nestablish procedures to require that the most current records are \nrequested and that when a new need arises, a new record check is \nconducted.\n  Significantly, the newly-created Council must establish privacy \nenhancing procedures to ensure that requested criminal history records \nare only used by authorized officials for authorized purposes. \nFurthermore, the Compact makes clear that only the FBI and authorized \nrepresentatives from the State repository may have direct access to the \nFBI index. The Council must also ensure that only legally appropriate \ninformation is released and, specifically, that record entries that may \nnot be used for noncriminal justice purposes are deleted from the \nresponse.\n  Thus, while the Compact would require the release of arrest records \nto a requesting State, the Compact would also ensure that if \ndisposition records are available that the complete record be released. \nAlso, the Compact would require States receiving records under the \nCompact to ensure that the records are disseminated in compliance with \nthe authorized uses in that State. Consequently, under the Compact, a \nState that receives arrest-only information would have to give effect \nto disposition-only policies in that State and not release that \ninformation for noncriminal justice purposes. Thus, in my view, the \nimpact of the Compact for the privacy and accuracy of the records would \nbe positive.\n  I am pleased to have joined with Senators Hatch and DeWine to make a \nnumber of refinements to the Compact as transmitted by to us by the \nAdministration. Specifically, we have worked to clarify that (1) the \nwork of the Council includes establishing standards to protect the \nprivacy of the records; (2) sealed criminal history records are not \ncovered or subject to release for noncriminal justice purposes under \nthe Compact; (3) the meetings of the Council are open to the public, \nand (4) the Council's decisions, rules and procedures are available for \npublic inspection and copying and published in the Federal Register.\n  Commissioner Walton of the Vermont Department of Public Safety \nsupports this Compact. He hopes that passage of the Compact will \nencourage Vermont to become a full participant in III for both criminal \nand noncriminal justice purposes, so that Vermont can ``reap the \nbenefits of cost savings and improved data quality.'' The Compact is \nalso strongly supported by the FBI and SEARCH.\n  We all have an interest in making sure that the criminal history \nrecords maintained by our law enforcement agencies at the local, State \nand Federal levels, are complete, accurate and accessible only to \nauthorized personnel for legally authorized purposes. This Compact is a \nsignificant step in the process of achieving that goal.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 438, S. 1976.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1976) to increase public awareness of the plight \n     of victims of crime with developmental disabilities, to \n     collect data to measure the magnitude of the problem, and to \n     develop strategies to address the safety and justice needs of \n     victims of crime with developmental disabilities.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill which had been reported from the Committee\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\non the Judiciary, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crime Victims With \n     Disabilities Awareness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) although research conducted abroad demonstrates that \n     individuals with developmental disabilities are at a 4 to 10 \n     times higher risk of becoming crime victims than those \n     without disabilities, there have been no significant studies \n     on this subject conducted in the United States;\n       (2) in fact, the National Crime Victim's Survey, conducted \n     annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the \n     Department of Justice, does not specifically collect data \n     relating to crimes against individuals with developmental \n     disabilities;\n       (3) studies in Canada, Australia, and Great Britain \n     consistently show that victims with developmental \n     disabilities suffer repeated victimization because so few of \n     the crimes against them are reported, and even when they are, \n     there is sometimes a reluctance by police, prosecutors, and \n     judges to rely on the testimony of a disabled individual, \n     making individuals with developmental disabilities a target \n     for criminal predators;\n       (4) research in the United States needs to be done to--\n       (A) understand the nature and extent of crimes against \n     individuals with developmental disabilities;\n       (B) describe the manner in which the justice system \n     responds to crimes against individuals with developmental \n     disabilities; and\n       (C) identify programs, policies, or laws that hold promises \n     for making the justice system more responsive to crimes \n     against individuals with developmental disabilities; and\n       (5) the National Academy of Science Committee on Law and \n     Justice of the National Research Council is a premier \n     research institution with unique experience in developing \n     seminal, multidisciplinary studies to establish a strong \n     research base from which to make public policy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to increase public awareness of the plight of victims \n     of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities;\n       (2) to collect data to measure the extent of the problem of \n     crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; \n     and\n       (3) to develop a basis to find new strategies to address \n     the safety and justice needs of victims of crime who are \n     individuals with developmental disabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``developmental disability'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 102 of the Developmental \n     Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6001).\n\n     SEC. 4. STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall conduct a study \n     to increase knowledge and information about crimes against \n     individuals with developmental disabilities that will be \n     useful in developing new strategies to reduce the incidence \n     of crimes against those individuals.\n       (b) Issues Addressed.--The study conducted under this \n     section shall address such issues as--\n       (1) the nature and extent of crimes against individuals \n     with developmental disabilities;\n       (2) the risk factors associated with victimization of \n     individuals with developmental disabilities;\n       (3) the manner in which the justice system responds to \n     crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; \n     and\n       (4) the means by which States may establish and maintain a \n     centralized computer database on the incidence of crimes \n     against individuals with disabilities within a State.\n       (c) National Academy of Sciences.--In carrying out this \n     section, the Attorney General shall consider contracting with \n     the Committee on Law and Justice of the National Research \n     Council of the National Academy of Sciences to provide \n     research for the study conducted under this section.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit to \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives a report describing the results of the \n     study conducted under this section.\n\n     SEC. 5. NATIONAL CRIME VICTIM'S SURVEY.\n\n       Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, as part of each National Crime Victim's Survey, the \n     Attorney General shall include statistics relating to--\n       (1) the nature of crimes against individuals with \n     developmental disabilities; and\n       (2) the specific characteristics of the victims of those \n     crimes.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was delighted to join with Senator DeWine \nduring National Crime Victims Rights Week in April to introduce S. \n1976, the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act. I was glad to \nwelcome Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Abraham as cosponsors.\n  I have been overwhelmed by the positive response and broad support \nthat our bill has received. I have, and will include in the record, a \nletter of support signed by over 50 groups, including the National \nAssociation of Developmental Disabilities Council's the National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Association of State \nDirectors of Special Education, the National Center of Hearing \nDisabilities, the American Association of Health and Disability, and \nmany, many others.\n  In order to move this bill through the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nDeWine and I are agreeing to a substitute amendment to the Crime \nVictims With Disabilities Awareness Act. The substitute eliminates the \nspecific authorization for the research funding and would, instead, \nleave it up to the Department of Justice to allocate money for this \nresearch. Although I preferred our original bill and regret having to \neliminate the specific authorization that was at the heart of our \noriginal proposal, I was prepared to accept the amendment in order to \nachieve progress on this important front in our efforts better to \nassist and serve victims of crime.\n  The bill being considered by the Senate would have the Department of \nJustice conduct research which will increase public awareness of the \nvictimization of individual with developmental disabilities, \nunderstanding of the nature and extent of such crimes, and examine the \nmeans by which States may establish and maintain a database on the \nincident of crime against individuals with disabilities.\n  The need for this research is abundantly clear. Studies conducted \nabroad have found that individuals with disabilities are four to 10 \ntimes more likely to be a victim than individuals without disabilities. \nOne Canadian study found that 67 percent of women with disabilities \nwere physically or sexually assaulted as children.\n  This bill also directs the Attorney General to utilize statistics \ngathered from studies by the Department for inclusion in the National \nCrime Victims Survey.\n  I said in April that it is important that we focus attention on the \nneeds and rights of crime victims not only during National Crime \nVictims Rights Week, but throughout the year. For the past several \nyears, I have worked hard with others to make improvements in the law \nand provide greater assistance to victims of crime.\n  My involvement with crime victims rights began more than three \ndecades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, \nVermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have \nworked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one \nthat respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic \nviolence, rather than presents additional ordeals for those already \nvictimized.\n  Over the last 20 years we have made strides in recognizing crime \nvictims' rights and providing much needed assistance. I am proud to \nhave played a role in passage of the Victims and Witnesses Protection \nAct of 1983, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, and the Victims' Rights \nand Restitution Act of 1990 and the other improvements we have been \nable to make.\n  In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Congress acted to ensure a \nright of allocution of victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse \nand to make tens of millions of dollars available to crime victims. No \namount of money can make up for the harm and trauma of being the victim \nof crime, but we should do all that we can to see that victims are \nassisted, compensated and treated with dignity by the criminal justice \nsystem.\n  I was the author of the Victims of Terrorism Act that passed the \nSenate the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and became the basis for \nthe Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act signed into law in April 1996. \nWe are able to make funds available through supplemental grants to the \nStates to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and mass violence, \nwhich incidents might otherwise have overwhelmed the resources of \nOklahoma's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance \nservices.\n  We also filled a gap in our law for residents of the United States \nwho are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur outside the \nborders of the United States. In addition, we allowed greater \nflexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and \nsome greater certainly so that they can know that our commitments to \nvictims programming will not wax and wane with events. And we were able \nto raise the assessments on those convicted of federal crimes in order \nto fund the needs of crime victims.\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\n  Last year, I cosponsored the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. \nThat legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing \nthe fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony \nduring the sentencing phase of that trial. As a result of that \nlegislation, not only were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing able to \nobserve the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all those who were able to \nwitness the trial and were called as witnesses to provide victim impact \ntestimony at the sentencing phase of that trial, were able to do so.\n  The Crime Victims Assistance Act, S. 1081, is legislation that I \nintroduced this past July with Senator Kennedy. It builds upon the \nprogress made over the last several years. It provides for a wholesale \nreform of the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional \nrights and protections for victims of federal crime.\n\n  This bill would provide crime victims with an enhanced right to be \nheard on the issue of pretrial detention and plea bargains, an enhanced \nright to a speedy trial and to be present in the courtroom throughout a \ntrial, an enhanced right to be heard on probation revocation and to \ngive a statement at sentencing, and the right to be notified of a \ndefendant's escape or release from prison.\n  The Crime Victims Assistance Act would also strengthen victims' \nservices by increasing Federal victim assistance personnel, enhancing \ntraining for State and local law enforcement and Officers of the Court, \nand establishing an ombudsman program for crime victims.\n  With a simple majority of both Houses of Congress, the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act could be enacted this year and we could mark a \nsignificant and immediate difference in the lives of victims throughout \nour country. I hope that the Senate will turn to this important \nmeasure, as well, in our efforts to assist victims of crime.\n  One unfortunate consequence of the effort to focus attention on \nproposals to amend the Constitution has been to dissipate efforts to \nenact effective victims rights legislation over the past two years. The \nmomentum we had built over the last several years has been dissipated \nby this constitutional focus and exclusion of statutory reform.\n  While we have made great improvements in our law enforcement and \ncrime victims assistance programs and have made advances in recognizing \ncrime victims' rights, we still have work to do. Each year I try to \nhelp focus attention on those who work so hard every week of the year \non behalf of all crime victims in crime victims' assistance and \ncompensation programs. Their hard work and dedication have made a real \ndifference in the lives of people who suffer from violence and abuse.\n  The needs of victims of crime are many and must be addressed in a \nnumber of ways, including strengthening law enforcement and education, \nimproving and increasing services for victims, and protecting the \nrights of victims. I am hopeful that in the days to come, the research \ndirected by the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act will \nserve as the foundation for the growth and improvement of services \navailable to victims with disabilities throughout our country.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1976), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to compliment my colleagues \nfor the unanimous passage of the Crime Victims with Disabilities \nAwareness Act of 1998. When I introduced this legislation, S. 1976, I \nwanted to increase public awareness of the plight of crime victims with \ndisabilities--by developing a research and statistical basis from which \nto understand the nature and extent of crimes against people with \ndevelopmental disabilities.\n  Gauging from the favorable response of my colleagues, the press, and \npeople in the disability community itself, public awareness of the \ncrime victims with developmental disabilities has increased by the very \nintroduction of this legislation. But we recognize that this is only \nthe tip of the iceberg--the larger problem is crimes against people \nwith many other kinds of disabilities as well.\n  Passage of this legislation comes not a moment too soon. It is time \nthat we began a new, hopeful chapter in the lives of the many disabled \nindividuals who live quietly in fear of crime and violence.\n  There are too many victims who cannot communicate what has happened \nto them--who find it more difficult than most crime victims to seek \ncomfort, counseling, reassurance, and protection. These victims must \nrelive the violence for the rest of their lives.\n  Today, as a governing body, the United States Senate has spoken \ncollectively on this increasing challenge. We know that for a number of \nreasons, more people are being born developmentally disabled. Among the \nfactors are poor prenatal nutrition, increases in child abuse, and \nsubstance abuse issues, including fetal alcohol syndrome.\n  It is my hope that the Department of Justice will engage the \nCommittee on Law and Justice of the National Research Council to \nproduce seminal, multi-disciplinary research that will encourage \nfurther academic research in this area, and develop useful new \nstrategies to reduce the incidence of crimes against the disabled. \nAmerica should not have to rely upon foreign countries to infer \nresearch and statistics about our own citizens.\n  Passage of this legislation is an important recognition of the \nseverity of the impact crime has on these people's lives. It is an \nattempt to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. We will not \nlet the disabled suffer alone and in silence any longer. As a country \nwe must understand them, learn to communicate with them, and reassure \nthem.\n  This is a very important step forward for American society.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8082-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 14, 1998\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, it has been inquired all around the \ncountry, by many people, as to whether or not the tobacco industry won \nits fight here in the Capitol. Did they bowl us over? Did they get the \nCongress to knuckle under? Are they so powerful that, over the will of \nthe American people, the tobacco industry prevailed?\n  And we say no. There is an amendment that has been offered by the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, that would give us a chance in the \nSenate to choose between the tobacco industry, the tobacco lobby, their \nfriends, and our Nation's children.\n  This amendment would put a real dent in a public health catastrophe \nthat has touched nearly every American family. There are few of us who \nhave not heard about the ravages of tobacco on a friend or relative, or \nseen people we know weakened from respiratory conditions caused by the \nuse of tobacco--smoking, and how it changed the structure of their \nlives, how they are unable to do the things that they used to do: \nparticipate in sports, play actively with their children or their \ngrandchildren--or how they suffered premature death.\n  Too often, on the Senate floor, we have heard opponents of the \ntobacco bill parrot the propaganda of the tobacco industry. I would \nlike to take a moment to review the real issues in this debate.\n  The tobacco industry still lives in a privileged regulatory \nenvironment set up by its backers throughout decades. We have now \nlearned something about what they discussed in the privacy of their \nboardrooms, in the privacy of their records, in the privacy of their \nmarketing schemes, knowing full well that if they manipulated their \nproduct, if they introduced more nicotine, if they changed the \nadvertising, that they could capture the market replacements that they \nneeded to maintain their profits and their revenues. They knew if they \ntweaked their ads in a certain way, they could get young people to pick \nup smoking. Joe Camel became better known, it was said, than Mickey \nMouse.\n\n  The reason the industry targets our children and engages in other \ncorporate misbehavior is that, aside from the courts, the industry does \nnot face any real oversight of their actions, despite their devious \nactions to fool the public. The tobacco amendment that we have before \nus would put oversight in place. That is the primary reason that the \nindustry's friends killed the bill last month. They killed it because \nthey didn't want to have their market opportunities reduced. They \ndidn't want to let the children, the young people in our society, get \nby, live normal lives, without their life expectancies being impaired. \nThey didn't want to protect the families and the well-being of our \ncitizens, because it meant cash to these folks. It meant that their \nmarket might shrink a little bit, that their stock prices might go \ndown, that their salaries might be decreased. They didn't care about \nthe damage they wrought--not at all. We see it in testimony, some of \nwhich was given under oath, which has some questions surrounding it.\n  This amendment would establish unfettered FDA jurisdiction over \ntobacco products, so people would know what is there, so people would \nknow that smoking can really do a job on you. I know many people have \ntalked about the importance of FDA jurisdiction, but I want to describe \nwhat it really means. It means that the Federal Drug Administration has \nthe capacity to enforce their anti-teen-smoking efforts. It means that \nthey will have clear statutory authority to enact the appropriate \nconstitutional advertising restrictions to protect children.\n  FDA authority also means that smokers will know what chemicals and \nadditives are put into the cigarettes they smoke. We did some research \nin my office on this subject and found out there are some 500 \ningredients that are in a pack of cigarettes and some of these things \nare really toxic. We restrict their use in normal functioning in our \nsociety because we know how dangerous they are. When our constituents \nenter their local grocery or drug stores, cigarettes and other tobacco \nproducts are the only products meant for human consumption that do not \ndisclose their ingredients. We ask it of food products. We are getting \nstricter all the time about what you have to worry about with meat and \nhow you have to cook it and treat it. So, too, with vegetables. We see \nadvertisements: ``Organically grown.'' But when it comes to tobacco, \nthey put up, to use the expression, a pretty heavy smokescreen.\n  Last year I introduced a bill to inform consumers about the \ningredients and chemicals in tobacco products. Although we know that \nmost smokers are aware that cigarettes are ``bad for you,'' I don't \nthink the vast majority of smokers, or citizens, realize that there is \narsenic and benzene and lead in the smoke they consume. These are \nthings we prohibit. We prohibit the use of lead in paint today. We \nprohibit the use of benzene in products where it used to be routine. \nAnd arsenic--everybody knows that arsenic is a poison. Not only will \nthe FDA require, under this amendment, the tobacco companies to \ndisclose the presence of these chemicals, but it will also make sure \nthe tobacco industry takes appropriate steps to decrease these poisons \nin their products.\n  For years, the tobacco companies hid health secrets and secretly \nmanipulated the ads as to the nature of their products. Under strong \nFDA jurisdiction, the tobacco industry will have to play by the rules. \nAnd, like other industries that produce drugs, they are going to be \nsubject to the appropriate oversight to protect the consumers, to \nprotect our citizens. It is long overdue.\n  One thing we have to remember in the argument with the tobacco \ncompanies, the arguments that we have with them, is that this is not \njust another business, this is a business whose products are going to \nkill you if you use them, and there is no denying that. This is a \nbusiness that is designed to make an addict out of you--addicts, over \n45 million in America today. If this business was conducted in a less \nauspicious place than a boardroom of a tobacco company, and if it was a \ngroup of individuals who said, ``We have a way to weaken America and \nhere is the plot: We can kill over 400,000 Americans every year, and no \none is going to say anything to us. Further, we cannot only encourage \npeople to use the product, but we can start with them when they are \nchildren.''\n\n  Do you know what? They will be more addicted to this product than \nmany of them are addicted to illegal drugs. If we do this, we can cost \nAmerica $100 billion in lost productivity and in health care costs; we \ncan attack the American Nation, killing 400,000 people in a year, more \nthan eight times the number that we lost in Vietnam in all the years of \nthat war, a period of time when almost all America went into mourning \nabout the loss of these young lives, these brave people; 58,000 died \nthere--and here we lose 400,000 people a year, more than all of the \nwars that this country fought in this century. In one year, we kill \nmore Americans with tobacco than those lost in combat in the 20th \ncentury.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is going to require the tobacco \nproducts and advertisements to have large, clear warning labels that \nwill send a strong message to kids about the real consequences of \nsmoking. We are not just going to say ``could be dangerous to your \nhealth.'' And we are not going to permit it to be in colorful ads to \nmake the young people feel like this is the macho image, this is the \ncool image that they want to portray. These warning labels will not be \nhidden in small type on the side of a pack of cigarettes. These labels \nwill be prominently displayed in large type on each side of the pack of \ncigarettes.\n  They will contain simple, truthful messages about the dangers of the \nproduct: Cigarettes are addictive; cigarettes cause cancer; and smoking \ncan kill you. All true. All to the point. These new warning labels will \nadd a strong dose of truth to the industry's deceitful billboards and \nother ads. They are not going to continue to see the guy on horseback \nroping the cattle or the champion swimmer or the champion athlete. No, \nthose are bogus claims. We don't believe those anymore. But the problem \nis there has\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\nbeen an impression created in the minds of America that goes back \ndecades, and smoking appeared to be cool. Every movie actor and every \nmovie actress not too many years ago would have a cigarette hanging out \nof their mouth.\n  When I was a soldier in the Army and I was in the war zone, they made \nsure we had in our rations little packs of cigarettes, little sleeves \nwith three or four cigarettes, as I remember, in each of them, free, to \nmake sure you felt good about what you were doing. At the same time, \nthey were creating addictions that we now wrestle with in our veterans \npopulation.\n  What we want to see is the Surgeon General's warning clear and \nconcise, clear and perceptible, instead of the industry lies like \n``Alive with Pleasure.'' We have seen that on billboards. It ought to \nread: ``Dying with pain,'' ``Dying too early,'' ``Unable to compete,'' \n``Unable to function,'' ``Unable to take care of your family,'' \n``Unable to stay with your children as they grow,'' because tobacco is \ndragging you down all the way.\n  This amendment will require a truthful health warning to be printed \non 20 percent of the billboard service. See it: ``Cigarettes kill''; \n``Dying with pain.'' That is the message that has to be out there, not \nthis deceitful message that says, ``You are going to feel good.''\n  There was a time, I remember, when they used to say doctors smoke one \nbrand more than any other, because it had the real taste, it was good, \nit made you feel good.\n  The tobacco industry and their friends don't want us to deliver this \nmessage to the public.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, contains strong look-back provisions \nthat were improved by an amendment approved overwhelmingly by this body \n66 votes to 29. I want to explain this look-back provision.\n  It says that if you haven't gained the objective--and that is to \nreduce the number of teenagers who are picking up smoking--you and your \ncompany are going to have to pay and pay substantially. It is going to \nput teeth in our effort to dramatically reduce teen smoking.\n  The real experts on marketing cigarettes to children are the tobacco \ncompanies themselves. So let them work to reduce that number. They have \ndone a masterful job, and now they have to undo it.\n  Mr. President, we know that the most efficient and effective way to \ndramatically reduce teen smoking is to raise the price, and this \namendment will do that. A variety of factors contribute to a teenager's \ndecision to try that first cigarette or to chew that first bit of spit \ntobacco. I know, because I smoked for 25 years. I took up smoking when \nI was a teenager, and I sure reinforced the image when I served 3 years \nin the U.S. Army.\n  But we know that once you begin--tobacco companies know--most \ncitizens don't realize that the first cigarette or the 15th or the 20th \ncigarette that you smoke is the reaction that says you are going to do \nthis for the rest of your life whether you like it or not. How many \npeople have we ever met in our lives--I know I have met, I will say, \nthousands who said to me, ``Boy, I quit once for 3 months, but then \nsomething happened, and I started again.'' Or ``I tried 100 times to \nstop smoking, and every time I have it licked, I come back to it.''\n\n  We know that addiction is the tobacco industry's game. That is what \nthey want to do: Get you addicted, and then the marketing is easy.\n  Mr. President, another issue I have long been involved with is \nsecondhand smoke. As many of my colleagues know, I, with the help of \nthen-Congressman Durbin, now Senator Durbin, authored the legislation \nthat prohibited smoking on airplanes. It is now 11 years ago.\n  It was the first real dent in the tobacco industry lobbying armor, \nand it was the first step toward the eventual goal of an overall \nnational standard on secondhand smoke. We know, and I see it all the \ntime when I talk to people, if I tell them that I was the author of the \nsmoking ban in airplanes, boy, they love it --``That is the greatest \nthing you have done.'' When I am searching for applause, speaking to an \naudience, I always tell them that and they all applause. These are \npeople who remember how unpleasant it was to be in an airplane filled \nwith tobacco smoke. The result is that secondhand smoke is very \ndangerous to the health and well-being of people.\n  A Harvard study said that there are 50,000 fatal heart attacks a year \nthat result from secondhand smoke--fatal heart attacks, secondhand \nsmoke, other people's smoke. This amendment makes serious headway in \nprotecting the public from the dangers of secondhand smoke.\n  The tobacco industry has spent millions on propaganda and fake \nscience reports to the contrary of the belief that breathing other \npeople's smoke is not merely an inconvenience, it is a deadly poison.\n  Mr. President, although the disease caused by secondhand smoke often \ntakes years to manifest itself in most adults, that is not the case for \nyoung children. Secondhand smoke creates immediate health risks for \nchildren. Exposure to smoking increases a child's risk for respiratory \nillnesses and infections, impaired development of their lungs and \nmiddle-ear infections. Further, about half of all the childhood cases \nof asthma, chronic bronchitis and wheezing are attributable to exposure \nto secondhand smoke.\n  It was really ironic when we were writing laws here that would \nprohibit smoking in places around the country, public buildings, et \ncetera, schools, places that children inhabit, and yet, smoking was \nallowed until very recently in the Capitol Buildings, on the Senate \nside absolutely.\n  I thought to myself, how can I ask my people to work in an \nenvironment where they have to breathe someone else's secondhand smoke \nand know that I am doing the right thing, when smoking was allowed in \nthe halls in other areas. It used to bother me that a pregnant woman \nworking in my office would have to walk through the halls, and it would \nbe like walking through a smoker's lounge.\n  I know that she did not want to do it. And I did not want her to have \nto do it.\n  So we have a chance, Mr. President, to say to the tobacco industry, \n``Listen, lay off our kids. Stop it. We want you to be as concerned \nabout this as the public health community is.'' I hope that my \ncolleagues will support this, the Daschle amendment, to provide our \nchildren with a fighting chance against the seductions offered by the \ntobacco industry.\n  Its time will come. The game isn't over. What happens when the game \nis delayed in sports is, there is always a penalty that gets offered. \nThat is the same thing that is going to happen here.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/13/senate-section/article/S8085-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
