Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \nmorning there will be a period of morning business until 10:10. \nFollowing morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive \nsession to consider the nominations of A. Howard Matz to be United \nStates District Judge for the Central District of California, and \nVictoria A. Roberts to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan. It is, therefore, expected that up to two votes \nwill occur on those nominations at approximately 10:15 this morning.\n  Following those votes, the Senate may consider any of the following \nitems: drug czar reauthorization bill, the clean needles bill, the \nreading excellence legislation, the legislative branch appropriations \nbill, and other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for \naction.\n  Once again, Members are reminded there will be rollcall votes during \ntoday's session of the Senate, with the first vote expected at \napproximately 10:15.\n  I understand from our discussions with Senator Daschle that we \nperhaps have been able to get an agreement on the higher education \nbill--we did get the time agreement locked in--with a number of \namendments in order. We will work to consider that bill as \nexpeditiously as possible. We need to get it done because the \nauthorization expires July 1. Even though we have had an extension of \nfunding for 90 days, that is something we need to get done absolutely \nbefore we go out for the year. So we need to get it completed in the \nSenate and be able to get it in conference. We also may be able to take \nup the intelligence authorization bill later on today.\n  Let me go ahead and announce to the Senate, and I will repeat it \nlater, right before votes probably, Senators should expect long days \nand lots of votes during the month of July. We will have votes on most \nMondays, even though we have not made a final decision with regard to \nJuly 6. It is expected we will have one vote on that date, but we are \nstill working with Senators on both sides to determine what that one \nvote will be late in the day.\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\n  Throughout July, though, Senators should expect to be here on Mondays \nand on Fridays. I expect that we will be in 6 or 7 hours each Monday; \nthat we will have night sessions every night; that we will be in \nusually 12 hours a day Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays; and I will \nbe trying to schedule bills and votes into the night Tuesdays, \nWednesdays, and Thursdays so that we can move several appropriations \nbills and some of the bills I have mentioned here.\n  We have a number of other important issues--product liability, \nbankruptcy, the credit union bill. We have a lot of work to do, so what \nI will try to do is dual-track some of these, with appropriations bills \nbeing on the floor almost every day and then maybe work at night on \nother issues.\n  For instance, it is my intention to have the conference report on the \nIRS restructuring probably the Tuesday or Wednesday night that we come \nback. We may actually have a final vote on it the next morning. But in \norder to get our work done, Senators should expect that I will schedule \nvotes around 9 o'clock every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n  I have really bent over backwards to be helpful to the Senate, to try \nto be considerate of their family needs, but it seems that we have not \ngotten reciprocation from Senators, frankly, on either side. The number \nof amendments is totally out of control. Every bill now has 100 \namendments. If Senators can't learn to be serious, only have major \namendments, cut the debate time, if we do not get cooperation on both \nsides of the aisle, then I have no alternative but to start having what \nwould be called ``bed check'' votes. If we get our work done, we will \nnot go late. If we do not, we will be here until 9 and 10 o'clock every \nnight in July.\n\n  So Senators need to prepare for that, and then we won't surprise \nanybody. But that is the schedule we have to work in order to get six \nor eight appropriations bills done in July, and maybe more, if we can, \nand other important authorizations that have to be done. I know that is \ngood news for one and all, and now morning business is in order.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7229-7", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, it is my hope and the hope of many of my \ncolleagues, that, when we return following the Independence Day break, \nwe will take up a piece of legislation called the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  We have, over many weeks, come to the floor of the Senate to talk \nabout cases around the country that illustrate the critical need for us \nto do something about a health care system that has increasingly herded \npeople into managed care plans in which profit and loss, or the bottom \nline, becomes more important than a person's health care needs. That is \nwhy the American Medical Association and many others support the \nPatients' Bill of Rights that we have introduced. My fervent hope is \nthat the Congress and the Senate will find time to address this issue \nin July.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about a woman, Phyllis Cannon from \nNewcastle, OK. In September of 1991, Phyllis Cannon was diagnosed with \nacute myeloblastic leukemia. She underwent a regimen of chemotherapy, \nwhich her HMO did pay for, and her leukemia went into remission. But \nher doctor, her oncologist, fearing that her cancer would again \nsurface, recommended that she undergo an analogous bone marrow \ntransplant. However, her HMO contended that this procedure was still \nexperimental for first remission patients, and it refused to pay for \nthe bone marrow transplant, even though a bone marrow transplant \nprocedure was covered under the terms of her plan.\n  Phyllis Cannon's oncologist fought vigorously for this procedure. He \nsupplied the HMO with the latest medical literature on the procedure, \nknowing that an urgent transplant was critical for Phyllis' health. \nBut, once again, the HMO denied coverage. Phyllis, her husband Jerry, \nand the doctor continued to fight, and finally, after another month had \npassed, the HMO relented and said it would pay for the bone marrow \ntransplant.\n  But the HMO officials, once they had agreed to cover the transplant, \ndidn't notify Phyllis of the decision until a month later, and by then \nit was too late. The leukemia had returned, and Phyllis died 6 weeks \nlater.\n  Because Phyllis received her health care coverage from her employer, \nher HMO was protected under a law called ERISA. Employer-sponsored \nplans, like the one covering Phyllis, are governed by ERISA, which \ngives HMOs immunity from the harmful effects their decisions might \nhave. So, for Jerry Cannon, ERISA left him no chance to hold the HMO \naccountable for its decision which led to his wife's death. And this \nstory, one more story, of Phyllis Cannon, demonstrates the need for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  Increasingly, as health care becomes more a function of profit and \nloss, it is straying from the central purpose of health care.\n  Let me share with my colleague what Phyllis' husband Jerry said. This \nis a picture of Jerry holding a photograph of his wife.\n\n       [Telling my wife that the HMO was not going to provide the \n     transplant she needed] just devastated her. She gave up after \n     that. Oh, it was horrible. Once I got off the phone, I could \n     see all hope leave her.\n\n  This is just one person, one person among thousands and tens of \nthousand in this country who now fear a health care system in which \nthey are herded into this big chute called HMOs or managed care, and \nsome insurance company accountant in a back room 500 miles away will \nmake a decision about whether a medical procedure is covered. And when \nthey make a mistake in that back room of the insurance office, no one \ncan hold them accountable. If the doctor makes a mistake, that doctor \nis accountable. But the health care plan has no accountability.\n  In fact, they have special protection under the law. We suggest as \nthe remedy a Patients' Bill of Rights supported by the President, by \nthe American Medical Association, and by a vast array of groups around \nthis country that represent patients.\n  Let me describe one more time, as I have before when I have come to \nthe floor to talk about this issue, why the American people are \ndemanding we do something about this problem.\n  There was a story in the paper several months ago about a woman who \nwas injured quite severely by a fall from a horse. Her brain was \nswelling, and bystanders called an ambulance to take her to the \nhospital. While this woman was in the ambulance, with her brain \nswelling, she said, ``I don't want to go to hospital X,'' which was the \nnearest hospital. ``I want you to take me to hospital Y,'' which was \nfurther away.\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\n  She survived this brain injury and was asked later, ``Why did you, \nwhile you were in this ambulance suffering from a serious injury, ask \nto be taken to the hospital that was further away?'' She said, \n``Because I had read a lot about the hospital that was closest, and it \nwas all about profit and loss, all about the bottom line. I didn't want \nto be wheeled into an emergency room in that hospital and have someone \nlook at me in terms of dollars and cents, in terms of profit and loss. \nThat is not the way I wanted to be treated as a patient.''\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights says that every patient has a right to \nknow all the medical options available for treatment of their disease, \nnot just the cheapest option. Our Patients' Bill of Rights says that \npeople have a right to go to an emergency room when they have a medical \nemergency. You think that is something that is understood across this \ncountry? It is not. There are plenty of instances when people are not \ngetting coverage for emergency room visits.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights says that when someone is in need of a \nspecialist to treat their disease, he or she has a right to see that \nspecialist. You think that is routine in managed care organizations \ntoday? I am sorry to say it is not.\n  And our Patients' Bill of Rights--unlike the bill that was unveiled \njust yesterday, I believe, in the other body--says patients have a \nright to sue their health plan if its decision harms them. We take away \nthe special exemption that is given these organizations so that when a \nhealth plan makes medical judgments that can deny someone like Phyllis \nthe cancer treatment she needs the folks who made that decision are \nmade to take responsibility for it. That is why President Clinton and a \ngood many in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, say it is time to do \nsomething about this issue.\n  I suppose that one can make the case, ``Well, there's only so much \nmoney in the system.'' Doctors make the case that they want to practice \nmedicine in the doctor's office, in the hospital room.\n  I have met with a good many doctors in my State to talk to them about \nthe health care system. Increasingly, they tell us that managed care \norganizations are taking the decisions out of the doctors' offices and \nout of the hospital rooms, and making them instead in some insurance \noffice hundreds of miles away by someone who knows nothing about the \npatient and nothing about the patient's needs.\n  Doctors are angry about that, and justifiably angry in my judgment. \nIt is time--long past the time--to pass a piece of legislation that \nsays to these organizations, there are certain basic rights that ought \nto be available to every American when they are ill, when they are in \nneed of help from the health care system.\n  Among those rights, as I just mentioned, is the right to understand, \nfrom your health care provider, all of the options available to you to \nhelp treat you, not just the cheapest option available that the managed \ncare organization is willing to provide. Those are the kinds of things \nthat we will address and discuss and hopefully deal with when we bring \na Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor.\n  Again, I am pleased to say this is not one of those issues that is a \npartisan issue. There are Republicans and Democrats who feel strongly \nand have spoken aggressively on the floor of the Senate and the House \nabout this issue.\n  The power to schedule here in the Congress is a very important and \nvery significant power. We hope that those who have the power to \nschedule will put on the agenda of the U.S. Senate the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. No, not some watered down, lukewarm version like was \nintroduced yesterday that is designed only to allow Congress to say it \ndealt with this issue. I am talking about a real Patients' Bill of \nRights, one that addresses and solves the health care problems that \nAmericans are forced to deal with every day and that, regrettably, \nJerry Cannon and his poor wife Phyllis discovered a few years ago in a \nvery tragic way.\n  We can solve these problems, and we should. We owe it to Phyllis and \nJerry and the other families around this country who confront this \nevery day in the doctors' offices and in the hospital rooms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, is recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7230-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7231-S7235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S MICROSOFT INQUIRY\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Meanwhile, the Department of \nJustice encountered a set back in its original consent decree case. \nAnd, something which got less attention in the midst of these other \ndevelopments, the Software Publisher's Association, the 1,200 member \nsoftware industry association of which Microsoft is a member, released \na report describing how, if allowed to proceed with its tried and true \nmarket practices, Microsoft will extend its current desktop monopoly to \ncontrol the market for network servers--a technology which provides the \nfoundation for the Internet and corporate intranets. So this is \nimportant. Microsoft is attempting to extend its current monopoly of 90 \npercent of the underlying operating system to control all the market \nfor network services, both the Internet and corporate intranets.\n  So, for those who have looked seriously at the Microsoft issue, I \nbelieve it is clear that the issue is about much more than just the \nbrowser. In fact, I have never thought that the browser issue was the \nmost important issue at all, although it is important if you look at \nall of the ramifications of the browser problems.\n  It is about whether one company will be able to exploit its current \nmonopoly in order to control access to, and commerce on, the Internet; \nwhether one company will control the increasingly networked world in \nwhich we are coming to conduct our businesses and in which we are \ncoming to lead our lives.\n  Indeed, the reach of Microsoft's monopoly power is on the verge of \nextending well beyond markets which we have traditionally thought of as \nsoftware or technology markets, and the effects of this expansion will \nbe felt not just by the software companies who have traditionally \ncompeted with Microsoft, but by a broad swath of U.S. consumers. As The \nNew York Times yesterday observed,\n\n       Right now Microsoft is expanding into myriad Internet \n     businesses, including news, entertainment information, \n     banking, financial transactions, travel bookings and other \n     services. Since consumers have no choice but to buy the \n     Windows operating system when they buy personal computers, \n     Microsoft is in a position to give such a big advantage to \n     its own software that any other software maker would not be \n     able to compete.\n\n  I agree with the Times's conclusion. They went on to say: ``It is not \nhealthy for the courts to grant Microsoft a permanent chokehold over \nthe entire expanding world of the Internet.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat this New York Times editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 25, 1998]\n\n                      A Mistaken Microsoft Ruling\n\n       One month after the Justice Department filed its sweeping \n     antitrust suit against Microsoft, a Federal appeals court has \n     issued a deeply flawed ruling that may weaken the \n     Government's case. The three-judge panel seemed to adopt \n     Microsoft's arrogant claim that it has the right to \n     incorporate its browser, or any other software, into its \n     Windows operating system as long as doing so offers certain \n     advantages to consumers. But if the thinking behind this \n     decision prevails, it could permit Microsoft to use its \n     monopoly power to crush competitors throughout the Internet. \n     The Justice Department thus needs to mount a vigorous \n     counterattack invoking the full force of antitrust laws.\n       The Justice Department can argue that the appeals court \n     ruling need not determine\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\n     the outcome of its larger antitrust case against Microsoft. \n     That is because it was based on a narrow case brought by the \n     Justice Department last year, when it charged that Microsoft \n     violated a 1995 consent decree affecting the marketing of \n     Windows 95. In that decree, Microsoft agreed not to condition \n     its sale of Windows to computer makers on the sale of other \n     software, but could improve Windows by integrating other \n     functions into it.\n       In December a Federal district judge ordered Microsoft to \n     split off its browser, the software used to navigate the \n     World Wide Web, from Windows 95. Now the appeals court has \n     said the browser can be included, because with it Windows \n     became a new and improved integrated product.\n       The problem with the appeals court's reasoning is that \n     virtually any new form of software can be integrated into the \n     basic Windows system, arguably improving it. Right now, \n     Microsoft is expanding into myriad Internet businesses, \n     including news, entertainment information, banking, financial \n     transactions, travel bookings and other services. Since \n     consumers have no choice but to buy the Windows operating \n     system when they buy personal computers, Microsoft is in a \n     position to give such a big advantage to its own software \n     that any other software maker would not be able to compete.\n       Because the court of appeals ruling was based on the \n     meaning of the 1995 consent decree, the Justice Department \n     has a chance to reverse its thinking in its larger case \n     against Microsoft, which is to come to trial in September. In \n     that case, the judge will be asked to look beyond the consent \n     decree to the broad principles of antitrust law, and to look \n     as well at Microsoft's predatory practices. The department \n     has assembled impressive evidence that Microsoft deliberately \n     used its monopoly in Windows to crush its rival Netscape, \n     which was selling a browser that many consumers preferred to \n     the one made by Microsoft.\n       The appeals court's decision referred to the general \n     ``undesirability of having courts oversee product design.'' \n     Judge Patricia Wald, in her dissent, correctly warned that \n     the decision ``would seem to permit'' Microsoft to \n     incorporate ``any now-separate software product into its \n     operating system by identifying some minimal synergy'' as a \n     result. It is not healthy for the courts to grant Microsoft a \n     permanent chokehold over the entire expanding world of the \n     Internet.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe this is one of the more important policy issues \nof our day, one which will have far reaching ramifications for years to \ncome, and that it would be remiss for lawmakers and law enforcers not \nto be paying close attention to these issues. So, when we return from \nthe July recess, I plan to hold further hearings on competition in the \ndigital age. In particular, I plan for the committee to examine market \npractices and developments in the so-called ``enterprise'' or back \noffice software market, and more generally to examine practices and \ndevelopments affecting access to, and transactions on the Internet. \nSpecific hearing dates and witness lists will be released when \nfinalized.\n  While I will reserve comments regarding Microsoft's tactics in these \nmarkets until after we learn more about this issue next month, I do \nhave a few comments regarding Microsoft's tactics in Washington over \nthe last several months. In a nutshell, I would offer my view that \nMicrosoft has, regrettably, seen fit to deploy a massive pr campaign \ngrounded in spin control and misdirection, as opposed to engaging the \nAmerican public, on the basis of the facts and the merits surrounding \nall of these issues.\n  For starters, I find it rather surprising that any one company would, \nrather than seeking to prevail on the merits, instead have the hubris \nto try and use the appropriations process to ``go on the offensive'' \nand seek to restrain a federal law enforcement agency that has an \nobligation to enforce the laws, as was recently reported. I trust that \nmy colleagues in this Chamber would have little difficulty in seeing \nthis as anything but an effort to interfere with an ongoing law \nenforcement action. I can certainly appreciate my colleagues wanting to \ngo to bat for their constituent, but I would find it surprising and \ndisturbing were they or any other Senators swayed to permit this body \nto seriously consider such an effort to interfere with the \nappropriations system hope and cut out funds for the Justice Department \ndivision on antitrust. I hope that they don't continue in those efforts \nif those reports are true.\n  More fundamentally, though, I am troubled that Microsoft has seen fit \nto engage in a game of hide the ball, as opposed to putting their best \ncase forward on the facts and on the merits. This issue has nothing to \ndo with the government trying to design software. It is about trying to \npreserve competition and innovation--the hallmark of a free market--in \nan area that is absolutely critical to the future of our economy and I \nguess you have to pay the world. It is critical to our economy, as \nwell. It is about getting to the bottom of the true facts here so as to \nunderstand how best to accomplish this fundamental objective. Frankly, \nif the facts truly aren't so bad, I would expect Microsoft to be happy \nto explain them.\n  One of the issues I have been concerned with since last fall, for \nexample, happens to be the restrictive contracts Microsoft has imposed \non various Internet firms seeking placement on the ubiquitous Windows \ndesktop. Rather than admit that they have indeed imposed such terms, \nand explain to us why we should not find them objectionable, Microsoft \nhas consistently sought to avoid the existence and implications of \nthese contract terms. When pressed on the issue, Microsoft announced on \nthe eve of our March hearing that it would no longer enforce these \nrestrictive covenants or these restrictive contract provisions, instead \nof explaining why these provisions were legal. But, when the Justice \nDepartment filed its suit nearly three months later, we learn not only \nthat these restrictive and exclusionary provisions existed, but that \nMicrosoft in fact continues to enforce them with respect to the biggest \nInternet firms such as AOL and Compuserve, notwithstanding Microsoft's \nprior representations to the Committee that these very provisions had \nbeen removed from its contracts ``on a worldwide basis.''\n  These are just a few examples where Microsoft has been less than one \nhundred percent candid and forthright. There are others. Committee \nstaff has prepared a brief report outlining some of the areas where I \nbelieve Microsoft could and should have been more forthright with the \nCommittee.\n  As the Committee continues its inquiry, I plan to give Microsoft a \nfair opportunity to be heard on these issues. But I think they should \nbe heard on the record, rather than through carefully orchestrated, \nmulti-million dollar pr campaigns that are more concerned with blurring \nthe true facts than explaining them. So I hope that, when given the \nopportunity to be heard on the record, Microsoft chooses to be somewhat \nmore candid with the American people than it has been so far.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a report prepared by the majority staff \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated June 26, 1998, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[A Report Prepared by Majority Staff, Senate Judiciary Committee, June \n                               26, 1998]\n\n  Microsoft Statements to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Throughout the course of the Senate Judiciary Committee's \n     ongoing inquiry into competition in the software industry, \n     Microsoft has continually sought to steer the Committee away \n     from important but potentially damaging areas of inquiry. At \n     times, Microsoft has relied on factually misleading or \n     inaccurate statements to accomplish this objective. A \n     sampling of such statements, and a brief assessment of their \n     accuracy, are provided in the following report.\n\n\n        i. exclusionary licenses with internet service providers\n\n       At the Committee's November 4, 1997 hearing, Senator Hatch \n     raised concerns about the exclusive nature of Microsoft's \n     licenses with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that appeared \n     to have the effect of limiting ISP's freedom to promote and \n     distribute competing browsers. Senator Hatch specifically \n     cited a number of provisions in Microsoft's license with \n     Earthlink.\n       In response, Microsoft Senior Vice President William Neukom \n     wrote Senator Hatch, stating that: ``The implication at the \n     hearing that Microsoft's agreement with Earthlink was somehow \n     directed at locking out competing software is plainly refuted \n     by the facts.\n       ``. . . the ISP is free at all times to distribute and \n     promote any browser software to any customers not referred by \n     Microsoft.'' \\1\\\n\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of report.\n\n       In addition, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates testified at the \n     Committee's March 3 hearing that Microsoft's ISP agreements \n     ``are not exclusive.'' \\2\\ and reiterated Mr. Neukom's \n     suggestion that those restrictions Microsoft did impose on \n     ISPs only applied to customers referred to the ISP by \n     Microsoft.\\3\\\n       When pressed by Committee staff to square these assertions \n     with the plain language of the Earthlink license, Microsoft \n     officials stated that staff was overlooking the fact that the \n     Committee's version of the contract\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\n     contained redactions. The redactions referred to, however, \n     turned out to be largely irrelevant and Microsoft's \n     assertions cannot be squared with the unredacted language of \n     the contracts.\n       First, Microsoft's restriction on an ISP's freedom to \n     promote competing browsers plainly is not limited, as Messrs. \n     Neukom and Gates suggested, to customers referred to the ISP \n     by Microsoft. Microsoft's contracts include blanket \n     prohibitions, not limited to customers referred by Microsoft, \n     stating that the ISP ``shall not advertise or otherwise \n     promote any non-MS browser more than 10 to 20% of total \n     impressions,'' and that the ISP ``shall not display any logo \n     for, or maintain a link to, a non-MS web browser on [ISPs] \n     home page for the ISP Service, on the Start Page, or on any \n     [ISP] home page for any other Internet access service offered \n     by [the ISP].'' \\4\\ (Emphasis added). Messrs. Gates and \n     Neukom's assertion that ``the ISP is free at all times to . . \n     . promote any browser software to any customers not referred \n     by Microsoft'' is simply false.\n       Second, and more importantly, Microsoft required its ISP \n     licensees, in order to avoid being removed from the Windows \n     ISP referral, to ensure that a high percentage (between 75% \n     and 85%) of total browser shipments were Internet \n     Explorer.\\5\\ Independent of other restrictions in Microsoft's \n     ISP contracts, an ISP which is obliged to guarantee that 85% \n     of the browsers it distributes are Microsoft browsers clearly \n     is not, as Mr. Neukom stated, ``free at all times to \n     distribute . . . any browser software to any customers not \n     referred by Microsoft.''\n       In sum, it is inconceivable how licensing provisions that \n     prevents ISPs from promoting competing browsers, and actually \n     require that ISPs ensure that 75-85% of its browser shipments \n     are Microsoft's, are not ``exclusive'' and directed precisely \n     at ``locking out competing software.'' Indeed, this \n     conclusion is only buttressed by the fact that, as a top \n     strategic priority aimed at ``Winning the Internet platform \n     battle,'' Microsoft executives directed its sales force to \n     sign ``[e]xclusive licensing of Internet Explorer to top 5 \n     [Internet] Access providers.'' \\6\\\n\n\n          II. Withdrawal of Exclusive ISP Licensing Provisions\n\n       When the Committee persisted in questioning how these ISP \n     contract provisions were anything other than exclusionary and \n     designed to ``lock out competing software,'' Microsoft, \n     instead of providing any plausible, substantive response, \n     stated that it had agreed to remove these provisions from its \n     contracts. On the eve of the Committee's March 3 hearing, \n     Microsoft provided the Committee with a letter stating that \n     the contract provisions at issue had been deleted from its \n     ISP agreements ``on a worldwide basis.'' \\7\\ When questioned \n     on the subject by Senator Hatch at the Match 3 hearing, Mr. \n     Gates states that ``we agreed to waive'' the ISP contract \n     provisions that had raised concerns.\\8\\ The clear implication \n     of Microsoft's letter to the Committee, and Mr. Gates's \n     testimony, was that Microsoft would no longer prevent firms \n     that provide Internet access from promoting or distributing \n     alternative browsers as a condition of gaining placement on \n     the Windows desktop.\n       Notwithstanding Mr. Gates's testimony, and Microsoft's \n     assertion to the Committee that it had removed these \n     restrictive contract terms ``on a worldwide basis,'' \n     Microsoft had apparently continued to enforce the most \n     restrictive of its contract terms with the largest Internet \n     access firms, including AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy.\\9\\ In \n     fact, the firms still restricted from distributing and/or \n     promoting non-Microsoft browsers represent over 53% of North \n     American Internet users.\\10\\ Given the fact that more than \n     half of U.S. consumers accessing the Internet are still \n     subject to Microsoft's restrictive and exclusionary contract \n     terms, Microsoft's failure to, at a minimum, qualify or \n     clarify its officially asserted waiver of these provisions \n     can be considered nothing other than a sleight of hand.\n\n\n                    III. ability to switch browsers\n\n       In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Gates \n     sought to limit the relevance of any restrictions it might \n     impose on ISPs by suggesting that, regardless of what browser \n     was bundled by an ISP, the ISP's customers ``could always go \n     out and switch their browser. There is no product that is \n     easier to switch in the world today than a browser. It takes \n     about five seconds to go up and click and go get the Netscape \n     browser or the Microsoft browser or any other browser that is \n     out there on the Internet.\\11\\\n       In reality, it is simply not possible to switch browsers in \n     five seconds. To execute the procedure referred to by Mr. \n     Gates, a user would have to launch Internet Explorer, find \n     that Netscape homepage, find an option for downloading, \n     Netscape Navigator, and executive the download. Using a \n     typical 28.8 K modem, it took the Committee systems \n     administrator over two hours merely to complete the download \n     process. The reality is that all but the most sophisticated \n     Internet users are likely to forego the time and effort \n     necessary to download a browser off the Internet when they \n     can instead use the browser which comes bundled with their \n     Internet service of PC. Thus, Mr. Gates's attempt to minimize \n     the exclusionary impact of its ISP contracts is misleading at \n     best.\n\n\n        IV exclusive licensing provisions with content providers\n\n       Microsoft has also imposed restrictions on the ability of \n     firms providing Internet content (``content providers'' or \n     ``ICPs'') to promote, distribute, or render payment of non-\n     Microsoft browsers. Here again, Mr. Gates has been less than \n     candid about these resctictions. At the Judiciary Committee's \n     March 3 hearing, for example, Mr. Gates testified: ``At far \n     as Internet content providers go, let me be very clear about \n     that. There is nothing that restricts anybody who has content \n     relationships with use from developing sites that exploit any \n     browser out there in the marketplace. Those people are free \n     to do as they choose in terms of developing sites, and they \n     have lot of ways they can promote the other sites that they \n     do.\\12\\\n       This statement, however, glossed over the very significant \n     fact that, while Microsoft might not have been able to \n     explicitly prohibit a content provider from developing \n     content that can be retrieved with using nonMicrosoft \n     browsers, it did manage to split its leverage over content \n     providers, to get them to agree, as a condition for obtaining \n     placement on the Windows desktop, to various restrictions \n     designated at ``locking out'' competing browser platforms. \n     For example, the Justice Department learned that, contrary to \n     Mr. Gates's testimony, Mirosoft's contracts with the largest \n     and most popular ICPs in fact do require those ICPs \n     to promote their Microsoft channel exclusively, and do \n     restrict the ICPs' abilities to deal with ``Other \n     Browsers.'' As the Justice Department's brief explains:\n       ICPs are not allowed to compensate in any manner a producer \n     of an ``Other Browser''--including by distributing its \n     browser--for the distribution, marketing, or promotion of the \n     ICP's content, effectively precluding payment for a channel \n     on Netscape's competing Netcaster product;\n       Even if an ``Other Browser'' (namely Netscape) \n     distributes--without compensation--an ICP's content through \n     Netcaster, the ICP is still prohibited by its Microsoft \n     contract from promoting or advertising the existence of its \n     Netcaster channel and from licensing its logos to Netscape in \n     order for Netscape to promote and highlight the existence of \n     that content for Netcaster;\n       ICPs are not allowed to promote any ``Other Browser'' \n     products;\n       Microsoft restricts the distribution of ``Other Browsers'' \n     by requiring that the ICP ``distribute Internet Explorer and \n     no Other Browser as an integral part'' of an ICP Channel \n     Client for the Win32, Win16 or Macintosh platforms; and\n       ICPs must create channel content exclusively viewable with \n     Internet Explorer, and optimize many of their websites to \n     take advantage of Internet Explorer--specific extensions to \n     web standards (such as HTML) and Windows-specific technology \n     (such as Active X).\\13\\\n       Thus, Mr. Gates's testimony that Microsoft does not \n     restrict content providers' ability to develop for, or \n     promote, competing browsers, is flatly contradicted by the \n     evidence unearthed by the Justice Department. Moreover, when \n     pressed on this issue at the Committee's March 3 hearing, Mr. \n     Gates went to great lengths to avoid conceding that Microsoft \n     imposed such restrictions, even when posed with direct \n     questions and asked to give a ``yes-no'' answer. For example, \n     when Senator Hatch repeatedly questioned whether Microsoft \n     prevented any of its content partners from advertising or \n     promoting Netscape, Mr. Gates persisted in giving non-\n     responsive answers and avoiding the simple ``yes'' or ``no'' \n     answer that was requested. Only after Senator Hatch, visibly \n     frustrated, repeated the question for a fifth time, did Mr. \n     Gates finally concede albeit in a grossly incomplete fashion, \n     that Microsoft did in fact impose restrictions on Internet \n     Content Providers. The colloquy was as follows:\n       Q: Mr. Gates, you have been somewhat hard to nail down on a \n     very specific question, and I would appreciate just a yes or \n     no, if you can. Do you put any limitation on content \n     providers that limit them . . . for advertising or promoting \n     Netscape? Yes or no, if you can.\n       A: Every Internet content provider that has a business \n     relationship with Microsoft is free to develop content that \n     uses competitors' platforms and standards.\n       Q: But my question is do you put any limitations on content \n     providers that limit them . . . for doing any advertising or \n     promoting of Netscape?\n       A: Well, understand, there are more people in the Netscape \n     channel guide than there are on the Microsoft channel guide.\n       Q: How about Microsoft: Do they put limitations or \n     restrictions on people from advertising and promoting \n     Netscape?\n       A: I am not aware of any limitation that prevents them from \n     doing content that promotes Netscape.\n       Q: Do you use your exclusive arrangement with the \n     companies--do you use that as leverage to stop them from \n     advertising or promoting Netscape?\n       A: I don't--we don't-- . . .\n       Q: Does Microsoft then limit--place any limit on any \n     content providers that limits them . . . for advertising or \n     promoting Netscape or any other competitor?\n       A: I said earlier that on the pages that you link to \n     through the channel guide--that on those pages you don't \n     promote the competitive product, but that is a unique URL. \n     You are free to promote their content in quite a variety of \n     ways, but not off the specific page that we link to.\\14\\\n       Mr. Gates's steadfast refusal to answer Senator Hatch's \n     question prevented the\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\n     Members of the Committee from discovering what would be \n     revealed in the Justice Department suit nearly three months \n     later--a broad range of exclusionary restrictions that \n     Microsoft imposes on content providers. Indeed, contrary to \n     Mr. Gates's testimony, it appears that Microsoft does, in \n     fact, restrict content providers from promoting content \n     developed for competing browsers, and from promoting or \n     distributing other browsers. These practices all are, to use \n     Mr. Neukom's own words, clearly designed at ``locking out \n     competing [browser] software.''\n\n\nV. Strategic Motivation Behind ``Integration'' of Windows and Internet \n                                Explorer\n\n       An issue central to understanding the ``browser wars'' and \n     the nature of competition in the software industry generally \n     is whether Microsoft's decision to link its browser to \n     Windows was a response to consumer demand and preferences, or \n     an effort to lock competing browsers out of the market. A \n     December 20, 1996 email by Microsoft Senior Vice President \n     Jim Allchin appears to shed light on this question. It reads \n     as follows: ``Ensuring that we leverage Windows. I don't \n     understand how IE is going to win. The current path is simply \n     to copy everything that Netscape does packaging and product \n     wise . . . My conclusion is that we must leverage Windows \n     more, Treating IE as just an add-on to Windows . . . [is] \n     losing our biggest advantage--Windows market share . . . We \n     should first think about an integrated solution. That is our \n     strength? \\15\\\n       In follow-up questions to the Committee's March 3 hearing, \n     Senator Hatch inquired whether Mr. Allchin was ``urging that \n     Internet Explorer be integrated into Windows as a strategic \n     marketing measure intended to compete with Netscape Navigator \n     by ensuring that all Windows users would automatically \n     receive Internet Explorer as well.'' In his written response, \n     Mr. Gates claimed that this interpretation was inaccurate, \n     stating that ``Mr. Allchin's e-mail had nothing to do with \n     the distribution of Internet Explorer. . . .''\\16\\\n       Mr. Gates' assertion is puzzling at best. Mr. Allchin's \n     questioning ``how IE is going to win'' and criticism of \n     Microsoft's current plan ``simply to copy everything that \n     Netscape does packaging and product wise'' certainly appears \n     to be concerned with nothing other than ``the distribution of \n     Internet Explorer.'' Indeed, Mr. Allchin's view that \n     Microsoft should tie Internet Explorer to Windows in order to \n     gain an advantage over Netscape is abundantly clear in an E-\n     mail he wrote only two weeks after the above-quoted E-mail. \n     In this second E-mail, Allchin wrote: ``You see browser share \n     as job 1 . . . I do not feel we are going to win on our \n     current path. We are not leveraging Windows from a marketing \n     perspective. . . . We do not use our strength--which is that \n     we have an installed base of Windows and we have a strong OEM \n     shipment channel for Windows. Pitting browser against browser \n     is hard since Netscape has 80% marketshare and we have 20% . \n     . . I am convinced we have to use Windows--this is the one \n     thing they don't have. . . . (emphasis added) \\17\\\n       Indeed, Allchin's view was echoed by other Microsoft \n     employees.\n       Christian Wildfeuer, for example wrote as follows: ``It \n     seems clear that it will be very hard to increase browser \n     market share on the merits of IE 4 alone. It will be more \n     important to leverage the OS asset to make people use IE \n     instead of Navigator.\\18\\\n       It is, in short, difficult to accept Mr. Gates' summary \n     assertion that ``Mr. Allchin's e-mail had nothing to do with \n     the distribution of Internet Explorer.''\n\n\n                        VI. The Windows Monopoly\n\n       Notwithstanding the fact that Microsoft has a 90% plus \n     market share in the market for personal computer operating \n     systems, Mr. Gates denies that Microsoft enjoys a monopoly in \n     this market. In an effort to support his position, Mr. Gates \n     has repeatedly made reference to the fact that prices in the \n     computer industry have been falling. For example, in his oral \n     testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Gates stated \n     that: ``Another sign of a healthy, competitive industry is \n     lower prices. The statistics show that the cost of computing \n     has decreased ten-millionfold since 1971.''\n       (Mr. Gates repeated this statistic in a recent Economist \n     piece, where he also stated that the price of Windows has \n     remained ``relatively stable.'')\\20\\ And, in his written \n     testimony, Mr. Gates proudly declared that ``Prices for \n     personal computers continue to fall, even as PC's become more \n     powerful and offer greater features than ever before . . . \n     Microsoft has been an active participant in providing the \n     incredible price/performance gains that distinguished the \n     computer industry.\\21\\\n       What Mr. Gates fails to mention, however, is that the price \n     of Windows has steadily increased since its introduction to \n     the marketplace. According to one news report, the price \n     Microsoft charges OEMs for a PC operating system has risen \n     from $12-$15 per copy of DOS, to $35 for Windows 3.x, to \n     approximately $60-$70 for Windows 95.\\22\\ Four OEMs have \n     reported that Microsoft will further raise the price of \n     Windows 98 \\23\\ and it is expected that Windows NT 5.0 (which \n     eventually will replace Windows) will cost OEMs approximately \n     $130 per copy.\\24\\ Thus, while the cost of computing has \n     ``decreased ten-millionfold,'' the price of a Microsoft \n     operating system has increased roughly ten-fold--from $12 to \n     $130. This market departure from an overwhelming industry \n     trend of decreasing prices is a classic sign of monopoly \n     power.\n       While it is, of course, true that new features and \n     functionality have been added to Microsoft's operating \n     systems over this period, the same clearly can be said of \n     other computing components and computing generally. Whereas a \n     single transistor cost $5-$6 in 1959, today $6 will buy a 16 \n     megabit DRAM chip with sixteen million transistors.\\25\\ And, \n     while Intel's first Pentium chip, with 3.1 million \n     transistors and a speed of 60 megahertz, sold for $878 in \n     1993, the Pentium II, with 7.5 million transistors and a \n     speed of 233 megahertz, now sells for $268.\\26\\\n       Thus, Mr. Gates's use of the fact that the price of \n     computing has fallen dramatically to imply that Microsoft \n     operating systems are priced competitively is quite \n     misleading. In fact, Microsoft's monopoly power in the \n     operating system market has enabled it not just to raise \n     operating system prices while the price of other computing \n     components has dropped precipitously, but in fact has allowed \n     Microsoft to reap huge monopoly profits. According to the \n     Wall Street Journal, for example, Microsoft earns a \n     staggering 92% gross and 50% operating margin in its Windows \n     business.\\27\\\n\n\n     VII. Competition and Choice in the PC Operating System Market\n\n       In another effort to rebut the seemingly self-evident \n     proposition that Microsoft's 90%-plus market share for PC \n     operating systems amounts to a monopoly, Mr. Gates also \n     stated to the Committee that, ``if Microsoft attempted to \n     raise its prices beyond competitive levels, powerful \n     operating system competitors like IBM, Sun Microsystems, \n     Novell, Apple or a new entrant to the business could satisfy \n     consumer demand instantly.'' \\28\\\n       This sweeping statement is plainly at odds with the \n     economic reality, attested to by OEMs, that, given \n     Microsoft's monopoly and the fact that such a vast majority \n     of desktop applications are written for Windows,\\29\\ computer \n     manufacturers clearly do not have the choice of turning to an \n     operating system other than Windows. Indeed, numerous \n     representatives from computer manufacturers have testified \n     that they simply have no choice but to ship computers with \n     Windows, and that there is no other operating system which a \n     computer manufacturer could or would use as a substitute to \n     Windows.\n       Packard Bell executive Mal Ransom testified that there were \n     no ``commercially feasible alternative operating systems'' to \n     Windows 98.\n       Micron executive Eric Browning asserts: ``I am not aware of \n     any other non-Microsoft operating system product to which \n     Micron could or would turn as a substitute for Windows 95 at \n     this time.''\n       Hewlett Packard executive John Romano testified that HP had \n     ``absolutely no choice'' except to install Windows on its \n     PCs.\n       Gateway executive James Von Holle testified that Gateway \n     had to install Windows because ``We don't have a choice.''\n       Mr. Von Holle has testified that if there were competition \n     to Windows, he believed such competition ``would drive prices \n     lower'' and promote innovations.\\30\\\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ November 12, 1997 Letter to Chairman Hatch from William \n     H.

I suggest people who are interested in this issue not only \nlisten to what I have to say here today but that they read this. I \nthink they will find that this is a group that basically disassembles \non many issues. Frankly, I don't think they need to disassemble. All \nthey have to do is come in and tell their case forthright and in a fair \nand reasonable manner and do it on the merits. If you read this, I \nthink you will realize this is a much more serious set of problems than \nsome in the media make it, especially some of those who seem to think \nthere should never be an enforcement of the antitrust laws.\n  You don't get people from the left to the right, or right to the \nleft--from Bork to you-name-it on the left--saying that there are \nthings that are wrong here, that there is an exploitation of the \nmonopoly power of 90 percent of the operating system and the desktop \noperating systems throughout the world to crush competition and to do a \nnumber of other things that basically are violative of our laws, \nwithout their being some heat to some of the arguments that they are \nmaking.\n  I have to say, our committee hearings have shown that there are some \nthings that are wrong here. It is a matter of getting people in the \nsoftware industry to have the guts to come forward and tell their \nstories. For instance, the OEM, the original equipment manufacturers, \nare terrified because they depend totally on Microsoft's underlying \noperating system to run their machines. All Microsoft has to do is to \ndelay the delivery of that underlying operating system or anything else \nthey do to the OEMs by 1 week and they could be multimillions of \ndollars in the hole as others get an unfair advantage. We have had \npeople come in and tell us, who are afraid to testify for fear they \nwould lose their business, that they have been warned they better not \ncooperate with the committee or they better not tell the story.\n  This happens in a wide variety of things according to people who have \ncome to us. Now I think they have to have the guts to get in front of \nthe committee and tell their stories and let the chips fall where they \nmay. If they are true, if what they have been alleging to us and to the \nJustice Department is true, then we ought to find out about it and \nMicrosoft ought to have some answers for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Almost \nall legislative bodies in this country have biennial budgets, which \ngives an opportunity, first of all, for the agencies to have two years \nwith which to know what their spending will be. Secondly, it allows the \ninstitution to have time to oversee the spending that is authorized.\n  Rather than take more time to talk about it, I just raise the \nquestion again and urge the leadership to give some consideration to a \nbiennial budget, where we would make a budget for two years and then \nhave a chance for oversight, have a chance for the agencies to know \nwhat they are doing longer, and have a chance to do some of the other \nbusiness that properly comes before this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7235-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HOWARD MATZ, TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL \n                         DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session for the consideration of executive calendar \nNo. 574, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of A. Howard Matz, to be \nU.S. District Judge for the Central District of California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering today the nomination of A. Howard Matz to be U.S. District \nJudge for the Central District of California.\n  With all the support Mr. Matz has from both Democrats and \nRepublicans, I know the Senate will agree he is eminently qualified to \nsit on the U.S. District Court for the Central District in California.\n  I first recommended Mr. Matz for this seat on the federal bench on \nJuly 23, 1997, and said then that Howard Matz is an exceptional \nattorney and person. His experience, intelligence, and integrity make \nhim extremely well-qualified for the Federal bench.\n  Howard Matz is currently a partner in private practice. He represents \nlargely business clients in civil and white-collar crime matters. His \nclients have included IBM, Walt Disney Co., the cities of Anaheim and \nRiverside, Yale University and numerous individuals, partnerships, \nlawyers, and law firms. I would like to note here that I am not related \nto Joel Boxer, a partner in Howard's firm.\n  Mr. Matz received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University \nand his law degree from Harvard University. In addition to working in \nvarious law firms, early in his career he clerked for U.S. District \nCourt Judge Morris Lasker. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the \nCriminal Division, in charge of the Los Angeles Fraud and Special \nProsecutions team, he has always believed the punishment should fit the \ncrime. Mr. Matz is highly regarded in the legal community, having \nwritten many articles on legal topics and having served as a speaker \nand panelist on legal matters numerous times. He has received many \nawards and other distinctions from representatives of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue \nService for cases he handled as a prosecutor.\n  Complementing his exceptional legal career, Matz also engages \nregularly in pro bono work and is very active in his\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\ncommunity. He is on the board of directors of Bet Tzedek, having once \nserved as the President of this highly respected provider of legal \nservices for the poor. He has also served on the board of the Los \nAngeles Legal Aid Society. He is a member of the Board of Overseers for \nthe Los Angeles campus of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of \nReligion and is one of the founding sponsors of the Skirball Cultural \nCenter and Museum.\n  Howard Matz has received numerous letters in support of his \nnomination.\n  Judge Lourdes G. Baird, was appointed to the U.S. District Court in \nthe Central District of California by President Bush. Howard Matz was \nJudge Baird's mentor at the United States Attorney's office when the \nserved as Assistant U.S. Attorney together. Judge Baird wrote ``For \nover 20 years I have known Howard Matz well, both professionally and \nsocially, and strongly believe that he would be an outstanding federal \njudge if given the opportunity. . . . I am certain that one could find \nvery few candidates who could fulfill the demands of this position as \nwell as Howard.''\n  Sheriff Sherman Block of the County of Los Angeles wrote in a letter \nto Chairman Hatch ``Matz is an extremely hard working individual of \nimpeccable character and integrity. His list of credits, both \nprofessionally and within the community, is extensive. I would like to \nrecommend that you favorably consider this appointment. I have no doubt \nthat he would be a distinguished addition to the United States District \nCourt.''\n  Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles County District Attorney, has known \nHoward Matz for almost 15 years. Gil Garcetti turns down most requests \nof support from those seeking appointments, but for Mr. Matz, he felt \nthe need to express his strong support. Garcetti wrote to Chairman \nHatch ``His unusually diverse background--representing clients in civil \nand criminal litigation, in state court and federal court, as \nplaintiffs and defendants--has given him a view of the judicial process \nwhich would compel him to exercise his responsibilities as a federal \njudge with restraint. . . . I am confident Howard possesses no other \nagenda than to preside fairly and to rule with due regard for the \nimportance of precedent.''\n  George O'Connell, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nCalifornia under President Bush, and former Assistant U.S. Attorney in \nboth Los Angeles and Sacramento, wrote ``I can only underscore the I \nthink Mr. Matz would make a superb United States District Judge. . . . \nI do not think that he would engage in inappropriate judicial activism. \nRather, I believe he would make the most sincere efforts to achieve \njustice within the existing framework of the law.''\n  Robert Bonner, former U.S. Attorney (Appointed by President Reagan), \nformer U.S. District Court Judge in the Central District of California, \nformer head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (Appointed by \nPresident Bush), has known Matz for nearly 25 years, and served side-\nby-side as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Criminal Division of the \nU.S. Attorney's office in the Central District of California. Bonner \nwrote in a letter to Chairman Hatch that he believes ``Howard Matz \npossesses those attributes of character, knowledge and intellect that \nconvince me that he will be an outstanding federal district judge. On a \npersonal note, and on an issue of concern to both of us, not only do I \nknow Howard well, but I believe that, if appointed, he will not be an \nactivist jurist.''\n\n  Harold Blatt, the head of Bryan Cave LLP, sent Senator Ashcroft two \ndetailed support letters from California partners of his distinguished \nfirm, who know Mr. Matz very well.\n  Ronald Olson, a former Iowan and former chair of the American Bar \nAssociation Federal Judiciary Committee, writes to Senator Grassley \nthat he has known Howard for most of his professional life. Olson wrote \n``Howard is a lawyer who understands the limitations of the law as well \nas its possibilities, and I can assure you that he will serve as a \njudicial officer in a way that respects the limited powers of the Court \nand the fundamental roles of the legislative and executive branches.''\n  John Fishel, Executive Vice President of the Jewish Federation, wrote \n``Mr. Matz would make an outstanding federal judge and hope that his \nnomination will receive serious consideration.''\n  I would like to submit these recommendation letters in full for the \nRecord.\n  I strongly believe Howard Matz will make an outstanding addition to \nthe federal bench. I believe his intelligence, judicial temperament, \nbroad experience, professional and community service, and deep \ncommitment to justice qualify him to serve on the federal bench with \ngreat distinction. I am very proud to have had the opportunity to \nrecommend him to the President, and hope the Senate will confirm him \ntoday.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will say one thing. With the approval of \nthese two judges, this Republican Congress will have confirmed, during \nthe full tenure of President Clinton, 272 Federal judges, following the \nconfirmation of these two judges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have two separate \nback-to-back votes of 15 minutes each on the two nominations we're \nconsidering this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on both of the \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of A. Howard Matz, to be U.S. District Judge \nfor the Central District of California.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President I would like to take leader time just to go \nover the schedule briefly because I know Senators are interested in the \nbalance of the day and when we return.\n  This second vote will be the last vote of the week. We did get a good \ndeal accomplished yesterday and I thank Senators for their cooperation \non the Department of Defense authorization bill, the military \nconstruction appropriations bill and nominations.\n  The Senate will recess this afternoon until 12 noon on Monday, July \n6, for the Independence Day recess. When we reconvene on Monday, it \nwill be my intention to turn to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. Any votes to occur with respect to that \nappropriations bill will be stacked to occur on Tuesday, July 7. It is \nmy understanding the managers may have as many as 20 amendments to \nconsider on Monday, and expect to debate those amendments and have \nvotes, then, on Tuesday.\n  Before the Senate adjourns, I will ask consent that we turn to the \nproduct liability bill. If that request is objected to, then I will \nmove to proceed to that matter and file cloture. That cloture vote will \noccur, then, on Tuesday, July 7, at 9:30, if it is necessary to file \ncloture. We will then be asked to consider the IRS reform conference \nreport Tuesday evening, and I do mean Tuesday night, so that we can get \nwork done on appropriations bills, product liability, and the IRS \nreform.\n  There will be no vote occurring, then, on Monday, July 6. There are a \nlot of conflicts, Senators trying to get back and I am trying to be \ncooperative on that. But I do want to announce again, as I did earlier \ntoday: Expect votes on Mondays and Fridays and expect 12-hour days \nTuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays throughout July. We have to do at \nleast 8 appropriations bills during July.\n  If we get our work done, we won't have to have votes at 9 or 10 \no'clock. But it would be my intention, if we don't get cooperation, \nthat I would schedule votes at 9 or 10 o'clock every Tuesday, Wednesday \nand Thursday, because we have to get it done. I hope Senators will stop \nintroducing 100 amendments to every bill. It is ridiculous. If you have \nthree or four important amendments on each side, and I am talking to \nboth sides, fine. But if we call up DOD and there are 150 amendments \noffered, it just tells you something about the Senate. So we are going \nto get our work done in July if we have to go way into the night every \nnight.\n  Members should be prepared, then, to work on the appropriations bills \nand the conference reports. We have a time agreement on higher \neducation. We will work to take up bankruptcy, drug czar \nreauthorization, Internet gambling, pornography and filtering. I thank \nall Senators for their cooperation.\n  I thank Senator Gordon Smith for what he has done to the dress code \nin the Senate. I think the Senate is looking brighter, lighter, and it \nis good for our image and, I think, for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7237-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7237-S7238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF VICTORIA A.

Mr. President, I began this year challenging the Senate to \nmaintain the pace it set in the last weeks of the last session in which \nit confirmed 27 judicial nominees in 9 weeks. Instead, the Senate has \nconfirmed only 31 nominees so far this year--instead of the 54 it \nshould have if it had maintained last year's pace.\n  I reissue my challenge for the remaining 10 weeks of this session: \nThe Republican Senate can confirm another 30 nominees by the end of the \nsession if it will just work at the pace it achieved in connection with \nthe President's radio address last year.\n  I thank the Majority Leader for calling up the nominations of Howard \nMatz and Victoria Roberts. With their confirmations, and I do believe \nthat they should and will be confirmed, the Senate will have acted on \nonly 33 federal judges at a time in which the federal judiciary has \nexperienced 103 vacancies, many of longstanding duration. Indeed, Ms. \nRoberts would fill a judiciary emergency vacancy. We will have 45 \njudicial nominations still pending before the Senate or the Judiciary \nCommittee, some which were first received over three years ago.\n  There are currently nine other qualified nominees on the Senate \ncalendar having been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. I \ndeeply regret that the entire Senate Executive Calendar is not being \ncleared and the Senate is not being given the opportunity to vote on \nall 11 nominees awaiting Senate action.\n  The nomination held up the longest is that of Judge Sonia Sotomayor \nto fill a critical vacancy on the Second Circuit, a Circuit whose Chief \nJudge has declared an emergency situation, canceled hearings and taken \nthe extraordinary step of proceeding with 3-judge panels including only \none Second Circuit judge. Chief Judge Winter recently issued his annual \nreport in which he notes that the Circuit now has the greatest backlog \nit has ever had, due to the multiple vacancies that have plagued that \ncourt.\n  In addition, there are 36 nominees pending before the Committee and \nmore nominees being received from the President every week. I hope that \nthe Committee will schedule prompt hearings for each of the judicial \nnominees currently pending in Committee and the nominees we expect to \nbe receiving over the next several weeks so that they may have an \nopportunity to be considered by the Committee and confirmed by the \nSenate. At the rate of six nominees a hearing, the Committee needs to \nschedule at least six more hearings this summer for currently pending \nnominees.\n  The Senate continues to tolerate more than 70 vacancies in the \nfederal courts with another 11 on the horizon--almost one in 10 \njudgeships remains unfilled, and, from the looks of things, will remain \nunfilled into the future unless the Judiciary Committee does a better \njob and the Senate proceeds promptly to consider nominees reported to \nit.\n  We have held only seven judicial nominations confirmation hearing all \nyear. I recall in 1994--the most recent year in which the Democrats \nconstituted the majority--when the Judiciary Committee held 25 judicial \nconfirmation hearings, including hearings to confirm a Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  Nine currently pending nominees for the Courts of Appeals need their \nhearings and need them promptly if they are to be considered and \nconfirmed this year, only three of those were received in the last 60 \ndays. We have 25 currently pending nominees to the District Courts and \nonly four of those were received in the last 30 days.\n  Unlike earlier days in the Senate when nominees were not made to wait \nfor weeks and months on the Senate calendar before they could be \nconsidered, that is now becoming the rule. Margaret Morrow spent 244 \ndays on the calendar. Patrick McCuskey and Michael McCuskey each spent \n144 days on the calendar. The average time on the calendar has gone \nfrom a day or two to over 44 days.\n  I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky \nnominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1994 \nand 1995 judicial nominees took on average 86 or 87 days from \nnomination to confirmation. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 \ndays on average. Some would discount that number because it was a \npresidential election year, but even they cannot ignore that it \nshattered the previous record. Last year, the average number of days \nfrom nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and this \nis the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to \nconfirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 \njudges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200 day barrier for the first time \nin our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is still \ngrowing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the \nadministration of justice. As we begin the day the average time from \nnomination to confirmation is over 250 days. That is three times the \ntime it took before this slowdown began in earnest.\n  During the entire four years of the Bush Administration there were \nonly three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for \nas long as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a \nyear. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more \nthan 9 months before a final favorable vote and 9 of those 10 extended \nover a year to a year and one-half. Of the judges confirmed so far this \nyear, Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki Mollway's \nconfirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, \nMargaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret Morrow's \nconfirmation took 21 months, and Victoria Roberts will have taken 11 \nmonths. An additional nine confirmation this year took more than 200 \ndays.\n\n  Last year the President sent us 79 judicial nominations but the \nSenate completed action on fewer than half of them. The percentage of \njudicial nominees confirmed over the course of last year was lower than \nfor any Congress over the last three decades and, possibly, at any time \nin our history.\n  Left pending were 42 judicial nominees, including 11 who were first \nnominated in 1995 and 1996, and 21 to fill judicial emergencies. Still \npending before the Senate are four nominees first nominated in 1995 and \ntwo more first nominated in 1996. There are still eight nominations \npending from 1997.\n  Unfortunately, over the last three years, the Senate has barely \nmatched the one-year total of judges confirmed in 1994 when we were on \ncourse to end the vacancy gap. We have not yet made up for attrition \nover the last two years. I observed at our last nominations hearing \nthat we are not even keeping up with Mark McGwire, the St. Louis \nCardinal slugger. In the three months of the baseball season leading up \nto the All Star game, he has hit 35 home runs. The Senate has had two \nadditional months and confirmed only 33 judges.\n  I recall in 1992, the last year of President Bush's Administration, \nthe Senate, with a Democratic majority in a presidential election year \nconfirmed 63 judicial nominations. Since obtaining their majority in \nthe 1994 election, the current Republican majority has not achieved \nthat number of confirmation in any year. Indeed in the presidential \nelection year of 1996, the Senate confirmed only 17 judges and none for \nthe courts of appeals.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the \nnumber of judicial vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in \nthe federal judiciary.'' I have urged those who have been stalling the \nconsideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and \nto work with us to have the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfill \nthis constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the \nfilling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or \npreventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, \nincarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.\n  The numerous, longstanding vacancies in some courts are harming the \nfederal administration of justice. The people in these districts and \ncircuits need additional federal judges. Indeed the Judicial Conference \nof the United States recommends that in addition to filling the current \nvacancies, the Congress should authorize 53 additional judgeships \nthroughout the country, as set forth in S. 678, the Federal Judgeship \nAct that I introduced in May 1997. That indicates that the work demands \nof the federal judiciary justify 133 additional judges. There is a \nclamor for us to fill these vacancies and there is\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\nharm by the Senate's delay and failure to do so.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly \ndeclared in his 1997 Year End Report: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such \nhigh levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \ntraditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.'' We have \nhad hearings canceled by both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit \ndue to judicial vacancies. Must we wait for the administration of \njustice to fail before the Senate will act on the other 45 judicial \nnominees pending before us? I hope not.\n  In his most recent report on the judiciary the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court observed: ``Some current nominees have been \nwaiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a \nfinal floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in \n1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to \nnote: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \nparticular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should \nvote him up or vote him down.''\n  I hope that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate will proceed to \nconsider and confirm judicial nominees more promptly and without the \nmonths of delay that now accompany so many nominations. I hope the \nCommittee will not delay in scheduling the additional hearings we need \nto hold to consider the fine men and women whom the President has \nnominated to fill these important positions.\n  Mr. President, Howard Matz, I am glad to see, was confirmed. He was \nnominated last October, reported by the committee on April 2.\n  I thank the majority leader for bringing this up and getting it \nconcluded. Senator Boxer of California showed enormous perseverance and \ndetermination in moving this forward. I commend her and her choice. I \nnote that he was confirmed by unanimous vote, 85-0.\n  Victoria Roberts' nomination has been on the calendar 1 month, \npending 11 months. Senator Levin has been very strongly supportive of \nher, and I believe that also was a unanimous confirmation. I commend \nthe Senators involved, and I commend the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7238-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Romulus was the legendary first King of \nRome. It was said that he went up to Heaven during a storm. Others have \ndrawn the conclusion that it was during an eclipse of the Sun. In any \ncase, it was a historic event.\n  When Joshua had his men march around the walls of Jericho, they blew \ntheir trumpets at a given signal and the walls came tumbling down. We \nare told in the Scriptures that it was a long day, a long day, a \nsignificant event, perhaps a scientific event, one about which there \nhas been some debate.\n  I have been informed of a truly significant recent event. I wouldn't \nsay that it is Earth shaking, but who knows? It could eventually be \nlooked back upon as an earthshaking event.\n  Now, what is this all about? The Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, \nis watching and listening with great interest, and so are others. This \nevent, I want to say in the Record and for all those who are watching \nthrough that electronic eye, this event was about the coming of Chester \nTrent Lott III, the first grandchild of our distinguished majority \nleader, and the baby came with the angels on last Saturday evening.\n  He weighed 7 pounds and 7 ounces--so, you see, those are mystic \nnumbers, 7/7--7 pounds, 7 ounces. He was 19.5 inches in length. Now, \nthese weights and measures are important. They were even important to \nthe barons who forced King John on the meadow at Runnymede on June 15, \n1215, to sign the great charter, the Magna Carta, which required that \nthere be a system of weights and measures in the Kingdom. And our \nillustrious forebears who wrote the Constitution of the United States \nsaid that Congress would have the power to fix the standard of weights \nand measures.\n\n  So here to live by that system of weights and measures is a new man, \na nova Homo sapiens named Chester Trent Lott III. That is a matter of \ngreat significance in the life of our leader.\n  I congratulate Senator Lott on this most felicitous happening, this \nmost felicitous occasion. Mr. President, there is nothing, may I say to \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, so wonderful \nas cradling in your arms--oh, many times I have done it--cradling in \nyour arms a swaddled baby. It awakens in one such an amazing range of \nemotions. There is nothing like it. It is an experience sui generis--\none of a kind. Upon the birth of one's own child, the tremendous joy \nand relief felt in meeting for the first time this tiny, new person is \ntempered by a measure of fear. You gaze down at this fragile baby and \nrealize what an awesome responsibility you have assumed. Your baby is \nsmall, maybe 7 pounds 7 ounces--and there are smaller babies. They are \nall small and so fragile, so helpless, and so dependent upon you for \ntheir survival. His skin is as soft as a butterfly's wing, his \nfingernails as translucent as scraps of rice paper; yet those minute, \nperfect little fingers grasp yours with such fierce determination! I \ncan feel those little fingers closing around my fingers with such \nfierce determination--although that experience of having my own \ndaughters do that is now 60 years gone. But the memory is fresh in my \nmind.\n  But to become a grandfather--now, that is a higher plateau. Mr. \nLeader, you are walking a higher plateau of immortality. It is not your \nfirst taste of mortality--that came with your son or daughter--but now \na more inspiring, promising taste of immortality. To become a \ngrandfather is a completely different experience. There is none of that \nfear, but all of the joy. That joy is heightened by a deep conviction--\na deep conviction that ``this is in my image'' and in its grandmother's \nimage, too. But it has my genes, it has my chromosomes, it is part of \nme. I can see it going on into the future and carrying on through life. \nRobert Byrd will never die, I would say. I can say that in more ways \nthan one, but in this situation, my grandchild is part of me.\n  Tennyson said, ``I am a part of all that I have met.'' But this was \nknown before Tennyson. A grandfather, when he looks upon that child, \ncan say with joy: ``This is a part of me; it will never, never die.''\n  That joy is heightened by a deep connection that you feel to the long \ncontinuum of countless generations, stretching all the way back from \nAdam and Eve to you and through you to your child, and now to your \nchild's child. And you can feel the pull of the ancient echoes from the \ndim and distant past as your arms adjust to the weight of this little, \nnew life in your arms. And you can see into the hazy unknown and murky \ndistant future of continuing, endless generations, when this child of \nyour child will have children who will carry a part of you and a part \nof everyone in this chain before you into the next century, and beyond.\n  There is a sense of connectedness and timelessness that allows you to \nunderstand your place in the long, slow march of generations that is as \ndifficult to express as it is wonderful to experience.\n  That political treatise, The Policraticus, was written by John of \nSalisbury in the early part of the 12th century. It told of \nProthaonius, who said it was glory enough for him that he had lived a \nlife, of which his ``grandson need not be ashamed.'' It was glory \nenough for him that he had lived a life of which his grandson need not \nbe ashamed. We grandfathers should try to emulate Prothaonius.\n  Well, I offer my sincere congratulations to Senator Lott and best \nwishes to his new grandson; and, of course, I congratulate Mrs. Lott, \nabout her new grandson, and my wife joins me. I hope the duties of the \n``grandfather's office'' will not prevent the Senator from Mississippi \nfrom spending many happy\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\nhours with the newest member of the ``House of Lott.''\n  We read about the House of David. This is the ``House of Lott.'' And, \nas the days and months go by, when this grandfather holds his new \ngrandson, I hope that Senator Lott will appreciate the emotion that is \nexpressed by these few lines of verse, which I did not write, but which \nI dedicate to Chester Trent Lott III.\n\n     First, in thy grandfather's arms, a newborn child\n     thou didst weep, while those around thee smiled;\n     so live, that in thy lasting sleep\n     thou mayst smile while those around thee weep.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am truly honored and awed by the \nbeautiful, flowing, wonderful remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. I can assure him that the ``House of Lott'' will forever \ntreasure his remarks here today.\n  I actually was not sure that the Senator was going to do this today. \nBut by accident, coincidence, I had suggested to my wife earlier this \nmorning about 10:30 that she might want to look in on the Senate's \nactivities this morning. I hope that she and my son and daughter-in-law \nand young grandson have been able to watch this magnificent \npresentation.\n  I could never match, nor would I even attempt to respond in kind to \nthe magnificent statement that has just been given by the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  The American people have seen once again here this morning what an \nimportant and incomparable role that the Senator from West Virginia \nplays in this body. He is our historian. He is our conscience. He is \nthe one that guarantees that we honor this institution, respect each \nother, that we are honest and fair with each other, that we think about \nour country, and that we have moments of great oratory and moments \nwhere we reach for that power star in this country and in the world. \nBut only Senator Byrd would take the floor and take the time to talk \nabout the importance of family, fatherhood, grandchildren, and \ngenerations yet to come.\n  He brings us back to Earth. He makes us appreciate, once again, how \nreally humbled we should be to be here, and that we should always keep \nour priorities in order.\n  History gives us something we can look back toward as we move in the \nfuture--great events, great moments, crowning of kings, and war \ntreaties. But in most lives nothing is more important than the birth of \nyour children, your daughter, and your son, and your grandson.\n  So I thank him for what he had to say here today, not just for my \ngrandson and me, but what it says about this institution, what it says \nabout our relationship, and what is says about America and the \nimportance of family.\n  I am very proud. I am a very proud grandfather. I have a wonderful \nwife and two wonderful children, and now our grandchild.\n  You are right. I have held him in my arms already. I was reduced to a \npuddle of tears and excitement about this occasion. It really is one of \nthe magic moments in your life.\n  But the most wonderful experience I had over the past week was when I \ntook my son to lunch last Sunday to give him a break because it had \nbeen a long time through the delivery. And his wife did wonderfully \nwell. And I was talking to him. I said, ``Now, son, don't feel like you \nhave to pass the family name on. You know, call him whatever you \nwant.'' He said, ``Dad, I want to name my son after my best friend.''\n  I couldn't say anything more, because I was so proud of him and what \nhe had to say.\n  So this is a great event. I am really appreciative of what you had to \nsay, and I am appreciative of being able to serve in this great body.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to add my hearty congratulations to \nour distinguished leader.\n  And how much I enjoyed listening to Senator Byrd. I had the privilege \nof having a long conversation with your granddaughter the other day. \nShe has a certain interest in my State. I am not even going to let you \nknow what we were talking about.\n  Someday, Senator Lott, we will put in the Record the great story \nabout Senator Murkowski and his grandchildren. That is a wonderful \nstory. It should be in the Record.\n  But these are moments in the life of the Senate--to look at these \ntwo, the greatest of leaders, exchange heartfelt thoughts. It enriches \nus all. And I thank you.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to join with all my other \ncolleagues in congratulating the majority leader, Senator Lott, on the \nbirth of his grandson, and also to express my very deep appreciation to \nSenator Byrd for his wonderful statement just a few minutes ago on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  There is no one who brings us back to our sense of the Senate as an \ninstitution any more than Senator Byrd. And it is always a delight to \nhave the opportunity to hear him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7239-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7240-S7241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, and all Senators last night for the \nunanimous-consent passage of an important piece of legislation \nauthorizing the placement of a Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial in \narea I of the capital of the greatest country in the world, right here \nin Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, I rise to applaud the passage of this important \nlegislation authorizing the placement of a Martin Luther King, Jr., \nMemorial in Area I of the Capital.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Senator Sarbanes \nand Congresswoman Morella for the leadership they have both shown over \nthe years we have worked together on legislation authorizing the \nestablishment of a Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial.\n  In 1996, Congress passed and the President signed legislation, also \nsponsored by Senator Sarbanes and myself, authorizing the Alpha Phi \nAlpha Fraternity, the oldest predominately African-American fraternity \nin the United States, to establish without cost to the Federal \nGovernment a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the District of \nColumbia.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity wishes to honor Dr. King \nwith a memorial in the Nation's Capital as tangible recognition of his \nremarkable role in the history of our nation. Dr. King's message of \nnonviolence and freedom for all should be passed from generation to \ngeneration. A memorial in his name will be effective in helping us \nreach this important goal.\n  The legislation establishes the memorial in Area I, which consists of \nthe Mall and environs. As you know, the Department of Interior, after \nconsult with the National Capital Memorial Commission, transmitted its \nformal recommendation that the memorial be located in Area I in a \nletter to the President of the Senate dated January 29, 1998.\n  Requirements contained in the Commemorative Works Act stipulate that \nthe Department of Interior's recommendation regarding location of a \nmemorial in Area I shall be disapproved if not enacted into law within \n150 days of its transmittal to Congress. Therefore it was critical that \nthe Senate consider and pass this legislation prior to that deadline.\n  I would like to add two personal reminiscences that I have about Dr. \nKing. By coincidence largely, I was within the vicinity of the Lincoln \nMemorial when he delivered his historic address. I do recall vividly \nthe long line of marchers coming to and from that historic event.\n  Somewhat later in life, I was privileged to serve on the governing \nboard of the Washington Cathedral. The subject came up as to whether or \nnot he would be invited to preach in the Washington Cathedral. And I \nremember very well the board meeting. I was present and with others \ncast my vote such that he could come to that magnificent edifice which \nis on the highest promontory of the Nation's Capital to deliver his \nlast and most historic sermon.\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\n  So I am deeply moved. But I have played a modest role in seeing that \nanother very fitting memorial be dedicated to that American of \nextraordinary accomplishment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to amend one thing that the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia said. I think he referred to his \nrole here as a ``modest role.'' But he really was very pivotal in \nhelping us to get this legislation enacted last night.\n  The Secretary of the Interior determined that the Martin Luther King \nstatue, which is going to be placed in the District of Columbia in \nmemory of Martin Luther King, would be put in the prime area, which is \nthe Mall and the surrounding areas. That determination needed the \napproval of the Congress. Senator Warner and I joined together in the \nSenate, along with Congresswoman Morella, who led the effort in the \nHouse, in order to bring this about.\n  We will now have a statue in the District in a fairly short time. The \nmoney will be raised privately by the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. But \nit will stand as a tribute to what Martin Luther King, Jr. represented, \nwhich, in my judgment, was a commitment to achieving change through \nnonviolence--a very important lesson. Martin Luther King, Jr. clearly \nworked within the framework of a democratic society. He sought very \nsignificant and substantial change. He sought to make the Nation live \nup to its ideals. But he was committed in doing it in a nonviolent way.\n  I think that is a very important lesson for all Americans.\n  I, like the Senator from Virginia, have personal memories. I was at \nthe Reflecting Pool the day he gave the ``I Have a Dream'' speech, when \nhe stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and, of course, that \nspeech had a tremendous impact on American society then and continues \nto have a tremendous impact.\n  So I am very glad that this matter has been moved forward now. All of \nthe legislation that is now necessary is in place, and now we look \nforward to going ahead and we look forward to, at sometime in the not \ntoo distant future, a ground breaking and, sometime thereafter, a \ndedication.\n  I express again my deep appreciation to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia for his efforts in this regard.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I just simply add my thanks to my colleague. We \nwere full partners on it. And, indeed, I did not know that the Senator \nlikewise was at the historic speech. It shows you how interesting life \ncan be.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are, with remarks limited to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7240-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING SENATOR LOTT AND SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in expressing my \nadmiration and respect for the senior Senator from West Virginia, for \nthe extraordinary comments he made on behalf of Senator Lott. I was \nequally touched I think by the honest, open response of Senator Lott to \nthe emotions that he felt with respect to the birth of his grandson. I \nthink we can all sense, at least those of us who have had children, the \nenormous emotional wave of that particular moment.\n  So we salute both of those colleagues of ours. I thank Senator Byrd \nfor taking the time to share with the Senate those important thoughts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7241-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7241-S7242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE TOBACCO BILL\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I almost hate to break the sort of magic, \nif you will, of those moments, but I want to say a few things, if I \nmay, about the proposal yesterday of the Speaker of the House with \nrespect to the principles that the House and he will pursue in trying \nto put forward tobacco legislation.\n  Many people in the press have been busy writing that the tobacco bill \nis dead, and a great number of people have suggested, even in this \nbody, that tobacco is dead as an issue for this year.\n  I wish to make it very clear that, if anything, the proposal by the \nSpeaker makes it clear that not only is it not dead but the Republicans \nfeel compelled to somehow create some sort of cover for the efforts \nthat took place in the Senate over the course of the last weeks to stop \na particular piece of legislation.\n  I think the headlines that ran across the country saying \n``Republicans Killed Tobacco Bill''; have stung more than some people \nwant to suggest, and the evidence of that is the fact that the Speaker \nsaw fit to provide this figleaf to the party. It is a figleaf, and I \nthink it has to be put in the context of Speaker Gingrich's own $50 \nbillion tax credit that he snuck for the tobacco industry into the \nbalanced budget legislation. No one should forget that only a year ago \nthe Speaker of the House provided the tobacco industry of this country \nwith a $50 billion tax credit and now he is providing another gift to \nthe industry and a disaster for children and for public health.\n  As Surgeon General Koop said yesterday about the Gingrich proposal:\n\n       Instead of doing something serious about reducing \n     the number of children who smoke, these Members of \n     Congress have created a bill that they can hold up for a \n     photo opportunity and a sound bite. If the House \n     Republicans try to call this a bill to limit the damage \n     that tobacco does to the Nation's health, that's false \n     advertising.\n\n  Then Surgeon General Koop said:\n\n       I'm glad they feel they have to do something. I'm sorry \n     they think they can do so little.\n\n  Mr. President, let me say specifically what the great flaws are in \nthe outlined proposed by the Speaker.\n  First of all, rather than expand FDA authority over tobacco, it \nactually restricts authority. By restricting the FDA to only being able \nto regulate the manufacture of cigarettes, it actually strips the FDA \nof most of its regulatory authority. And that is directly contrary to \nwhat the Senate accepted in the proposal that came from the Commerce \nCommittee by a vote of 19 to 1, and it was never contested in this \nChamber that that authority ought to exist.\n  The House, under the Gingrich proposal, would even curtail the FDA's \nability to restrict the illegal sale of tobacco products to children. \nThat is extraordinary, and also it lacks any common sense whatsoever.\n  Furthermore, the Gingrich proposal provides no tough penalties \nwhatsoever on the tobacco industry if they are to continue to market to \nkids. There is not any one of us who does not know the long history of \nthe tobacco industry marketing to kids.\n  Here is the memo from R.J. Reynolds Company:\n\n       They, i.e. young people, represent tomorrow's cigarette \n     business. As this 14-24 age group matures, they will account \n     for a key share of the total cigarette volume for at least \n     the next 25 years.\n\n  In the course of the debate, we made it very, very clear, through \ntheir own words, the degree to which tobacco companies targeted young \nchildren and the degree to which they created a strategy to try to \naddict young people to cigarettes, to tobacco. There is no effort \nwhatsoever in the Gingrich approach to try to hold the tobacco \ncompanies responsible, not only to the programs that might reduce \nchildren from smoking but also to tough provisions that would hold them \naccountable if they do not meet the reduction in teenager smoking.\n  The tobacco industry has preyed upon children for decades. The \nRepublicans in the House evidently are prepared to let them continue to \ndo that, and the Senate I know will find that unacceptable.\n  Furthermore, the Gingrich approach lays out a series of very tough, \npunitive measures for teenagers without being punitive on the companies \nthemselves. They are tougher on the kids who wind up subjecting \nthemselves to the lure of the tobacco companies than they are on the \ntobacco companies themselves. That is absolutely extraordinary and \ntotally unacceptable.\n  Obviously, there ought to be some penalties with respect to teenage \npurchase if it is against the law to purchase, but the answer to reduce \nyouth smoking is not a solely punitive bill on children, it is to \ninclude the tobacco companies. If anything ever stood for\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\nthe degree to which the Republicans in the House, and maybe elsewhere, \nare prepared to stand with the tobacco companies, it is an outline for \na tobacco bill that holds the children liable and lets the tobacco \ncompanies go free.\n  In addition to that, there is no price increase whatsoever for the \neffort to reduce youth smoking. We can argue about what this level \nought to be. The Senate rejected the notion that it ought to be $1.50, \nbut the Senate did accept the notion that $1.10 seemed to make sense. \nAt least no one voted to strip that $1.10, and I doubt that they would.\n  So it is clear, all of the evidence thus far makes it clear, that \nraising the price has some impact on smoking. Let me quote from Philip \nMorris. You don't have to believe the Senate debate, but this is Philip \nMorris speaking, this is an internal document from the Minnesota trial:\n\n       You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey \n     Harris of MIT calculated . . . the 1982-1983 round of price \n     increases caused two million adults to quit smoking and \n     prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke.\n\n  In 1982, the tobacco companies took note themselves of the fact that \na price increase prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke:\n\n       Those teenagers are now 18-21 years old, and since about 70 \n     percent of 18-20 year-olds and 35 percent of older smokers \n     smoke a [Philip Morris] brand, this means that 700,000 of \n     those adult quitters had been [Philip Morris] smokers, and \n     420,000 of those non-starters would have been [Philip Morris] \n     smokers. Thus, if Harris is right, we were hit \n     disproportionately hard. We don't need this to happen again.\n\n  Philip Morris says, ``We don't need this to happen again.'' \nEvidently, Newt Gingrich agrees with him because he has come up with a \nproposal that allies himself directly with the tobacco companies and \nwith that memo.\n  Mr. President, it is clear we need serious legislation. We have made \nit clear that we are going to return on future pieces of legislation to \ntry to pass tobacco legislation in the Senate.\n  Let me be clear. If we were to simply come back with the same bill \nthat was defeated, I think we would be both stupid and we would deserve \na vote of rejection by the Senate. So it is clear that we need to \nrethink how we do this in an intelligent way.\n  The Senate found cause to cite specific kinds of problems with the \nlast piece of legislation. I am not going to disagree that there were \nnot legitimate problems. I do disagree that we could not have cured \nthem in a legitimate legislative process. But it is clear that, if we \nput our minds to it, we can constrain a piece of legislation so it \nadequately is tailored to meet the needs of reducing teenage smoking \nand of creating a sufficient amount of funding, if you will, of the \nStates' needs with respect to the settlement process. After all, the \ntobacco companies and the States agreed to a $368 billion base over 25 \nyears, and that provided about $200 billion to the States to be able to \nsettle. They came to agreement on that.\n  It would seem to me we ought to be able to ratify something in the \nSenate that establishes a comprehensive proposal to have a State \nsettlement at the same time as we meet the needs of health care with \nrespect to reducing the number of kids smoking at the same time as we \nmeet the needs of farmers.\n  So, we will be able to test that, in the next weeks, through a \nproposal that I and others will make, which ought to be able to address \nthe most critical concerns that were expressed by Senators in \nopposition but at the same time provides us with something completely \ndifferent from what Speaker Gingrich is talking about.\n  We do not need a figleaf. We do not need a photo opportunity. We need \na serious piece of legislation that will allow the States to be able to \ndo what they need to do to provide counteradvertising and cessation \nefforts to address the health care needs of our country and to reduce \nteenage smoking while simultaneously allowing us to come to a global \nsettlement.\n  I believe that is achievable. I hope when we return the Senate will \nact seriously to make that happen. I look forward to the U.S. Senate \nsending over to the House a serious piece of tobacco legislation that \nwill provide the country with an opportunity, in bipartisan form, to be \nable to deal with this important problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I make comments on trade, let me \nonly say to the Senator from Massachusetts, long before the Senate \ndecided to put down the very ill-conceived piece of legislation, the \nSpeaker of the House was saying that the House would address teenage \nsmoking problems. So, whether the Senator from Massachusetts decides to \ncharacterize it today as a figleaf or Johnny-come-lately, that was \nclearly the intent of the House all along. Obviously, the Speaker is \nnow honoring his commitment by stepping forward with a proposal.\n  I hope in the end we can address this issue and not allow teenagers \nto be the figleaf of big taxes and big government, and find a real \nsolution to this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7241-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7242-S7243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING EVASION OF U.S./CANADA LUMBER AGREEMENT, AT \n                   THE EXPENSE OF U.S. MILLS AND JOBS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to talk today briefly about an \nissue that affects hundreds of American companies and tens of thousands \nof American workers, and that is, of course, the proper enforcement of \nthe 1996 U.S./Canadian Softwood Lumber Agreement.\n  On several occasions I have stood before this body to express \ndisappointment at our trading partners who are violating trade \nagreements with the United States. Generally, the problem arises abroad \nand requires aggressive efforts by the administration to insist on \ncompliance by other countries to ensure that our products and our \nworkers can compete on a level playing field. But the foremost problem \nfor the Lumber Agreement is action by the U.S. Customs Service that is \naffirmatively undermining the current softwood agreement that I am \nspeaking to.\n  As many of us who are from lumber-producing States are so keenly \naware, the 1996 Lumber Agreement is our largest sectorial trade \nagreement with our largest trading partner, Canada. It is a very \nmoderate response to a massive Canadian subsidizing of lumber. Unlike \nUnited States lumber mills which must buy timber at market prices, \nCanadian mills are provided timber by the Provinces at prices that are \noftentimes one-quarter to one-third the market value of real timber on \nthe stump. Those subsidies amount to $4 billion Canadian dollars a \nyear. Subsidized imports have cost the United States thousands of jobs \nand have injured and constrained a pivotal U.S. industry.\n  In 1991, Canada unilaterally abrogated a 1986 settlement of that \ndispute. Canada's imports to the United States climbed from about 27 \npercent of market share to almost 37 percent. The compromise in the \n1996 Agreement was intended to offset, in part, Canada's subsidies and \nbring Canada's share of our market back to around 33 percent to 34 \npercent.\n  In February of 1997, however, a ruling by our own Customs Service \nenabled Canadian producers to evade the agreement merely by drilling \nholes in the lumber. Let me repeat that--by simply drilling holes in a \n2X4 or a building stud, ostensibly, the argument was, for wires and \npipes in construction purposes. Customs said this lumber with a hole \nwas ``joinery or carpentry,'' like doors or window frames or buil-up \ntruss. This was a ridiculous ruling, by almost everybody's evaluation. \nIt is inconsistent with other classifications. It is inconsistent with \ncommon commercial understanding. Official guidance issued by the \nCommerce Department, the International Trade Commission, and the \nCustoms Service all confirmed that drilled lumber is ``lumber'' for \nimport classification purposes, not joinery or carpentry. The U.S. \nTrade Representative confirmed that this product was intended to be \ncovered by the Agreement.\n  Not surprisingly, though, once Customs opened the door, imports of \n``joinery and carpentry'' rose from about $8-10 million a month to \nnearly $46 million a month in April. This loophole is allowing over $1 \nmillion a day--let me repeat that--$1 million a day of subsidized \nlumber to evade the Agreement and destroy the Agreement's intent of \noffsetting the subsidy.\n  The U.S. industry is again experiencing widespread shutdowns, \nslowdowns,\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nand job losses. In my State of Idaho, mills are closing or anticipating \nclosure because of this flood of Canadian timber now hitting our \nmarket.\n  Last September, Congress confirmed its intention that drilled lumber \nbe considered ``lumber.'' But while Customs promised a quick \nreassessment of the February 1997 ruling, our report was ignored. \nCustoms finally requested formal comments on the ruling by late \nOctober, but then gave a 60-day comment period rather than its normal \n30-day comment period. You almost have to say, ``U.S. Customs, whose \nside are you on?''\n  Customs delayed its response until April 15--that is from a February \nruling of the year before--when it acknowledged its mistake, but again \nfailed to take action. Instead, even though it had thoroughly reviewed \nextensive public comment, it asked for more comment, but this time \nreferenced a statute with a deadline for formal action by June 15. Now \nwe are almost a year and a half into the process. After 17\\1/2\\ months \nof review, the agency failed to meet that statutory deadline. Highly \nsubsidized drilled lumber continues to pour over the border, damaging \nthe agreement and destroying jobs in my State and in every other \ntimber-producing State in the Nation.\n  Now, some are arguing that even if Customs finally corrects the \nerror, it will take another 60 days for implementation, at the cost of \nmore than $70 million in U.S. sales. I have to say --and I use this \nword, but I would like to find a stronger word -- ``Customs, how \nridiculous can you get?'' Importers were warned by Customs in the \nOctober 27, 1997 Federal Register notice that they could not rely on \nthe old ruling. Once Customs decides that this product is properly \ncovered by the United States-Canadian Lumber Agreement, further \ninvasion should be stopped. By its terms, the international agreement \nwill cover this lumber.\n  What is particularly shocking about this loophole is that before the \nAgreement was signed, the administration expressly committed to the \nU.S. lumber industry that USTR, Commerce, and Customs would work \naggressively at full and effective enforcement.\n  Now, I do not know if you call stumbling through the darkness of \nstatutes for 17 months an aggressive effort. Mr. President, this \n``ain't'' aggressive.\n  Mr. President, the Customs Service handled this issue in what I would \nhave to say is the most outrageous of ways. U.S. mills and workers \nshould be able to expect their Government, their President, to work for \nthem by enforcing trade agreements. Heaven knows, they should be able \nto expect their Government not to affirmatively undermine trade \nagreements and cause them to be defenseless against unfair imports. \nThat Customs would continue to do so in violation of a direct statutory \nrequirement and blithely ignoring this Congress' report is beyond the \npale. Of course, now with the Asian flu, we have Indonesian dimensional \nlumber beginning to hit the west coast at even well below our cost of \nproduction.\n  In the strongest terms, I urge Customs to begin doing the job that it \nis commanded to do by U.S. law and for which U.S. taxpayers are paying. \nCustoms must immediately issue a definitive, corrected ruling on \ndrilled lumber and implement the ruling at once--not 30 days, not 60 \ndays, not 17 months--but at once. It must also correct related \nmiscalculations regarding notched lumber that are also undermining the \nlumber agreement. Reported efforts by the administration to clarify \nwith Canada the Agreement's treatment of drilled and notched lumber do \nnot affect Customs' obligation to act in accordance with U.S. law and \npolicy. In fact, if Customs fails to act properly and reclassify this \nproduct, we can only expect more delay and more efforts at evasion in \nthe future. More broadly, the agency must vigorously enforce the \nagreement and help the U.S. lumber industry realize that full subsidy \noffset is exactly what they deserve.\n  Failure by Customs to proceed in conformity with U.S. law and policy \ncould have grave implications for other trade agreement programs. Just \nat a time when this country must awaken to not only the fairness of \ntrade, but the importance of trade, and the balance of it, the \nadministration is apparently moving in the other direction by ignoring \nit and allowing the flow of subsidized imports. The administration \npromised full and vigorous enforcement. With this loophole, it is not \nliving up to that commitment.\n  Trade agreements serve U.S. interests only if they are effective. If \nthe American people cannot trust the administration to maintain the \nintegrity or much less enforce such agreements, the administration \ncannot expect a continued mandate to pursue trade agreements. Here we \nare trying to, struggling to, get this administration the ability to \ndeal in trade, and they are simply doing the slow waltz at a time when \nit is costing this country hundreds of jobs, if not thousands.\n  Customs' mishandling of this important issue could also have \nbudgetary implications. The taxpayers should not be expected to fund \nactivities that actually worsen their position. Moreover, Congress \nshould reconsider who has authority to make and implement \nclassification decisions which can undermine our international trade \nagreements. In the context of countervailing duty and antidumping duty \ncases, the Commerce Department has direct authority to prevent these \ntypes of evasion. Perhaps we need to give USTR direct authority--and a \nmandate--to stop Customs from the twiddling of their fingers and their \nwilly-nilly attitude toward obeying and enforcing the law. ``Customs, \nI'm sorry, 17 months doesn't cut it.''\n  Mr. President, this is truly one of those situations that makes most \nAmericans outside the beltway just shake their heads in disbelief at \nour Government. I, and I know others in Congress, will demand drastic \nactions if this problem is not rectified in a prompt manner. I am \nsending a copy of this to Secretary Rubin, and I am going to ask other \nsenior Treasury officials to report to Congress immediately about the \nagency's intentions on this matter.\n  At a time when trade is of utmost importance to the producers in our \ncountry, we must recognize that balance is what really counts, and not \nallow industry or certain industries to die simply by arbitrary \ndecision or inaction on the part of Customs and other agencies of our \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A HISTORY OF SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on July 1st, concerned Americans will \ngather in Cranston, Rhode Island, for the second in what will be a \nseries of public meetings called the ``Great Social Security Debate.''\n  I want to thank the Concord Coalition, the American Association of \nRetired Persons, and Americans Discuss Social Security for sponsoring \nthis event.\n  The first forum, which took place last April 7th in Kansas City, \nMissouri, was a great success. The discussions in Rhode Island will no \ndoubt be equally compelling, especially given the focus of the debate: \n``Retirement in the 21st Century.''\n  It is with one eye to the 21st Century that I rise today to speak \nabout Social Security's past--to offer some perspective on its history \nand what we can learn from our attempts at social policy making.\n  In recent years, as more and more Americans become aware of its \nlooming financial and demographic crisis, Social Security is no longer \nthe ``third rail'' of American politics.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans have offered reform plans, including \nones that would set up individual retirement accounts--a suddenly \nmainstream idea that would have been considered heresy just a couple of \nyears ago.\n  Long before President Clinton's ``Save Social Security'' State of the\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\nUnion address, a national dialogue was already underway.\n  Summits, conferences, forums, and town hall meetings were organized \nto allow all Americans, old and young, to discuss Social Security and \nhow to reform it to benefit our nation and make retirement more secure \nfor current and future generations.\n  This democratic process will help us build a national consensus and \neventually find workable solutions to preserve and strengthen Social \nSecurity while providing freedom of choice for all Americans.\n  As we move forward, it is important to remember that history is a \nmirror--by looking through it we gain perspective and the wisdom it \nprovides, giving us the opportunity to avoid repeating mistakes. Nobel \nLaureate Friedrich Hayek says:\n\n       Political opinion and views about historical events ever \n     have been and always must be closely connected. Past \n     experience is the foundation on which our beliefs about the \n     desirability of different policies and institutions are \n     mainly based. . .\n       Yet we can hardly profit from past experience unless the \n     facts from which we draw our conclusions are correct.\n\n  A review of its history will provide a better understanding of the \norigin and evolution of our Social Security system. It will facilitate \nthe national debate on its reform and point us in the right direction.\n  For a time I would like to travel back in time. For hundreds, perhaps \nthousands of years, human society relied on families, relatives, or \nfriends to care for their elders.\n  For the unfortunate individuals who could not support themselves, or \ndid not have families to support them, the community provided \nassistance, in many cases through what were called the ``poor laws.''\n  The first compulsory social insurance programs on a national scale, \nincluding the programs that we call ``Social Security\" today, were \nestablished in Germany under Bismarck during the 1880s. Soon after, \nAustria and Hungary followed Germany by passing similar legislation.\n  England adopted national compulsory social insurance in 1911 and \ngreatly expanded it in 1948. After 1920, social insurance on a \ncompulsory basis was rapidly adopted throughout Europe and into the \nAmerican hemisphere.\n  The United States did not have a national social insurance program \nuntil 1935.\n  Today, more than 140 countries in the world have one form or another \nof a social security program.\n  Unfortunately, a recent World Bank study shows that most of these \nprograms are not sustainable in their present form. I will discuss this \nissue on another occasion.\n  It has been said that the industrial and agricultural revolution that \nbegan in the late 18th Century triggered social reform that shifted \nelderly-care from individuals and families to the state.\n  But empirical evidence is insufficient to support this statement, \nparticularly in the case of the United States.\n  Prior to 1929, the economic condition of the elderly in America was \nfairly secure: most owned their own homes and lived off labor income, \nwhich was supplemented by emerging private pension plans as well as \nlife insurance, savings, and family support.\n  The intellectual origin of social insurance, or as we call it, Social \nSecurity, comes in effect from an obscure group of scholars known as \nthe German historical school of economics.\n  Driven by their dislike of laissez-faire capitalism and fear for a \nMarxist-led revolution, a group of German-government employed \nprofessors desperately sought a middle ground to make peace with \nMarxists.\n  They pushed for large-scale welfare legislation that could, in their \nview, ease the social tension, keep social order and justice, and avoid \nproletariat revolutions.\n  One of the leading figures was Gustav Schmoller. Schmoller was \nsympathetic to the industrial proletariat, and hated what he called the \n``unethical'' striving for wealth by the property-owning classes.\n  He believed that the lower classes had a right to derive benefits \nfrom increased production through welfare legislation. He argued that \nunequal distribution of income was evil, and that government, not the \nindividual or the community, had the moral duty to help the proletariat \nmaintain equity and social harmony.\n  In the early 1870s, Schmoller set up the Congress for Social Reform. \nThe purpose was to draft, propose, and promote social legislation. \nLater, he and others created the Association of Socialpolitics as a \nforum to advocate social reform.\n  As a result of his effort, the Bismarck government passed the first \nwelfare laws in 1883 and old age insurance laws in 1889 in Germany.\n  Very few in this country have ever heard about the German Historical \nSchool of Economics, but it was this small group of intellectual elite \nhad a tremendous impact on American economic thought as well as public \npolicy making.\n  As thousands of young Americans went to Germany to study in the late \n19th century and early this century, many became disciples of the \nGerman Historical School of Economics and were indoctrinated by German \nwelfare capitalism.\n  The American students were urged by their German teachers to \ninfluence the course of politics in the U.S. and change American \nattitudes towards social legislation.\n  Now, these German-trained and educated economists--Adams, Clark, \nPatten, Seligman, and Ely--founded the American Economic Association in \n1885. That is the American counterpart of the German Association of \nSocialpolitics.\n  Edwin Gay, one of Schmoller's students, was a founder of the National \nBureau of Economic Research and created the journal, Foreign Affairs.\n  Recford Tugwell, a well-known American disciple of the German \nHistorical School of Economics, favored social legislation along the \nlines of the German welfare economists. Tugwell become influential \nunder President Roosevelt in the 1930s and exerted considerable \nlegislative influence under the New Deal.\n  Richard Ely, another important disciple of the German Historical \nSchool, established the American Association for Labor Legislation, \nlater named the American Association for Old-age Security. That \nlaunched the first American social insurance movement. He was even put \non trial by Wisconsin's superintendent of public instruction for \npropagating socialism in Wisconsin schools in 1894. Ely and John \nCommons succeeded in passing the old-age insurance legislation in \nWisconsin in 1925. That was among the first in this country.\n  Later, the Wisconsin model was used in drafting the federal Social \nSecurity legislation.\n  Now, despite their enthusiasm for social legislation, these German-\ntrained intellectuals were initially not successful in achieving their \ngoals in America.\n  Before 1929, there were no significant, broad-based demands for \ncompulsory, federal old-age insurance. In most states, elderly \nassistance was locally provided and administered through poor laws.\n  Private charity and town/county-controlled almshouses were the \nprimary sources for elderly assistance. In 1929, the New York \nCommission on Old-Age Security found that 90 percent of the elderly \npopulation were either self-supporting or were being supported by their \nfamilies and relatives.\n  Less than four percent depended on private charity or public \nassistance. Private pensions existed although they were not widespread \nin America before the era of the Great Depression.\n  During the Great Depression, when the stock market plunged 80 \npercent, 15 percent of the population began receiving some form of \npublic relief. This event gave tremendous momentum to social \nlegislation.\n  On June 8, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced his \nintention to provide a program for Social Security.\n  Subsequently, FDR created the Committee on Economic Security, which \nwas chaired by Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor, with four other \nmembers of the cabinet.\n  The committee was instructed to study the entire problem of economic \ninsecurity and to make recommendations that would serve as the basis \nfor legislation consideration by the Congress.\n  A number of university professors were called to staff the CES. \nAccording to the recollections of Professor Douglas Brown, a staff \nmember in the small,\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\nold-age security section of the CES, the major attention of the CES and \nits staff was focused on unemployment insurance, not old age insurance.\n  FDR, Perkins, and the CES director clearly had doubts about a \nnational old-age system. On a number of occasions it appeared unlikely \nthat the Committee would approve the old-age insurance system.\n  Because it was on the back burner, the old-age security section had a \nvery small staff and was left alone to work out a plan at its will.\n  Basically, two individuals, Barbara Armstrong of the University of \nCalifornia and Douglas Brown of Princeton, who pushed old-age insurance \nin the CES. The two actually drafted the U.S. Social Security plan in \nonly a month.\n  Their compulsory old-age insurance plan raised serious concerns about \nits constitutionality within the CES.\n  Even President Roosevelt, Labor Secretary Perkins, who was also the \nchairman of the CES, and Edwin Witte, the Executive Director of the \nCES, did not think this was the right time for a Social Security \nsystem.\n  But the intellectual elite within the CES pushed on. In November, \n1934, Armstrong asked her friend, Max Stern, who was in the Scripps-\nHoward newspaper chain to launch a sharply written editorial \ncriticizing Roosevelt's failure to give his wholehearted support to \nold-age insurance.\n  Roosevelt finally caved. From then on, old-age insurance moved to the \nfront burner at the CES.\n  The original proposals for the old-age insurance program drafted by \nthe CES staff allowed the states or private insurance companies to \nadminister the program.\n  But this was removed in later drafts. Douglas Brown later admitted \nthat the CES staff deliberately exaggerated the difficulties of \nestablishing separate state old-age insurance systems as an alternative \nto a federal system.\n  It is generally believed that the Great Depression made Social \nSecurity necessary for the American people.\n  The CES argued that the Great Depression had greatly exacerbated the \nplight of the elderly, that the elderly were among the first to lose \ntheir jobs, and that the effects of the Depression would be felt for a \nlong time to come since many families had seen their lifetime savings \nwiped out.\n  However, the Social Security proposal submitted to Congress fell far \nshort of dealing with this. The Social Security system started to \ncollect payroll taxes in 1937 but no benefits were distributed until \n1942. It took more than seven years for this elderly relief measure to \nbe effective--long after the Great Depression ended.\n  More recent studies have suggested the Depressions may not have \ndictated the establishment of a Social Security system.\n  For example, economists now believe that by examining the welfare of \nthe elderly outside the family context, reformers such as those \nstaffing the CES drew an exaggerated picture of the elderly's plight.\n  The 1935-36 data shows that per-capita household income peaked at \n$627 for persons aged 60 to 64, while for people aged 65 and over, \naverage per-capita income was only slightly lower, at $601.\n  In any event, the CES made its report to the President in early \nJanuary 1935, and on January 17, the President introduced the report in \nboth Houses of Congress for simultaneous consideration.\n  In less than seven months following its introduction, Congress passed \nand the President signed the Social Security Act into law.\n  The history of Congress' debates and consideration of this \nlegislation is of particular interest.\n  When drafting the compulsory old-age legislation, the CES felt that \nthe House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, \nwhich had jurisdiction over the issue, might not be sympathetic toward \nFDR's plan, so they created a special committee that would be headed by \nthe labor committees' chairmen.\n  Without showing much interest in the substance of social security, \nthe tax committees were concerned nonetheless with who should have \njurisdiction over it.\n  When it appeared he might be bypassed, Ways and Means Chairman Robert \nDoughton of North Carolina went to see FDR, whereupon the President \ntold Frances Perkins that bypassing the Ways and Means Committee would \nnever do.\n  He did not want to alienate Doughton and his Senate counterpart, Pat \nHarrison. Without especially liking the old-age insurance program, both \ncommittee chairmen stood loyally by it, perhaps in return for having \nbeen left in charge.\n  Instead of being put into a new committee, the chairmen of these \ncommittees, the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means, did not want \nto feel that they were being bypassed, so they pledged their loyalty in \norder to keep jurisdiction in their committees over these plans.\n  Once the Economic Security bill was introduced, both chambers began \nhearings immediately, and it took less than a month for the committees \nto complete its work on the bill. Nearly 100 people testified--but most \nof them were either government officials or friends of the CES. The \ngeneral public and opponents of the bill, particularly employer groups, \nwere not well represented. Again, according to CES Director Edwin \nWitte, the employer groups ``simply knew too little to take any active \nrole.'' So did the public.\n  In other words, the employers and the public knew too little, so they \nonly invited certain people to testify before their committees in \nsupport of the new Social Security program.\n  The Economic Security Legislation contained many titles. In an ``all-\nor-none'' strategy, FDR smartly tied old-age insurance with the old-age \nassistance program.\n  If not for the needed program to aid the elderly poor, the old-age \ninsurance would have never gone through the Congress, according Edwin \nWitte.\n  Nevertheless, there was no shortage of opposition to the bill in the \nHouse.\n  In fact, the old-age insurance title was nearly stricken from the \nbill in the House Ways and Means Committee and again on the House \nfloor, where an amendment to strike the program mustered a third of the \nvotes cast.\n  Congressman Allen Treadway, the ranking Republican member of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, called old-age insurance the ``worst \ntitle in the bill. . . a burdensome tax on industry.''\n  Congressman Daniel Reed pointed out that neither old-age insurance \nnor unemployment compensation were ``relief provisions and they are not \ngoing to bring any relief to the destitute or needy now nor for many \nyears to come.''\n  When the Senate began debate on the legislation, the old-age \ninsurance program became even more controversial. Many senators from \nboth sides of the aisle seriously questioned how un-Americaness this \ncompulsory old-age insurance plan was. So there were a lot of questions \nand concerns at that time in Congress over these proposals.\n  Some worried about the extremely high cost of the program and the \nheavy tax burden it would impose on the American people.\n  Some doubted the finance mechanism, and predicted the funding could \nnot be sustained. Some pointed out how unwise it was to have the \nfederal government, instead of states and private companies, run the \nplan.\n\n  Some were concerned that, as an emergency measure to respond to the \ndifficult days of the Great Depression, the plan would turn into a \npermanent program over which the Congress had no control.\n  Some criticized the discriminative nature of the legislation against \nthe young and higher-wage earners. Some questioned the morality of the \ncurrent generation passing the burden to future generations.\n  Unfortunately, many of their prophecies have become reality today.\n  The major battle on the Economic Security Legislation was fought over \nthe Clark amendment.\n  Senator Bennett Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, recognized the \nincome-redistribution and non-competitive nature of the old-age \ninsurance program and decided to amend it by allowing companies with \nprivate pensions to opt out of the public program.\n  Any employer could stay out of the Social Security program if they \nhad a pension plan that offered benefits comparable to the federal \nprogram. Workers would be given the freedom to choose either the \nfederal Social Security program or a private pension plan offered by \ntheir companies.\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\n  Clark argued that if the purpose of the old-age insurance program was \nto provide pensions based on earnings and contributions, not to \nredistribute income, the private sector was perfectly capable of \nperforming this function. Unearned benefits, not competition, were the \nsource of the problem.\n  The proponents of the Economic Security Bill feared that if the Clark \namendment passed, it would encourage private competition and put the \nfederal-run program at a disadvantage.\n  That is the market at work. Again, those who were proponents of the \nSocial Security plan did not like the Clark amendment because they \nthought it would encourage private competition and it would put the \nFederal run program at a disadvantage.\n  Competition would eventually undermine and destroy the Social \nSecurity program, they argued.\n  The Clark amendment was narrowly defeated in the Senate Finance \nCommittee by a tied vote, but was adopted on the Senate floor by a wide \nmargin of 51 to 35. Considering FDR's veto threat and the two-to-one \nratio of Democrats/Republicans in the Senate, this was indeed a very \nsignificant vote.\n  Subsequently, the Senate passed the Economic Security bill, including \nthe Clark amendment, by a vote of 77-6. However, the amendment became a \nsticking point once the bill reached conference.\n  House conferees strongly opposed the amendment on the grounds that it \nwould ruin the federal program, but Senate conferees refused to concede \non this matter.\n  The conference dragged on for weeks. At the end, FDR ordered the \nSenate Democrat conferees to agree to the House position, and because \nmany conferees feared that the much-needed old-age assistance might be \ndelayed by the Clark amendment, they agreed to drop the amendment.\n  The concession was that the Administration promised to further study \nthe idea of contracting out of Social Security.\n  There would be a special joint legislative committee to work on \nlegislation based on the Clark amendment and submit it to Congress for \nconsideration during the next session. With that understanding, the \nCongress approved the conference report. FDR signed it into law on \nAugust 14, 1935. The promised special committee and the Clark \nlegislation, of course, never happened.\n\n  In her book, ``The Roosevelt I Knew'', Frances Perkins recorded an \ninteresting conversation she had with Senator Al Gore, Sr., of \nTennessee:\n  ``I remember that when I appeared before the Senate Committee old \nSenator Gore raised a sarcastic objection. `Isn't this Socialism?'\n\n       ``My reply was, `Oh, no.'\n       Then, smiling, leaning forward and talking to me as though \n     I were a child, he said, `Isn't this a teeny-weeny bit of \n     Socialism?' ''\n\n  Despite her denial, Senator Gore may have made a point. Professor \nTheresa McMahon, a member of the Social Security Council, put it more \nbluntly by saying at that time: `` I don't mind taxing the bachelors. . \n.I think they ought to take on the responsibility of sharing their \nincome with somebody else.''\n  On January 31, 1940, the Social Security system started to distribute \nthe payroll taxes the government had collected in the past three years \nto those who never paid any tax into the system. The first monthly \nretirement check was issued to Ida May Fuller of Ludlow, Vermont, in \nthe amount of $22.54. Miss Fuller died in January of 1975 at the age of \n100. During her 35 years as a beneficiary, she received over $20,000 in \nbenefits and paid in nothing.\n  In the 60 years following its creation, and despite continued \ncriticism, the Social Security program has grown dramatically in size \nand scope. As more beneficiaries and programs are added, the payroll \ntax has been raised 51 times.\n  Congress 51 different times has gone back either to raise the tax on \nSocial Security, or to expand the income on which that was to be taxed.\n  As an example, in 1940, an American worker earning the maximum \ntaxable wage paid $70 in payroll tax. That is $675 in inflation-\nadjusted dollars. Today, that same worker would pay a Social Security \npayroll tax of $8,481.\n  So the maximum in 1940 in today's dollars would have been $675. The \nmaximum today is nearly $8,500. Meanwhile, the number of workers per \nretiree has dropped from 100 in 1942 to two today, and the unfunded \nliabilities of the program have become unbearable for future \ngenerations.\n\n  Since the enactment of the 1935 Social Security Act, many changes \nhave taken place to expand the program.\n  Major changes include the 1939 amendment, which was initiated by \nSocial Security officials and greatly expanded the program. It required \nthe payment of benefits to the spouse and minor children of a retired \nworker, and survivor benefits to the family in the event of the \npremature death of a covered worker.\n  It also increased benefit amounts and accelerated the start of \nmonthly benefit payments from 1942 to 1940. The 1939 amendment \nofficially set up the pay-as-you-go scheme which uses today's tax to \npay today's benefits, leaving unfunded liabilities to future \ngenerations.\n  A 1950 amendment accelerated the benefits schedules and extended \nSocial Security coverage to the self-employed. In 1952, all Social \nSecurity beneficiaries received a general ``cost-of-living'' increase.\n  The Social Security Amendments of 1954 expanded the old-age insurance \nto a disability insurance program.\n  Another major change was made in 1956.\n  The 1956 amendment expanded Social Security coverage to more classes \nof workers, increased the wage base substantially, and increased \nbenefits by 77 percent.\n  In 1965, Medicare, a new social insurance program that extended \nhealth coverage to retirees, was added to the Social Security system. \nIn the 1970s, another new program, Supplemental Security Income, was \nadded.\n  The 1950s and 1960s were the golden age for Social Security because \nthe fund revenue was greatly increased by growing employment and rising \nwage rates. Social Security officials repeatedly assured the Congress \nthat Social Security would maintain long-term actuarial balances.\n  Ronald Reagan saw the defects of the system and was the first to \nsuggest investing Social Security funds in the market. As early as \n1964, Reagan asked: ``Can we introduce voluntary features that would \npermit a citizen to do better on his own, to be excused upon \npresentation of evidence that he had made provisions for the non-\nearning years?''\n  Reagan's advice was cast aside. But in 1975, Social Security first \nbegan running larger long-term deficits. Its expenditures exceeded \nincome by $1.5 billion. The pay-as-you-go finance mechanism started \ncracking and was unable to produce large windfall gains to retirees.\n  In 1977 and 1983, Congress had no choice but to pass Social Security \nrescue packages by significantly increasing taxes. Again Washington \nclaimed the fix would make Social Security solvent for at least 75 \nyears. Again, that was a lie.\n  Today, Social Security faces the severest crisis yet. When 74 million \nbaby boomers begin retiring in 2008, Social Security will run a cash \nshortage in 2013 and go broke in 2031, according to official \nprojections. Knowing the ``reliability'' of these official forecasts, \nthe shortage could arrive much earlier.\n  Without a policy change, the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthe debt held by the public will balloon to nearly $80 trillion, from \ntoday about $5.6 trillion in debt. But without a policy change, \nbeginning with Social Security, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the debt held by the public could balloon to as much as \n$80 trillion. And General Accounting Office estimates that it could be \neven worse. The General Accounting Office says it could be a $158 \ntrillion debt. This is very, very serious.\n\n  Mr. President, that covers the history of Social Security. Now, what \ncan we learn from our past policy making experiences?\n  First, the Social Security system was put together in just a few \nweeks without thorough debate and time to consider such a major policy \nchange.\n  It was imposed on the American people following a time of economic \ncrisis and despair by a few individuals who had a personal agenda of \nredistributing private income.\n  At the time it passed, few people understood the long-term impact of \nthe program on the citizens. It was hardly a democratic process.\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\n  Second, a retirement program that mixes insurance with welfare does \nnot work, because these two functions are fundamentally incompatible.\n  As a result, we have a bad welfare plan and a bad old-age insurance \nplan which make the system much more inefficient for those who need \nwelfare assistance as well as those who need retirement security.\n  It does not work because it is based on the false assumption that \npeople no longer have to work to achieve the American dream--the \ngovernment will take care of them.\n  Third, when we consider Social Security, policy--not politics--should \nbe our guide. Changes made for short term gain will come back to haunt \nus.\n  Fourth, the federal government does not have a good record of running \nsocial insurance programs. We should look for ways to improve and \nstreamline the program.\n  Fifth, we should begin to look to the ingenuity and competitive \nspirit of the private sector to improve and rejuvenate the program.\n  The American people should have some freedom of choice. Each \nindividual has different abilities and different needs at different \ntimes; they should be free to choose either the current compulsory \ninsurance plan or their own individual retirement accounts.\n  The individual retirement account is not a new idea. A majority in \nCongress supported this idea 60 years ago. Sixty years ago the Clark \namendment, the individual retirement account, was supported by the vast \nmajority in Congress--60 years ago. Had we adopted the Clark amendment \nthen, our Social Security system would be in much better shape today.\n  And it is not too late, because Congress should take Senator Clark's \nadvice by allowing people to opt out of the Social Security system and \ngiving individual workers the right to fund and control the investment \nof their own retirement accounts.\n  With today's mature and well-regulated financial markets, every \nAmerican, rich or poor, can greatly improve their retirement security. \nWe must provide the options to ensure that Americans can provide for \ntheir retirement, not just pass an increasing liability on to their \nchildren and grandchildren. If we don't make this change, we are going \nto pass to our children a national debt somewhere between $80- and $160 \ntrillion. We need to pass on the ability for our children and \ngrandchildren to make those decisions for themselves.\n  Finally, we need to educate and inform the public about Social \nSecurity. We should encourage more people to participate in the \npolicymaking process. We need to encourage them to understand how \noptions can actually help them enjoy their retirement. A well-informed \ngeneral public will not be deceived by political rhetoric and will be \nable to decide what is the best option for them. They can make that \ndecision best for themselves.\n  So, Mr. President, with the perspective offered by the past, I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in the months to come in my efforts to improve \nretirement security for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may consume \nas much time as I require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 11 months ago, this body resoundingly passed \nS. Res. 98, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, cosponsored by the \ndistinguished Senator who presently presides over the Senate, the \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, and myself. The Byrd-Hagel Resolution \nsent a strong message to the Administration regarding the then-\nimpending Kyoto Protocol. The Resolution directed the Administration \nnot to submit the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for its advice and \nconsent until developing countries, especially the largest emitters, \nmake ``new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions'' similar to those to which developed nations would be \nbound if the Protocol were implemented. The resolution also called on \nthe Administration to show that such a Protocol ``would not result in \nserious harm to the economy of the United States.''\n\n  In anticipation of the President's trip to China, I recently sent a \nletter to him urging him to use his influence to persuade the Chinese \nto take ``a progressive leadership role among the developing world'' so \nthat we can begin to fully address this complex and serious issue. I \nnoted that, ``after 2015, China is expected to surpass the United \nStates as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. While the \nChinese contribution to global emissions in 1995 was 11 percent, it is \nexpected to reach 17 percent by percent by 2035. In that same time \nperiod, the U.S. emissions will shrink from 22 percent to 15 percent.''\n  While the international effort to bring China on board may seem like \na difficult task, it is still possible if we seek win-win \nopportunities. While China has taken a number of steps to clean up its \nown environment, China's domestic efforts must increase given the \nserious nature of their environmental problems. I urged the President \nto encourage China to support the market mechanisms that were \nsuccessfully incorporated in the Protocol by the Administration's \nnegotiators.\n  Through flexible, market-based mechanisms, we have a tremendous \nopportunity to work with the developing world, allowing for economic \ngrowth and also reducing world, allowing for economic growth and also \nreducing global greenhouse gas emissions. As I have previously said, \nthe United States and the rest of the developed world is not attempting \nto limit the economic growth of China or any other developing nation. \nChina has the right to develop economically. But, based on the growing \nbody of evidence and the potential consequences of increasing \ngreenhouse gas concentrations, all economic development should be done \nin a responsible manner. The Chinese must recognize the importance of \ntheir role, and they should not ignore their responsibilities in \naddressing this shared problem. Global warming is a global problem. It \nis not just an American problem. It is not just a European problem. It \nis a global problem. And as such, it requires not just an American \nsolution, not just a European solution, but a global solution.\n\n  I wrote the President stating that, ``the combination of these \nefforts would be the right course of action and underscores how the \nChinese could accept binding commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas \nemissions. Taken together, these steps would lead to a real reduction \nin emissions as well as global participation in the Kyoto Protocol.''\n  Mr. President, I believe we should challenge the Administration to \nrecognize the concerns of the Senate and the American people with \nregard to the Kyoto Protocol and its possible impact on the U.S. \neconomy, but in saying this, I am also willing to seek a constructive \ndialogue focusing on addressing this important issue. Of all the \nsignificant concerns that the President will discuss with the Chinese \nduring his visit, I believe that this is one of the most critical for \nthe long-term relationship of both our nations. We have to begin to \nwork together because our shared environmental futures are at stake, \nand the well-being of our people's futures--these are at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7247-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7247-S7248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENATOR COATS AND THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on another item, I take this opportunity to \nspeak about him during his absence, and I am referring to the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats.\n  Mr. Coats will be leaving the Senate after this year. He is \nvoluntarily doing so. He is a very able member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I serve on that committee with Senator Coats. He is \nvery knowledgeable about national defense, about military matters. He \ntakes his responsibilities seriously. He is extremely articulate in his \nexposition of the problems and the defense needs of our country, and he \nis quite influential among the other members of the committee and of \nthe\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nSenate on both sides of the aisle as well.\n  I admire him. He was a very dedicated protagonist--a very dedicated \nprotagonist of the line-item veto, and it was on those occasions when \nwe would debate back and forth between us, and among us on both sides \nof the aisle, that I learned to respect Senator Coats--learned to \nrespect him for his ability to debate, for his equanimity, always, in \ndebate. He is always most charitable, very deferential, and courteous \nto a fault. He has always treated me fairly and kindly. On yesterday, \nwhen we discussed the Supreme Court's decision--which I favored, and \nwhich did not follow the viewpoint of Mr. Coats--Mr. Coats was most \nmagnanimous in his words concerning those of us who opposed the line-\nitem veto.\n  So, basically he is a gentleman, and what more can one say? A \ngentleman; he considers the views of others, he listens to the words of \nothers patiently and with respect, and is much to be admired. I admire \nhim.\n  He has indicated, along with Senator McCain, that it is his--it is \ntheir intention to come forward with another proposal. And of course I \nwill respect their viewpoint and listen to what they have to say and \nread carefully what they propose, and will again oppose anything that \npurports to shift the people's power over the purse as reflected by \ntheir elected Representatives in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives--shift that power to any President.\n  Yesterday was a great day in the history of our Nation, an \nexceedingly important day, because, beginning with President Grant \nafter the Civil War, all Presidents, with the exception of William \nHoward Taft, have endorsed and espoused the line-item veto. For much \nlonger than a single century, Presidents have wanted the line-item \nveto. George Washington, the first and greatest President of all \nPresidents, in my viewpoint, recognized the Constitution for what it \nwas and for what it is. He said that when he signed a bill, he had to \nsign it or veto it in toto, he had to accept it or veto it in its \nentirety.\n  Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention that met in \nPhiladelphia in 1787. He presided. He listened to all of the debates. \nHe, obviously, listened and joined in the conversations that went on in \nthe back rooms and the meeting places of Members when they were not in \nconvention session. He knew what their thoughts were. He knew what \nMadison's thoughts were; he knew what Hamilton's ideas were; he knew \nwhat Elbridge Gerry's feelings were; he knew what Governor Edmund \nRandolph's ideas were. But George Washington knew that that \nConstitution did not allow, it did not permit, it did not give the \nline-item veto to any President.\n  I am grateful to the majority on the Supreme Court for having acted \nto save us from our own folly. I am somewhat disappointed and amazed \nthat there would even be a minority on the Supreme Court on this issue. \nI cannot comprehend a minority of the Members of the Supreme Court \nseeing any way other than as the majority saw it. I voted against \nClarence Thomas to go on the Supreme Court, but Mr. Justice Thomas \nyesterday saw clearly what the Constitution requires.\n  Who yesterday stood to defend this unique system of checks and \nbalances and separation of powers? Clarence Thomas was one of the six. \nHe redeemed himself in great measure, in one Senator's eyes--my own! I \nwas proud of Chief Justice Rehnquist who agreed with Mr. Justice \nStevens in the majority opinion. I was proud of Mr. Justice Kennedy in \nhis concurring opinion.\n  For the first time, Congress had committed this colossal error of \nshifting to the President a power over the purse that he does not have \nunder the Constitution. Congress failed the people of the United \nStates, in whom all power in this Republic resides and from whom all \npower is given. And the Senate failed. For the first time in more than \na century and a quarter, the Congress yielded to political impulses and \ngave to the President a share in the control of the purse that the \nConstitution does not give him.\n  For those who have read Madison, who have read the Federalist essays, \nthey saw in Federalist 58 Madison's words when he said, ``This power \nover the purse may in fact be regarded as the most complete and \neffectual weapon with which any Constitution can arm the immediate \nrepresentatives of the people for obtaining a redress of every \ngrievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary \nmeasure.'' Those are Madison's words.\n  So, Mr. President, where are our eyes? Read the Federalist essays, \nread the debates that took place in the convention--according to \nMadison's notes and the notes of others who attended that convention. \nWhere could we possibly imagine that that Constitution gives to us puny \npygmies--the power and the authority or the right to attempt to end run \nthe Constitution by giving to the President the line-item veto by \nstatute?\n  What a shame. What a shame. How would those framers look upon us? But \nthe framers wisely provided for that eventuality when they created the \njudiciary. And our forebears in the first Senate, which met in 1789, \nalso provided for that eventuality when they enacted the Judiciary Act \nand created the court system.\n  I am a more exalted admirer of the Supreme Court today than I have \never been in my 29,439 days of life. It isn't my birthday; I have just \nlived 29,439 days. I keep count of my days, take my life one day at a \ntime--29,439 days. And yesterday I became a more enthusiastic and avid \nadmirer of the Supreme Court of the United States than ever before \nbecause, to me, this, this decision by the Court preserved the system \nof checks and balances and separation of powers.\n  So God bless America. God bless this honorable Court.\n  I also pause to thank those 28 other Senators who, on March the 23th, \n1995, stood with me in voting against that inimical, perverse Line-Item \nVeto Act that sought to give the line-item veto to the President of the \nUnited States.\n  And I thank those 30 other Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nstood with me in voting against the conference report on that \nlegislation, the Line-Item Veto Act, on March the 27th, 1996, a year \nand 4 days later. That was when the Senate stabbed itself in the back. \nThose 31 who stood in defense of the constitutional system of checks \nand balances and separation of powers on that day, those 31 were \nvindicated by the Supreme Court's decision on yesterday.\n  Thank God for the United States of America!\n  God save the Supreme Court of the United States!\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7247-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7248-S7251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOURTH OF JULY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on still another note, it seems like such a \nshort time ago that we rang in the New Year. It is almost July, and the \nmidpoint of the year has passed. How quickly we have gone from gray \nskies, lowering clouds, and seemingly incessant rain, with some snow, \nsome hail, strong winds, to bright sunshine and the first fruits and \nvegetables of the season. Already the brief moment of the wild \nstrawberries, those tender morsels of condensed sunshine and spring \nshowers, has passed, but juicy blackberries are ripening along their \nprotective bramble arches, ready for picking in time to fill a pie that \nmay grace a festive Fourth of July picnic. In West Virginia, whole \nfamilies can be spotted, buckets in hand, along the fence rows where \nbrambles grow, especially those old rail fences, gathering blackberries \nfor pies and jam. Of course, the younger the picker, the more \nblackberries that end up inside the picker rather than inside the \nbucket, but that is just one of the messy, finger-staining joys of \nsummertime. And the fingers are stained, as are the lips and the chins \nand the drippings on the clothing.\n  When I think of the Fourth of July, visions of family picnics crowned \nby the very literal fruits of that berry-picking labor are among the \nmany happy thoughts that surface. Like that blackberry pie topped with \nmelting vanilla ice cream, Fourth of July memories are a sweet blend of \nsmall town parades with volunteer firemen in brightly polished trucks \nand high school marching bands bedecked in their finest regalia; of \nlocal beauty queens sharing convertibles with waving mayors and \nCongressmen and Senators; and flags . . . flags everywhere, waving in \nthe sweaty palms of excited youngsters and proudly flying before houses \non\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nquiet side streets where no parade will ever pass, but where grandpa \nmight sit on the porch in his World War II service cap and wave to the \npassing neighbors. That is the American scene.\n  Although cheapened by holiday sales that commercialize the occasion, \nlike all holidays, the Fourth of July has somehow remained triumphantly \nabove it all, like the flag so gallantly flying over Fort McHenry that \ninspired Francis Scott Key to write ``The Star Spangled Banner.'' More \nfamilies and friends gather for picnics or reunions and an evening \nspent watching fireworks than spend the day in the mall and the evening \nbefore the television set. Most people still know that the Fourth of \nJuly celebrates the declaration of our nation's independence from Great \nBritain, though other historical facts concerning our battle for \nfreedom and the establishment of our government are fuzzy though these \nare facts, and out of focus but not the Fourth of July. Most people \nconsider themselves patriotic, though I suspect that a substantial \npercentage could not clearly define what it means to them to be a \npatriot.\n  To be a patriot is much, much more than to be a fan of, say, a \nfootball team. To root for one's country is part of being a patriot, \nbut that support can be shallow, like the hurrah of a sports fan that \nturns all too quickly to boos--boos, b-o-o-s--when the team's record \nloses a certain winning luster. Those cheers, those hurrahs, change to \nboos, b-o-o-s. It might have been some other spelling of ``booze'' \nimbibed during the game. We will leave that for another day. To be a \npatriot is to reach into the deep current that has carried our nation \nthrough history, and not be distracted by the ephemeral eddies of \nscandal that ripple the surface. To be certain, a part of that \ndefinition is the quiet willingness to set aside one's own plans and \ndon the uniform of a nation that calls for your service. But one need \nnot only wear a uniform to be a patriot. Nor is it enough simply to pay \nyour taxes, obey the speed limit, and memorize the pledge of \nallegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the \nrepublic--not the democracy--to the republic for which it stands, one \nnation, under God.\n\n  I am proud of the fact that I was a member of the other body, and I'm \nthe only Member of Congress who still serves in the Congress of the \nUnited States who was present there when the words ``under God'' were \nincluded in the Pledge of Allegiance on June 7, 1954.\n  Interestingly, exactly 1 year from that day, on June 7, 1955, the \nHouse of Representatives--I was a member of the House at that time--the \nHouse of Representatives enacted legislation providing for these words \n``In God We Trust'' to appear on the currency and the coin of the \nUnited States. Those words had appeared on some of the coins previous \nto that time, but on June 7, 1955, the House enacted legislation \nproviding that the currency and the coin of the United States would \ncarry the words ``In God We Trust.''\n  To be a patriot involves understanding, appreciating, and protecting \nthat which gives our Nation its unique spot on the compass of the \nworld--our Constitution. It has been much in the news the last 24 \nhours. And that cannot be condensed onto a bumper sticker.\n\n  In establishing a government that adroitly balances the minority \nagainst the majority, the small or less populous States against the \nlarger, the executive against the legislative against the judicial, and \nthat preserves individual liberty and opportunity, our Founding Fathers \ntruly delivered on the promise embodied in the Fourth of July. The \nDeclaration of Independence was a clarion call in the wilderness, a \ndefiant shout down the echoing canyons of history, saying, ``We can do \nbetter.'' The Constitution gave that call that was issued in the \nDeclaration of Independence substance, and the more than 200 years of \nhistory since that time have done little to erode the triumph of that \nachievement.\n  The Constitution of the United States of America is a remarkably \ncompact document. This is it--this little, tiny document. Of course, \nthis particular booklet also contains the Declaration of Independence. \nBut that is it. That is the Constitution of the United States. Think of \nthe struggles, think of the sacrifices of men and women, think of the \nbattles, think of April 19 when Captain Parker stood on the greens at \nLexington with his men and bared their breasts to the British redcoats, \nand then at Concord, and then Bunker Hill, and King's Mountain. And \nthink of the battles during the War of 1812, on the sea, on the land, \nthe carnage, the blood that was shed in the Civil War by men on both \nsides, who fought for the Union and who fought against the Union. All \nof these, and more, gave their lives.\n  The Constitution still lives! The men who wrote the Declaration of \nIndependence--Jefferson, Franklin, Sherman, Adams, Livingston--their \nlives were at risk. Their lives were at risk. They could have been \nhanged. That was treason--treason--to write that Declaration of \nIndependence! They could have been taken to England and tried and \nexecuted there. That was treason! Think of the sacrifices that have \ngone into the creation of that little booklet--the history, the events, \nthe treasures that were at risk, the fortunes that were lost, the lives \nthat were lost, the blood that was shed, the families that were \ndestroyed, the properties that were confiscated--all of these and more.\n  What did we get out of it? We got this--the Constitution of the \nUnited States! The Constitution's beginnings go back for years, for \ndecades, for centuries, back a thousand years. American \nconstitutionalism began at Runnymede on the banks of the Thames in June \n1215 and before. It had its roots in the English struggle when \nEnglishmen shed their blood at the point of a sword in their efforts to \nwrest from tyrannical monarchs the power of the purse.\n  So there it is. That little document is all we got out of it. But \nwhat that contains! More than the Magna Carta. That is what we will be \ncelebrating on the 4th of July--that Declaration of Independence and \nthat Constitution. Too soon we have forgotten, haven't we? This is a \nremarkable document. Every schoolchild ought to study it, and every \nschoolchild ought to be required to memorize it.\n  The Law of the Twelve Tables, created in Rome in the year 450 B.C. A \ndelegation was sent to Athens to study the laws of Solon--that \nremarkable man who is one of the seven wise men of Greece--to study the \nlaws and to bring back to Rome the ideas and the provisions that could \nbe put into a law, which the Plebeians would understand as well as the \nPatricians. The delegation went in 454 B.C., and they came back to Rome \nand began this work in 451 B.C. In 450, they completed the work: The \nLaw of the Twelve Tables. They inscribed these laws on tables, and \nthose tables were destroyed in the year 390 B.C. by Brennus and the \nGauls. The Gauls conquered Rome and destroyed much of it and, along \nwith it, destroyed the Law of the Twelve Tables.\n\n  But so what? Cicero said that the young people had been required to \nmemorize the Law of the Twelve Tables, and therefore, even though the \nGauls destroyed the Twelve Tables, the Law of the Twelve Tables lived \non in the memories of the schoolchildren. Hence, the Romans hadn't lost \nthe Law of the Twelve Tables. The Schoolchildren had been required to \nmemorize the Law of the Twelve Tables.\n  Cicero also had this to say about the Constitution:\n\n       It is necessary for a Senator to be thoroughly acquainted \n     with the Constitution, without which no Senator can possibly \n     be fit for his office.\n  Those who wish to find that quotation may look in Blackstone, the \nfirst book of Blackstone, section 1, paragraph #10, I believe it is. \nBlackstone quotes Cicero and what Cicero said about the Constitution.\n  This is it. Let us all think about that on the 4th of July. Let us \nthink about those who pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their \nsacred honor for that document. It is not lengthy. What does it weigh? \nPut it on the scale. Put it on the scales of time, on the scales of \nhistory, on the scales of liberty. Its weight cannot be measured.\n  Every schoolchild ought to study this, and every adult ought to know \nso instinctively that any challenge to the balance of powers outlined \nin this document should be instantly identified and resisted. If only \ncultural antibodies could be developed that would allow the people of \nthis Nation to acquire an immunity, and would allow the Members of this \nbody and the other body of\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\nthe Congress today and forevermore to acquire an immunity, to \nconstitutional cancer--it is a vaccine that I would gladly take. Then, \nperhaps, I and others like me would not have to struggle so hard to \nexcise the melanomas of balanced budget amendments and line-item acts \nthat periodically threaten to overturn the safeguards established by \nthe Framers to ensure that the people and their elected representatives \nhave recourse against an ambitious power grab by the executive, or by \nany political party.\n  Like the wild strawberries and blackberries that sweeten a country \nstroll on a Sunday afternoon, our republican form of government is a \nnatural treasure of a generous and bountiful land. But, like the \ndelicate wild beauties of vine and bramble which are too easily \noverlooked amid the garish profusion of plenty that surrounds us, so \nmust we be alert to often subtle presence of Constitutional safeguards \nembodied in our complex profusion of laws and governmental structures. \nWe must guard against a complacency that would trample them under foot \nor mow them down in a fervor of thoughtless modernization for the sake \nof change or in the name of some soul-less efficiency.\n  This Fourth of July--this Fourth of July--let us put aside for a \nmoment the bright display of fireworks, the inspiring ring of martial \nmusic, and listen for the timeless song of our past. Listen for the \ncourage and determination in the solemn opening paragraphs of the \nDeclaration of Independence where it is said:\n  ``When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one \npeople to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with \nanother, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and \nequal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle \nthem, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they \nshould declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n  ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of \nHappiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted \namong Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the \ngoverned,--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of \nthese ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and \nto institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles \nand organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most \nlikely to effect their Safety and Happiness.''\n  Mr. President, on July 4, 1776, the thirteen united states of America \ncommitted themselves to a bold new course, at great risk. It is no \nsmall thing to break away from centuries of tradition, in the face of \noverwhelming military might, and the opening paragraphs of the \nDeclaration of Independence make it clear that our Founding Fathers \nknew full well the seriousness and the risks of the course they had \nembarked upon. They recognized the challenge laid out for them in \nestablishing a new and better form of government.\n  This Fourth of July, I will happily watch the parades and the \nfireworks and, with luck, perhaps enjoy with my wife of 61 years and my \ndaughters of many years and my grandchildren of several years a piece \nof blackberry pie with ice cream.\n  But I will also take the time to pull out my little copy of the \nConstitution that I carry with me, near to my heart. I will take a few \nminutes to marvel again at the skill and economy with which the Framers \noutlined a government that has so well provided for our nation through \nthe centuries. We who enjoy the freedom, the independence, the \nsecurity, and the prosperity of 1998, owe a great debt of gratitude for \nthe courage and the commitment of those patriots of 1776, and an equal \ndebt to the men, some of them the same individuals, who followed \nthrough on that promise in the Constitutional Convention of 1789. We \nhonor them best, I think, by preserving their legacy for the patriots \nof the 21st Century, our children and grandchildren.\n  The legacy bequeathed to us in trust to our children and \ngrandchildren is, Mr. President--I say to the very distinguished \npatriotic Senator, who is from Wyoming, and who graces the Presiding \nOfficer's chair in the Chamber today--simply the most richly endowed \nnation on the face of the Earth--rich in land, in opportunity, in \nliberty.\n  We are the inheritors of plenty, thank God, merciful Providence. I \nhave had the great fortune to travel widely during my life. I have \nvisited with kings, queens, shahs, prime ministers, presidents, and \npremiers of many lands. I have seen the beauties of Europe, the \nmysteries of the Orient, the crumbling ruins of once-mighty empires in \nthe Middle East. They have all left me with wonderful memories and \ngreat stories. But when I travel, I pine for home.\n  I took a trip around the world along with six colleagues in the House \nof Representatives in 1955. That was 43 years ago. We traveled around \nthe world in an old Constellation. We traveled for 68 days. That would \nhave been called a junket today. We were a subcommittee of the House \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs. And so I traveled in many wonderful \nlands, but the most beautiful sight that I saw in that entire 68 days, \nhaving seen the Taj Mahal, having seen Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan, having \nseen the other wonders and beauties of the world and of nature, the \nmost inspiring and gratifying thing that I saw were the two little \nbright red lights flashing at the top of the Washington Monument when \nwe returned to the good old United States of America. We had been in \nlands where there was no fresh, clean water to be drawn from the \nfaucets. We so much take America for granted today, but what a \nwonderful experience it was anew to be able upon our return to go back \nto a faucet and see come from that faucet water--clear, pure, good \nwater--that we could drink without fear of becoming ill. So I have been \nleft with many wonderful memories, but never shall I forget those two \nred lights at the top of the monument to the greatest President of the \ngreatest country in the world, the Washington Monument.\n  I miss when I travel the comforting presence of friendly West \nVirginia faces, the soft breeze that carries their cheerful hellos, the \nwarm smiles that brighten the day and lift my heart. I think that I \nnever appreciate home so much as when I am away from it. I suspect that \nyou, Mr. President, and most Americans feel that way, too. That great \npoet Henry Van Dyke certainly did, and he used his facility with words \nto capture the feeling in his poem, ``America For Me.''\n\n     `Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,--\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in \n           Rome\n     But when it comes to living there is just no place like home.\n\n     I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day\n     In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way!\n\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack:\n     The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,--\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars!\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \nabsence or presence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nfine men and women of the United States Air Force, who honored my great \nstate and her great people by naming the 19th operational B-2 Stealth \nBomber, The Spirit of Mississippi. I saw the B-2 fly--and it filled me, \nand all those who participated in the naming ceremony, with enormous \npride.\n  The dedication of this magnificent aircraft took place in a moving \nceremony on Saturday, May 23rd, in Jackson, Mississippi. The ceremony \ntook on additional meaning for all those who joined me since it came at \nthe start of the Memorial Day weekend, when we honor those who \nsacrificed so much for the defense of our great nation.\n  The ceremony included a number of great Americans. General Richard \nHawley, the Commander of the Air Force's Air Combat Command, chose \nMississippi as the name to grace this aircraft as she serves to deter \nour enemies for decades to come. Also participating in the ceremony was \nMr. Kent Kresa, the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of \nNorthrop Grumman, the company that built this technological wonder with \nthe help of the skilled people and companies of Mississippi.\n  I was pleased to be joined by a number of senior political leaders \nfrom Mississippi: My esteemed colleague, Senator Thad Cochran, Governor \nKirk Fordice, and Congressman Roger Wicker of the 1st District.\n  Major General James H. Garner, the Adjutant General of the \nMississippi National Guard, and Colonel Robert Barron, the Commander of \nthe 172nd Airlift Wing at Jackson, served as our hosts for these \nceremonies.\n  When you stand up close to a B-2, and have the opportunity to see a \nB-2 fly, you realize just how magnificent this aircraft truly is--and \nthe magnitude of the technological accomplishments that it represents. \nJust to put this in perspective, the B-2 aircraft has a wingspan about \n\\2/3\\ the length of a football field and, so they tell me, the radar \nsignature of an insect. With refueling, it can fly anywhere on the \nplanet to deliver 16 one-ton precision-guided bombs--even in bad \nweather. The B-2 offers a revolutionary combination of stealth, range, \npayload, and precision. It could only have been built here in America--\nand, I say with pride, only with the help of my fellow Mississippians.\n  Fielding this revolutionary aircraft took courage and dedication on \nthe part of key leaders in the Senate, the House of Representatives, \nand four separate Administrations. To get where we are today, from \nconcept to a squadron of B-2s ready to fly and fight, took almost two \ndecades of effort. Standing here now, we can better appreciate their \nvision. And we need to remember the time it took to develop the B-2 as \nwe look to the future of America's long-range bomber force.\n  We in Congress believe that long-range air power will be even more \nimportant in the future than it has been in the past. The reasons are \nstraightforward. Our forces based overseas are shrinking in size--and \nthat trend is likely to continue. Potential adversaries are arming \nthemselves with fast-moving conventional forces and weapons of mass \ndestruction. Long range air power gives the President the ability to \nrespond to aggression immediately and decisively--and that's what helps \nprovide deterrence.\n  We in Congress, however, have had growing concerns about the future \nof the bomber force. Accordingly, we mandated last year that a \ndistinguished and independent panel of experts--the Long Range Air \nPower Panel--examine current plans for the bomber force and recommend \nactions to the President and the Congress. That panel has completed its \nreview and I'd like to briefly share some of its important \nrecommendations regarding the B-2 and the future of America's long-\nrange bomber force.\n  The Panel stated up front that, and I quote: ``long-range air power \nis an increasingly important element of U.S. military capability.'' \nOver the near term, to make sure that the bomber force can meet the \nincreasing demand for long-range air power, the Panel recommended that \nwe need to invest in and upgrade the current force. In the case of the \nB-2, for example, the Panel stated that we should work on in increasing \nthe B-2's sortie rate using a combined program that improves stealth \nmaintenance and performance. This will take some additional funding \nbeyond what we provided in the 1998 budget, but keep in mind that \ndoubling the B-2's sortie rate would in effect double the combat power \nof the force. That's a bargain.\n  The Panel also made an important recommendation regarding the long-\nterm future of the bomber force. As I noted before, it took almost 20 \nyears to field the B-2. In less than twenty years from now, the Panel \nstated that we should be fielding a next generation bomber--and to do \nso, we need to get started now to develop a plan to replace the \nexisting force over time. I don't know what the next generation bomber \nwill look like. Maybe it will be an upgraded B-2 or something \ncompletely different. But I do know that given the strategic importance \nof long-range air power, we need to get started. I look forward to \nseeing the Pentagon's recommendations next year about this important \nissue.\n  The enhancements suggested for the B-2 are in line with the \nrequirements identified by my fellow participant in the Spirit of \nMississippi naming ceremony, General Hawley. As we complete work on \nthis year's defense budget, we should follow the example offered by a \nbrilliant former leader from Mississippi--the late Senator John \nStennis--who along with other leaders in this chamber had the vision to \nstart building the B-2. His vision is now a reality that will fly for \nmany decades into the future. In following Senator Stennis' guidance, \nwe need to support the continued enhancement of the revolutionary B-2 \nstealth bomber. And we need to encourage the Air Force to provide us \nwith a comprehensive plan for developing a next-generation bomber to \nsustain the long-range air power force over the long-term. John Stennis \nwould be very proud of our actions--and our long-term vision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7248-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7251-S7252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO LISA KAUFMAN, SOUTH DAKOTA WINNER OF THE NATIONAL PEACE \n                             ESSAY CONTEST\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to salute Lisa Kaufman of Freeman, \nSouth Dakota--an outstanding young woman who has been honored as South \nDakota's first place winner in the eleventh annual National Peace Essay \nContest sponsored by the United States Institute of Peace. More than \n5,000 students in the 50 states participated in this year's contest. \nStudents wrote about the way in which war crimes and human rights \nviolations are accounted for in various international conflicts.\n  Ms. Kaufman was chosen to represent South Dakota in a special program \nfor state-level winners here in Washington this past week, where she \nparticipated in a three-day simulation of high-level discussions with \nthe goal of finding the best way to address war crimes and human rights \nviolations to ensure a stable peace in Cambodia. She has received a \ncollege scholarship to reward her achievement.\n  I also commend Ms. Vernetta Waltner, the faculty coordinator for the \ncontest at the Freeman Academy, for her involvement and for encouraging \nparticipation in this type of program.\n  I am pleased that Ms. Kaufman and our next generation of leaders are \nhelping build peace to promote freedom and justice among nations and \npeoples. Their commitment and dedication is a lesson to us all. The \ntitle of Ms. Kaufman's essay is ``Justice Leads to Peace.'' She richly \ndeserves public recognition for her accomplishment, and I am proud to \nask unanimous consent that her winning essay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                         Justice Leads to Peace\n\n                           (By Lisa Kaufman)\n\n       It is impossible to deny the fact that there are many \n     cruelties associated with war. In the news, we see and hear \n     about the devastation that war causes in a country. Damage \n     occurs to the land. Buildings and even whole cities may be \n     destroyed by bombs. The real problem with war, though, is \n     that it causes damage beyond just the destruction of various \n     structures within a country. War affects\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\n     people. Individuals who live through times of war endure much \n     pain. An ugly reality is that many violent crimes are \n     committed against people during times of war.\n       So how does a society deal with those who committed \n     atrocious human rights violations during a war? I feel that \n     the only way to restore a stable peace is to face the \n     challenge of punishing those guilty of war crimes. A society \n     can't move on without dealing with the realities of its past, \n     no matter how painful they may be. Several countries \n     throughout the world are now facing the obstacle of dealing \n     with war criminals as they move down the road to peace.\n       One country that is dealing with this issue is South \n     Africa. Conflict over the practice of apartheid, or racial \n     segregation, escalated into a serious situation during the \n     last half of the 20th Century. The conflict is deeply seeded \n     in South Africa's history. The British gained control of \n     South Africa in 1814 and white control of the country \n     immediately provoked uprising by the native blacks who sought \n     independence. In 1910, Britain did grant South Africa \n     independence, but the situation didn't change much as white \n     English-speaking people maintained control of the government.\n       The government established apartheid as an official policy \n     in 1948, and various acts were passed with the purpose of \n     completely separating South Africa's blacks from the white \n     minority. Inevitably, protests arose and they became more \n     serious throughout the 1950's. Nelson Mandela led the African \n     National Congress (ANC), a political organization that \n     actively worked for black control. Boycotts, strikes, and \n     rallies were used to draw attention to their plea for the end \n     of apartheid. Tensions rose even higher when the ANC was \n     banned by the government and Nelson Mandela was jailed.\n       The black movement began to escalate again during the \n     1970's and 1980's. Renewed demonstrations and riots plagued \n     the country and a state of emergency was declared in 1986. \n     Change finally began when a new president, Frederick de \n     Klerk, took office in 1989. Nelson Mandela was released from \n     jail and apartheid was gradually dismantled. Real progress \n     came with elections held in 1994 in which blacks took control \n     of the government with Nelson Mandela as the new president.\n       The new government faced many challenges, one of which was \n     dealing with those guilty of human rights violations that \n     occurred during the era of apartheid. The Truth and \n     Reconciliation Commission was created in June 1995 to give \n     victims a chance to voice the abuses that occurred. It also \n     served to uncover evidence about the perpetrators of those \n     crimes. Political amnesty was guaranteed for those who came \n     forward voluntarily to confess. In other words, those who \n     admitted to committing political crimes were pardoned, but \n     those who remained silent could be prosecuted.\n       I feel that the creation of this commission was beneficial \n     in several ways, but was too lenient in its dealings with war \n     criminals. The acceptance of the commission was evident when \n     over 10,000 victims came forward to share their personal \n     horror stories. This reveals that there was a need among the \n     people to talk about what happened. The way in which the \n     commission dealt with war criminals represented a compromise, \n     though Truth is essential, but at what cost?\n       There must be penalties for these crimes that were \n     committed and I think that the offer of political amnesty was \n     too generous. Citizens should be able to see punishment \n     handed out to the guilty so that they can feel safe again. It \n     would be beneficial to reward those who come forward \n     voluntarily with a lesser sentence, but they still deserve to \n     face punishment for their actions. Justice must not be \n     compromised in this way. War criminals must be held \n     accountable.\n       Another recent conflict that has been plagued by \n     discoveries of genocide and vast human rights violations is \n     the civil war in Bosnia. The region has had a troubled past. \n     After World War II, Yugoslavia was united as a confederation \n     of six republics held together by the ruling Communist Party. \n     This federation was unstable, though, because of deeply \n     seeded ethnic divisions.\n       In 1990, the Communists lost control and Yugoslavia began \n     to crumble. In June, 1991, two of the republics, Slovenia and \n     Croatia, declared their independence. The other republics \n     followed, with Bosnia and Herzegovina declaring their \n     independence in March 1992. Civil war then broke out in \n     Bosnia between the three ethnic groups living in the area: \n     the Croats, Serbs and Bosnian Muslims. The Muslim-dominated \n     government forces fought to maintain a multiethnic state \n     while the Bosnian Serbs and Croats called for separate ethnic \n     states.\n       A peace treaty was signed in December 1995 in which Bosnia \n     was split into two sub-states, a Muslim-Croat federation and \n     a Serb republic. The agreement called for the exchange of \n     territory and this led to much violence. International \n     peacekeeping forces and humanitarian organizations were \n     present throughout the war and remain in the area yet today \n     to stabilize the conflict.\n       Both during and after the war, reports were confirmed of \n     torture and cruelty committed by all three ethnic groups. The \n     Bosnian Serbs were specifically singled out, though, for \n     their policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' in which over 700,000 \n     Muslims were forced from their homes in Serb-controlled areas \n     of Bosnia. The Serbs were also responsible for putting people \n     in concentration camps and killing and raping many women. \n     Mass graves hold evidence to the large number of deaths that \n     occurred.\n       These human rights abuses were acknowledged with the \n     formation of The United Nations International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. This tribunal was set up \n     at The Hague in 1994 with the purpose of judging serious \n     violations of international humanitarian law. The tribunal \n     issued indictments of various criminal suspects and then \n     those in the international community were responsible to \n     arrest them and turn them over to the tribunal to face \n     punishment.\n       The problem with this arrangement was that many indicted \n     war criminals were not actively sought by international \n     peacekeepers. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     was very active both during and after the war in Bosnia by \n     stationing peacekeeping soldiers throughout the area. These \n     NATO troops have not chosen to search out the war criminals, \n     though. At one point 75 people had been indicted by the \n     tribunal, while only nine had been arrested.\n       In July 1997, NATO started to actively track down indicted \n     war criminals. More arrests were made, but NATO has not yet \n     moved to arrest the higher-level criminals that have been \n     indicted, such as Radovan Karadzic, a Serb leader who is \n     accused of genocide, or the intent to destroy a whole ethnic \n     group.\n       I believe that it is time for international peacekeepers to \n     actively move in on arresting the high-profile suspects. It \n     is easier to leave these suspects alone, but by delaying \n     action, peace and reconciliation is being delayed. I agree \n     with the tribunal's goal of bringing war criminals to face \n     judgment, but the way that this effort is being carried out \n     is short of effective.\n       These issues dealing with the prosecution of war criminals \n     must be dealt with carefully. There are many variables to \n     consider. Even though public trials may be painful for \n     survivors, I feel that it is necessary to deal with the \n     perpetrators in public. Silence is not a solution. It is \n     better to deal with those suspected of human rights \n     violations than to pretend the damage never occurred. Only \n     when these problems are dealt with can lasting peace have a \n     chance.\n       Truth must be exposed. Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor \n     and Nobel Peace Prize winner, recently said, '`There is no \n     compensation for what happened. But at least a certain \n     balance can be established that opposing fear there is hope, \n     hope that when we remember the fear . . . our memory becomes \n     a shield for the future.'' By exposing what really happened \n     we can guard ourselves against it ever happening again.\n       Both South Africa and Bosnia face challenges in their \n     future. As they work to bring war criminals to justice, \n     painful memories resurface. They are taking steps in the \n     right direction, though, as they confront the atrocities that \n     took place during times of war and conflict. War criminals \n     must be tried and held responsible for their actions. There \n     are no valid excuses for killing. People should never have to \n     suffer based on their ethnic origin or simply the color of \n     their skin. When these offenses occur, the guilty must be \n     punished so that peace and justice can thrive in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7251-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7252-S7253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few very brief \ncomments on the Product Liability Reform Act of 1998, which the Senate \nwill soon be considering. I will make more lengthy remarks on this bill \nwhen we return from recess and move on to this bill, but I did not want \nto let the bill's introduction last night pass without comment.\n  This bill is a good bill, and I am proud to be one of its original \nco-sponsors. It is the product of incredibly hard work and tremendous \ndedication by Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller, and I want to \ncongratulate--and thank--them and their staffs for what they have been \nable to achieve. I also want to thank the President for his willingness \nto work with us to come up with a bill that now has his full support.\n  I, frankly, would have liked a stronger bill, like the one we passed \nlast Congress, but the President vetoed that bill. That is something \nthat I think all those of us who support reform have to keep in mind as \nwe move forward with this bill. Because even if it doesn't incorporate \neverything we wanted, this bill does offer much--together with the \npromise of the President's signature.\n  The President's promise is important not just to those of us who have \nlong supported legal reform. It also should be important to my \ncolleagues who have not. I hope it prompts them to take a serious look \nat this bill--to put aside preconceived notions they may have of \nproduct liability reform, and to take a fresh look at what we have \ndone.\n  Mr. President, this bill offers meaningful--and fair--reform of our \nlegal system to redress the system's abuses while at the same time \nprotecting consumers' rights. And it contains the provisions of a bill \nSenator McCain and I\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\nhave been working on for a couple of Congresses: the Biomaterials \nAccess Assurance Act.\n  The Biomaterials bill is the response to a crisis affecting more than \n7 million patients annually who rely on implantable life-saving or \nlife-enhancing medical devices--things like pacemakers, heart valves, \nartificial blood vessels, hydrocephalic shunts, and hip and knee \njoints. These patients are at risk of losing access to the devices \nbecause many suppliers are refusing to sell biomaterial device \nmanufacturers the raw materials and component parts that are necessary \nto make the devices. The reason: suppliers no longer want to risk \nhaving to pay enormous legal fees to defend against product liability \nsuits when those legal fees far exceed any profit they make from \nsupplying the raw materials for use in implantable devices. Although \nnot a single biomaterials supplier has ultimately been held liable so \nfar, the actual and potential costs of defending lawsuits has caused \nthem to leave this market. A study by Aronoff Associates found that 75 \npercent of suppliers surveyed were not willing to sell their raw \nmaterials to implant manufacturers under current conditions. That study \npredicts that unless this trend is reversed, patients whose lives \ndepend on implantable devices may no longer have access to them.\n  The Biomaterials title of the Product Liability bill responds to this \ncrisis by allowing most suppliers of raw materials and component parts \nfor implantable medical devices to gain early dismissal from lawsuits. \nAt the same time, by allowing plaintiffs to bring those suppliers back \ninto a lawsuit in the rare case that the other defendants are bankrupt \nor otherwise judgment proof, it ensures that plaintiffs won't be left \nwithout compensation for their injuries if they can prove a supplier \nwas at fault. Mr. President, I have a summary of the bill here, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed after this statement in the \nRecord.\n  I will have a lot more to say about the Biomaterials provisions and \nthe entire bill when we return from recess. For now, let me just once \nagain congratulate Senator Gorton, Senator Rockefeller and the \nPresident for their success in forging this compromise bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Summary of Biomaterials Access Assurance Act\n\n  Title II of the Product Liability Reform Act of 1998 contains the \nprovisions of the Lieberman-McCain Biomaterials Access Assurance Act.\n  Need For The Biomaterials Bill: The Biomaterials bill responds to a \nlooming crisis affecting more than 7 million patients annually who rely \non implantable life-saving or life-enhancing medical devices such as \npacemakers, heart valves, artificial blood vessels, hydrocephalic \nshunts, and hip and knee joints. These patients are at risk of losing \naccess to the devices because many suppliers are refusing to sell \nbiomaterial device manufacturers the raw materials and component parts \nthat are necessary to make the devices. The reason: suppliers no longer \nwant to risk having to pay enormous legal fees to defend against \nmeritless product liability suits when those legal fees far exceed any \nprofit they make from supplying the raw materials for use in \nimplantable devices. Although not a single biomaterials supplier has \nthus far been held liable, the actual and potential costs of defending \nlawsuits has caused them to leave this market. A study by Aronoff \nAssociates found that 75 percent of suppliers surveyed were not willing \nto sell their raw materials to implant manufacturers under current \nconditions. That study predicts that unless this trend is reversed, \npatients whose lives rely on implantable devices may no longer have \naccess to them.\n  What The Bill Does: To alleviate these problems, the Biomaterials \nbill would do two things. First, with an important exception noted \nbelow, the bill would immunize suppliers of raw materials and component \nparts from product liability suits, unless (a) the supplier also \nmanufactured the implant alleged to have caused harm; (b) the supplier \nsold the implant alleged to have caused harm; or (c) the supplier \nfurnished raw materials or component parts that failed to meet \napplicable contractual requirements or specifications. Second, the bill \nwould provide raw materials and component parts suppliers with a \nmechanism for making that immunity meaningful by obtaining early \ndismissal from lawsuits.\n  What The Bill Does Not Do: The bill does not keep injured plaintiffs \nfrom gaining compensation for their injuries. First, it leaves lawsuits \nagainst those involved in the design, manufacture or sale of medical \ndevices untouched. Second, it provides a fallback rule if the \nmanufacturer or other responsible party is bankrupt or judgment-proof. \nIn such cases, a plaintiff may bring the raw materials supplier back \ninto a lawsuit if a court concludes that evidence exists to warrant \nholding the supplier liable. Finally, the bill does not cover lawsuits \ninvolving silicone gel breast implants.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part\" seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today along with the senior \nSenator from Missouri, Senator Bond, to honor Kathy and John Phillips, \nAlma and Larry Swon, and Kathy and Mike Yount of Mexico, Missouri, who \non July 3, 1998, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversaries. Many \nthings have changed in the 30 years these couples have been married, \nbut the values, principles, and commitment these marriages demonstrate \nare timeless.\n  My wife, Janet, and I had the privilege of celebrating our 30th \nwedding anniversary just one year ago. I can attest, like these fine \ncouples, to the remarkable love and appreciation that has grown out of \nmy own marriage. As these couples gather together in Mexico on July 3, \nsurrounded by friends and family, it will be apparent that the lasting \nlegacy of these marriages will be the time, energy, and resources \ninvested in their children, church, and community.\n  The Phillips, Swons, and Younts exemplify the highest commitment to \nrelentless dedication and sacrifice. Their commitment to the principles \nand values of their marriages deserve to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7253-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7253-S7255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, upon our return in July, it is my hope \nthat the Senate will turn to full and open debate of patient protection \nlegislation at the earliest appropriate time. The American people are \nconcerned about the state of our health care system. Earlier this \nmonth, a survey by the Pew Research Center showed HMO regulation at the \ntop of the list of issues important to individuals and the country.\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\n  We have a proposal, the Patients' Bill of Rights (S. 1890), which \nwould restore confidence in our system. A critical provision in our \nbill would allow patients who receive their benefits through their \nemployer to hold their plans accountable for medical or coverage \ndecisions that result in injury or death. Currently, approximately 123 \nmillion Americans are precluded from seeking any meaningful redress \nwhen they are permanently disabled or when they lose a loved one \nbecause of insurance company abuses that put profits ahead of patients.\n  Patients who purchase in the individual market can hold their plans \naccountable. Patients enrolled in plans that serve state or local \nemployees can hold their plans accountable. But people insured through \nERISA covered plans cannot. No industry deserves to be exempt from \nliability for their actions. Last week, William Welch, a reporter with \nUSA Today, wrote an article that eloquently outlines this issue and how \nit affects families across the country. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the USA Today, June 19-21, 1998]\n\n                1974 Pensions Law Sparks Political Fire\n\n                         (By William M. Welch)\n\n       Washington--When a doctor's mistake causes death or injury \n     to the patient, a malpractice suit frequently follows. But \n     what if fault lies with a managed care plan that denies \n     treatment?\n       Chances of a successful suit for damages are slim, many \n     Americans are finding, because a federal law makes it \n     practically impossible to collect from an employer-provided \n     health care plan.\n       As more people get into health maintenance organizations \n     and other types of managed-care plans, that 25-year old law \n     has become an election-year issue. Both parties propose \n     regulating managed-care plans and making HMOs more \n     accountable. Knocking down legal barriers to suits has \n     emerged as the most contentious issue in the debate.\n       ``The American public doesn't realize that the managed-care \n     industry is the only industry in the country that has a \n     congressionally mandated shield from liability,'' says Rep. \n     Charlie Norwood, R-Ga, a dentist who is sponsoring one of \n     several bills that would open the door to suits against \n     health plans. ``I want these accountants to think twice \n     before they overrule the physician who says your child needs \n     to go to the hospital.''\n       Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is sponsoring a similar \n     version in the Senate and vows to attach it to spending bills \n     or other must-pass legislation, perhaps as early as next \n     week. ``We will use whatever parliamentary means,'' he says, \n     ``because the American people expect it.''\n       The bills would remove the barrier to suits by changing a \n     federal law that says decisions made by employer-provided \n     health plans in most cases cannot be the subject of suits in \n     state courts. It also greatly limits potential awards in \n     federal courts.\n       Norwood and Kennedy say the change would instantly make \n     healthcare plan managers more accountable for their decisions \n     about coverage and put authority for treatment decisions back \n     in the hands of doctors.\n       Opponents say it would bring a flood of expensive lawsuits \n     and lead to higher health insurance costs for average \n     Americans. In the House of Representatives, Majority Leader \n     Dick Armey, R-Texas, is a leading opponent. He says the \n     change would ``drive up premiums and drive down coverage by \n     letting trial lawyers sue health plans for malpractice.''\n\n\n                          my child was cheated\n\n       Advocates of changing the federal law point to people like \n     Bill Beaver of Pollock Pines, Calif. Beaver, 52, says his HMO \n     misdiagnosed a brain tumor for two years, then told him his \n     condition was inoperable and hopeless. He cashed in a \n     retirement account to visit specialists at Johns Hopkins \n     University Hospital in Baltimore. They began radiation \n     treatment.\n       The tumor receded, and Beaver is alive three years later. \n     The HMO refused to pay for the treatment at Johns Hopkins. He \n     wanted to sue but was told federal law would make it \n     impossible for him to win.\n       ``When I needed support, my HMO gave me the door,'' Beaver \n     says, ``Unless HMOs are forced to give quality care, they \n     will continue to deny costly treatments that can prolong or \n     in my case even save a life.''\n       Melody Louise Johnson of Norco, Calif., died at age 16 of \n     cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that attacks the lungs. \n     Her mother, Terry Johnson, says the family's HMO delayed \n     their request for referral to specialists and overruled the \n     specialists once she saw them. The family has sued, and their \n     HMO is citing the federal law in seeking dismissal.\n       ``I don't want another parent to have to go through what I \n     went through,'' she says. ``It is devastating enough to have \n     a child with this disease. . . . My child was cheated.''\n       Privacy laws prevent health-care companies from commenting \n     on individual cases, says Richard Smith, vice president of \n     the American Association of Health Plans, whose members \n     include the nation's major HMOs and managed-care plans.\n       ``It is nearly impossible for the plans that are being \n     accused to respond,'' Smith says. ``I think that most people \n     understand there's often more than one side to a story.''\n\n\n                           support for change\n\n       Armed with stories like these, supporters of change have \n     tapped strong chords of unhappiness with managed care among \n     voters.\n       More than half the House, including members in both \n     parties, has signed on as supporters of Norwood's bill. House \n     and Senate Democratic leaders have introduced similar bills. \n     President Clinton has called for passage of the legislation, \n     and Congress is expected to act this year.\n       A poll released this week by the Pew Research Center found \n     that 69% say the debate over HMO regulation is very \n     important, and 60% said it was very important to them \n     personally.\n       Senate GOP leaders and Armey in the House have blocked the \n     bills, although some Republicans are calling for action. \n     House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has named a task force of \n     GOP lawmakers to come up with a more limited bill. But he \n     rejected their initial attempt.\n       The issue is already being used by Democrats in House and \n     Senate campaigns in states as diverse as North Carolina and \n     Montana. Some GOP lawmakers worry that their leaders are \n     handing a powerful issue to Democrats that threatens their \n     11-vote House majority.\n       ``In my opinion this will be one of the top two or three \n     issues in this fall campaign,'' says Rep. Greg Ganske, R-\n     Iowa, a physician. ``We will only see legislation passed when \n     it becomes apparent to the Republican leadership that they \n     could lose their majority based on this issue.''\n\n\n                          why suits are barred\n\n       The obstacle to suits is a 1974 law, the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. It was designed to \n     protect pensions and simplify rules for employers by \n     preempting state regulation of benefit plans and covering \n     them with a single federal law.\n       Many experts say the law was never intended to shield \n     health care decisions from malpractice suits, but court \n     interpretations and the changing nature of the U.S. health \n     care system have had that effect. Because of the law, \n     managed-care plans can argue that they are extensions of \n     employer-provided benefit plans and thus protected from state \n     laws and regulations on health insurance.\n       The law also makes it relatively futile to sue in federal \n     court. It prohibits plaintiffs from seeking punitive or \n     compensatory damages. They can sue only to recover the cost \n     of the procedure that was denied.\n       A decade ago, when HMOs and managed care covered relatively \n     few Americans, denial of coverage meant an insurance company \n     didn't pay a bill after treatment, and the law wasn't a big \n     issue. But there has been a revolution in the way health care \n     is provided, and now 138 million people, or three-quarters of \n     Americans with private health insurance, rely on managed-care \n     plans.\n       Those plans limit costs by tightly controlling access to \n     many types of care. Decisions authorizing or denying care may \n     be made by claims clerks and managers. For patients in those \n     plans, denial of coverage can mean they don't see the doctor \n     or specialist they want or don't get a medical procedure \n     their doctor recommended. They may not even be informed of \n     expensive treatments or clinical trials that hold promise for \n     life-threatening illnesses such as cancer. A health plan can \n     limit the options its doctors discuss with patients.\n       ``In non-managed care, it's not an issue because the \n     physician makes the decision and is accountable,'' says Dr. \n     Thomas Reardon, president of the American Medical \n     Association. ``It's when you have a third party second-\n     guessing the physician that this becomes a problem.''\n       Jerry Cannon of Newcastle, Okla., learned about the limits \n     on accountability when his wife, Phyllis, contracted \n     leukemia. Her HMO denied the bone marrow transplant that her \n     doctor recommended until it was too late. She died in 1992 at \n     46. When Cannon sued, a federal court ruled that the federal \n     law prevented any award.\n       A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals upheld the ruling and said the law was clear, however \n     wrong the result may seem. The Supreme Court refused the \n     case.\n       ``Although moved by the tragic circumstances of this case \n     and the seemingly needless loss of life that resulted, we \n     conclude the law gives us no choice,'' the appeals court \n     said.\n       Cannon recalls taking the phone call and relaying word to \n     his wife that the HMO wasn't going to provide the transplant \n     she needed: ``It just devastated her. She gave up after that. \n     Oh, it was horrible. Once I got off the phone, I could see \n     all hope leave her.''\n\n\n                            radical proposal\n\n       Concerned about growing calls for change, employers, \n     insurers and health care companies have begun an aggressive \n     advertising and lobbying campaign against the bills. They \n     contend that changing the law could open the door to \n     expensive lawsuits against employers as well as health plans, \n     drive up costs for consumers, and ultimately reduce the \n     quality of health care.\n       ``This kind of radical proposal to expand the current \n     flawed medical liability system is not going to generate \n     better medical care. It's going to generate lower quality \n     medical care,'' says Smith, of the health plans association.\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\n       Kennedy and Norwood dispute the industry view and say their \n     bills would not permit suits against employers unless they \n     actually participated in the decisions leading to injury.\n       But industry groups say higher costs and the potential for \n     suits could cause some big employers to stop offering health \n     plans for their workers.\n       ``There is no question, we believe, that this would cause a \n     lot of employers to drop coverage. They just couldn't take \n     the risk,'' says Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits \n     Coalition, made up of business groups organized to fight the \n     bills.\n       His group has run ads in selected congressional districts \n     attacking the bills as protecting ``fat cat trial lawyers'' \n     rather than the sick. Danner says his group's spending is \n     approaching $2 million, and individual companies are spending \n     more.\n       Fighting for the bills are consumer groups and an unusual \n     alliance of doctors and trial lawyers, who are traditionally \n     adversaries in malpractice cases. The lawyers have let groups \n     with more sympathetic public images, such as doctors, wage \n     the visible campaign while the lawyers lobby aggressively \n     inside Congress.\n\n\n                           there are problems\n\n       Industry officials say their decisions are protected \n     because they are not, strictly speaking, medical decisions. \n     Instead, they say the decisions revolve around what \n     treatments are or are not covered by a plan. Doctors, who are \n     liable to lawsuits for their decisions, dismiss that claim.\n       ``That's absurd because they are making medical \n     decisions,'' says the AMA's Reardon. ``They're hiding behind \n     the facade that it is not medical, that it's a coverage \n     decision.\n       Some industry officials agree that some new regulation of \n     managed care plans is needed, short of dropping the \n     prohibition on suits.\n       ``There are problems with managed care,'' says Danner. \n     ``Hopefully the debate will focus on the best way to solve \n     those problems without significant unintended consequences.''\n       Advocates from Norwood to the AMA say that accountability \n     is at the heart of the issue. Making HMOs liable for their \n     decisions would bring dramatic change for all patients, not \n     just those inclined to sue, they say.\n       ``If the plans are held as accountable as I am for the \n     medical decision-making,'' Reardon says, ``it will benefit \n     the patient.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      About the Managed-Care Bill\n\n       Here are key provisions in a managed-care regulation bill \n     proposed by Rep.

A bill to reform unfair and anticompetitive practices in the \nprofessional boxing industry; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n                     muhammad ali boxing reform act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a \nnew bipartisan proposal to improve several aspects of the professional \nboxing industry in the U.S. I am joined by Senator Bryan of Nevada in \noffering this legislation. He has been a great partner in my efforts to \nimprove the safety and integrity of this major industry in the public \ninterest.\n  This bill is intended to protect boxers from some of the most \negregious and onerous business practices which they have been subjected \nto across the U.S. over the last several decades. It will also help \nState officials provide more effective public oversight of boxing \nevents held in their jurisdiction, so that they can better prevent \nbusiness practice abuses and unethical conduct. Furthermore, this \nlegislation will improve integrity and open competition in professional \nboxing, by curbing its most restrictive and anti-competitive business \npractices. This is a limited and modest proposal in many respects, but \nit is the product of months of consultation with experienced State \nathletic officials and the most respected and knowledgeable members of \nthe boxing industry.\n  Let me say a few words about the title of this legislation. I thought \nit would be a fitting tribute to name an important new reform measure \non professional boxing after Muhammad Ali. Mr. Ali had perhaps the most \nimpressive and exciting career in the history of professional boxing, \nand his many championships and achievements are legendary in the sport. \nOf course, Muhammad Ali's character, integrity, and personal charm \nappealed to tens of millions of Americans who did not even consider \nthemselves to be boxing fans. His entire life has been a story of \ntremendous determination, accomplishment, and perseverance against \ndaunting odds. I feel it most appropriate for the Congress pass a \nmeasure to protect the interests of boxers, encourage fair competition, \nand vastly improve the overall integrity of the boxing industry, that \nis named in his honor. I want to thank Mr. Ali for his graciousness in \nletting this legislation be so named.\n  I have been deeply involved in exploring ways to improve the \nprofessional boxing industry for most of this decade. It is a complex \ntask. Many of the steps that need to be taken to permanently end the \ndisreputable and abusive business practices which have long marred the \nsport must be taken either by members of the industry, or by State \nofficials. I firmly believe that State boxing commissioners and \nindustry leaders must be the primary agents of reform in this sport. It \nis they who I have continually turned to for advice and recommendations \non how the federal government might be of help, albeit in a limited and \nsupportive role.\n  This proposal seeks to remedy many of the anti-competitive, \noppressive, and unethical business practices which have cheated \nprofessional boxers and denied the public the benefits of a truly \nhonest and legitimate sport. This reform measure is designed to \nprohibit the harmful and arbitrary business practices which have \nclearly hurt the welfare of professional boxers, without imposing \nunnecessary restrictions or federal intrusions into the sport. I want \nto emphasize that this proposal requires no State or federal funding; \ncreates no federal bureaucracy; imposes no mandates on State \ncommissions; and requires no new regulatory actions by State boxing \ncommissioners. It is a modest and practical measure that will establish \nseveral ``fair contracting'' standards to protect professional boxers, \nand enhance important financial disclosures that are made to State \ncommissions by business entities in the industry.\n\n  This bill also would establish certain federal standards with which \nboxing's ``sanctioning organizations'' must comply. These entities are \nnotorious in the\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\nsport for engaging in arbitrary and manipulative activity with respect \nto their ratings of professional boxers. Though often foreign-based, \nthese entities operate on an interstate basis in the U.S. with \nvirtually no oversight at the State or federal level. For several \ndecades they have been repeatedly and credibly criticized by boxers and \nsportswriters for business practices that are highly questionable. \nTheir inconsistent and subjective methods of rating boxers, often in \napparent collusion with powerful promoters in the sport, clearly has \nhad negative consequences for boxers. A boxer's career can be \neffectively stalled or crippled by these entities' arbitrary decisions. \nThis legislation would establish a series of prudent business conduct \nstandards and financial disclosure requirements on sanctioning \norganizations to ensure they are subject to legitimate public oversight \nby State officials.\n  I want to note the vital need for these reforms at the federal level, \nMr. President. Boxing in the U.S. is regulated by individual State \nboxing commissions, many of which are severely underfunded and \nunderstaffed. Many do not have more than a single employee. Though many \nState commissions have extremely knowledgeable and dedicated members, \nthey do not have the capacity to prevent the indefensible interstate \nbusiness abuses which this legislation address. Indeed, when a small \ngroup of states boxing commissions tries to crack down on the promoters \nand others who are engaged in fraudulent or unethical activity, State \nofficials face the prospect of losing all their professional boxing \nevents to another jurisdiction. Promoters and sanctioning bodies can \navoid State reforms by seeking out new forums where public interest \nprotections are fewer and weaker. That is not good for the boxers who \nbear all the risks of this punishing profession, and it not good for \nthe ticket-buying fans, either.\n  Decades of scandals, controversy, and corruption have shown \nprofessional boxing to be an industry where public oversight is \nabsolutely critical, Mr. President. Therefore, this limited series of \nnational fair business standards and public disclosure requirements \nwill be of tremendous service to the State officials and general public \nconcerned about this industry. This bill will in no way interfere with \nany legitimate, good faith business practices in the sport.\n  Senator Bryan and the many industry members that I have worked with \nover the past five months to develop this bill have come up with a \nsolid, practical, and no-cost way to protect the interests of the \nathletes and the public in the boxing industry. The sole objectives of \nthis bill are to ensure that boxers are not cheated of their fair \nearnings in the sport; that State officials are given better \ninformation with which to supervise major boxing events, and take \ncorrective actions when necessary; and to encourage integrity and \nhonest business practices by the business interests which dominate \nprofessional boxing. I have attached a one page summary of this \nproposal, and ask unanimous consent to print the bill and summary in \nthe Record. I look forward to comments on this proposal by members of \nthe industry and State commissioners across the U.S., and ask my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Professional boxing differs from other major, \n     interstate professional sports industries in the United \n     States in that it operates without any private sector \n     association, league, or centralized industry organization to \n     establish uniform and appropriate business practices and \n     ethical standards. This has led to repeated occurrences of \n     disreputable and coercive business practices in the boxing \n     industry, to the detriment of professional boxers nationwide.\n       (2) Professional boxers are vulnerable to exploitative \n     business practices engaged in by certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies which dominate the sport. Boxers do not \n     have an established representative group to advocate for \n     their interests and rights in the industry.\n       (3) State officials are the proper regulators of \n     professional boxing events, and must protect the welfare of \n     professional boxers and serve the public interest by closely \n     supervising boxing activity in their jurisdiction. State \n     boxing commissions do not currently receive adequate \n     information to determine whether boxers competing in their \n     jurisdiction are being subjected to contract terms and \n     business practices which may be violative of State \n     regulations, or are onerous and confiscatory.\n       (4) Promoters who engage in illegal, coercive, or unethical \n     business practices can take advantage of the lack of \n     equitable business standards in the sport by holding boxing \n     events in states with weaker regulatory oversight.\n       (5) The sanctioning organizations which have proliferated \n     in the boxing industry have not established credible and \n     objective criteria to rate professional boxers, and operate \n     with virtually no industry or public oversight. Their ratings \n     are susceptible to manipulation, have deprived boxers of fair \n     opportunities for advancement, and have undermined public \n     confidence in the integrity of the sport.\n       (6) Open competition in the professional boxing industry \n     has been significantly interfered with by restrictive and \n     anti-competitive business practices of certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies, to the detriment of the athletes and the \n     ticket-buying public. Common practices of promoters and \n     sanctioning organizations represent restraints of interstate \n     trade in the United States.\n       (7) It is necessary and appropriate to establish national \n     contracting reforms to protect professional boxers and \n     prevent exploitative business practices, and to require \n     enhanced financial disclosures to State athletic commissions \n     to improve the public oversight of the sport.\n       (8) Whereas the Congress seeks to improve the integrity and \n     ensure fair practices of the professional boxing industry on \n     a nationwide basis, it deems it appropriate to name this \n     reform in honor of Muhammad Ali, whose career achievements \n     and personal contributions to the sport, and positive impact \n     on our society, are unsurpassed in the history of boxing.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect the rights and welfare of professional \n     boxers by preventing certain exploitative, oppressive, and \n     unethical business practices they may be subject to on an \n     interstate basis;\n       (2) to assist State boxing commissions in their efforts to \n     provide more effective public oversight of the sport; and\n       (3) to promoting honorable competition in professional \n     boxing and enhance the overall integrity of the industry.\n\n     SEC 4.

Also enclosed is a section-by-section \n     analysis of the bill. We recommend that the bill be \n     introduced, referred to the appropriate committee for \n     consideration, and enacted.\n       The enclosed bill would revise the boundary of Fort \n     Matanzas National Monument in Florida to clarify long-\n     standing boundary and acquisition issues involving a total of \n     approximately 70 acres. The first issue involves two tracts \n     of land, 01-102 and 01-103 which are currently adjacent to \n     the park's boundary. These two tracts were donated to the \n     United States in 1963 and 1965. At the time of the donations, \n     no attempt was made to seek authority to include these tracts \n     within the park's boundary.\n       The second issue involves Tract 01-107, which was \n     originally intended to be donated as part of Tract 01-102 on \n     January 1, 1965. However, a regional Solicitor's opinion of \n     September 14, 1984, indicated that an error in the legal \n     description omitted this tract and the United States does not \n     hold title to this parcel.\n       The purpose of this bill is to include the three tracts \n     within the boundary of Fort Matanzas National Monument. This \n     would ensure that the National Park Service could legally \n     protect the resources on the tracts and ensure visitor \n     safety.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Donald Barry,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n     Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1 of this legislation revises the boundary of Fort \n     Matanzas National Monument in Florida by adding three small \n     tracts of land totaling approximately 70 acres. The boundary \n     adjustments are depicted on the map entitled ``Fort Matanzas \n     National Monument'', numbered 347/80004, and dated February \n     1991.\n       Section 2 authorizes the Secretary to acquire the lands by \n     donation, purchase, transfer or exchange.\n       Section 3 states that the lands will be administered as \n     part of Fort Matanzas National Monument and will be subject \n     to the laws that are applicable to the monument.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2240.

Currently the \n     proposed Adams National Historical Park is designated as a \n     National Historic Site. It was established by Secretarial \n     Order in 1935 based on the Historic Sites Act. It was \n     expanded in 1952 again by Secretarial Order. In 1972, 1978 \n     and 1980, Congress added more acreage to the site and \n     authorized the addition of two separate properties to the \n     historic site. The continued expansion of the historic site \n     with the addition of separate properties all focused on the \n     life and history of John Adams, Abigail Adams, John Quincy \n     Adams, and their descendants, qualifies the existing National \n     Park System unit for designation as a national historical \n     park.\n       The legislation would authorize the acquisition of ten \n     additional acres for development of visitor and \n     administrative facilities to protect the historical setting \n     and integrity of the historical park. The legislation directs \n     that the historical park be managed in accord with the laws \n     applicable to units of the National Park System, in \n     particular the National Park Service Organic Act of 1916 and \n     the Historic Sites Act of 1935. The legislation also provides \n     specific cooperative\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\n     agreement authority to the historical park to work with \n     outside entities and individuals on the preservation, \n     development, interpretation, and use of the site.\n       The redesignation of Adams National Historic Site to Adams \n     National Historical Park is the important recognition that \n     the collection of sites in Quincy, Massachusetts, related to \n     the lives of John Adams, 2nd President of the United States, \n     his wife Abigail and their descendants, including their son, \n     John Quincy Adams, 6th President of the United States, \n     properly deserves. The authorities for land acquisition and \n     cooperative agreements are critical for the successful \n     protection, development, interpretation and use of the Adams \n     National Historical Park.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Donald Barry,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n     Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Section-by-Section Analysis--Adams National Historical Park\n\n       Section 1.--Provides a short title for the Act--``Adams \n     National Historical Park Act of 1998.''\n       Section 2. (a) Findings.--Provides the references including \n     Secretarial Orders and Public Laws which created the Adams \n     National Historic Site in Quincy, Massachusetts and expanded \n     it from a single site to three separate sites in Quincy plus \n     additional acreage at the original site. No single piece of \n     legislation or Executive Order provides overarching authority \n     or guidance for managing the multiple sites.\n       Section 2. (b) Purpose.--States the purpose of the \n     legislation, to establish the ``Adams National Historical \n     Park.''\n       Section 3.--Provides definitions.\n       Section 4.--Establishes the boundary of the historical park \n     which is made up of the properties currently owned by the \n     National Park Service and managed as part of the Adams \n     National Historic Site or property identified in Executive \n     Orders or Public Laws related to Adams National Historic Site \n     that are to be acquired or conveyed to the National Park \n     Service for inclusion in the historic site but that have not \n     yet been acquired or conveyed. Also provides for the \n     acquisition of up to ten additional acres for the development \n     of administrative and visitor services.\n       Section 5.--Provides the authorities under which the \n     historical park is to be administered, including cooperative \n     agreement authority.\n       Section 6.--Authorities that funds necessary for the \n     development, operation, and maintenance of the park be \n     provided.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2241. A bill to provide for the acquisition of lands formerly \noccupied by the Franklin D. Roosevelt family at Hyde Park, New York, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n         franklin d. roosevelt family historic site legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the Administration, \ntoday I introduce legislation to provide for the acquisition of lands \nformerly occupied by the Franklin D. Roosevelt family at Hyde Park, New \nYork, and for other purposes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Administration's letter of \ntransmittal and a section-by-section analysis of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record for the information of my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1998.\n     Hon. Albert Gore Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill ``To provide \n     for the acquisition of lands formerly occupied by the \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt family at Hyde Park, New York, and for \n     other purposes.''\n       We recommend the bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate committee, and enacted.\n       The purpose of the legislation is to allow the Secretary of \n     the Interior to acquire lands and interests therein that were \n     owned by Franklin Delano Roosevelt or his family at the time \n     of his death, as depicted on the map referenced in the bill, \n     by means of purchase using appropriated or donated funds, by \n     donation, or exchange. The lands would be added to and \n     managed as part of the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National \n     Historic Site or the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic \n     Site.\n       This would expand the current acquisition authority at the \n     Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site. \n     Currently the Secretary's authority to acquire land owned by \n     FDR or his family at the time of his death is by means of \n     donation only. The National Park Service's priority at the \n     site would continue to be land acquisition by donation. With \n     regard to the property where Roosevelt's Top Cottage is \n     situated, the National Park Service would acquire such \n     property by donation only. This bill, upon enactment, would \n     allow the use of appropriated funds for purchase of lands \n     where donation is infeasible.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Donald Barry,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n                                      Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n\n    Section-by-Section Analysis--Franklin Delano Roosevelt National \n         Historic Site/Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site\n\n       Section 1. Provides the Secretary of the Interior authority \n     to acquire lands and/or interests in lands owned by Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt or his family at the time of his death. The \n     property may be acquired by purchase using donated or \n     appropriated funds, by donation or otherwise. This revises \n     current authority that only allows acquisition by donation.\n       Section 2. States that any land acquired will be \n     administered as part of the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     National Historic Site or as part of the Eleanor Roosevelt \n     National Historic Site, as appropriate.\n       Section 3. Provides authority for funds to be appropriated \n     to carry out the Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Abraham, \n        Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 2242. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Import and Export \nAct to place limitations on controlled substances brought into the \nUnited States from Canada and Mexico; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n         Controlled Substances Import and Export Act Amendments\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. One of the key priorities for America today is protecting \nour young people from drugs. We need to stay on the lookout for new and \ndifferent ways that we can make even a small difference in this \nimportant fight. This morning, along with Senators, Grassley, Kohl, \nAbraham, Sessions, and Coverdell, I am introducing a bill that is \nneither monumental in approach nor grandiose in scope--but it will \nbreak on of the links in the chain of the drug trade.\n  There is now a loophole in Federal law that permits large quantities \nof a certain class of drugs known as controlled substances to pour into \nour country at an alarming rate. Included among these are some \ndangerous hallucinogenics and so-called date-rape drugs.\n  The reason for this current loophole is that, under present law, an \nindividual is permitted to transport a 90-day supply of a controlled \nsubstance into the United States. By ``controlled substance'' we mean a \nsubstance that is either banned or regulated by the Drug Enforcement \nAgency. This ``personal use exception,'' as it is called, is well \nintentioned. It was created to allow Americans who become ill or \ninjured abroad to carry their necessary medication back to the United \nStates. I want to emphasize that this bill would by no means end that \nvery legitimate practice. That is not our intention at all. However, \nthis legislation would stop the blatant exploitation of that exemption \nwhich is allowing some drug traffickers to operate freely in the United \nStates.\n  Let me explain. Specifically, these narcotics are being legally \npurchased in another country without any sort of documentation of \nmedical need, then brought across our border, and then illegally sold \non our streets in this country. By closing this loophole, we will \nempower our law enforcement to stop what amounts to nothing more than \nanother form of drug trafficking in the United States.\n  The remedy we seek today is both effective and sensible. It would \nlimit the amount of these controlled substances that can be carried \nback to the United States by Americans to 50 doses. According to the \nDEA, that is about a 2-week supply, enough time to go get a new \nprescription before running out of that medication.\n  I would also like to note some things that this legislation will not \ndo, so we can explain it very clearly to Members. It will not change \nthe law with respect to noncontrolled prescription drugs, drugs such as \ninsulin or Premarin, and it would not affect the ability of people to \nobtain drugs to treat heart disease or cancer or AIDS or other serious \nillnesses, because these medication are not on the Controlled \nSubstances List at all. I also indicate to my colleagues\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\nthat there is support for this among the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Customs--they \nall support this approach. They recognize the problem and would like to \nsee it resolved.\n  Let me again emphasize, this legislation is not complex. All we are \nreally doing is closing a loophole to stop this illegal trafficking of \ncontrolled substances in the United States. If we are really going to \nmake drug interdiction a priority, then it makes a great deal of sense \nto take this relatively small but effective and meaningful step. We \nneed to take this step today.\n  Before closing, I would like to compliment my friend and colleague \nfrom the State of Ohio, Congressman Steve Chabot, from Cincinnati, who \nhas shown great leadership on this issue, and many issues. It was \nthrough his active and tireless efforts in raising the profile on this \nissue that I was first made aware of the problem. I look forward to \nwork with him and my other colleagues on this very important new \ninitiative. It is my hope the Senate will act quickly and decisively to \napprove this very commonsense piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I ask unanimous consent a recent \narticle that appeared in USA Today entitled ``Medications from Mexico'' \nthat explains this and illustrates the problem be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Medications From Mexico\n\n                            (By Tim Friend)\n\n       Millions of tablets of prescription sedatives, amphetamines \n     and narcotic painkillers are being brought into the U.S. from \n     Mexico, and most appear destined for recreational use or sale \n     on the street, a new study shows.\n       The 12-month study of U.S. Customs declaration forms \n     suggests serious abuse of federal laws that permit \n     individuals to buy prescription drugs in Mexico and bring \n     them back for personal use, the authors say.\n       It also suggests U.S. Customs enforcement of controlled \n     substances at the border at Laredo, Texas, is limited.\n       ``It is remarkable what is being brought back across the \n     border,'' says Marvin Shepherd of the College of Pharmacy at \n     the University of Texas at Austin. ``It's a prescription mill \n     down there.''\n       Shepherd set out to determine how many prescription drugs \n     elderly people are buying in Mexico because of the cheaper \n     prices. The study was funded by the National Association of \n     Chain Drug Stores and the Texas Pharmacy Association. They \n     were concerned that unapproved drugs were entering the U.S. \n     and that many elderly were skirting safeguards provided by \n     U.S. pharmacies.\n       Shepherd says he and the study sponsors were shocked to \n     learn that drugs declared by people over age 50 accounted for \n     only 9.4% of 5,624 claims. The median age of men purchasing \n     drugs was 24 and of women it was 35.\n       In some cases, individuals declared as many as 25 bottles \n     of Valium containing 90 pills each and 29 boxes of Percodan \n     containing 10 pills each.\n       Most people declaring the drugs obtained prescriptions in \n     Nuevo Laredo from Mexican doctors' offices, usually for $20 \n     to $30, without seeing a doctor.\n       Federal law permits prescriptions written and filled in \n     Mexico to pass through customs, says Judy Turner, U.S. \n     Customs spokeswoman. However, the policy is to allow only a \n     90-day supply of drugs.\n       ``They do see a huge amount of Valium in Laredo,'' says \n     Turner. ``But it's possible people are declaring large \n     amounts of drugs and that agents are not permitting them to \n     keep more than the limit.''\n       Customs records show agents at Laredo seized 330,089 \n     tablets of Valium and 14 other drugs in 1995. But Shepherd \n     estimates from June 1994 to July 1995, 8.7 million tablets of \n     the top 15 drugs were brought into the U.S. from Nuevo \n     Laredo.\n       Kristin McKeithan, who collected data for the study, says \n     agents sometimes enforce limits on the drugs and at other \n     times allow individuals to bring in large quantities.\n       ``When a person came through it was a really random \n     process,'' McKeithan says.\n       Leticia Moran, port director for U.S. Customs at Laredo, \n     says the situation there is complicated by large numbers of \n     people crossing the border.\n       ``There is no way my officers would allow someone to bring \n     in 25 boxes of Valium,'' Moran says. But on Saturdays, 25,000 \n     people visit Nuevo Laredo. It is impossible for customs to \n     check everyone, she says. People will get through with more \n     drugs than are allowed.\n       Ronald Ziegler, president of the chain drug association, \n     says the amounts of drugs many individuals were declaring far \n     exceed amounts considered medically appropriate.\n       ``The study cries out with the potential for abuse in \n     almost every section,'' says Ziegler. ``You can imagine that \n     if you take this from one border and expand it to other \n     border crossings across the state, it's quite profound. \n     Within this system, something has gone haywire.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nBy Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n  Daschle, Ms. Collins, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nSmith of Oregon, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Bond, Mr. DeWine, and \n                      Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n\n  S. 2244. A bill to amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to promote \nvolunteer programs and community partnerships for the benefit of \nnational wildlife refugees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\nnational wildlife refuge systems volunteer and partnership enhancement \n                                  act\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to introduce \na bill that has tremendous potential to improve management and \noperations of the National Wildlife Refuge System. This bill--the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Partnership Enhancement \nAct-- will supplement scarce Federal dollars with outside services and \ndonations by local groups and individuals. I am joined by 13 of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Senators Kempthorne, \nBaucus, Allard, Daschle, Collins, Graham, Feinstein, Jeffords, Gordon \nSmith, D'Amato, DeWine, Bond, and Faircloth.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System consists of 93 million acres in \n513 units. This is the land set aside by the Federal Government to \nprotect fish and wildlife. The Refuge System historically has received \nless funding acre-for acre than its larger and older sibling, the \nNational Park System. Despite the recent passage of the National \nWildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, the refuge system \nremains poorly funded, and has a significant backlog of construction \nand maintenance projects totaling approximately $1 billion.\n  As budgets continue to shrink, the Federal Government must look at \nalternative sources of funding and assistance. Volunteer services have \nlong helped the Refuge System, and are becoming increasingly important \nas a means of supplement decreasing Federal dollars. Indeed, the very \nfirst refuge on Pelican Island, Florida, was staffed by volunteer \nwardens. Since 1982, when the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) \nestablished a formal volunteer program, the program has grown from \n4,251 volunteers donating 128,440 hours of time to 25,000 volunteers \ndonating more than one million hours in 1996. This 1996 figure \nrepresents almost 20 percent of all work done by the FWS on the Refuge \nSystem, amounting to about $11 million worth of services, compared with \na cost of $1.7 million for maintaining the volunteer program.\n  The five refuges in my own state of Rhode Island, which are managed \nas a single complex, provide a wonderful illustration of how important \nthese effort are. Last year, volunteers donated 4,500 hours of service \nto Rhode Islands refuges. With only five full-time employers working \namong the five Rhode Island refuges, volunteers contributed 36 percent \nof all work performed on these refuges. At several of our refuges, the \ntypical visitor often will only interact with volunteer staff.\n  The ``National Wildlife Refuge System Vounterer and Partnership \nEnhancement Act'' lends must needed support to the efforts of the FWS \nto maintain and operate the Refuge System. This bill will accomplish \nfour goals: (1) encourage financial contributions and donations to \nrefuges; (2) increase opportunities and incentives for volunteers on \nrefuges; (3) promote community partnerships with local refuges; and (4) \nestablish a refuge education program to use refuges as ``outdoor \nclassrooms.''\n  Mr. President, let me give you some of the highlights in the bill. \nSection 3 of the bill allows gifts and donations to be made to \nindividual refuges without further appropriations. While this is \nsimilar to current law, the bill provides new authority for the FWS to \nmatch these gifts. This will allow refuge managers to leverage the \nprecious few dollars over which they have discretion for operations and \nmaintenance with money from local residents and groups.\n  Section 4 directs the FWS to carry out a pilot project at 2 or more \nrefuges in each region, but no more than 20 nationwide, to hire a \nvolunteer coordinator for the refuge. This coordinator\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\nwill manage and supervise the volunteers, and service as the liaison \nbetween the volunteers, the partnership organizations, and the refuge. \nIt also establishes a Senior Volunteer Corps for individuals 50 years \nor older. These older citizens comprise the majority of volunteer \nefforts throughout the refuge system. This new Corps will recognize and \nfoster that effort.\n  Section 5 provides for community partner organizations to enter into \nagreements with the FWS to implement projects consistent with the \npurposes of the refuge. The projects may improve habitat, support \noperations, promote educational materials, or encourage donations. Non-\nFederal funding may be matched by the FWS. Section 6 directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to develop guidance for education programs \nthat promotes understanding of refuge resources, improves scientific \nliteracy, and provides outdoor classroom experiences. It also \nauthorizes the Secretary to develop or enhance refuge education \nprograms based on this guidance.\n  This bill is similar to a House bill, H.R. 1856, introduced by \nCongressman Saxton on June 10, 1997, and subsequently passed by the \nHouse. I have been pleased to work with Congressman Saxton on this \nwonderful initiative, and I urge all of our colleagues to support \nit.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Chafee, the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, in introducing the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer \nand Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998.\n  This bill will promote volunteerism on our national wildlife refuges. \nBy encouraging volunteers to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService to improve our national wildlife refuges, this bill will not \nonly benefit fish and wildlife but enhance the outdoor recreation and \neducation experience for thousands of visitors.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System is a sanctuary for our nation's \nfish and wildlife, many species of which are threatened or endangered. \nIt is a sanctuary for people too, who use refuges for many purposes. \nComprising some 93 million acres spread across the country in over 500 \nindividual refuges, the system is an invaluable natural resource.\n  To ensure that the resource is conserved for future generations of \nAmericans, the Congress recently enacted legislation to guide the \nmanagement of the National Wildlife Refuge System. But even improved \nmanagement cannot make up for the lack of money. The refuge system is \nunderfunded. Without adequate financial and staff resources, we will \nnot realize the full potential of the refuge system, as envisioned by \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997.\n  One way to address this need is through the use of volunteers, \nordinary citizens who care enough about our refuges to contribute their \ntime.\n  To encourage volunteers to take a more active role in improving our \nwildlife refuges, this bill would authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to enter into cooperative agreements with partner \norganizations to undertake conservation and education projects. In \naddition, the bill would authorize the Secretary to develop refuge \neducation programs and provide for staff to assist partner \norganizations and coordinate volunteer activities.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this is a good bill and that it \ndeserves our support. It will benefit fish and wildlife, provide unique \nopportunities for citizens to donate their valuable time and expertise \nto refuges in their local communities, and enhance the refuge \nexperience for the many people who visit our refuges each year.\n  I intend to work closely with my colleague, Senator Chafee, and other \nmembers of our Committee, to help ensure that it is enacted this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 2245. A bill to require employers to notify local emergency \nofficials, under the appropriate circumstances, of workplace \nemergencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n             industrial emergency notification act of 1998\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Industrial \nEmergency Notification Act of 1998. The bill will require the U.S. \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to require that \nemployers notify local emergency officials, like police and fire \ndepartments, in the event of workplace emergencies. Passage of this \nbill will help prevent accidents such as the explosion that took the \nlives of five men three years ago at Napp Technologies in Lodi, New \nJersey.\n  One mark of our progress as a society is the extent to which we can \nguarantee every working man and woman a safe, healthy workplace. No one \nshould have to risk their health and safety to make a decent living. \nSadly, the Napp explosion showed us how far we have to go.\n  Among other things, the Napp explosion showed the loopholes that \nexist in current OSHA regulations. On the day of the explosion, after \nthe chemical mixture started smoking, Napp management clearly knew they \nhad a chemical emergency on their hands, yet they ordered the \nevacuation by word of mouth rather than by alarm, resulting in a lack \nof notification to the fire department. Then, still without notifying \nlocal emergency officials, which even common sense would have dictated, \nthey sent the workers back in to their deaths. After all this, one \nwould think OSHA would have had the basis for a strong enforcement \naction against Napp. Yet after the explosion, OSHA officials were \nunable to cite Napp for not contacting local emergency officials \nbecause there was no clear enforceable requirement to do so.\n  Current OSHA standards on workplace emergencies and emergency \nresponse require employers to coordinate with local response \nauthorities, leaving the final decision for notification to employers' \ndiscretion--rather than specifying clear minimum criteria for \nnotification. The compliance directive recently released by OSHA on \nthis standard elaborates on this requirement, but fails to close this \ngap.\n  The Industrial Emergency Notification Act of 1998 will require OSHA \nto require that employers notify local emergency officials in the event \nof workplace emergencies. OSHA shall specify, as appropriate, the \ncircumstances under which emergency notification is required, such as \nworkplace evacuation. Also, the legislation will codify OSHA's recent \ncompliance directive, which requires employers to develop emergency \nresponse procedures in cooperation with local emergency officials.\n  It is both possible and important to list the circumstances under \nwhich local emergency officials should be notified, rather than leaving \nsuch notification to the discretion of a potentially harried business \nmanager. Also it is vital that OSHA's authority include the ability to \ntake appropriate enforcement action against negligence, after \ninadequate notification and the resulting workplace injuries or deaths. \nFinally, in addition to the importance of this legislation in improving \nworkplace safety, to the extent that local emergency officials can help \ncontrol the chemical releases associated with workplace emergencies, \nthis legislation will provide important environmental protection \nbenefits as well.\n  The bill is endorsed by the American Federation of Labor, Congress of \nIndustrial Organizations, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and \nTextile Employees, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International \nUnion, the International Chemical Workers Union Council of the United \nFood and Commercial Workers, the International Union of Operating \nEngineers, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2245\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Subsequently, the National Park \n     Service reimburses the District for medical payments made on \n     behalf of the Park Police. Fiscal constraints experienced by \n     the District have resulted in untimely payments of these \n     expenses. Consequently, some Park Police members have been \n     denied treatment and others have had their credit ratings \n     adversely affected. This situation is untenable. It \n     compromises the law enforcement capability of the Park Police \n     and places an undue burden on Park Police employees. the \n     enclosed draft legislation would amend the Act of September \n     1, 1916, section 12(e), to allow the National Park Service to \n     make these payments directly to the medical providers. \n     Amended language is urgently needed. We respectfully request \n     that this draft legislation be expedited.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Donald Barry,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n     Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       This bill amends the Act of September 1, 1916, section \n     12(e), to allow the National Park Service to pay medical \n     providers directly for expenses incurred by the U.S. Park \n     Police while on official duty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2248.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Administration, \ntoday I introduce legislation to allow for wavier and indemnification \nin mutual law enforcement agreements between the National Park Service \nand a state or political subdivision, when required by state law, and \nfor other purposes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Administration's letter of \ntransmittal and a section-by-section analysis of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record for the information of my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill, ``To allow \n     for waiver and indemnification in mutual law enforcement \n     agreements between the National Park Service and a state or \n     political subdivision, when required by state law, and for \n     other purposes.''\n       We recommend the bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       This amendment would provide express authority for the \n     National Park Service to enter into mutual aid agreements \n     with adjacent law enforcement agencies. Pursuant to statutory \n     authorities, the Park Police have maintained memoranda of \n     understandings with local law enforcement agencies in \n     Maryland and Virginia. These agreements specify the \n     circumstances under which these agencies will assist the Park \n     Police. Both Maryland and Virginia laws require that each \n     party must agree to indemnify and hold harmless the assisting \n     agency from all claims by third parties for property damage \n     or personal injury, which may arise out of the assisting \n     agency's activities outside its respective jurisdiction.\n       The Comptroller General issued a decision on August 16, \n     1991, which stated that such indemnification clauses violate \n     the Anti-deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341(a)). The Comptroller \n     General stated:\n       ``[O]pen-ended indemnification agreements should not be \n     entered into regardless of the existence of language of \n     limitations except with express congressional acquiesence. . \n     . . Thus we recommend that the Park Police obtain \n     congressional approval for this type of arrangement.''\n       The Comptroller General further recognized the importance \n     of memoranda of understandings between the Park Police and \n     local authorities for effective law enforcement, and stated, \n     ``. . . we will not object to the Park Police temporarily \n     entering into revised agreements with the required \n     indemnification clauses while congressional approval is being \n     sought.''\n       Although the opinions of the Comptroller General are not \n     binding on Executive Branch\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\n     departments, they often provide useful guidance on \n     appropriations matters and related issues. Because it raises \n     questions as to Interior's indemnification authority, the \n     Comptroller General's opinion may impede Interior's efforts \n     to maintain intergovernmental cooperation in the policing of \n     national parks. The amendment that we have proposed would \n     eliminate this potential impediment.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Donald Barry,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n     Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1: This section renumbers paragraphs and adds a new \n     section c(3), which would provide express statutory authority \n     for the National Park Service to use indemnification clauses \n     in their mutual aid agreements with a state or political \n     subdivision for law enforcement purposes, when required by \n     state law.\n       Section 2: This section makes a technical \n     correction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2249. A bill to provide retirement security for all Americans; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     Retirement Accessibility, Security and Portability Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, Democrats are offering identical \nbills in the House and the Senate--the ``Retirement Accessibility, \nSecurity and Portability Act of 1998''--to make the prospect of \nretirement less frightening for millions of American workers. Right \nnow, just under half of all American workers have pension plans, and \nthe number is far worse for women and low- and moderate-income workers.\n  Our plan would increase the number of Americans with pensions by \nmaking it easier and cheaper for small businesses to set up pension \nfunds. It would create a new system to help workers who have no pension \ncoverage to build their own retirement savings through direct \ncontributions from their paychecks into an IRA.\n  Our plan would make it easier for workers to take their pensions with \nthem from one job to the next. This is incredibly important in an \neconomy where the average worker will change careers an average of 7 \ntimes.\n  Our plan would increase pension security to ensure retirees will \nactually have a pension when they leave the work force. And, it would \nhelp close the huge pension gap that now exists between men and women \nand that leaves far too many older women who are widowed or divorced \nliving in near-poverty.\n  Mr. President, I talk frequently to people all the time who are \nworried they won't be able to afford the ``luxury'' of retirement. I \nsay, we can't afford the luxury of ignoring the coming retirement \ncrisis. Retirement shouldn't mean an economic freefall. And it doesn't \nhave to.\n  The first of the baby boomers turns 50 this year. We still have time \nto make the changes that will allow us to enjoy a secure retirement. \nBut it will take change from individuals, employers and from the \ngovernment.\n  That's what this bill provides.\n  This bill would expand pension coverage and access to more Americans \nby establishing an easy-to-administer defined benefit plan option for \nsmall businesses known as the SMART Plan; providing a maximum credit of \n$1,000 to help small business cover the cost of setting up new pension \nplans; and modifying new rules for the ``SIMPLE'' and 401(k) plans to \nencourage the provision of pensions to low-to-moderate income \nemployees.\n  This bill would encourage pension portability by requiring faster \nvesting of employers' matching contributions under defined contribution \nplans, including 401(k) plans, so that employees would have rights to \nthe contributions after the least 3 years of employment; allowing \nrollovers between 401(k) and similar plans set up by non-profit \norganizations, including 403(b) plans; and allowing participants in \nplans set up by state and local governments to roll over their account \nbalances to IRAs.\n\n  This bill would protect and strengthen pensions by establishing \ngreater safeguards to prevent corporations from raiding their \nemployees' pension plans; creating stricter requirements for audits of \nplan assets and how companies are investing these assets; prohibiting \nemployers from making credit card loans against pension assets; and \nproviding pension plan participants with regular and informative \nbenefit statements so they can monitor the activity and value of their \npension assets.\n  In addition, this bill would reduce the wide gap in pension coverage \nbetween men and women, as well as provide greater protections for older \nwomen by creating new safeguards to ensure that pension benefits are \nnot overlooked when a couple divides assets upon divorce; a new option \nfor federal workers to provide a greater benefit for women who outlive \ntheir husbands; protections for low-income women against the loss of \ntheir Social Security benefits; a new women's pension information \nhotline; and a requirement that additional hours taken under the Family \nand Medical leave Act are credited to one's pension plan for purposes \nof participation and vesting in their plan benefits.\n  In 1994, President Clinton signed a bill protecting the pensions of \nmore than 40 million American workers and retirees against risky \ninvestments and corporate raids. In 1996, he signed additional \nlegislation cutting red tape and start-up costs for pension plans, so \nmore small businesses could create retirement plans for their workers.\n  Before 1998 is over, we intend to give the President another \nretirement security bill to sign.\n  This Congress has done precious little so far to address the concerns \nof America's working families. passing this bill--increasing Americans' \nretirement security--would do a lot to fill that void. We urge our \nRepublican colleagues to join us in passing it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the rights of the States and the people \nfrom abuse by the Federal Government, to strengthen the partnership and \nthe intergovernmental relationship between State and Federal \nGovernments, to restrain Federal agencies from exceeding their \nauthority, to enforce the Tenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                    tenth amendment enforcement act\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tenth \nAmendment Enforcement Act of 1998. The Tenth Amendment was a promise to \nthe States and to the American people that the Federal Government would \nbe limited, and that the people of the States could, for the most part, \ngovern themselves as they saw fit. Unfortunately, in the last half \ncentury, that promise has been broken. The American people have asked \nus to start honoring that promise again: To return power to State and \nlocal governments which are close to and more sensitive to the needs of \nthe people.\n  We took an important first step in the 104th Congress by enacting the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act. It began the shift of power out of \nWashington and back to the States and to the American people. Today we \ncontinue that process. The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998 will \nreturn power to the States and to the people by placing safeguards in \nthe legislative process, by restricting the power of Federal agencies \nand by instructing the Federal courts to enforce the Tenth Amendment.\n  The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998 enforces the Tenth \namendment in five ways. First, it includes a specific congressional \nfinding that the Federal Government has no powers not delegated by the \nConstitution, and the States may exercise all powers not withheld by \nthe Constitution. In other words, the Tenth Amendment means what it \nsays.\n  Second, this proposal states that Federal laws may not interfere with \nState or local powers unless Congress declares its intent to preempt \nand specifically cites its constitutional authority to act.\n  Third, it enforces this declaration by establishing a point of order \nthat allows any Congressman or Senator to challenge a bill lacking such \na declaration or insufficiently citing constitutional authority. Such a \npoint of order would require a three-fifths majority to be defeated.\n  Fourth, it requires that Federal agency rules and regulations not \ninterfere with State or local powers without constitutional authority \ncited by Congress. Agencies must allow States notice and an opportunity \nto be heard in the rulemaking process.\n  Fifth, the proposal directs the courts to strictly construe Federal \nlaws and regulations interfering with State powers. It requires a \npresumption in favor of State authority and against Federal preemption.\n  Too often in Washington, there is the temptation to weakening our \nFederal system of government. It has been stated that just as the \nseparation and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal \nGovernment serves to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any \none branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and the \nFederal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from \neither front. We have an obligation to take steps to prevent such \nthings from happening and to preserve the freedom and liberties we \nenjoy. I believe the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998 is an \nimportant step and urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2253. A bill to establish a matching grant program to help State \nand local jurisdictions purchase bullet resistant equipment for use by \nlaw enforcement departments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to help \nour nation's state and local law enforcement officers acquire the \nbullet resistant equipment they need to protect themselves from would-\nbe killers. This bill, the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police \nProtective Equipment Act of 1998, is named after a Cortez, Colorado, \npolice officer who was fatally shot through the windshield of his \npatrol car on May 29, 1998, after stopping a stolen truck. Officer \nClaxton was tragically and prematurely taken away from his wife and \nfour children. Today, two of the three suspects are still at large, \neven after an extensive manhunt.\n  Unfortunately, this type of incident is far from isolated. All across \nour nation law enforcement officers, whether parked on the side of the \nroad or in hot pursuit, are at risk of being shot through their \nwindshields. Another example that many of my colleagues may be aware of \nis the brutal murder of the District of Columbia's Officer Brian \nGibson, who was ambushed and shot while sitting in his patrol car. We \nmust do what we can to prevent tragedies like this.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I am personally aware of the dangers \nwhich law enforcement officers face on the front lines every day. One \nway in which the federal government can improve their safety is to help \nthem acquire bullet resistant glass and other equipment for patrol \ncars. These partnership grants are especially crucial for officers who \nserve in small local jurisdictions that often lack the funds to provide \ntheir officers with all of the life saving equipment they may need.\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\n  The Officer Dale Claxton bill builds on the impact of the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act, S. 1605, which I introduced and the \nPresident signed into law on June 16, 1998. This new program provides \ngrants to law enforcement agencies to purchase body armor for their \nofficers. The Officer Dale Claxton bill extends this protection to \ninclude bullet resistant equipment for the officers' vehicles, shields, \nand any other equipment that officers may need when they are serving \nout on the front lines of law enforcement.\n  The bill I introduce today has two major components. The first is to \nprovide a matching grant program for state, county, local and tribal \nlaw enforcement agencies. This legislation would authorize the \nDepartment of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to administer a \n$40 million matching grant program to assist these agencies purchase \nbullet resistant equipment for patrol cars, including bullet resistant \nglass, panels, and other safety devices.\n  The program will provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law \nenforcement agencies and Indian tribes to assist in purchasing \nbulletproof vests and body armor. To ensure that the funding goes first \nto those police departments which need it most, the Director of the \nBureau of Justice Assistance is given discretion to give preferential \nconsideration to smaller departments whose budgets are scarce.\n  Additionally, those jurisdictions which do not receive any funding \nunder the local law enforcement block grant program will be given \npreference. Furthermore, at least half of the funds available under \nthis program will be awarded to jurisdictions with less than 100,000 \nresidents.\n  The second component of this legislation would launch an expedited \nand targeted research and development effort to come up with new \ntechnologies and products. Promising new light-weight bullet proof \nmaterials now being developed could be as revolutionary in the year \n2000 as the development of Kevlar was in the 1970s for the manufacture \nof body armor. These exciting new technologies promise to be lighter, \nmore versatile and hopefully less expensive than traditional heavy \nbulletproof glass.\n  The Officer Dale Claxton bill authorizes $3 million over 3 years for \nthe Justice Department's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to conduct \nresearch and development of a new bullet resistant technologies, such \nas bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized material, and \ntransparent ceramics. This R and D program would focus on specialized \nequipment, including windshield glass, car panels, police shields and \nother types of protective gear.\n  The Officer Dale Claxton bill directs the National Institute of \nJustice to inventory existing technologies in the private sector, in \nsurplus military property, and in use by other countries. The bill also \ndirects the Institute to conduct: standards development; technology \ndevelopment; technical testing; operational testing; evaluation; and \ntechnology transfer.\n  Under the bill, the Institute would give priority in testing and \nengineering surveys to law enforcement partnerships developed in \ncoordination with existing High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \n(HIDTAs).\n  Our nation's police officers, sheriffs and deputies regularly put \ntheir lives in harm's way as they protect the people and preserve the \npeace. They deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment \nthey need. The Officer Dale Claxton bill will both accelerate the \ndevelopment of new lifesaving bullet resistant technologies and then \nhelp get them deployed into the field where they are needed. Lives will \nbe saved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bullet \n     Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police \n     Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through \n     the windshield of his police car after he stopped a stolen \n     truck, and his life may have been saved if his police car had \n     been equipped with bullet resistant equipment;\n       (2) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States had access to \n     additional bullet resistant equipment;\n       (3) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n     enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       (4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n     risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not \n     wearing bullet resistant equipment, such as an armor vest, is \n     14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor vest;\n       (5) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet-\n     resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 \n     law enforcement officers in the United States; and\n       (6) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply, despite a decrease in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of \n     law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal \n     law enforcement agencies provide officers with bullet \n     resistant equipment.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the establishment of an assistance \nprogram for health insurance consumers; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                THE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n   Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Health Care \nConsumer Assistance Act. This legislation creates a consumer assistance \nprogram that is key to patient protections in the health insurance \nmarket.\n  President Clinton's Health Quality Commission stated in its recently \nreleased Bill of Rights that consumers have the right to receive \naccurate, easily understood information and get assistance in making \ninformed decisions about health plans and providers. Today, only a \nloose patchwork of consumer assistance services exists. And, while a \nnumber of sources provide assistance, most programs are limited. Many \nconsumer groups have advocated for the establishment of consumer \nassistance programs to support consumers' growing need of information.\n  The legislation I am introducing today gives states grants to \nestablish nonprofit, private consumer assistance program designed to \nhelp consumers understand and act on their health care choices, rights \nand responsibilities. Under my bill, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices will make available funds for states to select an independent, \nnonprofit agency to provide the following services to consumers: \nprovide information to consumers relating to their choices, rights and \nresponsibilities within the plans they select; operate 1-800 telephone \nhotlines to respond to consumer information, advice and assistance \nrequests; produce and disseminate educational materials about patients' \nrights; provide assistance and representation to people who wish to \nappeal the denial, termination, or reduction of health care services, \nor a refusal to pay for health services; and collect and disseminate \ndata about inquiries, problems and grievances handled by the consumer \nassistance program.\n  This program has been championed by Ron Pollack of Families USA, a \nmember of the President's Commission on Quality, as well as numerous \nother consumer advocates.\n  Mr. President, I have joined with many of my Democratic colleagues in \nsponsoring S.1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998. I am \npleased that S.1890 would establish a consumer assistance program, \nsimilar to that established by my legislation. My purpose today is to \nemphasize the importance of such a consumer protection program. This \nlegislation is not without controversy, but I believe that American \nconsumers deserve protection and assistance as they attempt to navigate \nthe often confusing and complex world of health insurance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Consumer \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall award \n     grants to States to enable such States to enter into \n     contracts for the establishment of consumer assistance \n     programs designed to assist consumers of health insurance in \n     understanding their rights, responsibilities and choices \n     among health insurance products.\n       (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     this section a State shall prepare and submit to the \n     Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and \n     containing such information as the Secretary may require, \n     including a State plan that describes--\n       (1) the manner in which the State will solicit proposals \n     for, and enter into a contract with, an entity eligible under \n     section 3 to serve as the health insurance consumer office \n     for the State; and\n       (2) the manner in which the State will ensure that advice \n     and assistance services for health insurance consumers are \n     coordinated through the office described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Amount of Grant.--\n       (1) In general.--From amounts appropriated under section 5 \n     for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall award a grant to a \n     State in an amount that bears the same ratio to such amounts \n     as the number of individuals within the State covered under a \n     health insurance plan (as determined by the Secretary) bears \n     to the total number of individuals covered under a health \n     insurance plan in all States (as determined by the \n     Secretary).

A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nprohibit the Secretary of Agriculture from including any storage \ncharges in the calculation of loan deficiency payments or loans made to \nproducers for loan commodities; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and forestry.\n\n\n             agricultural market transition act amendments\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \ngive some relief to the taxpayers of this country, who now pay millions \nevery year to cover the storage costs of cotton farmers. This year \nalone, this program has provided more than $23 million to store the \ncotton crop of participating farmers. This measure puts all commodities \non a more equal footing by eliminating the storage subsidy for cotton, \nthe only commodity that still enjoys that privilege.\n\n  Mr. President, prior to the passage of the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill, \nfarmers producing wheat and feed grains relied heavily on the Farmer \nOwned Reserve Program to assist them in repaying their overdue loans \nwhen times were tough. They would roll their non-recourse loans into \nthe Farmer Owned Reserve Program which would allow them the opportunity \nto pay back their loan, without interest, and also get assistance in \npaying storage costs. Although cotton producers were not eligible to \nparticipate in that particular program, they were offered the same \nopportunities and others through the heavily subsidized cotton program. \nThose were the days of heavy agriculture subsidization, when the \ngovernment dictated prices, provided price supports, and more often \nthan not, had over-surpluses of wheat, corn and other feed grains--\ndriving down domestic prices. The 1996 Farm Bill, sought to bring farm \npolicy up to date with prevailing modern agricultural thought--that the \nagriculture industry must be more market oriented--must survive with \nminimal government price interference.\n  Mr. President, although the Farm Bill was successful in ridding \nagriculture policy of much of the weight of government intrusion that \nburdened it for years, there are still hidden subsidies costing \ntaxpayers billions. This legislation would prevent USDA from factoring \ncotton industry storage costs into Marketing Loan Program calculations. \nThis costly and unnecessary benefit is bestowed on no other commodity.\n  Farmers, except those who produce cotton, are required to pay storage \ncost through the maturity date of their support loans. Producers must \nprepay or arrange to pay storage costs through the loan maturity date \nor USDA reduces the amount of the loan by deducting the amount \nnecessary for prepaid storage. Cotton producers are not required to \nprepay storage costs. When they redeem a loan under marketing loan \nprovisions or forfeit collateral, USDA pays the cost of accrued \nstorage.\n  It is interesting to note, Mr. President, that in a 1994 audit of the \ncotton program, USDA's Office of Inspector General found no reason for \nUSDA to pay for the accrued storage costs of cotton producers. The \nInspector General recommended that USDA ``revise procedures to \neliminate the automatic payment of cotton storage charges by CCC and \nmake provisions consistent with the treatment of storage charges on \nother program crops''.\n  Although those in the cotton industry will argue that the automatic \npayments were eliminated in the Farm Bill, in reality, those payments \nare now simply hidden. It's true that certain provisions have been \nremoved from the statute which mandates that USDA pay these charges. \nNow, USDA freely chooses to waste the taxpayers money by paying these \ncosts, allowing cotton producers to subtract their storage costs from \nthe market value of their cotton, providing a larger difference with \nthe loan rate, and therefore receiving a higher return.\n  Marketing Loan Programs are designed to encourage producers to redeem \ntheir loans and market their crops, but USDA payment of cotton storage \ncosts discourage loan redemption. As long as the adjusted world\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nprice is at or below the loan rate, producers can delay loan redemption \nin the secure expectation that domestic prices will rise or the \nadjusted world price will decline regardless of accruing storage costs.\n  Mr. President, its time to stop kidding ourselves. Let's eliminate \nthis subsidy before it costs hardworking Americans any more. Let's \nbring equity to the commodities program. Lets finish what the Farm Bill \nstarted--a more market oriented agriculture program. One that benefits \nus all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STORAGE CHARGES FOR LOAN COMMODITIES.\n\n       Subtitle C of the Agricultural market Transition Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 7231 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 138. STORAGE CHARGES FOR LOAN COMMODITIES.\n\n       ``In calculating the amount of a loan deficiency payment or \n     loan made to a producer for a loan commodity under this \n     subtitle, the Secretary may not include any storage charges \n     incurred by the producer in connection with the loan \n     commodity.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 2256. A bill to provide an authorized strength for commissioned \nofficers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\nTHE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION CORPS CONTINUATION \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwill relieve the hiring freeze on the Commissioned Corps of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), that was first \nimposed following the 1995 National Performance Review. I want to thank \nSenators Snowe, Hollings, and Stevens, who have joined me in \ncosponsoring this legislation, for their continued leadership on this \nissue. This legislation represents another milestone in their \nconsistent stewardship of the NOAA Corps and the very important part it \nplays in NOAA and to our Nation. This legislation will restore \nstability and renew the good faith contract made with the men and women \nthat make up the NOAA Corps by establishing a minimum and maximum \nauthorized strength for our nation's seventh uniformed service.\n  The NOAA Corps is an indispensable part of NOAA: a pool of \nprofessionals trained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, \nmeteorology, fisheries science, and other related disciplines. Corps \nofficers serve in assignments within the five major line offices of \nNOAA. They operate ships, fly aircraft into hurricanes, lead mobile \nfield parties, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and \nserve in staff positions throughout NOAA. They operate the ships that \nset buoys used to gather oceanographic and meteorological data on \nunusual weather phenomena such as El Nino. They fly research aircraft \ninto hurricanes that record valuable atmospheric observations. They \nconduct hydrographic surveys along our nation's coast in order to make \nour waters safe for maritime commerce.\n  Over three years ago, the Administration proposed that the NOAA Corps \nbe disestablished and unilaterally imposed a hiring freeze. This action \nwas based on flawed recommendations by the President's National \nPerformance Review. A thorough review of the cost studies associated \nwith the dissolution of the NOAA Corps clearly reflects that no real \nsavings will be achieved over either the short or long term. In fact, \nwithout commissioned officers, NOAA may incur significant additional \ncosts in the acquisition of data to fulfill its statutory missions. \nFurther, recent data indicate that factors such as tort liability were \nnot even considered as part of the total cost-benefit analysis. The \nAdministration has ignored the fact that Congress alone has the \nauthority to set the duties and strength of the uniformed services and \nCongress alone must act for the NOAA Corps to be disestablished. I am \nconvinced that the preponderance of evidence supports the need for the \nNOAA Corps to be retained, not disestablished. This legislation will \nensure that the pearl of expertise that resides in the men and women \nwho make up the NOAA Corps is retained for the nation.\n  The NOAA Corps hiring freeze has been tantamount to slow motion \ndissolution of our nation's seventh uniformed service. At the time the \nfreeze was imposed, the NOAA Corps had a strength of 411 officers. At \nthe end of this fiscal year, the projected on-board strength will be \n235 officers. Through this three years of adversity, the NOAA Corps has \nheroically continued to sail NOAA's fleet and fly its aircraft. At its \ncurrent diminished personnel levels, I have become deeply concerned \nregarding the NOAA Corps' ability to carry out its mission. In \naddition, I am also concerned about the safety of the men and women \naboard NOAA ships and aircraft.\n  Last week, Dr. James Baker, the Administrator of NOAA, announced a \nplan for restructuring the NOAA Corps. This plan calls for a further \nreduction of the Corps strength from its current level of 248 officers \nto 240 officers. In addition, it calls for a civilian Senior Executive \nService member to manage the Corps. This restructuring plan will \nmaintain a cloud of uncertainty over the future of the NOAA Corps, \ndiminishing its viability and culminating in its ultimate elimination.\n  The proposed level of 240 officers will be inadequate to staff NOAA \nships and aircraft. There are currently 70 officer billets aboard NOAA \nvessels. Assuming that a NOAA Corps officer spends one third of his or \nher career at sea, which is the norm in other seagoing services, a \nrequirement exists for 210 seagoing officer billets. Likewise, there \nare 36 billets aboard NOAA aircraft. Assuming that an officer flies for \ntwo years and is moved to an office support billet for one year, a \nrequirement exists for 54 aviator billets. Therefore, the minimum \nstaffing requirement to maintain a viable NOAA Corps is 264 officers. \nAll services allow for 10 to 15 percent of their personnel to be in a \ngeneral detail status (i.e. training classes, travel and temporary \nduty). Therefore, I endorse staffing the NOAA Corps at a floor of 264 \nand a ceiling of 299 officer billets which corresponds to a general \ndetail percentage that is consistent with the practices of other \nuniformed services. This level is consistent with the already-achieved \nreduction of 130 billets that was recommended by the National \nPerformance Review.\n  The proposal to establish a civilian position to manage the NOAA \nCorps in place of the current flag officer creates an extra layer of \nmanagement that is not required. A NOAA Corps flag officer is required \nto carry out NOAA fleet business with flag officers of the other \nservices. As the civilian Administrator of NOAA, Dr. Baker is in a \nposition to oversee the NOAA Corps, working with its senior flag \nofficer.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will establish staffing levels for \nthe NOAA Corps that will provide some assurance of long term viability. \nIt will establish a floor strength of 264 officers with a ceiling of \n299 officers. It is time that we reaffirm our commitment to studying \nthe earth's oceans and atmosphere by insuring that the NOAA Corps is \nstaffed at the appropriate level.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration Corps Continuation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Tracing its roots back to 1807 when President Thomas \n     Jefferson signed a bill for the ``Survey of the Coast'', the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps has \n     served the armed services and the Nation consistently and \n     ably for almost two centuries.\n       (2) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     Corps is a dedicated and specialized uniformed officer corps \n     that operates vessels and planes, provides important \n     scientific and technical services, and carrier out \n     programmatic responsibilities throughout the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration.\n       (3) The smallest of the seven uniformed services, the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps grew in \n     size\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\n     from 275 officers in 1970, the year the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration was created, to 411 officers in \n     1994.\n       (4) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     Corps has met or exceeded the 1996 National Performance \n     Review recommendation which called for a reduction of 130 \n     officers from the 1994 level.\n       (5) Federally-sponsored studies conclude that no immediate \n     or long-term cost savings would be achieved by replacing the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps with a \n     comparable civilian entity.\n       (6) As a result of the hiring freeze imposed on the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps, \n     positions necessary to maintain the statutorily mandated \n     operation of the vessel and aircraft fleets of the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have not been filled, \n     valuable research work has been delayed, and the hydrography \n     expertise of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, that is critical to the international trade \n     of the United States, has been compromised.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZED NUMBER OF COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.\n\n       Section 2 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Commissioned \n     Officers' Act of 1948 (33 U.S.C. 853a) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (a) through (3) as \n     subsections (b) through (f), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting before subsection (b), as redesignated, \n     the following:\n       ``(a) There are authorized to be not less than 264 and not \n     more than 299 commissioned officers on the active list of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC \n                   AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION CORPS.\n\n       Section 24(a) of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Commissioned \n     Officers' Act of 1948 (33 U.S.C. 853u(a)) is amended by \n     inserting ``One such position shall be the director of the \n     commissioned officers who shall be appointed from the \n     officers on the active duty promotion list serving in or \n     above the grade of captain, and who shall be responsible for \n     administration of the commissioned officers, and for \n     oversight of the operation of the vessel and aircraft fleets, \n     of the Administration.'' before ``An officer''.\n\n     SEC. 5. RELIEF FROM HIRING FREEZE.\n\n       The Secretary of Commerce immediately shall relieve the \n     moratorium on new appointments of commissioned officers to \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Commerce \nCommittee colleagues Senators Kerry, Stevens, and Hollings in \nintroducing legislation today to reauthorize the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps.\n  The NOAA Corps is a uniformed officer service that fulfills a variety \nof important missions for the agency and the public. NOAA Corps \nofficers manage the operations of NOAA's research and survey vessels, \nas well as its aircraft. They serve as pilots and navigators, and as \nkey scientific and engineering personnel involved with the missions for \nwhich the vessels and aircraft are being used. These missions include \nfisheries research, hydrographic surveys, oceanographic research, and \nairborne research on hurricanes, among others.\n  In addition to field missions, NOAA Corps officers perform a variety \nof shoreside tasks, from managing the ground support for the vessel and \naircraft operations, to serving in management and technical support \npositions in offices throughout NOAA's line agencies.\n  At the outbreak of World War I, personnel and equipment from the \nCoast and Geodetic Survey--one of NOAA's predecessor organizations--\nwere transferred to the War Department for military missions during the \nwar, and the personnel were given military commissions. In World War \nII, about half of the Survey's commissioned officers and vessels were \ntransferred to the war effort. Although all Survey personnel resumed \ncivilian duties after the war, the commissioned Corps has continued to \nexist since that time.\n  But in recent years, some questioned whether it still makes sense to \nretain a uniformed Corps to perform these missions for NOAA. As part of \nits National Performance Review in 1994, the Clinton Administration \ndetermined that a uniformed Corps was no longer necessary, and it \nrecommended that the organization be disestablished and replaced with a \ncivilian staff. The Administration argued that the disestablishment of \nthe Corps would result in some budget savings to the federal government \nand increase operational flexibility.\n  Unfortunately, the Congress did not receive a legislative proposal \nfor disestablishment from the Administration until May of last year, \nand in the interim, the Corps was subject to administrative hiring \nfreezes and annual appropriations riders that whittled the Corps' ranks \nby more than 25%. Since last year, the Corps has continued to shrink \nthrough attrition. Understandably, the morale of the Corps members has \nbeen negatively affected by these actions and the uncertainty about \ntheir future. As a result of these developments combined, important \nNOAA operations have been negatively affected.\n  Last fall, the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, which I chair, \nheld a hearing on the Administration's disestablishment proposal. The \nAdministration claimed that the replacement of the Corps with civilian \npersonnel would save $2 million or more annually for the Federal \ngovernment, primarily because of lower retirement costs for a civilian \nworkforce. But upon examination by the Subcommittee, these estimated \nsavings appeared to be suspect. The non-retirement costs of a civilian \nworkforce could be much higher than the Administration estimated, and \nthe likelihood of finding qualified civilians to replace the Corps \nofficers in a short period of time is likewise very uncertain. In my \nview, the budget savings achieved by disestablishing the Corps would be \nmarginal at best, but the American people would be losing a highly \ndedicated and professional cadre of men and women to perform many of \nNOAA's essential missions.\n  Very recently, the Administration reconsidered its disestablishment \nproposal and has decided to abandon it. The Administration now proposes \nto maintain a streamlined NOAA Corps of 240 officers. While I \nappreciate the Administration's willingness to honestly reassess a \nproposal that it had advocated since 1994, I fear that the 240 number \nis too low to effectively operate NOAA's vessels, aircraft, and \nassociated support units. The bill that we are introducing today \nreauthorizes the Corps and establishes a force range of between 264 and \n299 officers. This represents a substantial down-sizing of the Corps \nfrom a level of over 400 in 1994, but it ensures that a sufficient \nnumber of officers will be available to maintain NOAA's missions at a \nhigh level of effectiveness while providing a substantial degree of \nmanagement flexibility to the agency. The bill also requires the \nAdministration to immediately rescind the current moratorium on the \ncommissioning of new officers and it requires the director of the Corps \nto be a Corps officer.\n  This legislation is the product of careful examination and \ndeliberation by the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries and it \nrepresents a responsible solution to a problem that has been lingering \nfor four years. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, Senators Kerry, Snowe, \nStevens, and I are introducing a bill which will address the future of \nthe smallest of this Nation's seven uniformed services, the \ncommissioned officer corps (Corps) of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA). This bill will set a floor on Corps \nofficers of 264 and a ceiling of 299, designate a flag officer as the \nDirector of the Corps, and lift the hiring freeze on NOAA Corps \nofficers.\n  Let me be clear at the outset. Since 1995 when the Administration \nproposed the disestablishment of the NOAA Corps, I have thought it was \na solution in search of a problem. The NOAA Corps is a dedicated and \nhighly skilled group of men and women who have served this Nation \nconsistently and ably for almost two centuries. This uniformed officer \ncorps operates NOAA vessels and planes, provides important scientific \nand technical services, and carries out programmatic responsibilities \nthroughout the agency.\n  NOAA Corps officers do more than routine work; they maintain an \nability to provide a specialized, rapid response in emergencies. The \nactions of the NOAA ship, RUDE, after the tragic crash of TWA Flight \n800 demonstrate the importance of the Corps' work to NOAA and to the \nNation. Managed and operated by NOAA Corps officers, the RUDE's sonar \ncapabilities were used to locate crash debris and map the wreckage. In \naddition, ship officers served as liaison between Navy divers and \nmembers of the National Transportation Safety Board. The NOAA officers \naboard the RUDE and those on-shore directing charting operations \nimpressed the other myriad agencies who\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\nresponded to the disaster, even earning the Coast Guard's Public \nService Commendation. As one newspaper headline put it, ``Obscure team \ngains respect at TWA site.''\n  Corps officers also pilot NOAA aircraft through hurricanes at low \naltitudes, the only pilots trained with such skills anywhere in the \nworld. The information they collect is essential for projecting the \ntrack and strength of hurricanes so that people in the path can \nprepare.\n  It should be clear to all of us that the NOAA Corps provides a unique \nand valuable service. Speaking frankly, I do not understand the efforts \nto disestablish the Corps or let it wither and die through a hiring \nfreeze. None of the studies on converting the Corps to civilian status \nhave shown a significant cost savings. A GAO study showed savings of 2 \npercent, another study by Arthur Andersen showed a cost increase of 2 \npercent, and the Hay/Huggins report concluded that costs were \nessentially the same for the Corps or civilians. It seems to me that \nthere is not a justification for doing away with the Corps based on \nthese studies of cost savings.\n  This is an issue that must be resolved. The Corps has not been \npermitted to recruit new officers since October 1994, and this \nmethodical, de factor elimination of positions has continued without \nthe oversight of approval of the Congress. While we have been \ndiscussing the issue, the natural retirements and attribution of time \nhave been slowly bleeding the strength out of the NOAA Corps. The Corps \nstands now at 248 members, down 44 percent from its highest level of \n439 in 1995.\n  That is why we are introducing the NOAA Corps Continuation Act today. \nWe cannot let the members of this service continue in limbo. NOAA's \nrecently released plan to restructure the Corps is not acceptable. It \ntakes into account neither the reductions in personnel already achieved \nnor the need for officers to have shore assignments.

Mr. President, today I introduce a measure to extend \nthe authorization for appropriations for the National Historic \nPreservation Fund, as established in the Historic Preservation Act \nAmendments of 1976. On September 30, 1997, the authorization for \ndeposits into the Historic Preservation Fund from revenues due and \npayable to the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \nAct expired. I am introducing this legislation today with the purpose \nin mind of re-authorizing the deposits at the same level of \n$150,000,000 annually through the year 2004.\n  The Historic Preservation Fund is based on the idea that a part of \nproceeds from depletion of a non-renewable resource, off shore gas and \noil, should be invested in the enhancement of other non-renewable \nresources: historic properties. The Historic Preservation Fund account \nsupports roughly half the cost of the Nation's historic preservation \nprogram as created by the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n470). State governments contribute the other half of the cost. This is \na true Federal-State partnership.\n  States and certain local governments and Indian tribes carry out the \nNation's historic preservation program under the Act for the Secretary \nof the Interior and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. The \nhistoric preservation program involves the identification of historic \nplaces, working with property owners in nominating significant places \nto the National Register, consulting with federal agencies on projects \nthat may adversely impact historic places, advising investors on tax \ncredits for the rehabilitation of historic buildings, and offering \ninformation and educational opportunities to the private and public \nsectors on historic preservation.\n  The national historic preservation program, made possible by the \nHistoric Preservation Fund (plus the State match), contributes \nsignificantly to community revitalization for the benefit of residents, \nto heritage tourism by identifying places people want to visit, and to \neconomic development through the rehabilitation of commercial buildings \nand rental housing ($1.7 billion in construction costs in fiscal year \n1997).\n  I believe this is an extremely worthwhile program that works. We \nshould re-authorize this fund so that important restoration and \nrevitalization efforts may continue across the country, done with the \nassistance of State Historic Preservation Offices and the Advisory \nCouncil on Historic Preservation. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2257\n\n       Be in enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT.\n\n       The second sentence of section 108 of the National Historic \n     Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h) is amended by striking \n     ``1997'' and inserting ``2004''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7286-1", "month": "06", "year":

MACK R. FARR\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nvision, professional dedication, and public service of Mr. Mack R. Farr \nwho will retire in July after thirty-one years of civilian service in \nthe Department of Defense. During that time, Mr. Farr has become one of \nthe preeminent leaders in the development and procurement of night \nvision devices for the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Mr. Farr has been instrumental in the development of night vision \ndevices at all levels--from technician at the Army's Night Vision \nLaboratory to Technical Director for the Army's Project Manager for \nNight Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition. The \nextent of his participation spans the development of two generations of \nimage intensifiers, laser aiming lights, laser range finders, and laser \ncountermeasures systems, as well as the recent development and \nproduction of second-generation thermal systems. These systems enable \nour troops to fight in the dark and represent one of the most profound \nimprovements in military capability.\n  Our ability to ``own the night'' was critical to the success \ndemonstrated during Operations Desert Storm in Kuwait and Just Cause in \nPanama. Under Mr. Farr's technical direction, the U.S. military has \nprocured $3.3 billion worth of night vision equipment, substantially \nimproving the lethality and survivability of our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. Farr began his career with the government as a technician for the \nArmy's Night Vision Laboratory in January 1967, working to improve the \noperating life of image intensifier tubes. He then focused on \nminiaturizing this technology so that it could be utilized by the \nindividual soldier. The products which evolved from this effort are now \nwidely used by both ground soldiers and aviators alike, and have formed \nthe foundation for such grand concepts as the Land Warrior program. The \nbest compliment paid to Mr. Farr came from one of his colleagues who \nstated, ``Mr. Farr brought night vision to the individual soldier.''\n  During his career, Mr. Farr was the chief architect of omnibus style \nprocurements for night vision devices. Omnibus procurements are \ndesigned to solicit multiple night vision systems which use common \nmanufacturing processes and combine them into one significant multi-\nyear contract. In addition, these procurements were one of the Army's \nfirst ``best value'' contracting efforts. Both concepts have become so \nsuccessful that best value source selections are now the desired method \nof procurement for the Army, and four omnibus style contracts have been \nawarded over a fifteen-year period for 476,861 night vision goggles, \nsights, and driving devices. Mr. Farr's efforts in shaping these \nconcepts have led to the continuous improvement of night vision devices \nover this period. Night vision goggle unit prices have decreased by \nseventy percent over this time frame, while the performance of night \nvision goggles has significantly increased.\n  Mr. Farr has also led the Army's Project Manager, Night Vision/\nReconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition office in \ncontinued acquisition reform. His efforts in Image Intensification have \nresulted in a consolidated program which today is known as horizontal \nTechnology Integration and Single Process Initiatives. Mr. Farr has \nworked with industry to develop innovative concepts such as \nestablishment of the first swap out program which allows Army units to \ntrade-in old image intensification systems for credit toward purchase \nof the latest high performance devices. Industry then recycles \ncomponents from the old image intensifier systems for use in their \ncommercial products. This process keeps industry prices low and Army \ncapability high, at a reduced cost to the Government.\n  Mr. Farr has also been instrumental in developing export policy for \nnight vision devices. He has worked closely with the Army Materiel \nCommand, Defense Technology Surveillance Agency, and Defense \nIntelligence Agency to develop a policy which is both fair to U.S. \nnight vision manufacturers and protective of U.S. interests in this \ntechnology. Under this policy, U.S. manufacturers have become the \ndesired suppliers of night vision equipment on the international \nmarket.\n  Mr. Farr has received numerous awards during the span of his \ngovernment career, however his preeminence in the electro-optics field \nis best demonstrated by his selection into the Association of Night \nVision Manufacturers Image Intensification Hall of Fame for his long \nservice and remarkable contributions to this technology.\n  I know that Mr. Farr's wife, Nancy, his children, Shelly, Mark, and \nRobert, and the Department of Defense are proud of his accomplishments \nand contributions. Our Nation and our Armed Forces are indebted to him \nfor his many years of public service. I wish him well in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7291-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7291-S7292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  321ST MISSILE GROUP, GRAND FORKS AFB\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \n321st Missile Group at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, as it prepares to \ndeactivate.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, the 321st is one of the longest-\nserving and most decorated ICBM units in the United States Air Force. \nAfter flying B-25 bombers in the Mediterranean theater during the \nSecond World War as the 321st Bombardment Group, this fine unit \nundertook several aircraft and basing changes before coming home to the \nprairies of North Dakota at Grand Forks AFB in 1964.\n  As the 321st Missile Wing, this unit was the very first to deploy the \nMinuteman II ICBM during the mid-1960s, and became one of the first to \nupgrade to the Minuteman III missile in the early 1970s. The 321st \nconsistently won awards, being often regarded as the best ICBM wing in \nthe Air Force. After this unit was selected for closure, its personnel \nably continued the strategic deterrence mission, while also--ahead of \nschedule--realigning the 321st Missile Group's assets.\n  North Dakotans have always had a special attachment to the 321st. \nUnlike other military units which are sometimes seen at a distance, at \nair fields and barracks behind chain-link fences, the 321st Missile \nGroup has literally been based in North Dakota's backyards. Its roots \nof steel and concrete are sunk deep into the prairie soil of the \nFlickertail State.\n  One hundred and fifty ICBM silos and fifteen missile alert facilities \ndot the fields of eastern North Dakota, covering an area larger than \nthe state of New Jersey. As the missileers and their hardware stood at \nthe very frontlines of the Cold War, we North Dakotans in our nearby \nfarms and communities knowingly and proudly stood with them. For over \nthree decades, we have been pleased to open our small town coffee shops \nto personnel on their way to inspect a launch facility, or to groups of \nofficers returning to base after pulling long strategic alerts in \nlaunch control facilities beneath the wheat fields of the Red River \nValley.\n  Mr. President, the men and women of the 321st have been a part of \nNorth Dakota in a very special way. To everyone who has served in the \n321st over its long history at Grand Forks, I say this: you will always \nhave a home in North Dakota. You are part of the family.\n  There is no question that we are sad to see the 321st go. Even so, I \nthink it is important that we put the departure of this unit in its \nproper context.\n  The 321st is being realigned because our country won the Cold War. \nThe triumph of America and its ideals over communism and tyranny is \nworth celebrating.\n  As we celebrate this victory, however, we must not forget that it was \nthe men and women of the 321st who provided America the strategic \ndeterrence and stability that allowed the Cold War to end peacefully. \nAround the clock, year after year, the 321st stood ready to deliver 450 \nnuclear warheads to targets throughout the Soviet Union in just a few \nminutes time. This made it clear to Moscow that a thermonuclear war \nwith the United States would be a conflict they could never hope to \nwin.\n  I would urge my Colleagues in the Senate not to forget that the motto \nof the Strategic Air Command was ``Peace is Our Profession.'' Truly, \nthe 321st has been an organization of ``peace professionals.''\n  It is good to know that the spirit of the 321st Missile Group will \nlive on at\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\nGrand Forks AFB with the 319th Air Refueling Wing, a ``core'' tanker \nunit of KC-135 Stratotankers. I hope that the 319th and the Air Force \nwill be with us in North Dakota for many years to come.\n  Today, Mr. President, as the 321st prepares to retire its colors, I \nwould send to the 321st Missile Group, all who have and do serve her, \nand the Untied States Air Force that has protected us so well, a \nmessage of thanks and congratulations. The Senate--and all Americans--\nowe you a deep debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7291-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNITION OF THE JEFFERSON CITY SAMARITAN CENTER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Samaritan \nCenter of Jefferson City, on the occasion of the groundbreaking for a \nnew home. More than decade ago, Samaritan Center began as an effort of \nfive Mid-Missouri Catholic churches. Three Protestant churches joined \nthe cause and Samaritan Center has operated ever since as an interfaith \nagency. Virtually all of its resources are devoted directly to service \ndelivery, as the center's single paid employee, an operations manager, \nis assisted by more than 150 volunteers each month.\n  Respectful, loving service is delivered with firm supervision, and \nanyone who knows the center pays tribute to the practical assistance \nthey provide. For example, during the historic Flood of 1993, which \nwiped out the life stake of so many Missouri farmers, the center not \nonly donated food, clothing, diapers and utility assistance to make it \nthrough the winter; they also came through with help to get the crop in \nwhen spring arrived. Many folks got back on their feet thanks to this \nhelping hand, and those who saw what it meant to these families will \nnever forget it.\n  I am one who marvels at how far the center can stretch its help. I \nhave visited and left with my faith in people renewed. The computer is \ndonated, the employees unpaid, the furniture castoffs--but the service \nis sterling and as varied as the need.\n  This groundbreaking is another step toward meeting a new challenge \nthe Samaritan Center is taking on. The current quarters are bursting at \nthe seams, and new space must be found to continue to help the families \nthey serve (which number more than 400 each month for food alone!). \nCharacteristically, the center refuses to reduce service to pay for the \nnew building they hope to place on land donated by supporters. So, in \naddition to continuing to help people with needs ranging from rent to \nwork uniforms, the center and its friends are not so slowly and very \nsurely piecing together the resources to build a site that meets the \nneeds of Mid-Missouri today.\n  To know the Samaritan Center is to respect and support it. It is my \nhonor to offer this tribute from the United States Senate on the loving \nservice provided by the Center, its volunteer and many \nsupporters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7292-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNATIONAL DAY IN SUPPORT OF TORTURE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the first \nobservance of International Day in Support of Torture Victims and \nSurvivors. This day, which was designated last year by the United \nNations General Assembly, serves as a reminder to all of us that, \nsadly, at this very moment, somewhere in the world a prisoner is being \nbeaten, a woman is being raped, or a child is witnessing the torture or \nmurder of a loved one at the hands of a hostile force.\n  Along with guns and bombs, torture unfortunately has become just \nanother weapon in the arsenal of war. In generations past, we like to \nbelieve that wars were fought between combatants according to an \nunwritten code. In some conflicts of the past, fighting was suspended \nafter dark and during the winter months so as not to give one side an \nadvantage over the other. But the rules of contemporary wars are much \nless clear. Combatants fight, not merely against each other, but \nagainst civilians, including women and children, on the opposing side. \nWar is no longer just a means to acquire territory or settle long-\nrunning disputes, but often it is used as a means to attempt to \nobliterate entire ethnic or religious groups.\n  In this past decade alone, the world has been witness to \ninconceivable acts of horror committed against specific populations in \nsuch places as Rwanda, Sudan, Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, and Kosovo. \nThe terms ``ethnic cleansing'' and ``genocide'' have become all too \ncommon in describing events around the world. And the stories of those \ntorture victims who live to tell of their experiences continue to shock \nand horrify the international community.\n  Earlier this month, during the National Day of Action for Tibet rally \nwhich took place on the Capitol steps, I was privileged to hear the \ncomments of Palden Gyatso, a Buddhist monk who was imprisoned for 33 \nyears by the Chinese force which unlawfully occupies his homeland. He \ntold of unspeakable acts of torture that are routinely committed \nagainst the Tibetan people by the Chinese military. The myriad forms of \ntorture he was forced to endure included being hung upside down while \nhis naked body was repeatedly stung with an electric cattle prod and \nhaving boiling water poured over his body. That he was able to survive \nthis brutal treatment is a testament to his faith, which his captors \nattempted to squelch through these and other inhuman acts.\n  But for every person like Palden Gyatso, who somehow managed to \nsurvive such brutal treatment, there are countless others, whose names \nwe may never know, who did not. These people endured their fate with a \nquiet courage that inspires hundreds of thousands worldwide to fight \nagainst the practice of torture as a weapon of war.\n  I find it particularly ironic that the President is spending the \nfirst International Day in Support of Torture Victims and Survivors in \nthe People's Republic of China as the guest of a government that has \nsanctioned the torture of its own citizens. I hope the President will \nmark this day by calling on Chinese leaders to open a meaningful \ndialogue with the Dalai Lama regarding Tibet and to gain assurances \nthat the basic human rights of all Chinese citizens will become a top \npriority.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have been contacted by numerous \nWisconsin residents who share the concern of the international \ncommunity about the prevalence of torture in our world. As a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I will continue to speak out \nagainst such reprehensible acts at every available opportunity. I look \nforward to the day when the use of torture as a weapon of war is \nconsigned to history books instead of daily news reports from around \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7292-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7292-S7294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FEDERAL RESEARCH INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation \nthat would elevate Congress' commitment to federally-funded research \nand development. This critical federal investment, performed throughout \nour national laboratories, universities, and private industry, is \ncurrently fueling 50% of our national economy through improvements in \ncapital and labor productivity. While it is imperative that we \nreinforce this commitment by raising the funding levels, we must also \nestablish a solid foundation for Congress to evaluate current and \nfuture civilian federally-funded research and development programs.\n  Now is not the time to let American leadership in science and \ntechnology slip. As a Congress and as a nation, we must reaffirm our \nnational commitment to science and technology and redouble our efforts \nto ensure that funding is not only maintained, but increased as America \nmoves into the next century. Nothing less than the future of our \nNation, and our leadership position in the world, depend upon it.\n\n\n        Importance of Science and Technology to America's Future\n\n  As a physician and surgeon, I've had the opportunity to witness \neveryday the remarkable difference that medical science and technology \nhave made in people's lives. In the short span of time that I've been \npracticing--less than twenty years--I've seen how the products of \nmedical research and development--lasers, mechanical cardiac assist \ndevices, and automatic internal defibrillators--have not only saved, \nbut\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nvastly improved the quality of hundreds of thousands of lives every \nyear.\n  As a physician, I can envision a future in which science and \ntechnology will roll back the current frontiers of medical knowledge, \nidentify the causes, and eliminate most of the effects of the diseases \nthat now plague mankind.\n  But, as a Senator, I've been afforded another opportunity. The \nability to see, and learn, and understand, not just medicine--but \nAmerica. I can envision the difference that science and technology will \nmake in the life or our Nation.\n  Science and technology have had a profound impact on our world. We've \nput men into space and looked into the farthest corners of the known \nuniverse. We've broken the code of the human genome and begun to \ndismantle previously intractable diseases. We've created a virtual \nworld and a whole new realm called cyberspace.\n  Our world runs on technology, and much of our economy runs on it as \nwell. In fact, half of all U.S. economic growth is the result of \ntechnological progress. Technology has provided new goods and services, \nnew jobs, and new capital--even whole new industries.\n  Without a doubt, technology is the principle driving force behind \nAmerica's long-term economic growth and our rising standard of living.\n\n\n           Science and Technology are Important to Tennessee\n\n  Science is especially important to Tennessee. From the Oak Ridge \nLaboratories' important contributions to America's security during the \nCold War, to today's research university partnerships, science and \ntechnology are a big part of Tennessee's past, present and future.\n  In 1995, the latest year for which figures are available--\n  20 out of every 1,000 private sector workers in Tennessee were \nemployed by high tech firms. The total payroll for those workers that \nyear reached $1.5 billion.\n  And every one of them earned, on average, $12,000 more per year than \nthey would have in another type of private sector job in Tennessee.\n  Of Tennessee's $8.8 billion export market, high technology products \naccounted for $2.1 billion or 24 percent.\n  But significant growth and activity have occurred since 1995. The \ntechnology corridor, now being forged in East Tennessee, will be a \nmodel for America's 21st Century economy. From Chattanooga to \nKnoxville, and Oak Ridge to the Tri-Cities, private industry and \nworking partnerships between the public and private sectors, and \nbetween research universities and industry, are creating jobs and \nopportunity; thus linking Tennessee to the nation and the world.\n  For example, in Kingsport, Tennessee, Eastman Chemical produces more \nthan 400 different kinds of modern chemicals, fibers, and plastics--as \nwell as a wide range of intellectual property technologies that will \nsoon be marketed on a global scale.\n  In Tri-Cities, the new Regional Med-Tech Center is a planned, large-\nscale, integrated development project that will one day link health \ncare delivery systems and related research with high technology \nbusiness.\n  And the Spallation Neutron Source, a major undertaking of Oak Ridge \nLaboratory, when completed, will be the most powerful spallation source \nof neutrons in the world: enabling scientists to ``see'', and thus \nunderstand, the physical, chemical and biological properties of \nmaterials at the atomic level.\n\n\n      America's Investment in Science and Technology Must Continue\n\n  Clearly, America's investment in science and technology must \ncontinue. Mr. President, the history of the last five decades has shown \nus that there is a federal role in the creation and nurturing of \nscience and technology, and that--even in times of fiscal austerity--\nCongress' commitment has been relatively constant.\n  However, the last three decades have also shown us something else: \nfiscal reality. The simple truth is that there's just not enough money \nto do everything we'd like to do. Discretionary spending is under \nimmense fiscal pressure. One only has to look back over the last 30 \nyears to confirm the trend. In 1965, mandatory federal spending on \nentitlements and interest on the debt accounted for 30 percent of the \nfederal budget. Fully 70 percent went toward discretionary programs--\nroads, bridges, education, research, national parks, and national \ndefense.\n  Today, just 30 years later, that ratio has been almost completely \nreversed: 67 percent of the budget is spent on mandatory programs; \nleaving only 33 percent for everything else. This situation will only \ngrow worse as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire.\n  Thus, Mr. President, we have both a long-term problem: addressing the \never-increasing level of mandatory spending; and a near-term challenge: \napportioning the ever-dwindling amount of discretionary funding. The \nconfluence of increased dependency on technology and decreased fiscal \nflexibility has created a problem too obvious to ignore: not all \ndeserving programs can be funded; not all authorized programs can be \nfully implemented.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the luxury of fully funding science \nand technology programs across the board has long since passed. We must \nset priorities.\n\n\n         Federal Research Investment Act: Vision for the Future\n\n  The Federal Research Investment Act that I am introducing today \nrepresents the result of over a year of debate surrounding increased \nfunding for federal research and development. I commend my colleagues, \nSenators Gramm, Lieberman, Domenici, and Bingaman, for not only \ncommencing this debate, but also continuing it. Like my colleagues, I \nfirmly believe that Congress must reaffirm our national commitment to \nscience and technology. And that is precisely what the Federal Research \nInvestment Act achieves through its strategy for the future--a vision \nthat not only provides adequate levels of funding, but most \nimportantly, ensures that the funding is both responsible and \naccountable over the long-term.\n  This legislation realizes this goal by establishing and applying a \nset of guiding principles, established by the Science and Technology \nCaucus here in the Senate, to consistently ask the appropriate \nquestions about each competing technology program; to focus on that \nprogram's effectiveness and appropriateness for federal funding; and to \nhelp us make the hard choices about which programs deserve to be funded \nand which do not. Only then can Congress be assured that it has \ninvested wisely.\n  These guiding principles, Mr. President, provide a framework that \nwill not only guide the creation of new, federally-funded research and \ndevelopment programs, but also validate existing ones. Taken together, \nthey create a powerful method for evaluating the debate by increasing \nCongress' ability to focus on the important issues, decreasing the \nlikelihood that it will get sidetracked on politically-charged \ntechnicalities, and ensuring that federal R programs are consistent \nand effective. These principles will also help us establish national \ngoals, and a vision for the future.\n  The Federal Research Investment Act doubles the aggregate amount of \ncivilian funding for research and development over a 12 year period. By \nsteadily increasing the total level by 2.5 percent, in addition to the \nassumed rate of inflation, this legislation would provide Congress with \nrealistic targets for prioritizing fundamental, scientific, and pre-\ncompetitive engineering research over the long-term.\n  Furthermore, this legislation has two components that I believe will \nchange the face of how taxpayer dollars are invested in research and \ndevelopment. First, under this bill, the President would be required to \nsubmit, as part of his annual budget to Congress, a detailed report on \nhow the Administration is paralleling Congressional funding goals. \nThus, the President will be held accountable for how his budget \nachieves Congressional targets to double R spending over 12 years.\n  Second, the Office of Science and Technology Policy will commission \nthe National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study to \ndevelop methods for evaluating Federally-funded research and \ndevelopment programs. The results of this study, in coordination with \nGovernment Performance Results Act, will provide a framework to help \nCongress and the Administration measure the success of federal \nprograms. Only after Congress holds federal agencies accountable to \nstrict, yet fair standards, will the legislative body\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\nbe able to claim that is acting responsibly on behalf of American \ncitizens.\n  In closing Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Federal Research Investment Act. I further challenge each \nof you to reach out to your own universities and engage them in this \ncritical dialogue as to the future of science and technology funding. \nThis federal funding, after all, is a public investment in America's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7292-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRADE SANCTIONS COMPENSATION\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to \ncompensate farmers if we choose to continue using food as a weapon. I \ndo not support the use of food in this way, but if this country chooses \nto use food as a weapon, then the producers of that weapon deserve to \nbe compensated, just as all other weapons manufacturers are \ncompensated.\n  Today, ten percent of the world's wheat markets are off limits to \nAmerican farmers because of sanctions. If we include the recent loss of \nthe markets in Pakistan and India, sixteen percent of the worlds \nmarkets are not available. Farmers in my state, and farmers across this \nnation, cannot afford to pay for this foreign policy option out of \ntheir own pockets.\n  This bill amends an existing statute which is so narrowly drawn that, \ndespite ongoing sanctions, the statute has not required any \ncompensation to farmers. The existing statute requires that the \nsanction be imposed by the executive branch of government, be \nunilateral, and not be joined by any other nation. It also limits \ncompensation to three years and allows the Secretary of Agriculture to \nchoose between direct compensation and export assistance programs.\n  This bill eliminates all of the restrictions in the existing statute \nwhich preclude it from being of any assistance to farmers hit by \ndeclining prices caused by lost export markets. The new statute will \nmake it clear that, if our government chooses to use food as a weapon, \nthen those who produce that food will not alone bear the financial \nburden. I ask that my colleagues join me in passage of this bill to \nensure fairness in our foreign trade policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7294-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE PROGRAM FOR INVESTMENT IN MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS OF 1998\n\n Mr. KERRY. Last week I joined Senators Kennedy, Domenici and \nBingaman in introducing a bill to establish the PRIME program for \ninvestment in microenterprise. I applaud Senators Kennedy and Domenici \nfor their work in developing this legislation and welcome their efforts \nin supporting the development of business skills for micro-\nentrepreneurs. Access to education and training is critical for the \ndevelopment of small businesses in the United States.\n  Developing microenterprise is crucial to the financial health of our \nnation. Small businesses have been the engine of growth in our economy \nand have provided virtually all of our country's net new jobs. Very \nsmall businesses, those with four or fewer employees, created more jobs \nfrom 1992 through 1996 than large businesses employing more than 500 \nworkers. However, many of those who yearn to turn an innovative idea \ninto a marketable product need assistance in developing the skills and \nknowledge necessary to succeed in today's competitive marketplace. That \nis why, as Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, I have been such a strong supporter of programs to assist \nmicroenterprise development, especially through the microloan program \nwithin the Small Business Administration. This program has provided $67 \nmillion in microloans to very small businesses in every state. A great \npercentage of microloans have gone to traditionally underserved groups, \nincluding 43 percent to women-owned businesses, 39 percent to minority-\nowned businesses and 11 percent to veteran-owned businesses. I am \ncommitted to seeing this and other programs that assist microenterprise \ngrow and thrive.\n  The Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) fund \nrepresents another type of community investment initiative. It uses \nlimited federal resources to invest in and build the capacity of \nprivate, for profit and nonprofit financial institutions, leveraging \nprivate capital and private-sector talent and creativity. The fund's \nmain program allows local CDFIs to apply for financial and technical \nassistance. This funding can be used to support basic financial \nservices, housing for low-income people, businesses that provide jobs \nfor low-income people and technical assistance for capacity-building, \ntraining, and development of programs, investments or loans. The CDFI \nfund offers a combination of increased access to capital and \ninstitutional capacity building that is vital to low-income \ncommunities, and fill a need that the marketplace is not meeting.\n  We have all heard a lot about the need for individual responsibility, \nfamily responsibility, and community responsibility. The \nmicroenterprise program within CDFI give us an opportunity to lend a \nhelping hand to those in need of financial aid and technical assistance \nso they can fulfill their personal, family, and community \nresponsibilities. It has given many a chance to break the cycle of \npoverty and welfare and move toward individual responsibility and \nfinancial independence.\n  The PRIME bill introduced last week seeks to increase CDFI's funding \nfor technical assistance to give micro-entrepreneurs access to \ninformation on developing a business plan, record-keeping, planning, \nfinancing and marketing that are crucial in the development of a small \nbusiness. Furthermore, this legislation will sponsor research on the \nmost innovative and successful ways of encouraging these new businesses \nand enabling them to succeed.\n  This legislation will allow organizations which assist \nmicroenterprises to develop new products and services for their \ncustomers and expand on existing services. In Massachusetts, Working \nCapital, a recipient of a Presidential Award for Excellence in \nMicroenterprise Development in 1997, currently offers three \ncomplementary programs to its microenterprise customers which could be \neligible for additional funding under the PRIME legislation. First, \nWorking Capital provides business credit to micro-entrepreneurs. \nSecond, they provide business education and training on how to draw up \nbusiness plans and prepare financial projections, and how to use these \ntools in managing their businesses. Third, they offer networking \nopportunities to connect micro-entrepreneurs to each other and give \nthem a sense of belonging within a community which faces the same \nchallenges.\n  The PRIME legislation will assist in the development of programs such \nas those offered by Working Capital in Massachusetts and similar \norganizations across the country and will assist more Americans in \ntaking a chance on the American dream of owning their own small \nbusiness. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7294-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7294-S7296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2614\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I now ask unanimous consent the Senate turn to Calendar No. \n404, H.R. 2614, the Reading Excellence Act, and immediately following \nthe reporting by the clerk, the chairman be recognized to withdraw the \ncommittee amendment and there be 30 minutes for debate to be equally \ndivided in the usual form with no amendments or motions in order.\n  I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of H.R. 2614, all without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  I would like to note that I have discussed this with White House \nofficials, and they have urged that we try to find a way to get this \nlegislation up. Actually, this was a week or two ago, so we have been \ntrying to get something worked out. I would like very much for us to be \nable to do that.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, and I do not \nhave any caveat to the unanimous-consent agreement, but would the \nmajority leader modify his request to include an amendment from the \nDemocratic side which would be the only amendment in order, and that it \nbe the text of the committee-reported substitute amendment as modified; \nthat there would be 1 hour for debate on the amendment equally divided, \nand that upon the use\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the \ncommittee-reported amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would have to object to that at this time \nbecause if we add any amendments to this bill in its present form, then \nit would require further House action. And, of course, the House has \nalready adjourned for the July 4 recess until July 14.\n  I note also, if we do not do this bill now in the form that it was \ncalled up, the money that would have been used for this Reading \nExcellence Program, some $206 million, I believe it was --something of \nthat nature--would then go over to the IDEA, Individuals with \nDisabilities in Education Act, so that money would be gone. So we \nreally are in a box here.\n  I think everybody would like to do the Reading Excellence Act. But if \nwe don't do it in the form that I have called it up, it would have to \ngo back to the House. Basically, then, we wouldn't get anything done. \nWe need to send it directly to the President.\n  So that is why I would be constrained to object to that modification.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is hard for me to understand, when this \nwas a House bill and it came over and the Senate committee studied it \nand sent it to the Senate floor with a substitute amendment, and then \nwe don't want to take the committee substitute amendment.\n  ``There is something about that,'' as we would say down in West \nKentucky, ``that ain't right.'' So we are again telling the committee \nyou can go through all of your work, you can do your hearings, you can \ndo your markup, but you did the wrong thing.\n  So I think the amendment that we offered, which was a committee \namendment as modified, was appropriate. If the majority leader wishes \nto object to that, why, that is the way it has to be.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, Mr. President, then, the Senator objects to the \noriginal request?\n  Mr. FORD. You objected to mine, so that ended it right there.\n  Mr. LOTT. You never said you object to it, then, as proposed. So you \nobject to it as proposed?\n  Mr. FORD. Sure, and you object to mine as proposed by the committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the House version of the Reading \nExcellence Act, and I also oppose the process by which it is being \nbrought to the Senate at the last minute in an effort to pass this bad \nbill under the pressure of the July 1 funding deadline.\n  On May 13th, six weeks ago, the Labor and Human Resources Committee \napproved an alternative bill on this issue, with unanimous bipartisan \nsupport, and with the strong backing of educators, reading specialists, \nand community organizations across the country. Despite this \noverwhelming support for the Senate committee bill, the Republican \nleadership refused to allow the full Senate to act on it. Instead, they \ndid nothing for six weeks. Now, as the July 1 deadline is upon us, they \ninsist that we swallow the deeply flawed House bill.\n  What is at stake here is nothing less than the way teachers and \nschools across the country will be allowed to help children learn to \nread.\n  Organizations throughout the nation who know this well are adamantly \nopposed to the House bill. These groups include the American \nAssociation of School Administrators--the International Reading \nAssociation--the Council of Chief State School Officers--the National \nSchool Boards Association--the National Parent Teacher Association--the \nNational Council of Teachers of English--the American Federation of \nTeachers--the National Education Association--the National Association \nof Elementary School Principals--the National Conference on Language \nand Literacy--the Conference on College Composition and \nCommunications--the National Association of State Boards of Education--\nReach Out and Read.\n  All of these groups are doing the hard day-to-day work, helping \nchildren learn to read. They say that no bill would be better than the \nHouse bill, because the House bill will not help them do the work they \nneed to do.\n  In last year's appropriations legislation, Congress reserved $210 \nmillion for a child literacy program if enacted by July 1. By missing \nthe July 1 deadline, we miss an initial opportunity. But we will have \nmany other opportunities this session to pass a bill we can all \nsupport--and fund it accordingly.\n  Many successful models to help children learn to read well now exist, \nbut they are not yet available to all children. As a result, far too \nmany children in communities across the country are denied the \nopportunity to learn to read well. The statistics are appalling. Forty \npercent of 4th grade students do not achieve the basic level in \nreading, and 70 percent of 4th graders do not achieve the proficient \nlevel.\n  We must do more--much more--to help all children learn to read well. \nMany of the reading difficulties experienced by teenagers and adults \ntoday could have been prevented by adequate intervention in early \nchildhood. By working to ensure that all children learn to read well in \nthe early grades, we can also reduce the need for costly special \neducation instruction in later grades.\n  The time has come to pass a bill that will help all children learn to \nread well. Child literacy is an important goal, and if we are to reach \nthis goal, we need well-educated, well-trained teachers prepared to \ngive children the special assistance they deserve. We need dedicated \nand trained volunteer tutors. We need support for successful community \nprograms to improve family literacy and teach parents how to read more \neffectively with their children at home. We need support for innovative \ncommunity efforts to help children learn to read before they enter \nschool.\n  This House-passed bill is not an adequate response to these problems. \nThis bill undermines state and local responsibility for public \neducation. My Republican colleagues want to create a new state \nbureaucracy and new federal control over public education. These are \nthe same Republicans who say they want school vouchers and block \ngrants, in order to give parents and communities more choice and more \ncontrol over their children's education.\n  State and local education agencies and school administrators are \ndoing well in creating, implementing, and coordinating innovative \nefforts to help children learn. We should do more to support these \nefforts. We should provide community organizations with the resources \nthey need to bring successful programs to more people. Instead, my \ncolleagues want to bypass state leadership, undermine local control, \nand create a new state bureaucracy, when states and communities are \nalready prepared to implement new literacy programs and oversee the use \nof new Federal funding.\n  State Departments of Education and local education agencies are \nalready working successfully to coordinate local, State, and Federal \nresources to improve education and provide higher quality education to \nchildren. It makes no sense to bypass the current State leadership and \nrequire states to create a new State bureaucracy.\n  Another serious problem with this bill is that it brings Federal \ncontrol into the classroom and dictates how teachers teach reading. \nThis bill specifies only one way to teach reading skills. It ignores \nthe research and recommendations of the leading educators. During the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee hearing on child literacy, \nwe heard from two of the most distinguished researchers--Doctor \nCatherine Snow of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who chairs \nthe Committee on the Prevention of Reading Difficulties at the National \nAcademy of Sciences, and Doctor Reid Lyon of the National Institutes of \nHealth. They emphasized that the best way to help all children learn to \nread is to promote a variety of the best practices and give local \neducators the freedom to tailor programs to meet local needs.\n  Doctor Snow testified that a solution to reading problems has not \nbeen achieved because of an:\n\n       Unrealistic desire for a simpler answer. Reading is a \n     complex and multifaceted outcome, determined by many factors. \n     Ensuring adequate reading progress for every child . . . \n     requires providing all of the many, varied experiences that \n     will benefit their reading.\n\n  Doctor Lyon testified that:\n\n       Learning to read requires different skills at different \n     levels of development. . . . It does\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\n     not have anything to do with philosophy, and it does not have \n     anything to do with politics. It has to do with making sure \n     the kids get the ideas. That is it. . . . To be able to read \n     our language, you have to know the sounds. You have got to \n     know how to map it onto the letters . . . you have got to do \n     it quickly, and you have got to know why you are reading and \n     have good vocabulary and the things that Dr. Snow spoke \n     about. It is never an either/or.\n\n  This bill will prevent teachers from following that sound advice. \nInstead, teachers will be forced to follow a mandate from Washington \nrequiring all teachers across the country to follow one formula to \nteach reading--regardless of local needs. Is this what the Republicans \nmean when they ask for more local control of education? Schools and \ncommunities already have control over education. The Federal Government \nshouldn't start micro-managing their reading programs.\n  We should be doing more, not less, to ensure that teachers and school \ndistricts are free to design programs to meet the unique local needs of \nthe children. The Reading Excellence Act approved by the Senate \nCommittee by a unanimous, bi-partisan vote would give local educators \nthe flexibility and training the experts say they need.\n  This bill doesn't just take control away from public schools. It also \ntakes money away from public schools. We all recognize that recruiting \nand training more tutors is an important goal. President Clinton began \nhis effort two years ago, with his ``America Reads Challenge.'' The \nSenate Committee bill would build on the success of that program, so \nthat local schools will benefit from available community resources.\n  The House bill is a detour away from these worthy goals. Instead of \nhelping schools capitalize on volunteer tutors and community resources, \nit wastes funds on private tutoring programs. It denies support for \nsuccessful school-based programs in which tutoring assistance is \nclosely linked to a child's classroom instruction.\n  The bill also requires local schools to spend time, money, and other \nscarce resources overseeing private tutoring programs. Funneling scarce \npublic dollars into these private programs will undermine \naccountability for academic results and expenditure of federal dollars.\n  This bill has major flaws. It does little or nothing to help public \nschool children learn to read or improve their chance of receiving a \ngood education. Other provisions in the bill are worthwhile, because \nthey encourage better teaching, more trained volunteer tutors, and more \nsupport for community-based family literacy programs. These initiatives \nwill ensure that many children get the extra assistance they need to \nlearn to read well and early.\n  These issues are too important for us to leave this House bill as the \nfinal word. I will do all I can to pass a strong bipartisan bill in the \nSenate in the coming months--the nation's children deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7294-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3717\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

And, finally, I ask unanimous consent it be in order \nfor me to ask for the yeas and nays on passage at this time.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, there are \nsome who had hoped to offer some amendments. They were in the process \nof trying to work these amendments out where they would be agreeable. \nThat has not transpired yet. So, then, on behalf of this side, I \nobject.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I must object. I object because what the \nmajority leader proposes is to add a very significant piece of \nsubstantive drug legislation relating to the crack-powder cocaine \nsentencing issues.\n  I note that the Judiciary Committee has not reported this \nlegislation. This legislation is subject to significant debate. For \nexample, the costs of the most recent proposal offered by Senators \nAbraham and Allard are very significant.\n  According to the Justice Department--the 5-year cost estimate to our \nfederal prison budget is more than $790 million. The 10-year estimate--\nmore than $1.9 billion.\n  This is just one example of the significant policy implications of \nthis proposal. Frankly, the Judiciary Committee must be given the \nopportunity to report this legislation before we debate this on the \nfloor.\n  In contrast, we have fully debated the drug director legislation \nintroduced last summer. The Judiciary Committee has debated it, the \ncommittee held hearings, the committee developed a bipartisan re-\nauthorization bill, the committee reported the bill last November, \nsince then we have worked with Senator McCain and the Armed Services \nCommittee to work out their issues with this bill.\n  The bottom lines--we have a bipartisan, fully debated, bill; and we \nneed to get the drug director's office re-authorized.\n  There are many particular, specific drug policy issues to debate. \nCrack-cocaine is just one of them. Youth drug abuse, youth violence, \ndrug interdiction, and many more all need to be debated.\n  But, let's keep our eye on the ball, and let's re-authorize General \nMcCaffrey's office. The General needs our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I should note we had at least one very \nimportant amendment that a Senator wanted to offer on this side of the \naisle to this bill, too, dealing with the penalties for the use of \npowder cocaine. Certainly, it is a very important issue, and I would \nlike it to be considered, but I called upon that Senator--actually it \nwas two Senators--and said you will have a chance to offer that on \nother legislation including State, Justice, Commerce. He was willing, \nthen, to agree to put it aside.\n  I really think we need to reauthorize the drug czar office. I am \nhoping this is not the final word on this. Maybe we can work out \nsomething in July to consider it. But our problem is, we are really \nrunning out of time. I think it is going to be unconscionable if we \ncan't find some way to quickly reauthorize the drug czar's office. We \nwill have to do it without it taking up more than just a couple or 3 \nhours, because we just don't have the time, when you look at the \nappropriations bills and everything else we are going to need to do.\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand what the majority leader is \nsaying, what he is trying to do. But if he continued to push these \namendments over to a piece of legislation at a later time, then you are \ngoing to have all these amendments that are waiting, and your \ncolleagues will want to bring them up, and then your colleagues will be \nasked not to bring it up on that one.\n  So we go through here with this constrained time that we find \nourselves with, and the inability to bring amendments. I understand \nwhat the majority leader wants to do. I have no fault with what he is \ntrying to do except we are trying to work out some amendments that we \nthink are important. Just like your side, we are going to let ours try \nto work them out.\n  So I will object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand that. I know every individual Senator can \ndemand his or her right to offer amendments. But I would have to say, I \nam very concerned that the Senate is getting more and more into a \nposition where we try to rewrite or write bills on the floor of the \nSenate. One of the basic tenets I was told about when I came over to \nthe Senate is, if you have a bad bill, don't think you are going to fix \nit on the floor of the Senate. When you have something like a drug czar \nreauthorization--I know there are a lot of drug-related amendments that \nare sort of pent up and Members want to offer them, but it seems to me \nwe ought to just reauthorize that office--it is not a big, complicated \nbill--and allow the drug czar to do his job.\n  But we will keep working and hopefully find a way to get a limited \namount of time and limited amendments on that issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7296-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been talking \nabout a task force to consider the question of economic sanctions, how \nthey are put in place, how they are dealt with, both in the short term \nand over the long term. We have discussed this matter with Secretary of \nState Albright.\n  I think there is feeling on both sides of the aisle that perhaps the \nproclivity to place sanctions, economic sanctions on countries around \nthe world repeatedly, and with not a clear way of ending those, has \nbecome a problem, at least one we should think very carefully about to \nsee if there is a way we can deal with some of the pending legislation \nin this area, like, for instance, the Glenn amendment that was \napplicable in the case of India and, I believe, Pakistan with the \nPressler amendment, and a number of other instances.\n  On the longer term, I think we need to have a task force to give \nthought, how we do this, when we do it, and even when we end it. I have \ndiscussed it with a number of Senators on our side of the aisle who \nwork in this area of foreign policy and deal with the question of \nsanctions, and so I am satisfied we can have a good group and this will \nbe a bipartisan group. So I want to announce we are agreeing to create \na task force on economic sanctions to examine this whole area.\n  I wanted to have a short-term mandate, though, not just the broader \npolicy questions, but to examine what we can do or what should be done \nabout sanctions on India and Pakistan as a result of their nuclear \nprograms. With the recent stories of nuclear tests in south Asia, it is \nimportant to look at the U.S. sanctions laws and how they affect our \nability to de-escalate the nuclear arms race in the region.\n  I have asked the task force to make recommendations to the Senate \nleadership by July 15, 1998, on sanctions relating to these two \ncountries--India and Pakistan. We will also ask this task force to \nexamine overall issues related to sanctions, legislation, and \nimplementation.\n  I have asked the task force to report back to the Senate leadership \nby September 1, 1998, on the following issues:\n  What constitutes a sanction?\n  There are many categories of legislative and executive branch action, \nusing economic sanctions in an effort to support policy goals, \nincluding restrictions on U.S. Government funds, conditions on the \nexport of sensitive technology, and limitations on normal commercial \nactivity.\n  What sanctions are now in place? And what flexibility is provided in \nthese different sanctions? That would be a second question.\n  Third: How should success be assessed in determining the \neffectiveness of these sanctions? When have we done what we wanted to \nachieve, and then can perhaps remove them?\n  Fourth: How should policy goals be defined in considering and \nimplementing these sanctions?\n  Are effective procedures in place now to ensure coordination between \nthe executive and legislative branches for the consideration and \nimposition of sanctions?\n  I have to say, I think the answer to that question is no; there is \nnot adequate coordination and communication between the executive and \nlegislative branches in this area of sanctions.\n  Are effective procedures in place for oversight and monitoring of the \nexecutive branch compliance and implementation of existing sanctions?\n\n  I have been stunned by some of the instances that I have seen with \nregard to Russia and with China where clearly sanctions were called \nfor, should have been almost automatic by the administration, and it \ndid not happen. Why not? And so we need to think about that.\n  Should there be a unique Senate floor or committee procedure for \nconsidering sanctions legislation?\n  Answering all of these questions in the limited timeframe will not be \neasy, but I am confident this very distinguished and qualified \nbipartisan group can come up with some very good recommendations. And I \nhope that the Senate will reserve its judgment and not act in this area \nuntil we see what will come out of the task force recommendations.\n  The task force will include 18 Members and will be chaired by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. He is chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. The cochair \nwill be Senator Biden. The task force will also include Senators Helms, \nBaucus, Lugar, Dodd, D'Amato, Glenn, Mack, Kerry, Kyl, Leahy, Warner, \nLevin, Hutchinson, Lieberman, Roberts, and Moynihan. I think you can \nsee this is a very distinguished group. And I know they will have some \nvery important recommendations to the Senate.\n  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the leader.\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\n  I suppose there is not a single Member of this body, I would say to \nthe majority leader, who has been very consistent on this subject. \nSometimes Members have felt that sanctions were inappropriate except in \ntheir particular area of interest where they thought sanctions might \nmake sense. I confess to being entirely inconsistent, too, myself, I \nsay to my friend from Mississippi, having supported sanctions in South \nAfrica and opposed them in China and other places. So none of us have a \nconsistent pattern here.\n  I think it is very important to try to pull together the best \nthinking available from Senators on both sides of the aisle to see \nwhether there is some kind of coherent way to go forward in this field.\n  So I thank the majority leader for his understanding of the \nimportance to try to pull us together in this complicated area. And I \nassure him I will do my best to try to give everybody an opportunity to \nhave their say. And we will certainly meet the deadlines. I say to the \ndistinguished majority leader, the deadlines will be met, with or \nwithout consensus, I cannot say at this point. But I look forward to \nworking on this assignment. I thank the majority leader for the \nopportunity.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank you, I say to Senator McConnell.\n  I do note that Senator Daschle and I have been communicating on this \nback and forth the last 2 weeks. I am sorry he is not able to be here \nnow. But this is an example of how we do come together and work very \ncarefully and sensibly, hopefully, when it comes to foreign policy \nquestions. And he certainly wanted to go forward with this. I am glad \nwe were able to make this announcement this afternoon.\n  I do have a series of bills I believe we can deal with before we \nadjourn for the week.\n  I know Senator Ford here is on behalf of the Democratic leader. So we \ncan go through these pretty quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7297-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2236\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with \nan amendment on page five, so as to make the bill read:\n\n                                S. 2073\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For 14 years, the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Center'') has--\n       (A) served as the national resource center and \n     clearinghouse congressionally mandated under the provisions \n     of the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984; and\n       (B) worked in partnership with the Department of Justice, \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of the \n     Treasury, the Department of State, and many other agencies in \n     the effort to find missing children and prevent child \n     victimization.\n       (2) Congress has given the Center, which is a private non-\n     profit corporation, unique powers and resources, such as \n     having access to the National Crime Information Center of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Law \n     Enforcement Telecommunications System.\n       (3) Since 1987, the Center has operated the National Child \n     Pornography Tipline, in conjunction with the United States \n     Customs Service and the United States Postal Inspection \n     Service and, beginning this year, the Center established a \n     new CyberTipline on child exploitation, thus becoming ``the \n     911 for the Internet''.\n       (4) In light of statistics that time is of the essence in \n     cases of child abduction, the Director of the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation in February of 1997 created a new NCIC child \n     abduction (``CA'') flag to provide the Center immediate \n     notification in the most serious cases, resulting in 642 \n     ``CA'' notifications to the Center and helping the Center to \n     have its highest recovery rate in history.\n       (5) The Center has established a national and increasingly \n     worldwide network, linking the Center online with each of the \n     missing children clearinghouses operated by the 50 States, \n     the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as with \n     Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom, the Royal Canadian \n     Mounted Police, INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and \n     others, which has enabled the Center to transmit images and \n     information regarding missing children to law enforcement \n     across the United States and around the world instantly.\n       (6) From its inception in 1984 through March 31, 1998, the \n     Center has--\n       (A) handled 1,203,974 calls through its 24-hour toll-free \n     hotline (1-800-THE-LOST) and currently averages 700 calls per \n     day;\n       (B) trained 146,284 law enforcement, criminal and juvenile \n     justice, and healthcare professionals in child sexual \n     exploitation and missing child case detection, \n     identification, investigation, and prevention;\n       (C) disseminated 15,491,344 free publications to citizens \n     and professionals; and\n       (D) worked with law enforcement on the cases of 59,481 \n     missing children, resulting in the recovery of 40,180 \n     children.\n       (7) The demand for the services of the Center is growing \n     dramatically, as evidenced by the fact that in 1997, the \n     Center handled 129,100 calls, an all-time record, and by the \n     fact that its new Internet website (www.missingkids.com) \n     receives 1,500,000 ``hits'' every day, and is linked with \n     hundreds of other websites to provide real-time images of \n     breaking cases of missing children, helping to cause such \n     results as a police officer in Puerto Rico searching the \n     Center's website and working with the Center to identify and \n     recover a child abducted as an infant from her home in San \n     Diego, California, 7 years earlier.\n       (8) In 1997, the Center provided policy training to 256 \n     police chiefs and sheriffs from 50 States and Guam at its new \n     Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center.\n       (9) The programs of the Center have had a remarkable \n     impact, such as in the fight against infant abductions in \n     partnership with the healthcare industry, during which the \n     Center has performed 668 onsite hospital walk-throughs and \n     inspections, and trained 45,065 hospital administrators, \n     nurses, and security personnel, and thereby helped to \n     reduce infant abductions in the United States by 82 \n     percent.\n       (10) The Center is now playing a significant role in \n     international child abduction cases, serving as a \n     representative of the Department of State at cases under The \n     Hague Convention, and successfully resolving the cases\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\n     of 343 international child abductions, and providing greater \n     support to parents in the United States.\n       (11) The Center is a model of public/private partnership, \n     raising private sector funds to match congressional \n     appropriations and receiving extensive private in-kind \n     support, including advanced technology provided by the \n     computer industry such as imaging technology used to age the \n     photographs of long-term missing children and to reconstruct \n     facial images of unidentified deceased children.\n       (12) The Center was 1 of only 10 of 300 major national \n     charities given an A+ grade in 1997 by the American Institute \n     of Philanthropy.\n       (13) In light of its impressive history, the Center has \n     been redesignated as the Nation's missing children \n     clearinghouse and resource center once every 3 years through \n     a competitive selection process conducted by the Office of \n     Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the Department \n     of Justice, and has received grants from that Office to \n     conduct the crucial purposes of the Center.\n       (14) An official congressional authorization will increase \n     the level of scrutiny and oversight by Congress and continue \n     the Center's long partnership with the Department of Justice \n     and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \n     of the Department of Justice.\n       (15) The exemplary record of performance and success of the \n     Center, as exemplified by the fact that the Center's recovery \n     rate has climbed from 62 to 91 percent, justifies action by \n     Congress to formally recognize the National Center for \n     Missing and Exploited Children as the Nation's official \n     missing and exploited children's center, and to authorize a \n     line-item appropriation for the National Center for Missing \n     and Exploited Children in the Federal budget.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Grants.--The Administrator of the Office of Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the Department of \n     Justice shall annually make a grant to the National Center \n     for Missing and Exploited Children, which shall be used to--\n       (1) operate the official national resource center and \n     information clearinghouse for missing and exploited children;\n       (2) provide to State and local governments, public and \n     private nonprofit agencies, and individuals, information \n     regarding--\n       (A) free or low-cost legal, restaurant, lodging, and \n     transportation services that are available for the benefit of \n     missing and exploited children and their families; and\n       (B) the existence and nature of programs being carried out \n     by Federal agencies to assist missing and exploited children \n     and their families;\n       (3) coordinate public and private programs that locate, \n     recover, or reunite missing children with their families;\n       (4) disseminate, on a national basis, information relating \n     to innovative and model programs, services, and legislation \n     that benefit missing and exploited children;\n       (5) provide technical assistance and training to law \n     enforcement agencies, State, and local governments, elements \n     of the criminal justice system, public and private nonprofit \n     agencies, and individuals in the prevention, investigation, \n     prosecution, and treatment of cases involving missing and \n     exploited children; and\n       (6) provide assistance to families and law enforcement \n     agencies in locating and recovering missing and exploited \n     children, both nationally and internationally.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Administrator to carry out this \n     section, $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999, 2000, \n     2001, 2002, and 2003.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This is to authorize appropriations for the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3047 and 3048, en bloc\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today I am proud to support passage of the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children Authorization Act of \n1998. This bill recognizes the outstanding record of achievements of \nthis outstanding organization and will enable NCMEC to provide even \ngreater protection of our Nation's children in the future. In addition, \nI am offering an amendment with the text of the Child Exploitation \nSentencing Enhancements Act along with the sponsors of that \nlegislation, S. 900, Senators Feingold and DeWine. Lastly, I urge the \nSenate to accept an amendment offered by Senator Leahy and myself to \nreauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and for other purposes.\n  The underlying bill, S. 2073, authorizes appropriations for the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. As part of the \nMissing Children's Assistance Act, the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention has selected and given grants to the Center for \nthe last 14 years to operate a national resource center located in \nArlington, Virginia and a national 24-hour toll-free telephone line. \nthe Center provides invaluable assistance and training to law \nenforcement around the country in cases of missing and exploited \nchildren. the Center's record is quite impressive, and its efforts have \nled directly to a significant increase in the percentage of missing \nchildren who are recovered safely.\n  In fiscal year 1998, the Center received an earmark of $6.9 million \nin the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations \nconference report. In addition, the Center's Jimmy Ryce Training Center \nreceived 1.185M in this report.\n  This legislation directs OJJDP to make a grant to the Center and \nauthorizes appropriations up to $10 million in fiscal years 1999 \nthrough 2003. The authorization would, of course, be subject to \nappropriations. This bill thus continues and formalizes NCMEC's long \npartnership with the Justice Department and OJJDP.\n  NCMEC's exemplary record of performance and success, as demonstrated \nby the fact that NCMEC's recovery rate has climbed from 62%to 91%, \njustifies action by Congress to formally recognize it as the nation's \nofficial missing and exploited children's center, and to authorize a \nline-item appropriation. This bill will enable the Center to focus \ncompletely on its missions, without expending the annual effort to \nobtain authority and grants from OJJDP. It also will allow the Center \nto expand its longer term arrangements with domestic and foreign law \nenforcement entities. By providing an authorization, the bill also will \nallow for better congressional oversight of the Center.\n  The record of the Center, described briefly below, demonstrates the \nappropriateness of this authorization.\n  For fourteen years the Center has served as the national resource \ncenter and clearinghouse mandated by the Missing Children's Assistance \nAct. The Center has worked in partnership with the Department of \nJustice, the Federal\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\nBureau of Investigation, the Department of Treasury, the State \nDepartment, and many other federal and state agencies in the effort to \nfind missing children and prevent child victimization.\n  The trust the federal government has placed in NCMEC, a private, non-\nprofit corporation, is evidenced by its unique access to the FBI's \nNational Crime Information Center, and the National Law Enforcement \nTelecommunications system (NLETS).\n  NCMEC has utilized the latest in technology, such as operating the \nNational Child Pornography Tipline, establishing its new Internet \nwebsite, www.missingkids.com, which is linked with hundreds of other \nwebsites to provide real-time images of breaking cases of missing \nchildren, and, beginning this year, establishing a new CyberTipline on \nchild exploitation.\n  NCMEC has established a national and increasingly worldwide network \nlinking NCMEC online with each of the missing children clearinghouses \noperated by the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In \naddition, NCMEC works constantly with international law enforcement \nauthorities such as Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom, the Royal \nCanadian Mounted Police, INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and \nothers. This network enables NCMEC to transmit images and information \nregarding missing children to law enforcement across America and around \nthe world instantly. NCMEC also serves as the U.S. State Department's \nrepresentative at child abduction cases under the Hague Convention.\n  The record of NCMEC is demonstrated by the 1,203,974 calls received \nat its 24-hour toll-free hotline, 1(800)THE LOST, the 146,284 law \nenforcement, criminal/juvenile justice, and healthcare professionals \ntrained, the 15,491,344 free publications distributed, and, most \nimportantly, by its work on 59,481 cases of missing children, which has \nresulted in the recovery of 40,180 children. Each of these figures \nrepresents the activity of NCMEC through this spring.\n  NCMEC is a shining example of the type of public-private partnership \nthe Congress should encourage and recognize. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation, which would help improve the performance of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and thus the \nsafety of our Nation's children.\n  In addition, I offer an amendment to S. 2073, along with Senators \nFeingold and DeWine, which contains the text of S. 900, the Child \nExploitation Sentencing Enhancement Act. It is of the utmost importance \nthat our children be protected from predatory pedophiles who roam the \nstreets and the Internet looking for innocent children to victimize. \nThese offenders need to be sent a message that the punishment for their \nactions will be serve and predictable.\n  Unfortunately, the anonymity provided by a computer linked to the \nInternet is being used by pedophiles more each day to lure children \ninto harmful, dangerous and potentially deadly situations. Often, the \nperpetrator will entice the child by convincing the child that he also \nis a child, thus easing the child's fears and inhibitions. The Hatch-\nFeingold-Dewine amendment calls for the Sentencing Commission to \nenhance the sentencing guidelines for punishment of individuals who \nhave used a computer to lure a child into sexual abuse or exploitation, \nor who has misrepresented himself for those purposes.\n  In addition to increasing the maximum penalties for first time \noffenders found guilty of transporting or enticing others for illegal \nsexual purposes or for traveling for illegal sexual purposes, the \namendment also ensures that the penalties for repeat offenders are \ntougher, as they should be. Those convicted for transporting or luring \nminors for illegal sexual purposes, of for traveling across state lines \nto abuse a minor, will face up to twice the maximum jail sentence if \nthey have previously been convicted of a similar crime. Those who are \nconvicted of crossing state lines to sexually abuse minors or who do so \non federal property, having previously been convicted of a similar \ncrime, will also see their potential prison sentences doubled.\n  Finally, the amendment will authorize funds to ensure that child \nvictims and witnesses to crimes involving sexual abuse and exploitation \nwill have the services of professional, experienced guardians appointed \nto assist them in legal proceedings where necessary and appropriate. It \nis important that those who have been traumatized by sexual abuse not \nbe victimized by the criminal justice system a second time.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \namendment.\n  Lastly, I have joined with Senator Leahy in offering an amendment to \nreauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. According to the \nNational Network for Youth, this Act provides ``critical assistance to \nyouth in high-risk situations all over the country.'' The three \nprograms, discussed in more detail below, benefit those children truly \nin need and at high risk of becoming addicted to drugs or involved in \ncriminal behavior. For these reasons, I supported including this \nreauthorization as section 306 of S. 10, the Violent and Repeat \nOffender Act.\n  The cornerstone of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act is the Basic \nCenter Program which provides grants for temporary shelter and \ncounseling for children under age 18. My home state of Utah received \nover $378,000 in grants in FY 1998 under this program, and I have \nreceived requests from Utah organizations such as the Baker Youth \nService Home to reauthorize this important program.\n  Community-based organizations also may request grants under the two \nrelated programs, the Transitional Living and the Sexual Abuse \nPrevention/Street Outreach programs. The Transitional Living grants \nprovide longer term housing to homeless teens aged 16 to 21, and aim to \nmove these teens to self-sufficiency and to avoid long-term dependency \non public assistance. The Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach \nProgram targets homeless teens potentially involved in high risk \nbehaviors.\n  In addition, the amendment reauthorizes the Runaway and homeless \nYouth Act Rural Demonstration Projects which provide assistance to \nrural juvenile populations, such as in my state of Utah. Finally, the \namendment makes several technical corrections to fix prior drafting \nerrors in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act.\n  The combination of this bill and the amendments will strengthen our \ncommitment to our youth, and I urge adoption of the amendments and the \nbill as amended.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the distinguished \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee has agreed to cosponsor my Child \nExploitation Sentencing Enhancement Amendment and add it to the \nauthorization bill for the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren (NCMEC).\n  As we all know, miraculous advances in computer technology have \nopened new worlds to citizens all across this country. It's an exciting \nfuture. But it is also a future filled with risk for vulnerable \nchildren because some in our country have chosen to exploit the new \ntechnologies to commit crimes. According to the NCMEC, criminals are \nincreasingly using computer telecommunications technology as a means to \nassist in the sexual victimization of young children and teenagers.\n  To combat this growing problem of the use of computers and the \nInternet to sexually exploit and abuse children, I introduced the Child \nExploitation Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1997 last June. The \namendment adopted by the Senate today incorporates that bill--S. 900--\nwhich was also co-sponsored by my friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. President, the same marvelous advances in computer and \ntelecommunications technology that allow our children to reach out to \nnew sources of knowledge and cultural experiences are also leaving them \nunwittingly vulnerable to exploitation and harm by pedophiles and other \nsexual predators in ways never before possible. Advances in technology \nshould not be the shield from behind which pedophiles and sexual \nmolesters target and prey upon our children. When new technologies are \nused to further the criminal sexual exploitation and abuse of children, \nit is essential, that this conduct be punished severely.\n  This amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase \ncriminal penalties for people who use a\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\ncomputer to entice children into illicit sexual conduct. The amendment \nalso directs that sentences be increased for those criminals who seek \nout children on the Internet and misrepresent their true identity in a \nknowing effort to gain the trust of the child they intend to victimize \nsexually.\n  The provisions in this amendment are directed squarely at those \nmolesters and sexual predators who go on-line and use computer chat \nrooms to target young victims. One distinct advantage of the Internet \nfor criminals is that they are able to reach a much wider audience of \npotential victims than they would if they had to be physically present \nat a schoolyard or playground. Another advantage for cyber-criminals is \nthat they have near fool-proof anonymity while they cruise the Internet \nlooking for victims. In some cases, victims are enticed or lured to \nmeet with the sexual molester. The opportunites for the criminal to \nmisrepresent his true identity and thus gain the confidence of the \nvictim is a significant aspect of these crimes. Director Freeh noted \nthis problem last year in testimony before an appropriations \nsubcommittee. He said:\n\n       Pedophiles often seek out young children by either \n     participating in or monitoring activities in chat rooms that \n     are provided by commercial on-line services for teenagers and \n     preteens to converse with each other. These chat rooms also \n     provide pedophiles an anonymous means of establishing \n     relationships with children. Using a chat room, a child can \n     converse for hours with unknown individuals, often without \n     the knowledge or approval of their parents. There is no easy \n     way for the child to know if the person he or she is talking \n     with is, in fact, another 14-year-old, or is a 40-year-old \n     sexual predator masquerading as a peer.\n\n  Director Freeh's testimony also noted that sexual criminals also \ntarget young victims by posing as children looking for pen pals or by \nposting notices on computer bulletin boards in order to facilitate and \ndevelop relationships which can in turn provide a victim for the \npredator's illegal sexual activity.\n  One chilling example of this problem comes from my own state of \nWisconsin.\n  In June 1997, a federal grand jury indicted a Jacksonville, Florida \nman for child enticement and for traveling in interstate commerce to \ncommit a sex act with a fifteen-year-old girl. The defendant first \ncontacted the girl via the Internet and over time began sending her \nincreasingly sexually explicit messages. The defendant offered to pay \nfor the girl to visit him in Florida. The entire time, the defendant \ntold the young girl that he was 21 years old when, in fact, he was 39.\n  As the sexually explicit messages escalated and it became apparent \nthat the girl would not be able to go to Florida, the man ultimately \ntraveled to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin to meet her.\n  Believing she was going to meet a 21-year-old, the girl took a friend \nand waited for the defendant at a restaurant. Upon being confronted by \nthe man--who was clearly not who he said he was--the young girl fled \ninto a restroom while the defendant stood outside and demanded that she \ncome out.\n  Later that day, based upon information provided by the girl, the man \nwas arrested by Sturgeon Bay police at a local motel at which he had \nregistered under an assumed name.\n  This is a chilling example of how criminals can use the Internet to \nfacilitate crimes against children. Thankfully, this incident did not \nend in the sexual abuse of a fifteen-year-old. But it is frightening to \nconsider what might have happened if the defendant had been able to \nlure her to the unfamiliar area of Jacksonville, Florida.\n  This is not an isolated incident; there have been other similar \ninstances in Wisconsin and across the nation. And many have not ended \nas happily as this one did.\n  In addition to increasing sentences for criminal activity involving \nthis type of conduct, my amendment expands the ``pattern of activity'' \nsentencing enhancement to a wider range of sexual abuse and \nexploitation crimes. Those criminals who have shown an ongoing pattern \nof sexually exploiting minors will be held accountable for their \nconduct through longer prison sentences. These longer sentences \nincapacitate the criminal for a longer period of time, reducing the \npotential that they will be set free to victimize again. This \nsentencing enhancement will now be applicable in cases of sexual abuse, \nsexual exploitation, and the coercion and enticement of minors for an \nillegal sexual activity.\n  In addition, the amendment targets repeat offenders by increasing \npenalties for repeat offenses and by increasing maximum penalties \navailable under the Federal criminal code. And finally, the amendment \nauthorizes funding to be used to appoint guardians ad litem for \nchildren who are the victims of, or witnesses to, crimes involving \nabuse or exploitation.\n  Mr. President, our children are our most precious resource. I am the \nfather of teenage children. Like any parent, I worry about the health \nand safety of my children. I encourage my children to utilize the \nInternet and to gain the benefits of these amazing new technologies--\ntechnologies which simply did not exist just a few years ago, not to \nmention when I was growing up. During my tenure in this body, I have \nbeen a strong believer in the potential of the Internet and sincerely \nhope that as we move toward the next century that potential will be \nrealized to the benefit of all our citizens.\n  But I am also mindful of the dangers that arise when criminals \nexploit a new technology to further their illicit criminal activity. \nThis amendment speaks directly to the small percentage of individuals \nwho intentionally misuse the Internet to prey sexually upon children. \nThe adoption of this amendment will send a message that the we will not \ntolerate the sexual exploitation of our young people on the information \nsuperhighway. Pedophiles and sexual predators are not welcome on that \nroad.\n  Mr. President, there are many different views on the best approach to \nthe potential dangers of the Internet. We have disagreements in this \nbody, as we do in the country, about the best way to protect children \nfrom sexually explicit images on the Internet. But I think we all can \nagree that when the Internet is used to facilitate criminal abuse of \nchilren, punishment should be swift and severe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Hatch has now \ndecided to join with me in including on this measure an amendment that \nwill reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act for five years. \nThis amendment complements Senator Hatch's bill to authorize the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, S.2073, because it \nprovides additional assistance to some of the most vulnerable children \nin our country--children and teenagers who have run away or become \nhomeless.\n  In 1996, I introduced legislation with Senator Simon similar to this \namendment. Unfortunately, that bill was never passed by the Judiciary \nCommittee and so the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act has not been \nauthorized for over two years. I think it is time for the Senate to \nremedy this situation and that is why I proposed this amendment to \nSenator Hatch's bill. I had also hoped to reauthorize the Incentive \nGrants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs, commonly known as the \nTitle V program, as well as two anti-drug abuse programs for runaway \nand homeless youth and gang-affiliated teenagers. But, due to \nobjections from the Republican side of the aisle, I have not been able \nto include reauthorization for those worthwhile programs in this \namendment. That is unfortunate. As a former prosecuter I know these \nprograms could cut drug abuse.\n  Reauthorizing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act for five more years \nis the first step in assuring local community programs that they will \nhave the additional resources they need to assist the growing number of \nhomeless and runaway youth in the U.S. This program distributes funding \nto local community programs which are on the front lines assisting the \napproximately 1.3 million children and youth each year who are homeless \nor have left their families for a variety of reasons. This is the sort \nof program that studies have found to be an effective and efficient use \nof limited federal dollars.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs assist some of our \nnation's neediest children--those who lack a roof over their heads. \nMany of the beneficiaries of these programs have either fled or been \nkicked out of\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\ntheir family homes due to serious family conflicts or other problems. \nThese programs assist children facing a variety of circumstances and \nprovide funding for shelters and crisis intervention services, \ntransitional living arrangements and outreach to teens who are living \non the streets.\n  The Basic Center grants for housing and crisis services for runaway \nand homeless children are awarded to each State, based on juvenile \npopulation, with a minimum grant of $100,000 currently awarded to \nsmaller States, such as Vermont. Effective community-based programs \naround the country can also apply directly for the funds made available \nfor the Transitional Living Program and the Sexual Abuse Prevention/\nStreet Outreach grants. The Transitional Living Program grants are used \nto provide longer term housing to homeless teens age 16 to 21, and to \nhelp these teenagers become more self-sufficient. The Sexual Abuse \nPrevention/Street Outreach Program also targets teens who have engaged \nin or are at risk of engaging in high risk behaviors while living on \nthe street.\n  Vermont's Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth and the Spectrum \nYouth and Family Services in Burlington, Vermont, have developed very \ncomprehensive and effective programs to assist both teens who are \nlearning to be self-sufficient and those who are struggling to survive \non the streets. As such, Vermont programs have been successful in \napplying for these two specialized programs and have been on the \nforefront of developing and improving the services available to runaway \nand homeless youth.\n  This amendment, which reauthorizes all three Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act programs, is intended to recognize the important work of \nthese programs in Vermont, as well as the many, many others across the \nU.S. that are working effectively with runaway and homeless youth and \ntheir families.\n  Our amendment also reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act \nRural Demonstration Projects for an additional five years. This program \nprovides extra assistance to States with rural juvenile populations. \nPrograms serving runaway and homeless youth have found that those in \nrural areas are particularly difficult to reach and serve effectively. \nRunaway and homeless youth programs in rural areas, such as those in \nUtah and Vermont, need additional assistance and have special needs.\n  For those who do not think rural areas have significant numbers of \nrunaway youth, I note that in fiscal year 1997, the Vermont Coalition \nfor Runaway and Homeless Youth served 987 young people in its programs \nin 10 counties. Spectrum Youth and Family Services served an additional \n259 at its center and over 2,000 through its street outreach services \nand drop-in center in Burlington. These numbers have been increasing \nrapidly over the past few years with a 154 percent increase in the \nnumber of youth served by the Vermont Coalition between 1992 and 1997. \nAn area of special concern is the increasing number of young people who \nare being ``pushed'' out of their homes--those numbers increased 263 \npercent between 1993 and 1997 in Vermont. This is in addition to the \nhundreds of children each year who find themselves homeless or who have \nrun away from home.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act does more than shelter these \nchildren in need. As the National Network for Youth stressed in their \nletter in support of my amendment, the Act's programs ``provide \ncritical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the \ncountry.'' This Act also ensures that these children and their families \nhave access to important services, such as individual, family or group \ncounseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources \nto help these young people and their families get back on track.\n  As a result of this multi-pronged approach to helping runaway and \nhomeless youth, the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth \nwas able to establish 85 percent of the youth served in 1997 in a \n``positive living situation'' by the end of the year. Of these 800 \nyoung people, 54 percent returned home and another 17 percent went to \nlive with a relative or friend.\n  The Vermont Coalition should be applauded for these fine results and \nI believe the best way to do that is to reauthorize the Runaway and \nHomeless Act for five more years, so programs like these in Vermont \nhave some greater financial security in the future.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to support passage of S.2073, \nlegislation to authorize specific funding for the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children. I am pleased to join Senator Hatch and \nothers in sponsoring this legislation.\n  I would also note that this legislation makes the same important \nchange in law that I originally proposed as an amendment during the \nJudiciary Committee's mark-up of S. 10, legislation concerning juvenile \njustice issues. My amendment was accepted by Chairman Hatch and agreed \nto by all members of the Committee.\n  So, I am particularly happy that the full Senate is today passing \nthis legislation in another form.\n  It is my hope that the House will also act to pass this bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments \nbe agreed to, en bloc, the committee amendment be agreed to, the bill, \nas amended, be considered read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3047 and 3048) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2073), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n\n                                S. 2073\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For 14 years, the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Center'') has--\n       (A) served as the national resource center and \n     clearinghouse congressionally mandated under the provisions \n     of the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984; and\n       (B) worked in partnership with the Department of Justice, \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of the \n     Treasury, the Department of State, and many other agencies in \n     the effort to find missing children and prevent child \n     victimization.\n       (2) Congress has given the Center, which is a private non-\n     profit corporation, unique powers and resources, such as \n     having access to the National Crime Information Center of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Law \n     Enforcement Telecommunications System.\n       (3) Since 1987, the Center has operated the National Child \n     Pornography Tipline, in conjunction with the United States \n     Customs Service and the United States Postal Inspection \n     Service and, beginning this year, the Center established a \n     new CyberTipline on child exploitation, thus becoming ``the \n     911 for the Internet''.\n       (4) In light of statistics that time is of the essence in \n     cases of child abduction, the Director of the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation in February of 1997 created a new NCIC child \n     abduction (``CA'') flag to provide the Center immediate \n     notification in the most serious cases, resulting in 642 \n     ``CA'' notifications to the Center and helping the Center to \n     have its highest recovery rate in history.\n       (5) The Center has established a national and increasingly \n     worldwide network, linking the Center online with each of the \n     missing children clearinghouses operated by the 50 States, \n     the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as with \n     Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom, the Royal Canadian \n     Mounted Police, INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and \n     others, which has enabled the Center to transmit images and \n     information regarding missing children to law enforcement \n     across the United States and around the world instantly.\n       (6) From its inception in 1984 through March 31, 1998, the \n     Center has--\n       (A) handled 1,203,974 calls through its 24-hour toll-free \n     hotline (1-800-THE-LOST) and currently averages 700 calls per \n     day;\n       (B) trained 146,284 law enforcement, criminal and juvenile \n     justice, and healthcare professionals in child sexual \n     exploitation and missing child case detection, \n     identification, investigation, and prevention;\n       (C) disseminated 15,491,344 free publications to citizens \n     and professionals; and\n       (D) worked with law enforcement on the cases of 59,481 \n     missing children, resulting in the recovery of 40,180 \n     children.\n       (7) The demand for the services of the Center is growing \n     dramatically, as evidenced by the fact that in 1997, the \n     Center handled 129,100 calls, an all-time record, and by the \n     fact that its new Internet website (www.missingkids.com) \n     receives 1,500,000 ``hits'' every day, and is linked with \n     hundreds of other websites to provide real-time images of \n     breaking cases of missing children, helping to cause such \n     results as a police officer in Puerto Rico searching the \n     Center's\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\n     website and working with the Center to identify and recover a \n     child abducted as an infant from her home in San Diego, \n     California, 7 years earlier.\n       (8) In 1997, the Center provided policy training to 256 \n     police chiefs and sheriffs from 50 States and Guam at its new \n     Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center.\n       (9) The programs of the Center have had a remarkable \n     impact, such as in the fight against infant abductions in \n     partnership with the healthcare industry, during which the \n     Center has performed 668 onsite hospital walk-throughs and \n     inspections, and trained 45,065 hospital administrators, \n     nurses, and security personnel, and thereby helped to reduce \n     infant abductions in the United States by 82 percent.\n       (10) The Center is now playing a significant role in \n     international child abduction cases, serving as a \n     representative of the Department of State at cases under The \n     Hague Convention, and successfully resolving the cases of 343 \n     international child abductions, and providing greater support \n     to parents in the United States.\n       (11) The Center is a model of public/private partnership, \n     raising private sector funds to match congressional \n     appropriations and receiving extensive private in-kind \n     support, including advanced technology provided by the \n     computer industry such as imaging technology used to age the \n     photographs of long-term missing children and to reconstruct \n     facial images of unidentified deceased children.\n       (12) The Center was 1 of only 10 of 300 major national \n     charities given an A+ grade in 1997 by the American Institute \n     of Philanthropy.\n       (13) In light of its impressive history, the Center has \n     been redesignated as the Nation's missing children \n     clearinghouse and resource center once every 3 years through \n     a competitive selection process conducted by the Office of \n     Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the Department \n     of Justice, and has received grants from that Office to \n     conduct the crucial purposes of the Center.\n       (14) An official congressional authorization will increase \n     the level of scrutiny and oversight by Congress and continue \n     the Center's long partnership with the Department of Justice \n     and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \n     of the Department of Justice.\n       (15) The exemplary record of performance and success of the \n     Center, as exemplified by the fact that the Center's recovery \n     rate has climbed from 62 to 91 percent, justifies action by \n     Congress to formally recognize the National Center for \n     Missing and Exploited Children as the Nation's official \n     missing and exploited children's center, and to authorize a \n     line-item appropriation for the National Center for Missing \n     and Exploited Children in the Federal budget.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a resolution I \nintroduced honoring the heroes of the Berlin Airlift. Today marks the \nfiftieth\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\nanniversary of this great undertaking. This massive Allied effort to \nprovide relief to a post war Berlin held hostage by the Soviet Union \ndisplayed to the world, the resolve of the western world to fight \noppression and began a long fight against Soviet Communism that \nculminated with the collapse of the Berlin Wall.\n  The former Soviet Union, Britain, France and the United States \noccupied separate sectors of Germany after World War II. Berlin, \nlocated in the Soviet zone of Germany, was occupied in a similar \nfashion. In response to a failing economy the Western powers undertook \nan effort to reform the German currency. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, \nkept the old German currency from entering its zones by banning, on \nJune 24, 1948, all travel into and out of the Western half of the city. \nThe Soviets also cut the supply of electricity to this zone. Berlin's \neconomy was in ruins and its citizens were under virtual seige.\n  The response to this blockade was one of the most heroic and \nmonumental undertakings in history. For fifteen months Allied transport \nplanes shipped food, coal and supplies into Berlin. During the height \nof this effort airplanes were taking off every three minutes, twenty \nfour hours a day, while delivering daily 14,000 tons of supplies. All \ntold, 2,326,205 tons of supplies were delivered by 277,728 flights in \nthe face of Soviet efforts to thwart the Allies.\n  Mr. President, these numbers do not speak to the personal stories of \nthose who organized and participated in the Berlin airlift, the \nsacrifices they made and the selflessness they displayed. They do not \nspeak to the lives lost during the operation, 31 of which were \nAmerican. They do not speak to the gratitude those in Berlin felt \ntoward the Allies who were so willing after such a brutal war, to \nprovide them with life-sustaining relief. Mr. President, let us all \nkeep these ideas in mind as we remember the Berlin Airlift, what it \nmeant to the world in a post World War II environment, and what it has \ncome to mean to us today.\n  Finally, Mr. President I would like to note that next week, on July \n2, 1998, a delegation with representatives from the Berlin Sculpture \nFund will visit Berlin to present a gift of art to the citizens of the \nFederal Republic of Germany in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of \nthe Berlin Airlift. The Berlin Sculpture Fund and its Chairman, General \nJohn Mitchell, should be commended for their work to commemorate this \nevent and the impact it made on our world's history.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, \nthe resolution, as amended, be agreed to, the amendment to the preamble \nbe agreed to, and the preamble, as amended, be agreed to, the amendment \nto the title be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to this resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3049) was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The amendment to the preamble was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 81), as amended, with its \npreamble, as amended, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con.

Mr. President, I rise in support of ``The Child Support \nPerformance and Incentive Act of 1998'' now before the Senate as \namended and urge its immediate adoption.\n  Today we take another important step forward to help millions of \nchildren receive the financial and medical support owed to them by \ntheir absent parents. The child support enforcement system involves not \nonly the federal, state, and local governments, but employers, \nfinancial institutions, and private sector agents and vendors as well.\n  By continuing to improve the child support enforcement system, we \nwill help families avoid and escape welfare dependency.\n  Mr. President, when Congress passed welfare reform nearly two years \nago, we sent a clear and unambiguous message that child support is \nindeed a personal responsibility. It has been with quiet determination \nthat Republican and Democratic members have found common ground and \nworked together to strengthen and improve the child support enforcement \nsystem. The legislation before us today is directed at fulfilling the \nresponsibilities of the states.\n  The work on this legislation began shortly after the ``Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996'' was \nsigned into law.\n  The 1996 welfare reform act required the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to recommend to Congress a new, budget-neutral \nperformance-based incentive system for the child support\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nenforcement program. H.R. 3130 incorporates those recommendations which \nwere developed in consultation with 26 representatives of state and \nlocal child support enforcement systems. The new incentive program is \nthe centerpiece of this bill.\n  Under current law, the federal government returns more than $400 \nmillion per year in child support collections to the states as \nincentive payments. But this incentive structure has been criticized \nfor years as weak and inadequate.\n  All states, regardless of actual performance, receive some incentive \npayments. But for more than a decade, performance has not been tied to \nthe national goals of the program.\n  H.R. 3130 breaks the past and creates five categories in which state \nperformance will be evaluated and rewarded. The states will be measured \naccording to their performance in paternity establishment, \nestablishment of court orders, collections of current child support \npayments, collections on past due payments, and cost effectiveness.\n  The new incentive structure is an important development not only for \nthe child support enforcement system but also as a model for improving \naccountability and performance in government.\n  The second major feature of this bill is to provide for an \nalternative penalty procedure for those states that have failed to meet \nfederal child support data processing requirements. Less than half of \nthe states have been certified as in compliance. Without this change, \nstates face not only the loss of their entire child support grant, but \nall of their funds in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nprogram as well.\n  Such a result would obviously be crippling to a state and would \nultimately hurt the very families these programs are intended to help. \nH.R. 3130 provides for a new mechanism under which HHS and the states \nwill map out a strategic plan to meet the federal requirements. States \nwhich do not achieve compliance will face tough but fair penalties.\n\n  The alternative penalty procedure is a new tool for both the state \nand federal governments to achieve compliance with federal requirements \nin the child support enforcement system. It is not intended to be a \nmeans of raising revenue at the expense of the state and potentially at \nthe expense of the very families who rely on this system.\n  H.R. 3130 also provides additional flexibility to the states in how \nthey design their automated systems. In looking back over the history \nof automation, we find there were a number of mistakes made at both the \nfederal and state levels which contributed to the delay in getting \nthese systems operational. The child support enforcement system is a \nprime example of what can happen when regulations fail to keep pace \nwith real world practices.\n  H.R. 3130 recognizes the advances in technologies and allows states \nto take advantage of these improvements. It properly refocuses federal \npolicy on function and results rather than on rigid rules.\n  All of these changes will work together to get the states in \ncompliance as quickly as possible. This will mean the child support \nenforcement system will work better for the families who depend on \nchild support.\n  Working with the states and employers, a bipartisan effort has \nyielded a three part approach to eliminate barriers to effective \nmedical support enforcement. More children will no doubt gain access to \ntheir non-custodial parents' private health insurance plans because of \nH.R. 3130. Children and taxpayers alike will benefit from the medical \nchild support provisions.\n  H.R. 3130 also makes a correction in how penalties are applied under \nthe new ``Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997'' which became law \nlast November. It is vitally important that the states be held \naccountable for assisting the children in foster care.\n  When Congress passed this legislation last fall, it sent an important \nmessage across the country that a child should not be denied the \nopportunity to be adopted into a loving and caring family simply \nbecause the prospective parents live in the next county. The intent of \nSection 202, ``Adoptions Across State and County Jurisdictions'' is to \nensure that states facilitate timely permanent placements for children \nso their wait in foster care be brief.\n  A child should not be denied the opportunity to be adopted into a \nloving and caring family simply because the prospective parents live in \nthe next county.\n  The intent of P.L. 105-89 clearly is to remove interjurisdictional \nbarriers to adoption. I am deeply concerned about recent reports that \nsome states may in fact be erecting new barriers to families who are \nseeking to adopt. There are some disturbing reports that some states \nmay be engaging in policies or practices that could create \ninterjurisdictional barriers to adoption such as discontinuance of the \nregistration of waiting families with adoption exchanges outside the \nstate, refusal to share home studies across state lines, and refusal to \nrespond to out-of-state inquiries.\n  The Secretary should closely monitor any change in state policy or \npractice which discourages families from seeking to adopt children and \ntake appropriate action if a state is not complying with the law. When \nthe Department of Health and Human Services issues regulations on how \nthe new penalties are enforced, it should of course provide the states \nwith the opportunity to present evidence of how it complies with the \nnew law. The review of this new requirement must be a fair and complete \nassessment of whether the law is being met.\n\n  Mr. President, this is indeed an important, bipartisan bill which \nwill prove itself to pay dividends for Americans' families. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a legislative history be printed in the \nRecord to reflect the Senate and House action on H.R. 3130. While there \nis a cost of $2,009 associated with printing this material, in the \nRecord, it is important that our action be clearly explained. \nFurthermore, this history is in lieu of a conference report which would \nhave been printed in the Record, so there is really no additional cost \nto the taxpayer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF SENATE AND HOUSE AMENDMENTS TO THE CHILD SUPPORT \n                 PERFORMANCE AND INCENTIVE ACT OF 1998\n\n          Title I. Child Support Data Processing Requirements\n\n\n                Sec. 101. Alternative Penalty Procedures\n\n     1. Eligibility for alternative penalty procedure\n       Present law\n       No provision. Under current law, if a State failed to \n     implement a statewide automated data processing and \n     information retrieval system by October 1, 1997 (which is a \n     child support enforcement State plan requirement), the Office \n     of Child Support Enforcement is required to ``disapprove'' \n     the State's child support enforcement plan, after an appeals \n     process, and suspend federal funding for the State's child \n     support enforcement program. Moreover, pursuant to title IV-A \n     (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; TANF), a State that \n     cannot certify that it has an approved Child Support \n     Enforcement plan when it amends its TANF plan (generally \n     every 2 years), is not eligible for TANF block grant funding. \n     Thus, a State that failed to implement a statewide automated \n     data processing and information retrieval system is in \n     eventual jeopardy of losing its TANF block grant allocation \n     along with its federal Chief Support Enforcement funding.\n       House bill\n       If the Secretary determines that a State is making good \n     faith efforts to comply with the data processing requirements \n     and if the State submits a corrective compliance plan \n     describing how it will comply, by when, and at what cost, the \n     State may avoid the penalty in current law and qualify for \n     the new penalty procedure outlined below.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     2. Penalty amount\n       Present law\n       As noted above, the penalty for noncompliance with a Child \n     Support Enforcement State plan requirement is loss of all \n     federal Child Support Enforcement funding and all TANF \n     funding as well.\n       House bill\n       The percentage penalty is 4 percent, 8 percent, 16 percent, \n     and 20 percent respectively for the first, second, third, and \n     fourth or subsequent years of failing to comply with the data \n     processing requirements. The percentage penalty is applied to \n     the amount payable to the State in the previous year as \n     Federal administrative reimbursement under the child support \n     program.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same as House bill, except in the fourth or subsequent \n     year, the percentage penalty is 30 percent.\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment with the modification that the percentage penalty \n     is 4, 8, 16, 25, and 30 percent in the first through fifth \n     and subsequent years respectively.\n     3. Penalty waiver\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       If by December 31, 1997, a State has submitted to the \n     Secretary a request that the Secretary certify the State as \n     meeting the 1998 data processing requirements and is \n     subsequently certified as a result of a review pursuant to \n     the request, all penalties are waived.\n       Senate amendment\n       If at any time during year 1998, a State has submitted to \n     the Secretary a request that the Secretary certify the State \n     as having met the 1988 data processing requirement and is \n     subsequently certified as a result of a review pursuant to \n     the request, all penalties are waived.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment except the State request that the Secretary certify \n     the state as meeting the 1988 data processing requirements \n     must be submitted by August 1, 1998.\n     4. Partial Penalty Forgiveness\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       If a State operating under the penalty procedure achieves \n     compliance with the data processing requirements before the \n     first day of the next fiscal year, then the penalty for the \n     current fiscal year is reduced by 75 percent.\n       Senate amendment\n       Under the Senate amendment, States will not face a penalty \n     in the fiscal year in which they come into compliance. \n     Moreover, if a State comes into compliance within the first \n     two years after penalties have been imposed, then the penalty \n     from the prior fiscal year is reduced by 20 percent.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment with the modifications that there is no \n     retrospective penalty reduction of 20 percent and the penalty \n     reduction in the year of certification is 90 percent. It is \n     expected that the date of certification for a given State \n     will be the date the State informs the Secretary in writing \n     that the State is ready for certification review and the \n     State in fact is certified under that review.\n     5. Penalty Reduction for Good Performance\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       States must comply with all the data processing \n     requirements imposed by the 1996 welfare reform law by \n     October 1, 2000. A State that fails to comply may \n     nonetheless have its annual penalty reduced by 20 percent \n     for each performance measure under the new incentive \n     system (see Title II below) for which it achieves a \n     maximum score. Thus, for example, a State being penalized \n     would have its penalty for a given year reduced by 60 \n     percent if it achieved maximum performance on three of the \n     five performance measures.\n       Senate enactment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     6. Penalty procedure applies to requirements of 1988 act and \n         1996 act\n       Present law\n       P.L. 104-193 requires that as part of their State child \n     support enforcement plans all States, by October 1, 2000, \n     have in effect a single statewide automated data processing \n     and information retrieval system that meets all of the \n     specified requirements, except that the deadline is extended \n     by one day for each day (if any) by which the Secretary fails \n     to meet the deadline for final regulations on the new data \n     processing requirements (i.e., which is not later than August \n     22, 1998). The disapproval procedures described above also \n     would apply to these new data processing requirements.\n       House bill\n       With the exception of the FY1998 waiver provision, which \n     applies only to the 1988 requirements, and the penalty \n     reduction provision for good performance, which applies only \n     to the 1996 requirements, the new penalty procedure applies \n     to data processing requirements of both the 1988 Family \n     Support Act and the 1996 welfare reform legislation.\n       Senate enactment\n       Same as House bill, except the Secretary may only impose a \n     single penalty for any given fiscal year with respect to the \n     establishment or operation of an automated data processing \n     and information retrieval system.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment with a modification which stipulates that a state \n     may not be penalized for violating the automatic data \n     processing and information retrieval system requirements \n     imposed under Public Law 104-193 if the state is being \n     penalized for violating the automatic data processing \n     requirements of the 1988 Family Support Act. In addition, a \n     State is not subject to more than one penalty at a given time \n     under the data processing requirements of either the 1988 Act \n     or the 1996 Act.\n     7. Exemption from TANF penalty procedures\n       Present law\n       As noted above, States without approved child support \n     enforcement plans are in eventual danger of losing funding \n     for the TANF block grant (which would include supplemental \n     and bonus TANF funding and funding for the Welfare-to-Work \n     program).\n       The TANF penalty for a State which the Secretary finds has \n     not complied with one or more of the child support \n     enforcement program requirements and has failed to take \n     sufficient corrective action to achieve the appropriate \n     performance level or compliance is subject to a graduated \n     penalty of TANF block grant funds equal to not less than 1% \n     nor more than 2% for the first finding of noncompliance; not \n     less than 2% nor more than 3% for the second consecutive \n     finding of noncompliance; and not less than 3% nor more than \n     5% for the third or subsequent finding of noncompliance.\n       House bill\n       No provision.\n       Senate amendment\n       Because States are subject to the penalty procedure \n     outlined above for violations of the data processing \n     requirement, they are exempt from the TANF penalty procedure \n     for such violations.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the Senate amendment. In addition the \n     Social Security Act is amended to clarify that TANF money \n     used as matching funds for grants under section 3037 of the \n     Transportation Equity for the 21st Century Act of 1998 can \n     only be spent on the transportation needs of families \n     eligible for TANF benefits and other low-income families. \n     TANF funds used to provide transportation services under \n     section 3037 grants are not considered assistance for \n     purposes of the TANF program.\n\n\nSec. 102. Authority to Waive Single Statewide Automated Data Processing \n              and Information Retrieval System Requirement\n\n     8. Expansion of waiver provision\n       Present law\n       Current law states that the Secretary of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services may waive any requirement related \n     to the advance planning automated data processing document or \n     the automated data processing and information retrieval \n     system if the State demonstrates to the Secretary's \n     satisfaction that the State has an alternative system or \n     systems that enable the State to be in substantial compliance \n     with other requirements of the child support enforcement \n     program. The waiver must also meet the following conditions: \n     (1) must be designed to improve the financial well-being of \n     children or otherwise improve the operation of the child \n     support enforcement program, (2) may not permit modifications \n     in the child support enforcement program which would have the \n     effect of disadvantaging children in need of support, and (3) \n     must not result in increased cost to the federal government \n     under the TANF program; or the State provides assurances to \n     the Secretary that steps will be taken to otherwise improve \n     the State's child support enforcement program.\n       House bill\n       The authority of the Secretary to waive certain data \n     processing requirements and to provide Federal funding for a \n     wider range of State data system activities is expanded to \n     include waiving the single statewide system requirement under \n     certain conditions and providing Federal funds to develop and \n     enhance local systems linked to State systems. To qualify, a \n     State must demonstrate that it can develop an alternative \n     system that: Can help the State meet the paternity \n     establishment requirement and other performance measures; can \n     submit required data to HHS that is complete and \n     reliable; substantially complies with all requirements of \n     the child support enforcement program; achieves all the \n     functional capacity for automatic data processing outlined \n     in the statute; meets the requirements for distributing \n     collections to families and governments, including cases \n     in which support is owed to more than one family or more \n     than one government; has one and only one point of contact \n     for interstate case processing and intrastate case \n     management; is based on standardized data elements, forms, \n     and definitions that are used throughout the State; can be \n     operational in no more time than it would take to achieve \n     an operational single statewide system; and can process \n     child support cases as quickly, efficiently, and \n     effectively as would be possible with a single statewide \n     system.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     9. Federal payments under waiver provision\n       Present law\n       To be approved for a waiver, a State must demonstrate that \n     the proposed project: (1) is designed to improve the \n     financial well-being of children or otherwise improve the \n     operation of the child support program; (2) does not permit \n     modifications in the child support program that would have \n     the effect of\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\n     disadvantaging children in need of support; and (3) does not \n     result in increased cost to the Federal government under the \n     TANF program.\n       House bill\n       In addition to the various waiver requirements described in \n     provision #8 above, and to the requirements in current law, \n     the State must submit to the Secretary separate estimates of \n     the costs to develop and implement both a single statewide \n     system and the alternative system being proposed by the State \n     plus the costs of operating and maintaining these systems for \n     5 years from the date of implementation. The Secretary must \n     agree with the estimates.

Child Support Incentive System\n\n\n                 Sec. 201. Incentive Payments to states\n\n     1. Amount of incentive payments\n       Present law\n       Each State receives an incentive payment equal to at least \n     6 percent of the State's total amount of child support \n     collected on behalf of TANF families for the year, plus at \n     least 6 percent of the State's total amount of child support \n     collected on behalf of non-TANF families for the year. [Note: \n     P.L. 98-378, the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of \n     1984, stipulates that political subdivisions of a State that \n     participate in the costs of support enforcement must receive \n     an appropriate share of any incentive payment given to the \n     State. P.L. 98-378 also requires States to develop criteria \n     for passing through incentives to localities, taking into \n     account the efficiency and effectiveness of local programs.]\n       House bill\n       The incentive payment for a State for a given year is \n     calculated by multiplying the incentive payment pool for the \n     year by the State's incentive payment share for the year.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     2. Incentive payment pool\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       The incentive payment pool is equal to the CBO estimate of \n     incentive payments for each year under current law. \n     Specifically, the amounts (in millions) for fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2008 respectively are: $422, $429, $450, $461, $454, \n     $446, $458, $471 and $483. Specifying these amounts in the \n     statute assures that the incentive payments will be budget \n     neutral. After 2008, the incentive payment pool increases \n     each year by an amount equal to the rate of inflation.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     3. Calculating incentive payments\n       Present law\n       The maximum incentive payment for a State could reach a \n     high of 10 percent of child support collected on behalf of \n     TANF families plus 10 percent of child support collected on \n     behalf of non-TANF families. There is a limit, however, on \n     the incentive payment for non-TANF child support collections. \n     The incentive payments for such collections may not exceed \n     115 percent of incentive payments for TANF child support \n     collections.\n       House bill\n       In addition to the incentive payment pool, incentive \n     calculations are based on the five factors defined below. The \n     general approach is to pay to each State its share of the \n     incentive payment pool based on the quality of its \n     performance on the five incentive performance measures. The \n     five computational factors are:\n       (1) State collections base is used to ensure that incentive \n     payments are proportional to the amount of child support \n     collected by the State; collections for welfare cases are \n     given double the weight of collections for nonwelfare \n     cases in the calculations;\n       (2) Maximum incentive base amount is simply a device to \n     give extra weight to three of the five incentive performance \n     measures because these measures are thought to be more \n     important to State performance. Specifically, paternity \n     establishment, establishment of support orders, and \n     collections on current support receive full weight in the \n     calculations, while collections on past-due support and the \n     cost-effectiveness performance level receive a weight of only \n     75 percent of the other three measures;\n       (3) Applicable percentage is the actual measure of \n     performance effectiveness and is determined by looking up the \n     raw performance level in a table; there is a different table \n     for each of the five performance measures (see below);\n       (4) Incentive base amount is the total of the applicable \n     percentages for each of the five performance measures \n     multiplied by their respective maximum incentive base amounts \n     (either 1.00 or 0.75);\n       (5) State incentive payment share is a percentage \n     calculated by using the four factors defined above. This \n     measure specifies the percentage share of the annual payment \n     pool that each State receives. The State incentive payment \n     share takes into account the State's performance on all five \n     incentive performance measures, the weighting of the five \n     incentive performance measures, its collections in the TANF \n     and non-TANF caseloads, and its performance relative to other \n     States.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     4. Data used to calculate ratios required to be complete and \n         reliable\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       The payment on each of the five performance measures is \n     zero unless the Secretary determines that the data submitted \n     by the State for each measure is complete and reliable.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     5. State collections base\n       Present law\n       Although the collections base terminology is not used, the \n     incentive payment is based on total child support collected \n     on behalf of TANF families (i.e., TANF collections) plus \n     total child support collected on behalf of non-TANF families \n     (i.e., non-TANF collections).\n       House bill\n       The collections base for a fiscal year is the sum of two \n     categories of child support collections by the State. The \n     first category is collections on cases in the State child \n     support welfare caseload. This category includes families \n     that are currently or were formerly receiving benefits from \n     TANF (or its predecessor program Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children), from Medicaid under Title XIX, or from \n     foster care under Title IV-E. Total collections from this \n     category are doubled in the State collections base \n     calculation. The second category is collections from all \n     other families receiving services from the State child \n     support enforcement program.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     6. Determination of applicable percentages for paternity \n         establishment performance level\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       The paternity establishment performance level for a State \n     for a fiscal year is, at the option of the State, either the \n     paternity establishment percentage of cases in the child \n     support program or the paternity establishment percentage of \n     all births in the State. In both cases, the paternity \n     establishment percentage is obtained by dividing the cases in \n     which paternity is established by the total number of \n     nonmarital births. The applicable percentage is then \n     determined in accord with the table in new section \n     458A(b)(6)(A) of the Social Security Act (see Table 1 below).\n       Special rule for computing the applicable percentage for \n     paternity establishment: If the paternity establishment \n     performance level of a State is less than 50 percent but \n     exceeds by at least 10 percentage points the paternity \n     establishment performance level of the State for the \n     immediately preceding fiscal year, then the applicable \n     percentage for the State paternity establishment performance \n     level is 50 percent.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment.\n     7.

Adoption Provisions\n\n\nsec. 301. more flexible penalty procedure to be applied for failing to \n                  permit interjurisdictional adoption\n\n       Present law\n       Under section 474(e) of the Social Security Act (as \n     established by P.L. 105-89), a State is not eligible for any \n     foster care or adoption assistance payments under Title IV-E \n     if the Secretary finds that the State has denied or delayed a \n     child's adoptive placement when an approved family is \n     available outside the jurisdiction with responsibility for \n     handling the child's case, or the State has failed to grant \n     an opportunity for a fair hearing to anyone who alleges that \n     a violation of this provision was denied by the State or not \n     acted upon promptly.\n       House bill\n       The current penalty of losing all Federal Title IV-E funds \n     for violating the jurisdictional provision is dropped and a \n     new penalty is substituted. Under the new penalty, States \n     that violate the adoption provision would receive a penalty \n     equal to 2 percent of the Federal funds for foster care and \n     adoption under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act for the \n     first violation, 3 percent for the second violation, and 5 \n     percent for the third and subsequent violations.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment. The intent of a major provision of the Adoption \n     and Safe Families Act of 1997 is to remove \n     interjurisdictional barriers to adoption to ensure that \n     States facilitate timely permanent placements for children. \n     Any State policy or practice that denies a child the \n     opportunity to be adopted across State or county \n     jurisdictions is in clear violation of the Act. The \n     Department of Health and Human Services must develop a \n     comprehensive monitoring strategy to uncover state \n     violations. The new penalties for violating the \n     interjurisdictional provision are aimed at enforcing State \n     plan violations by reducing for a fiscal quarter the amount \n     of money payable to the State by 2 percent for the first \n     violation, 3 percent for the second violation, and 5 percent \n     for the third and subsequent violations. Congress expects the \n     Secretary to carefully monitor changes in State policy on \n     interjurisdictional barriers and to use the new penalties \n     enacted by Congress if necessary.\n       The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 does not prevent \n     a State from making efforts to preserve or reunify a family \n     in cases of aggravated circumstances, as long as the child's \n     health and safety are the paramount considerations. In \n     addition, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 \n     establishes a new requirement that States must initiate \n     termination of parental rights proceedings in specific cases \n     that are outlined in the law. However, the law only requires \n     States to initiate such proceedings and does not mandate the \n     outcome. Moreover, the law provides that States are not \n     required to initiate termination of parental rights in \n     certain cases, including when there is a compelling reason to \n     conclude that such proceedings would not be in the child's \n     best interest. Thus, the State retains the discretion to make \n     case-by-case determinations regarding whether to seek \n     termination of parental rights.\n\n                    Title IV. Technical Corrections\n\n\n sec. 401. elimination of barriers to the effective Establishment and \n                  Enforcement of Medical Child Support\n\n       Present law\n       P.L. 104-193 required Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act (ERISA) plan administrators to honor health insurance \n     orders (i.e. medical support orders) issued by courts or \n     administrative agencies. It appears that many ERISA plan \n     administrators interpreted the statutory language as \n     requiring the actual receipt of a copy of the order itself. \n     Since it is the practice of many CSE agencies to simply \n     notify the ERISA plan administrator that an order has been \n     issued for a case, many plan administrators did not \n     recognize the administrative notice as sufficient to meet \n     the requirements of current law. Currently only 60% of all \n     national child support orders include a medical support \n     component. In its 1996 review of state child support \n     enforcement programs, GAO reported that at least 13 states \n     were not consistently petitioning to include medical \n     support in its general support orders, and 20 states were \n     not enforcing existing medical support orders.\n       House bill\n       No provision.\n       Senate amendment\n       The Senate amendment requires the Secretaries of the \n     Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor to design \n     and implement a National Standardized Medical Support Notice. \n     Proposed regulations would be required no later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment, and final regulations no later \n     than 1 year after the Date of enactment. State child support \n     enforcement agencies would be required to use this \n     standardized form to communicate the issuance of a medical \n     support order, and employers would be required to accept the \n     form as a ``qualified medical support order'' under the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The \n     Secretaries would jointly establish a medical support working \n     group, not later than 90 days after the date of enactment, to \n     identify and make recommendations for the removal of other \n     barriers to effective medical support. The working group's \n     report on recommendations for appropriate measures to address \n     the impediments to effective enforcement of medical support \n     is due to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the \n     Congress, no later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, would be required to \n     submit to Congress, not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of this bill, a report containing recommendations \n     for any additional ERISA changes necessary to improve medical \n     support enforcement.\n       Agreement\n       Medical child support is an essential part of any general \n     child support order because it ensures a child will have \n     access to quality private health care coverage to which she \n     or he would not have access even if available to the \n     noncustodial parent through the employer at reasonable costs. \n     It also prevents the misuse of Federal programs such as \n     Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program as \n     a backdoor alternative for parents who shirk their medical \n     child support responsibilities. Although ERISA already \n     requires that employers enforce medical child support orders \n     if those orders meet certain criteria laid out in that \n     statute (which qualifies them as Qualified Medical Child \n     Support Orders or QMSCOs), effective enforcement of \n     medical child support is still thwarted by (1) a lack of \n     standardized communication between the state child support \n     enforcement agencies, parents' employers, and the plan \n     administrators of parents' health insurance plans and (2) \n     uniform process for enforcement. Streamlining the medical \n     support process for ERISA plans and non-ERISA plans alike \n     is essential to ensure that all children receive the \n     medical support for which they are eligible and to which \n     they are entitled.\n       The agreement follows the Senate provision on medical \n     support with changes. The agreement requires that the Medical \n     Child Support Working Group be established within 60 days \n     after the date of enactment. It is expected that \n     representatives of states, employers, advocacy groups, IV-D \n     agencies and associations, experts in ERISA, and others who \n     must administer this process be invited to participate in the \n     working group. The working group is required to submit its \n     recommendations for appropriate measures to address the \n     impediments to effective enforcement of medical support as \n     well as recommendations on other issues as specified in the \n     statute, to the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and \n     Labor no later than 18 months after the date of enactment. \n     The Secretary of HHS should use its child support technical \n     assistance budget for special projects (per Section 452(j) of \n     the Title IV-D program under the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 652(j) as authorized by Section 354(a) of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996) to hire an outside facilitator to moderate and staff \n     Workgroup proceedings. The Secretaries are required to submit \n     their joint report to Congress no later than 2 months after \n     they receive the recommendations of the working group.\n       In general, the agreement would follow the Senate provision \n     with respect to the development and promulgation by \n     regulation of a\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\n     National Medical Support Notice to be issued by the States as \n     a means of ensuring that the medical support provisions in a \n     child support order are properly carried out. States' use of \n     the National Medical Support Notice will ensure enrollment of \n     the child in available health care coverage, as appropriate. \n     The National Medical Support Notice (1) is to conform to the \n     provisions specified in section 609(a)(3) of ERISA \n     (irrespective of whether the group health plan is covered by \n     reason of section 4 of such Act), and (2) is to include a \n     separate and easily severable employer withholding notice \n     (which can be made severable in any reasonable manner and not \n     limited to perforated paper). Interim regulations for the \n     National Medical Support Notice would be required within 10 \n     months of the date of enactment, and final regulations no \n     later than 1 year after the issuance of the interim \n     regulations.\n       The agreement requires State Child Support Enforcement \n     agencies to use the National Medical Support Notice to \n     transfer notice of provision of health care coverage for the \n     child to the non-custodial parent's employer (unless \n     alternative coverage is allowed for in any order of the court \n     or other entity issuing the order). The employer is then \n     required, within 20 business days, to send the national \n     notice, excluding the employer withholding notice, to the \n     appropriate plan providing health care coverage for which the \n     child is eligible. The employer withholding notice is also to \n     inform the employer of applicable provisions of state law \n     (and related information) requiring the employer to withhold \n     any employee contributions due as may be required to \n     enroll the child under such plan.\n       The agreement requires all plan administrators who receive \n     an appropriately completed National Medical Support Notice to \n     comply with such notice. The plan administrator is then to \n     report back to the State within 40 business days of the date \n     of the Notice whether coverage is available, whether the \n     child is covered and the date of coverage, and if the child \n     is not covered and coverage is available, any steps needed to \n     enroll the child under the plan. The agreement also requires \n     the plan administrator to provide to the custodial parent (or \n     substituted official) any forms or documents (including any \n     health care cards and claim forms) necessary to enroll the \n     child in coverage and ensure access to such coverage. Nothing \n     in this provision is to be construed as requiring a covered \n     group health plan to provide benefits (or eligibility for \n     such benefits) which are not otherwise provided under the \n     terms of the plan.\n       It is expected that federal plans will also comply with \n     these requirements.\n       The agreement also applies the requirements of the National \n     Medical Support Notice to certain other plans that are not \n     covered under section 609 of ERISA.\n\n\n            sec. 402. safeguard of new employee information\n\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       No provision.\n       Senate amendment\n       The Senate amendment would impose a fine of $1,000 for each \n     act of unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or use of \n     information in the National Directory of New Hires. It would \n     also require that data entered into the National Directory of \n     New Hires be deleted 24 months after the date of entry for \n     individuals who have a child support order. For an individual \n     who does not have a child support order, the data would be \n     required to be deleted after 12 months.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications. The $1,000 fine is retained and the Social \n     Security Administration (SSA), which maintains the New Hires \n     data base under contract with HHS, must delete the New Hire \n     and wage and unemployment compensation data within 24 months \n     after receipt. However, HHS will not have access to the wage \n     and unemployment compensation data after 12 months for \n     individuals who have not been found to have a child support \n     order. The Secretary may retain data on a sample of cases for \n     research purposes. In addition, the Secretary must inform \n     Congress within 90 days after enactment of the purposes for \n     which the New Hire and wage and unemployment compensation \n     data will be used. The Secretary must also inform Congress at \n     least 30 days before the data is to be used for a purpose not \n     specified in the original report. Within 3 years after \n     enactment, the Secretary must report to Congress on the \n     accuracy of New Hire data and the effectiveness of the \n     procedures designed to safeguard the New Hire information.\n\n\n  sec. 403. conforming amendments regarding the collection and use of \n social security numbers for the purposes of child support enforcement\n\n       Present law\n       Federal law (section 205(c)(2)(C) allows any State (or \n     subdivision of the State) to use Social Security account \n     numbers in the administration of any tax, public assistance, \n     driver's license, or motor vehicle registration laws within \n     its jurisdiction to identify individuals affected by such \n     laws.\n       House bill\n       No provision.\n       Senate amendment\n       The Senate amendment revises the current statute to reflect \n     the social security numbers also must be used by the agencies \n     administering the renewal of professional licenses, driver's \n     licenses, occupational licenses, or recreational licenses to \n     respond to requests for information from Child Support \n     Enforcement agencies; and that all divorce decrees, support \n     orders, paternity determinations and paternity \n     acknowledgments must include the social security number of \n     the applicable individuals for the purpose of responding to \n     requests for information from Child Support Enforcement \n     agencies.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the House bill; i.e., no provision.\n\n\n sec. 404. clarification of definition regarding high-volume automated \n              administrative enforcement of child support\n\n       Present law\n       Federal law (section 466(a)(14) of the Social Security Act, \n     as amended by section 5550 of P.L. 105-33) requires States to \n     conduct ``high-volume automated administrative enforcement,'' \n     to the same extent as used for intrastate cases, in response \n     to a request made by another state to enforce a child support \n     order and promptly report the results of such enforcement \n     procedures to the requesting state. Federal law also defines \n     ``high-volume automated administrative enforcement.''\n       House bill\n       No provision.\n       Senate amendment\n       The Senate amendment eliminates the definition of ``high-\n     volume automated administrative enforcement'' from the \n     statute.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement replaces the definition of ``high-volume \n     automated administrative enforcement'' in current law with a \n     clearer definition. The new definition requires states, upon \n     request from another state in an interstate case, to use \n     automated data matches with financial institutions and other \n     entities to locate the obligor's assets and, when assets are \n     discovered, to seize these asset through levy or other \n     appropriate process. The agreement also includes a provision \n     allowing the Secretary, through the Federal Parent Locator \n     Service, to help States work with financial institutions \n     doing business in 2 or more states. The Secretary may send \n     identifying information to such financial institutions on all \n     individuals who owe past-due child support in any state. The \n     financial institutions will then transmit back to the \n     Secretary the identifying information on individuals who owe \n     past-due support for whom they have accounts; the Secretary \n     will transmit this information back to the state that \n     submitted the identifying information. The State will take \n     appropriate actions to seize the assets. This provision does \n     not allow the Secretary to have access to any financial \n     information on individuals holding accounts in these \n     financial institutions. Multi-state financial institutions \n     that respond to requests for information from the Secretary \n     are not expected to respond to such requests from any state \n     for which they have accepted information from the Secretary. \n     However, states that now conduct these data matches with \n     financial institutions that do business in 2 or more states \n     may continue such procedures until January 1, 2000. This \n     provision is not intended to prohibit a State from requiring \n     any financial institution doing business in the State to \n     report account information directly to the State for purposes \n     other than child support enforcement. Financial institutions \n     that provide identifying information to the Secretary or \n     seize assets at the request of States are not liable under \n     State or Federal law for such actions.\n\n\n              sec. 405. general accounting office reports\n\n       Present law\n       No provision.\n       House bill\n       No provision.\n       Senate amendment\n       The Senate amendment would require the Comptroller General \n     of the United States (i.e., the General Accounting Office) to \n     report to Congress, no later than December 31, 1998, on the \n     feasibility of implementing an instant check system for \n     employers to use in identifying individuals with child \n     support orders. The report is to include a review of the use \n     of the Federal Parent Locator Service, including the Federal \n     Case Registry of Child Support Orders and the National \n     Directory of New Hires, and the adequacy of the privacy \n     protections.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n\n\n sec. 406. technical corrections (this provision is section 401 of the \n                              house bill)\n\n       Present law\n       Under section 473A of the Social Security Act (as \n     established by P.L. 105-89), States may receive financial \n     incentives for increasing their number of adoptions of foster \n     children, above an annual base level. In determining the base \n     levels for each State, the Secretary will use data from the \n     Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System \n     (AFCARS). However, in determining the base levels for fiscal \n     years 1995 through 1997, the Secretary may use alternative \n     data sources, as reported by a State by November 30, 1997, \n     and approved by the Secretary by March 1, 1998.\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\n       Under Section 466(a)(13) of the Social Security Act (as \n     established by P.L. 104-193 and amended by P.L. 105-33), \n     states must have procedures requiring that the social \n     security number of an applicant for a professional license, \n     driver's license, occupational license, recreational, or \n     marriage license be recorded on the application. In \n     addition, the social security number of a person subject \n     to a divorce decree, support order, or paternity \n     determination or acknowledgment must be placed in the \n     records relating to the matter. Also social security \n     numbers must be recorded on death certificates. The \n     statute permits the state to use a number other than the \n     social security number in some cases. If a state chooses \n     this option, it must still keep the social security number \n     of the applicant on file.\n       The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \n     Act of 1996 required States to collect social security \n     numbers on applications for State licenses for purposes of \n     checking the identity of immigrants by October 1, 2000.\n       House bill\n       The current law on alternative data sources to calculate \n     the adoption incentive amount only allowed the use of data \n     reported by States by November 30, 1997 and approved by the \n     Secretary by March 1, 1998. The new provision provides States \n     with an additional 5 months to report data (until April 30, \n     1998) and the Secretary with an additional 4 months to \n     approve the data (until July 1, 1998).\n       The House bill changes the January 1, 1998 date in the 1996 \n     welfare reform law pertaining to State licenses to October 1, \n     2000, or such earlier date as the State selects.\n       Senate amendment\n       Same.\n       Agreement\n       The Agreement follows the House bill and the Senate \n     amendment with some additional technical amendments. The \n     State data reporting on child support enforcement required \n     under section 469 of the Social Security Act is simplified. \n     The provision on eligibility for services in the Welfare-to-\n     Work program authorized by section 403(a)(5) of the Social \n     Security Act is clarified by allowing states to provide \n     services to noncustodial parents of children who meet the \n     qualifications for benefits under the program. Two sections \n     of the Child Support Enforcement statute at Title IV-D of the \n     Social Security Act regarding the use of the Federal Parent \n     Locator Service (FPLS) are clarified. Language on use of the \n     FPLS for making or enforcing child custody or visitation \n     orders is removed from section 453 where it had been placed \n     inadvertently by legislation enacted in 1997. The language on \n     use of the FPLS in cases of parental kidnaping, child \n     custody, or parental visitation is located in section 463. \n     This statute requires States to receive and transmit to the \n     Secretary requests from authorized persons (State agents, \n     attorneys, or courts). The provisions of section 463, which \n     carefully balance the rights of children, custodial parents, \n     and noncustodial parents, are intended to ensure that the \n     FPLS is used in an even-handed fashion to assist both parents \n     in achieving access to their children under appropriate \n     circumstances. States must honor the requests of noncustodial \n     parents to have access, through local courts, to information \n     in the FPLS if the procedures of section 463 are followed.\n\n                    Title V. Immigration Provisions\n\n\n    Sec. 501. Aliens Ineligible to Receive Visas and Excluded from \n               Admission for Nonpayment of Child Support\n\n       Present law\n       No comparable provision. The Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (INA) enumerates a number of reasons why an alien may be \n     ineligible to receive visas and excluded from admission, \n     including the likelihood of becoming a public charge, but \n     failure to pay child support is not among them.\n       House bill\n       Amends the INA to makes inadmissible any alien legally \n     obligated to pay child support whose failure to pay has \n     resulted in an arrearage exceeding $5,000, until child \n     support payments are made or the alien is in compliance with \n     an approved payment agreement. Extends applicability to \n     aliens previously admitted for permanent residence (i.e., as \n     immigrants) who are seeking readmission. Authorizes the \n     Attorney General to waive inadmissibility in a given case if \n     he or she: (1) has received a waiver request from the court \n     or administrative agency with jurisdiction over the child \n     support case; and (2) determines that granting the waiver \n     would substantially increase the likelihood that past and \n     future child support payments would be made.\n       Senate amendment\n       No provision.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the Senate amendment except that the \n     Secretary of HHS is required to write a report, after \n     consulting with the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     (INS), on the feasibility of enacting the provision on child \n     support enforcement against aliens in the House bill. The \n     report, which must be delivered to Congress within 6 months \n     of enactment, must include an assessment of whether the INS \n     can effectively implement the requirements of the House \n     provision.\n\n\n  Sec. 502. Effect of Nonpayment of Child Support on Establishment of \n                          good Moral Character\n\n       Present law\n       No comparable provision in the reasons given in the INA for \n     a determination that an alien is not a person of good moral \n     character; such a determination is necessary for an immigrant \n     to naturalize.\n       House bill\n       Amends the INA to preclude a finding of good moral \n     character, and thus naturalization, if a person obligated to \n     pay child support has failed to do so, with the opportunity \n     to overcome this either by meeting the child support \n     obligation or complying with an approved payment agreement.\n       Senate amendment\n       No provision.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the

 No comparable provision among the functions Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) officers are authorized by the \n     INA to perform during the inspections process.\n       House bill\n       Amends the INA to authorize INS officers, to the extent \n     consistent with state law, to serve an applicant for \n     admission with a writ, order, or summons in a child support \n     case.\n       Senate amendment\n       No provision.\n       Agreement\n       The agreement follows the Senate Amendment; i.e., no \n     provision.\n\n\nsec. 504. authorization to obtain

It has come to my attention that some States are \nengaging in policies or practices that could create interjurisdictional \nbarriers to adoption, such as discontinuance of the registration of \nwaiting families with adoption exchanges outside the State, refusal to \nshare home studies across State lines, and refusal to respond to out-\nof-state inquiries. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (P.L. 105-89), \nenacted last year, explicitly established that States shall not take \nany action that would deny or delay a child's adoption when an approved \nfamily is available outside the child's jurisdiction. In light of these \nrecent reports, I urge the Department of Health and Human Services to \nclosely monitor State policy and practice with regard to interstate \nadoptions to determine compliance with the new law, to immediately \nreport any change of policy or practice in this area to the States, and \nto impose the full penalty on States which are out of compliance.\n  I have been told by some organizations which represent the States' \ninterests that they consider Sec. 202 of Public Law 105-89 to be \nambiguous and that the Adoption and Safe Families Act did not \nnecessarily prohibit creating barriers to adoption. Let me make this \nvery clear, while the Adoption and Safe Families Act does not \nspecifically declare that States shall not create barriers to adoption, \nCongresssional intent is clear that any action that delays an adoption, \nwhen an approved family is available, would be a violation of the law. \nThus, policies that might result in such delays would be inconsistent \nwith the law's intent. Particularly when viewed in the context of the \nentire Adoption and Safe Families Act, which is designed to promote and \nexpedite adoptions, there can be no confusion about Congressional \nintent. In addition, this requirement is not inconsistent with other \nprovisions in federal child welfare law that require States to recruit \na diverse pool of potentially adoptive families, nor should it \ndiscourage States from developing adoptive families within their own \nborders. The overall goal is to place children for adoption with \napproved families without any unnecessary delay. Simply put, the law \nestablishes that States shall not discriminate in adoptive placements \non the basis of geography.\n  Let me give you examples of created barriers: any refusal to return \nphone calls from outside the agency's jurisdiction; the suggestion that \nagencies have a property right which permits them to withhold a \nhomestudy from a preadoptive family; the imposition of conditions on \nfamilies from outside the jurisdiction which are different in quantity \nor quality from conditions imposed on families within the jurisdiction; \nor, the refusal to accept home studies performed by duly licensed \nsocial workers from another jurisdiction without good cause to believe \nthose social workers are dishonest or incompetent.\n  We have a national crisis on our hands. Thousands of children are \nwaiting for families to adopt them. If we don't recognize this, \nchildren will continue to live out their childhoods in foster care. \nTerritory and turf should not come between waiting children and \nadoptive families. Any barrier created to deny or delay an adoptive \nplacement is an injustice. Although States can spend hundreds of \ndollars recruiting adoptive families, they need to remember, they do \nnot own these families. Their recruitment efforts contribute to a \nnational recruitment effort for the nation's waiting children, not just \ntheir State's children. I recognize that many states are pulling out \nall the stops for kids. But they cannot do all the work. We all must do \neverything we can to ensure that children are united with loving, \nnurturing families, and we cannot let geography get in the way.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsupport of the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998. It \nis my firm belief that this legislation will significantly improve the \nfinancial stability, health and well-being of millions of American \nchildren. My most sincere thanks to Senators Snowe, Kerry, Jeffords and \nDodd, who co-sponsored the Child Support Performance Improvement Act of \n1997, the bill that laid much of the groundwork for this legislation in \nthe Senate. I would like to thank Senator Jim Jeffords in particular \nfor his help in securing the inclusion of vital medical child support \nenforcement provisions in this legislation. I would also like to \nexpress my appreciation to my colleagues Senators Ted Kennedy and Dan \nCoats for their unwavering commitment to children and for their work on \nsecuring better medical child support enforcement.\n  There is no doubt that child support penalties and incentives \npayments simply do not generate the flash and natural interest that \nother children's issues do. The Child Support Performance and Incentive \nAct of 1998 addresses some very complicated financing formulas, complex \ninteractions between the Federal government and state child support \nenforcement agencies and hidden budget implications. Despite its plain \nwrapping, however, effective child support enforcement is one of the \nmost important roles the Federal government plays in facilitating a \nreal continuum of quality benefits and services for children in this \ncountry.\n  In my role as Governor of West Virginia and later as Senator and \nChairman of the National Commission on Children, my ultimate goal has \nalways been the same: to make sure that all children receive the \nspecialized supports necessary to address a wide range of financial, \nemotional and medical needs. Child support is one of the most vital \nsources of support for millions of American children, and the Child \nSupport Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 strengthens state \nenforcement of\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\nthese obligations in a variety of areas. I am proud of the fact that my \nstate works hard to enforce its child support obligations and does an \nexcellent job. It is my hope that this legislation will encourage West \nVirginia and other states do their job even more effectively.\n  One of the most important and, unfortunately, overlooked areas of \nchild support is the enforcement of medical child support (that is, \nhealth insurance or medical costs covered by the non-custodial parent). \nSince 1984, Federal law has required state child support enforcement \nagencies to pursue medical support as part of every child support \norder. Despite this requirement, only 60% of national child support \norders contain a medical support component. In its 1996 review of state \nchild support enforcement programs, GAO found that at least 13 states \nwere not consistently petitioning to include medical support in their \ngeneral support orders, and 20 states were not enforcing existing \nmedical support orders at all.\n  Such limited enforcement of medical support is dismal, particularly \nin light of the fact that health insurance and premiums provided \nthrough a non-custodial parent's health plan are often a child's only \nchance for comprehensive medical care. My colleagues and I have worked \nvery hard to make sure that Federal programs such as Medicaid and the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program provide quality health care for \nchildren whose families cannot afford to cover them. While no one could \ncare more about these Federal programs than I do, they are not designed \nto be and should not be misused as a backdoor for parents who shirk \ntheir medical support responsibilities.\n  Unfortunately, effective medical child support enforcement is \nthwarted by a lack of standardized communication between state child \nsupport enforcement agencies and the employers and plan administrators \nresponsible for the non-custodial parent's health plan. This is \nparticularly true for health plans that are governed by the Employment \nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) which represent 50% of all \nemployer health plans. With 700,000 children dependent on medical \nsupport through ERISA-governed plans and an additional 1,000,000 \nchildren dependent on medical support through non-ERISA governed \nmedical plans, it is essential that communication between states, \nemployers, and plan administrators be as efficient as possible.\n  The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 seeks to \nimprove enforcement of medical support in two ways. First, it orders \nthe Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to develop \na medical support incentive measure which would base a percentage of \neach qualified state's annual Federal incentives payment on its ability \nto establish and enforce medical child support. If implemented by \nCongress, this sixth performance measure would be added to the first \nfive already included in this legislation: (1) establishment of \npaternity; (2) establishment of child support orders; (3) enforcement \nof current child support orders; (4) enforcement of back child support \n(or ``arrearages''); and (5) cost effectiveness. Once HHS develops this \nmedical child support incentive measure, Congress has the \nresponsibility to make sure it becomes part of the overall incentives \nprogram.\n  The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 also takes \nanother important step towards effective medical support enforcement by \nrequiring the Secretaries of the Department of Human Services and the \nDepartment of Labor to develop a National Medical Support Notice as a \nmeans of enforcing the health care provisions of a child support order. \nUnder this new requirement, all states would be required to use and all \nemployers and plan administrators would be required to accept the \nNational Medical Support Notice as a qualified medical child support \norder under ERISA.\n  This standardization is an essential step in ensuring that everyone \nis on the same page when it comes to providing eligible children with \nthe health care coverage they deserve. The legislation also requires \nHHS and DoL to bring together a Medical Child Support Work Group \ncomposed of employers, plan administrators, state child support \ndirectors, and child advocates which will recommend additional ways to \nremove the remaining barriers to effective medical support. We have \nalso required that HHS and DoL submit their recommendations for further \nlegislative solutions to improve medical support, including any \nnecessary changes to ERISA.\n  With $15 to $25 billion each year in uncollected child support, we \nhave a long way to go to strengthen our national and state child \nsupport systems. I am hopeful, however, that the changes brought about \nin this legislation make significant progress towards the ultimate goal \nof ensuring child support for every child who is entitled to it. In \nthat regard, I am particularly pleased that medical child support \nenforcement is finally receiving the attention it deserves in the \ncontext of these broader changes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, yesterday the House of Representatives \npassed H.R. 3130, the Child Support bill by unanimous consent. Today, \nthe Senate will pass the same bill. One provision in the bill affects \nqualified medical child support orders, a provision in the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and a matter under the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Senators \nKennedy, Coats and myself were conferees on that provision.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Roth for including \na description of the changes we agreed upon in his explanatory \nmaterial. It is terribly important that this explanation be made a part \nof the legislative history on medical child support orders..\n  There are 700,000 children in the United States today who are \neligible for medical support from a non-custodial parent. All too often \nwhen the States attempt to enforce a medical child support order, the \nplan sponsors have had fiduciary concerns regarding some aspect of the \nmedical support order and, consequently medical benefits were denied to \nthe child. Hopefully, this legislation will alleviate those concerns \nand more children will be covered under private health benefit plans. \nThe legislation requires the Departments of Health and Human Services \nand Labor to quickly promulgate a model Medical Support Order form that \nStates must use to collect medical support for children. It also \nrequires those Secretaries to appoint and to collaborate with a Working \nGroup to improve the process by which these medical support orders are \nimplemented.\n  I am happy that we were able to reach agreement on this important \nlanguage. I want to take this opportunity to thank Senators Kennedy and \nCoats, and their staff, for all their assistance. Also, I thank \nChairman Bill Goodling of the House Workforce Committee, Chairman Bill \nRoth of the Senate Finance and Senator Jay Rockefeller, for their help \nand guidance in reaching an agreement. In particular, Mr. Bill \nSweetnam, Senior Counsel to the Finance Committee and Ms. Mary Bissell \nof Senator Rockefeller's staff provided the technical expertise, \nknowledge of State programs and support we needed to finish the job.\n  I look forward to the Labor and Human Resources Committee exercising \nits oversight authority to see that this legislation is properly \nimplemented and that we work toward improving collection of medical \nchild support for every child to which such support is legitimately \nowed.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3130, \nthe Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998. This \nlegislation contains two important components to improve child support \ncollections: a better system of making incentive payments to states for \ntheir performance in collecting child support and a new penalty system \nto help ensure that state child support systems meet basic data \nprocessing standards. While both of these components are rather \ntechnical, they do represent concrete steps forward and should result \nin thousands of children--many of them poor--receiving critical \nfinancial assistance from absent parents, something all too many poor \nchildren do not receive today.\n  In addition, the bill contains provisions to improve enforcement of \nthe medical aspects of child support and to help ensure data privacy. \nThese latter provisions we owe to the hard work of my colleagues \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Baucus, and I thank them for these \nimprovements to the legislation.\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge H.R. 3130 be passed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to commend the efforts of the \nconferees of the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 \nfor the hard work they have done to secure passage of child support \nreform legislation. The legislation that has passed the House and \nSenate represents a significant victory for children who are getting \nthe support they need from both parents. I am pleased that the \nconferees accepted a provision offered by Senator Grassley and I to \nfurther enhance the states' efforts along with banks to streamline the \nmatching process that is required to gather financial information to \nsupport our children.\n  The changes we have proposed through this provision will allow the \nFederal Parent Locator Service to aid our State agencies in their \ncollection efforts. Financial institutions doing business in two or \nmore States would be able to use the Federal Parent Locator Service to \nassist them in matching data for child support enforcement purposes. \nThe language included in this provision will provide a structure for a \ncentralized and coordinated matching process, thereby streamlining data \nmatches for the financial institutions and state child support \nenforcement programs. We believe that such measures will prevent the \nduplication of efforts by states and banks and assist us in the \nultimate aim of getting more money to more children more quickly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur to the amendments of the House to the amendments of the Senate \nto the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COPPS'S TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE \n                         FOR TRADE DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I urge this body to confirm Michael J. \nCopps to be the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Development. \nMike Copps has been enormously effective as the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Commerce for Basic Industries; the sooner the Senate \napproves his nomination, the sooner he can go to work to further our \nnation's economic interests and develop new trade opportunities for \nAmerican industry.\n  It has been my privilege to know Mike Copps for over 25 years. He \nserved on my staff for 15 years and was my administrative assistant for \nover a decade. In that time, I came to know and respect Mike; and today \nthere is no one whose judgment I value more highly or in whose \nabilities I place greater confidence. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I can \nthink of no one better suited to serve as the Assistant Secretary of \nCommerce for Trade Development than Michael Copps.\n  Mike is a man of measured judgment and extraordinary maturity, and he \npossesses a keen, analytical mind. I can state from personal experience \nthat he is the consummate chief of staff--cool and collected, Mike \nCopps leads by example. In moments of crisis, he was calm. In times of \nindecision, he was resolute. And he always demonstrated high-minded \nprinciple and professionalism.\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\n  I have been an elected servant of the people over the span of six \ndecades, Mr. Chairman; and in this time, I have seen many people forget \nthe purpose of public service. But Mike Copps never has forsaken his \ndedication to the public good. His moral compass has never wavered. I \ncan pay no greater tribute to Mike Copps than to say he is a public \nservant without equal. Truly, this is the greatest accolade one can \ngarner.\n  Perhaps one way to underscore Mike Copps' unique temperament and keen \nintellect is to explain the origins of my relationship with him. Mike \ncame to my staff in 1970, to help with writing and other tasks. From \nthis humble beginning, he rose in less than five years to be my \nadministrative assistant. Now, I pride myself on my staff, and for \nsomeone to rise from a newly hired assistant to chief of staff in the \nSenate in just five years is highly unusual. But Mike Copps has made a \ncareer out of making the unusual seem routine.\n  Just look at what he has accomplished since taking over as the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of Commerce for Basic Industries in 1993. His \ntenure has been one of the busiest and most purposeful in that office's \nhistory. DAS Copps has conceived, organized, and successfully achieved \npublic sector-private sector partnerships in the belief that we can \nsucceed in the world of global commerce only through close cooperation \nbetween industry and government. This has been the guiding light of his \ntenure at Commerce: fostering public sector-private sector cooperation \nto strengthen U.S. industry and benefit U.S. consumers.\n  For example, under Mike Copps' leadership, the Commerce Department's \nBasic Industries division has administered seven highly innovative \nMarket Development Cooperator Program Awards. This competitive matching \ngrants program provides two private sector dollars for every federal \ndollar and builds public-private partnerships by providing assistance \nto non-profit export multipliers.\n  DAS Copps chairs the U.S.-Russia Business Development Committee's Oil \nand Gas Working Group. The BDC is the principal venue for bilateral \ndiscussions on trade between America and Russia. Chairman Copps played \nan important role in pushing successfully for the removal of the export \ntax for U.S. companies shipping oil out of Russia and in reducing \nRussian oil excise taxes.\n  In China, Copps negotiated the terms of reference for working groups \nin the electrical power, chemical, and automotive industries; developed \npolicy and trade promotion programs for each; and started a broad range \nof working group activities involving both the private and public \nsectors.\n  Copps also helped create similar partnerships involving forest \nproducts and agribusiness in Russia, energy and agribusiness in the \nUkraine, and electrical power in Turkey.\n  To see how effectively Deputy Assistant Secretary Copps has promoted \nU.S. industries, just look at what he has done for the automotive \nindustry. Under his leadership, the Commerce Department's Office of \nAutomotive Affairs has become the lead agency of the U.S. Government in \nproviding both the expertise for our nation's global automotive \nnegotiations and its trade promotion initiatives. During the past two \nyears, for example, the Office has convened meetings to successfully \nresolve 23 outstanding Japanese vehicle standards issues.\n  The Office of Automotive Affairs also contributed its expertise and \nparticipation to ongoing U.S.-Korean automotive negotiations, an ASEAN \nautomotive trade initiative, and to U.S.-Brazil automotive talks. All \nthese initiatives have helped reinvigorate the U.S. auto industry and \nhave helped it achieve a level playing field and a competitive edge \noverseas.\n  Mike Copps has been able to compile this impressive record of \nachievement because he combines a tremendous work ethic, wonderful \ndiplomatic skills, and a rigorous and analytical mind. In addition, he \npossesses a historical perspective unmatched by anyone I have met in \ngovernment. Before joining my staff in 1970, he had earned his Ph.D. in \nhistory and taught courses at Loyola University for three years. His \nappreciation for the forces of history and the perspective his studies \ngave him make Mike Copps especially suited for this job, which requires \nan understanding not only of economic forces and trade negotiation, but \nalso of America's role in the world and the cultures of our trading \npartners.\n  Mike Copps possesses all the qualities we admire in our public \nservants. Professional and grave in matters of the public trust, he is \nalso witty and diplomatic. He values good policies over politics, but \nhe understands the importance of both in the arena of international \ntrade. After working in the Senate, private industry, and the \nDepartment of Commerce, he appreciates the concerns and needs of both \nsectors and knows the compromises necessary to create successful \npublic-private partnerships.\n  Finally, I would note that Mike Copps' dedication begins at home. He \nis a devoted family man, and I know his wife Beth and his five children \nare justifiably proud of his service and achievements. Unlike some in \nWashington, Mike has never forgotten the values and ideals that count \nthe most. I believe his moral compass points him in the right direction \nso infallibly because it is grounded in the family he treasures above \nall else.\n  Mr. President, I urge speedy confirmation of Michael J. Copps to be \nAssistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Development. We cannot afford \nto delay action on such an effective and dedicated public servant.\n\n\n   nomination of john o'leary to be united states ambassador to chile\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of John O'Leary to be the next United States \nAmbassador to Chile, and my appreciation to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for their prompt and favorable review. I urge the Senate to \ndo likewise.\n  I know that Mr. O'Leary will be a credit to his fellow Mainers and \nthe citizens of the United States. On June 13th, I was proud to join \nwith my colleagues in the Maine delegation--Senator Collins, \nRepresentative Allen, and Representative Baldacci--to introduce this \noutstanding candidate to the Foreign Relations Committee. Mainers have \nhad a long and proud tradition of service to this nation and John \nO'Leary is the latest individual to carry on this tradition. We in \nMaine are proud of him and know he will make the nation proud as well.\n  Mr. O'Leary brings a wealth of talents to the table, and a review of \nhis background reveals a man well-qualified for the demands and \nresponsibilities of the post for which he has been nominated.\n  Since his graduation from Yale Law School in 1974, John O'Leary has \nbuilt an impressive career in law distinguished by a strong intellect \nand a commitment to the highest ethical standards. He is a leader in \nthe American legal field, having recently served as the Chair of the \nAmerican Bar Association's eleven-person Standing Committee on \nEnvironmental Law. He has also been entrusted with one of eight seats \non the First Circuit Advisory Committee on Rules.\n  Mr. O'Leary's outstanding leadership and organizational skills are \nalso evidenced by his management of complex litigation. In fact, his \nefforts led one major national retailer to choose Mr. O'Leary's firm, \nPierce Atwood, for its annual award for quality and value--the first \ntime a law firm had ever been chosen from among the retailer's global \nvendors for such an honor. His analytical mind coupled with a studious \nattention to detail would be of tremendous benefit to the United \nStates' interests in Chile.\n  Mr. O'Leary is also no stranger to public and community service. His \ncommitment to civic affairs in Maine are evidenced by his election to \nthe City Council of Maine's largest city, Portland, and his service as \nMayor. He has also contributed of his time and talents as a trustee and \npresident of the Portland Public Library.\n  Finally, John O'Leary's extensive background and interest in Latin \nAmerican affairs would be invaluable to U.S.-Chile relations. His \nimpressive resume includes participation on an arbitration panel for \nthe Inter-American Commercial Arbitration Commission, working on a \nmatter involving Venezuela; and service on a three member United States \nteam that assisted Bolivia in sustainable development matters. From \n1991 to 1997, Mr. O'Leary also served as President of the Natural \nResources and Environmental Protection Committee of the Inter-American\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nBar Association (IABA), which was charged with overall responsibility \nfor the IABA committee's activities in Chile and throughout the \nAmericas.\n  And finally, in March of 1997, he both chaired and organized a major \nconference in Argentina on ``Development, the Environment and Dispute \nResolution in the Americas''--which incidentally was the first such \nAmerican Bar Association program ever run in South America.\n  Mr. President, we in the Senate have the solemn responsibility of \nensuring that those Americans we send abroad to represent our nation \nand her interests are individuals of the highest character and most \noutstanding qualifications. Today, we have before us a nominee who \nfulfills those criteria most ably. I met with Mr. O'Leary prior to his \nconfirmation hearing and that meeting only confirmed what I have \nalready stated--that I believe him to be an outstanding choice for \nAmbassador. He is a man of intellect and integrity, who knows how to \nwork with people and knows how to get things done.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to act to \nconfirm John O'Leary as our next Ambassador to Chile. It is a decision \nI believe all of my colleagues will be proud that we made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7323-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7325-S7333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 2052 and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration. This is the intelligence authorization \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2052) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1999 for intelligence and intelligence related \n     activities for the U.S. government and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 2052, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, to authorize \nappropriations for intelligence-related activities and programs of the \nUnited States Government. This important legislation was reported \nfavorably out of the Committee on May 7, 1998, by unanimous vote, \nconsistent with the long-standing, bipartisan nature of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Following receipt of the President's budget, the Select Committee \nundertook a thorough review of the budget request for intelligence for \nfiscal year 1999. That review was informed, in part, by several \nhearings and briefings as well as the findings and recommendations of a \ngroup of outside experts--known as the Technical Advisory Group--that \nthe distinguished Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kerrey, and I \ntasked last December to address key questions facing the Community.\n  In addition, the Committee staff recently completed indepth audits \nand reviews of the use of ``cover'' by the Central Intelligence Agency \nand the administration of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978. These reviews and audits led to Committee action with respect to \nthe authorities, applicable laws, and budget of the activity or program \nconcerned.\n  As a product of these reviews, the Committee came to some rather \nstartling and disconcerting conclusions about the overall health and \ndirection of the Intelligence Community. For example:\n  First, the CIA's foremost mission of providing timely intelligence \nbased on human sources (``HUMINT'') is in grave jeopardy. CIA case \nofficers today do not have the training or the equipment needed to keep \ntheir true identities hidden, to communicate covertly with agents, or \nto plant sophisticated listening devices and other collection tools \nthat will provide timely intelligence on an adversary's intentions.\n  Second, what many see as the ``crown jewel'' of U.S. Intelligence--\nthe National Security Agent's SIGINT capability--likewise is in dire \nneed of modernization. The digital and fiber-optic revolutions are \nhere-and-now, but NSA is still predominantly oriented toward Cold War-\nera threats. The Director of NSA, Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan, \nhas recommended major changes in how NSA performs its vital mission--\nchanges our Committee endorses--but these changes were not reflected in \nthe President's budget request.\n  Third, promising technologies and systems for detecting missiles and \nother threats have been short-changed in the budget request. Likewise, \nrobust funding for new tools for conducting information warfare, new \nsensors to detect and counter proliferation, and moving to smaller and \ncheaper satellites to support the war-fighter are not included in the \nbudget request.\n  And fourth, the quality of analysis within the Intelligence Community \nis poor and getting worse. Responding to the failure to predict the \nIndian nuclear tests, the Director of Central Intelligence commissioned \nretired Admiral David Jeremiah to review what went wrong and why. Among \nother findings, Admiral Jeremiah concluded that intelligence community \nanalysts were complacent; they based their analyses on faulty \nassumptions; and engaged in wishful thinking. It is my belief that such \nis the state of analysis as it relates to many issues and problems, \nincluding political-military developments in China, the ballistic \nmissile threat, and more. We can and should expect more from the \nIntelligence Community.\n  The Intelligence Community has been forced by budgetary pressures to \nchoose between funding current operations (such as Bosnia) and \ninvesting in the future. This is the case even after personnel \nreductions of over 20 percent in the Intelligence Community have been \nmade over the past decade. In many ways, then, the problem confronting \nU.S. Intelligence is similar to that confronting the Department of \nDefense: How to pay for the necessary investments in future, ``winning-\nedge'' capabilities when the policymakers emphasize current operations? \nAnd, equally important, how to sustain the quality of life and skills-\nlevel of personnel who are already stretched thin by high operations \ntempo and lengthy overseas deployments?\n  To address these challenges, Senator Kerrey and I tasked the staff to \nfind and cut any and all poorly justified or redundant programs out of \nthe budget. And, in fact, significant cuts were made to a wide range of \nlower-priority intelligence programs and activities. If it was poorly \njustified, redundant, or low-priority, then we cut it. These actions \nare entirely consistent with our oversight responsibilities, and the \nAmerican people would expect no less.\n\n  The Select Committee then took those funds and applied them against \nthe highest priority intelligence needs and targets. Earlier this year, \nSenator Kerrey and I prepared intelligence budget guidance to direct \nthe staff's budget work. That guidance emphasized the need for \nstrengthened investment in areas such as advanced research and \ndevelopment, counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, counter-\nnarcotics, personnel training, information operations, effective covert \naction, and enhanced analysis. These are precisely the areas the \nCommittee has historically supported and the keys to future \nintelligence successes--whether to support military commanders, \npolicymakers in Washington, or American diplomats.\n  This approach of cutting low-priority projects and redirecting those \nfunds into high-payoff, futuristic technologies and systems, is \nfiscally responsible and reflects the need for difficult choices in an \nera of scarce resources.\n  This budget is full of tough choices. For example, the Committee \nrecommended cutting certain ``legacy'' programs and activities at NSA \nin order to pay for the collection systems and processes of the future, \nas recommended in General Minihan's study of the future SIGINT \narchitecture needs (the ``Unified Cryptologic Architecture''). \nLikewise, the Committee recommended cutting the number of CIA \ncontractors, and reduced spending on costly infrastructure programs.\n  None of these actions were easy--and in fact I am concerned that the \nSelect Committee may have cut the intelligence budget too deeply in \norder to reach agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee. That \nbeing said, this legislation is sound, it is balanced, and it is worthy \nof strong bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\n  My colleagues and the American people must come to understand that to \nsave lives on the battlefield, to preclude terrorist attacks against \nAmericans, to root out spies in our midst, and to give diplomats the \ninformation they need to forestall conflict in the first place, we need \nan effective, revitalized Intelligence Community. And that it is \nprecisely what the Intelligence Authorization Act seeks to do.\n  In summary, the Select Committee made the tough choices. We cut \nprograms in order to invest in the future. We concluded that the \nintelligence budget can be cut, but it must be done in a careful, \nprecise way, and based on specific programmatic recommendations. And we \ndid it in a fully bipartisan manner.\n  I applaud and appreciate the efforts of the Vice Chairman of the \nCommittee, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, and all the Members of the \nCommittee, who labored long and hard on this bill. It is one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation this body will consider this year, \nand I urge its passage.\n  Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement, the Armed Services \nCommittee has been discharged from consideration of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Bill. Although the Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee and I had previously agreed that the Armed Services Committee \nwould not report the Intelligence Authorization Bill until three days \nfollowing completion of Senate Floor consideration of the Defense \nAuthorization Bill, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee has \ninformed me that his committee has completed its review of the \nIntelligence Authorization Bill and does not recommend any amendments. \nWe agree that it is appropriate for the Senate to consider the \nintelligence Authorization Bill at this time. We also agree, however, \nthat this unanimous consent agreement to discharge the Armed Services \nCommittee from further review of the Intelligence Authorization Bill \nwill not serve as a precedent for requiring the Armed Services \nCommittee to report future Intelligence Authorization Bills until it \nhas had an adequate amount of time to review such legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the cost \nestimate for the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2052, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Dawn \n     Sauter, who can be reached at 226-2840.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n   S. 2052: Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, as \n Reported by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on May 7, 1998\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       S. 2052 would authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1999 \n     for intelligence activities of the United States government, \n     the Community Management Account, and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System \n     (CIARDS).\n       This estimate addresses only the unclassified portion of \n     the bill. On that limited basis, CBO estimates that enacting \n     S. 2052 would result in additional spending of $174 million \n     over the 1999-2003 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     authorized amounts. The unclassified portion of the bill \n     would affect direct spending; thus, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would apply. However, CBO cannot give a precise estimate of \n     the direct spending effects because data to support a cost \n     estimate are classified.\n       The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) excludes \n     from application of the act legislative provisions that are \n     necessary for the national security. CBO has determined that \n     all of the provisions of this bill either fit within that \n     exclusion or do not contain intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined by UMRA.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of the unclassified portions \n     of S. 2052 is shown in the following table. CBO is unable to \n     obtain the necessary information to estimate the costs for \n     the entire bill because parts are classified at a level above \n     clearances held by CBO employees.

In addition, the bill would \n     authorize $202 million for CIARDS to cover retirement costs \n     attributable to military service and various unfunded \n     liabilities. The payment to CIARDS is considered mandatory, \n     and the authorization under this bill would be the same as \n     assumed in the CBO baseline.\n       Section 401 of the bill would extend the CIA's authority to \n     offer incentive payments to employees who voluntarily retire \n     or resign. This authority, which is currently scheduled to \n     expire at the end of fiscal year 1999, would be extended \n     through fiscal year 2001. Section 401 would also require the \n     CIA to make a deposit to the Civil Service Trust Fund equal \n     to 15 percent of final pay for each employee who accepts an \n     incentive payment. CBO estimates that these payments would \n     amount to less than $5 million. We believe that these \n     deposits would be sufficient to cover the cost of any long-\n     term increase in benefits that would result from induced \n     retirements, although the timing of the agency payments and \n     the additional benefit payments would not match on a yearly \n     basis. CBO cannot provide a precise estimate of the direct \n     spending effects because the data necessary for an estimate \n     are classified.\n       Section 501 of the bill would require the President to \n     inform certain federal employees and contract employees that \n     they may disclose classified and unclassified information to \n     Congressional oversight committees if they believe that \n     information provides direct and specific evidence of \n     wrongdoing. CBO estimates that the costs of implementing \n     section 501 would not be significant because the number of \n     employees covered by the bill would be small and the cost \n     associated with each notice would be minimal.\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that S. 2052 \n     will be enacted by October 1, 1998, and that the full amounts \n     authorized will be appropriated for fiscal year 1999. Outlays \n     are estimated according to historical spending patterns for \n     intelligence programs.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       Section 401 of the bill would affect direct spending, and \n     therefore the bill would be subject to pay-as-you-go \n     procedures. CBO cannot estimate the precise direct spending \n     effects because the necessary data are classified.\n\n\n              intergovernmental and private sector impact\n\n       The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) excludes \n     from application of the act legislative provisions that are \n     necessary for the national security. CBO has determined that \n     all of the provisions of this bill either fit within that \n     exclusion or do not contain intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined by UMRA.\n\n\n                         previous cbo estimate\n\n       On May 5, 1998, CBO issued an estimate for H.R. 3694, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, as \n     ordered reported by the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence. CBO estimated that section 401 of that bill \n     would increase direct spending by\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\n     $1 million or more in at least one year during the 2000-2003 \n     period. Like section 401 in S. 2052, the provisions in H.R. \n     3694 would extend the CIA's authority to offer incentive \n     payments to employees who voluntarily retire or resign. \n     However, H.R. 3694 would not require the CIA to make a \n     deposit equal to 15 percent of final pay to the Civil Service \n     Trust Fund for each employee who receives an incentive \n     payment. The bills also authorize different amounts of \n     appropriations for the Community Management Account.\n       CBO prepared a cost estimate on February 25, 1998, for S. \n     1668, as reported by the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence on February 23, 1998. Section 501 of S. 2052 \n     duplicates the provisions of S. 1668, a bill to encourage the \n     disclosure to Congress of certain classified and related \n     information. CBO's estimates for these provisions are \n     identical.\n     Estimate prepared by\n       Federal Costs: Estimate for Voluntary Separation Pay: Eric \n     Rollins (226-2820), and Estimate for Remaining Provisions: \n     Dawn Sauter (226-2840).\n       Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Teri Gullo \n     (225-3220).\n       Impact on the Private Sector: Bill Thomas (226-2900).\n       Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe Intelligence Authorization Bill. This bill is the product of the \nIntelligence Committee's efforts to match national intelligence \nresources and activities with today's and tomorrow's threats. Under \nChairman Shelby's leadership, the Committee has tried to move the \nIntelligence Community toward new technologies which address emerging \nthreats like weapons proliferation, terrorism, and information \noperations, while at the same time keeping intelligence strong against \nthe mature threats, such as Russian nuclear forces, which still can \nkill scores of millions of Americans.\n  Most of this bill is secret, contained in a classified annex \navailable to all Members for review in S-407. However, it has been \nreported that the bill authorizes less money for intelligence programs \nthan the President requested. I am not pleased with this outcome. But \nas the national security budgets are currently organized, the \nIntelligence Authorization bill must respond to larger Defense \nrequirements. The dependent relationship of intelligence to defense is \nanachronistic, in my view, but it exists and Chairman Shelby and I have \nworked with our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to make the \nbest of a bad budgetary situation for both Committees. Let me add, I am \nequally concerned that the Defense budget is skirting the level of \ninadequacy, especially with regard to our conventional forces. National \nsecurity is the principal function of government, and we should fund it \nbetter.\n  The Intelligence Committee looked at the way intelligence is \ncollected--through imagery, signals, human, and measurements and \nsignatures--and saw mature technologies which have served America well \nfor many years pitted against revolutionary change in the collection \nenvironments. The Committee studied solutions to this imbalance. In \naddition to its own evaluation, the Committee gathered a group of \noutside scientific experts, including some who have had no previous \nconnection to intelligence, to recommend solutions to our shortfalls in \nsignals and human intelligence. This panel's recommendations are also \nreflected in this bill. So Chairman Shelby and I have a strong basis in \nevidence for the new technologies and initiatives which would be \nauthorized by this bill.\n  The recent nuclear tests in India brought accusations of \n``intelligence failure'' in our media. In fact, I think the episode \nmight be more accurately called a policy failure, but intelligence \ncould certainly have done a better job. Director of Central \nIntelligence Tenet quickly tasked Admiral David Jeremiah to review the \nIntelligence Community's performance, and a summary of his \nrecommendations have been declassified at the Committee's request.\n  The India nuclear case offers many lessons, but two are especially \nimportant to intelligence. The first is that the Director of Central \nIntelligence needs to run the national Intelligence Community to ensure \nagency efforts are focused and priorities across the individual \nagencies are clear. I am holding off on legislation to increase the \nDCI's management powers because new officials are in place in positions \nalready created by Congress to help manage the Community better. I want \nto see what progress Deputy Director Joan Dempsey and her new Assistant \nDirectors make in harnessing the DCI's existing powers, before Congress \ncreates new ones. Congress and the American people hold the DCI \naccountable for these problems. We need the DCI to be in charge.\n  The second India lesson is the tendency to ``mirror image'', to \nassume Indians, in this case, would behave as we do. This tendency \nincreases when there is unanimity among analysts and no one is asking \ncontrarian questions. To insure such questions are always asked during \nthe analysis of significant intelligence, Chairman Shelby and I are \noffering an amendment today which, among other things, will require \ncompetitive analysis as an integral, routine part of the analytic \nprocess. The fundamental purpose of intelligence is to keep our \npolicymakers and military commanders from being surprised. Competitive \nanalysis should at least reduce the chance of surprise.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I understand Chairman Shelby will introduce \nan amendment to name the CIA headquarters building after the only U.S. \nPresident who has also served as DCI, former President George Bush. \nWhile I am not enthusiastic about the current fad of naming things \nafter living politicians, I make an exception in this case. In \npolitical terms, service as DCI carries considerable risk. Your \napparent failures are big news, while your successes are secret and the \nfruits of your leadership are harvested by your successor. But in peace \nor war, George Bush never calculated risks when there was an \nopportunity to serve his country, and I think he particularly relished \nthe hardest tasks. Naming his old headquarters in his honor is a \nfitting tribute which I am proud to support.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, \nand I yield the floor.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3051 through 3053, en bloc\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I strongly support an initiative to \nestablish a Quadrennial Intelligence Review and an independent, \nnonpartisan National Intelligence Panel. This process can be modeled \nafter the Military Force Structure Review Act of 1986 which passed the \nSenate by a unanimous vote of 100-0. This Act directed the Quadrennial \nDefense Review (QDR) and the National Defense Panel (NDP) which \nconducted comprehensive reviews of all aspects of defense. These \nreviews have produced a much needed update of our defense strategy, a \nrevised defense program, and a vibrant debate on the course of our \ndefense capabilities.\n  I believe that a process of internal and external comprehensive \nreview fashioned on this QDR and NDP model can be equally effective in \nthe area of intelligence. I intend to work with the Committee to \ndevelop a provision establishing a Quadrennial Intelligence Review and \nan independent National Intelligence Panel for inclusion in the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3050\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the designation of the Headquarters Building \n of the Central Intelligence Agency as the George Herbert Walker Bush \n                    Center for Central Intelligence)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Shelby has an additional amendment \nat the desk and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Shelby, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3050.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DESIGNATION OF HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF CENTRAL \n                   INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AS THE GEORGE HERBERT \n                   WALKER BUSH CENTER FOR CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The Headquarters Building of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency located in Langley, Virginia, shall be \n     known and designated as the ``George Herbert Walker Bush \n     Center for Central Intelligence''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     Headquarters Building referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     deemed to be a reference to the George Herbert Walker Bush \n     Center for Central Intelligence.\n\n\n     ``george herbert walker bush center for central intelligence''\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this Amendment will add a section to the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 that will designate \nthe headquarters building of the Central Intelligence Agency as the \n``George Herbert Walker Bush Center for Central Intelligence.''\n  I believe that this is a fitting tribute to a man that has had a \nremarkable and distinguished career in public service not only as \nPresident, but also as Vice President, Member of Congress, U.N. \nAmbassador, the Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to the Peoples' \nRepublic of China, and Director of Central Intelligence.\n  President Bush, of course, is the only Director of Central \nIntelligence to become President of the United States.\n  I know that he has always been particularly proud of his tenure as \nthe Director of Central Intelligence. I also know that he guided the \nAgency through a difficult time and continues to be held in high regard \nby not only CIA employees, but also the Intelligence Community at \nlarge.\n  Currently, the headquarters building at Langley does not have a \nformal name and this would be the only facility in the Washington, D.C. \narea named after President Bush. This amendment has been cleared on \nboth sides and I urge its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to and, further, a classified change be incorporated in the \nclassified schedule of authorizations which has been available for all \nMembers' review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3050) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read \nthe third time and the Intelligence Committee then be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 3694.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration, all after the enacting clause be stricken, and \nthe text of S. 2052, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof. I ask \nconsent that the bill be read the third time, and passed, the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the statements related to the bill appear in the Record and S. \n2052 be placed on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3694), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed, as follows:\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 3694) entitled ``An Act to authorize appropriations for \n     fiscal year 1999 for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities of the United States Government, the Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.'', \n     do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, from its origins as a U.S.-based research \nvehicle, the Internet has matured into a democratic, international \nmedium for communication, commerce and education. As the Internet \nevolves, the traditional means of organizing its technical functions \nsuch as the Domain Name System (DNS) need to evolve as well.\n  It is for this reason, in part, that I viewed S.1609, legislation to \nauthorize the Next Generation Internet (NGI) program, as the \nappropriate vehicle for my domain name amendment. This amendment is \nbased on S.1727, legislation I introduced on March 6 to authorize the \nNational Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to \nconduct a comprehensive study of the effects on trademark and \nintellectual property rights holders of adding new generic top level \ndomain names (gTLDs), and related dispute resolution procedures.\n  At the outset, I would like to thank Senator Ashcroft, who is a \ncosponsor of this domain name amendment to S. 1609 as well as a \ncosponsor of my original domain name bill, S.1727. I would also like to \nthank Senators Rockefeller, Frist, Hollings and McCain who enabled this \ndomain name amendment to be considered along with S.1609.\n  On today's Internet, the domain name system (DNS) works through a \nhierarchy of names. At the top of this hierarchy are a set of Top Level \nDomains that can be classified into two categories: generic Top Level \nDomains (gTLD), such as ``.gov,'' ``.net,'' ``.com,'' ``.edu,'' \n``.org,'' ``.int,'' and ``.mil,'' and the country code Top Level Domain \nnames, such as ``.us'' and ``.uk''. Before each TLD suffix, is a Second \nLevel Domain name.\n  Since the Internet is an outgrowth of U.S. government investments \ncarried out under agreements with U.S. agencies, major components of \nthe DNS are still performed by or subject to agreements with U.S. \nagencies. Examples include assignments of numerical addresses to \nInternet users, management of the system of registering names for \nInternet users, operation of the root server system, and protocol \nassignment.\n  For the past five years, a company based in Herndon, Virginia, named \nNetwork Solutions, Inc., has served under a cooperative agreement with \nthe National Science Foundation as the exclusive registry of all second \nlevel domain names in several of the gTLDs (e.g., .com, .net, .org, and \n.edu). This contract ended in March 1998, but the Federal Government \nhas exercised an optional ramp-down period that is scheduled to expire \nin September 1998. With this date quickly approaching, many of us have \nbeen concerned about what would happen at the end of that company's \nexclusive contract. Simply put, how will we avoid chaos on the Internet \nand the potential risk of multiple registrations of the same domain \nname for different computers?\n  On January 30, 1998, the Commerce Department released a ``Green \nPaper'', or discussion draft, entitled A Proposal to Improve Technical \nManagement of Internet Names and Addresses, proposing privatization of \nthe management of the DNS through the creation of a new, not-for-profit \ncorporation. The Green Paper suggested that during the period of \ntransition to this new, not-for-profit corporation, the U.S. \nGovernment, in cooperation with IANA, would undertake a process to add \nup to five new gTLDs to the DNS.\n  Although adding new gTLDs, as the Green Paper proposed, would allow \nmore competition and more individuals and businesses to obtain \naddresses that more closely reflect their names and functions, I was \nconcerned as were many businesses, that the increase in gTLDs would \nmake the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or \ndilution more difficult. In addition, increasing the number of gTLDs \nwithout an efficient dispute resolution mechanism had the potential of \nfueling litigation and the threat of litigation, with an overall \nchilling effect on the choice and use of domain names.\n  The Green Paper properly raised the important questions of how to \nprotect consumers' interests in locating the brand or vendor of their \nchoice on the Internet without being deceived or confused, how to \nprotect companies from having their brand equity diluted in an \nelectronic environment, and how to resolve disputes efficiently and \ninexpensively. It did not, however, answer these complex and important \nquestions. Dictating the introduction of new gTLDs without analyzing \nthe impact that these new gTLDs would have on trademark and \nintellectual property rights holders and related dispute resolution \nprocedures seemed like putting the cart before the horse.\n  The bill that I introduced, S. 1727, was intended to get the horse \nback in front of the cart. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to \nrequest the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of \nSciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects on trademark \nand intellectual property rights holders of adding new gTLDs and \nrelated dispute resolution procedures. The study shall assess and, as \nappropriate, make recommendations for policy, practice, or legislative \nchanges regarding:\n  (1) the short-term and long-term effects on the protection of \ntrademark and intellectual property rights and consumer interests of \nincreasing or decreasing the number of gTLDs;\n  (2) trademark and intellectual property rights clearance processes \nfor domain names, including whether domain name databases should be \nreadily searchable through a common interface to facilitate the \n``clearing'' of trademarks and intellectual property rights and \nproposed domain names across a range of gTLDs; identifying what \ninformation from domain name databases should be accessible for the \n``clearing'' of trademarks and intellectual property rights; and \nwhether gTLDs registrants should be required to provide certain \ninformation;\n  (3) domain name trademark and intellectual property rights dispute \nresolution mechanisms, including how to reduce trademark and \nintellectual property rights conflicts associated with the addition of \nany new gTLDs and how to reduce trademark and intellectual property \nrights conflicts through new technical approaches to Internet \naddressing;\n\n  (4) choice of law or jurisdiction for resolution of trademark and \nintellectual property rights disputes relating to domain names, \nincluding which jurisdictions should be available for trademark and \nintellectual property rights owners to file suit to protect their \ntrademarks and intellectual property rights;\n  (5) trademark and intellectual property rights infringement liability \nfor\n\n[[Page S7336]]\n\nregistrars, registries, or technical management bodies; and\n  (6) short-term and long-term technical and policy options for \nInternet addressing schemes and their impact on current trademark and \nintellectual property issues.\n  We should understand the effects on trademark and intellectual \nproperty rights holders of adding new gTLDs and related dispute \nresolution procedures before we move to quickly to add significant \nnumbers of new gTLDs. Since its introduction in March, groups such as \nATT, Bell Atlantic, Time Warner, the International Trademark \nAssociation, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, \nhave endorsed this legislation reflected in the Leahy-Ashcroft \namendment.\n  The Administration's White Paper, released on June 5, acknowledges \nthe concerns to be addressed in the study called for in this \nlegislation. The White Paper backed off the Green Paper's earlier \nsuggestion to add five new gTLDs. Instead, the White Paper proposes \nthat the new corporation would be the most appropriate body to make \ndecisions as to how many, if any, new gTLDs should be added once it has \nglobal input, including from the study called for in the Leahy-Ashcroft \ndomain name amendment. Specifically, the White Paper calls upon the \nWorld Intellectual Property Organization, inter alia, to ``evaluate the \neffects, based on studies conducted by independent organizations, such \nas the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, \nof adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures on \ntrademark and intellectual property holders.''\n  I commend the Administration for the deliberate approach it has taken \nto facilitate the withdrawal of the U.S. government from the governance \nof the Internet and to privatize the management of Internet names and \naddresses. We should have a Hippocratic Oath for the Internet--that \nbefore we adopt any new regimen that affects the Internet, we should \nmake sure we are doing no harm to this dynamic medium.\n  We, in Congress, have not always lived up to the standard of this \noath. Passage by an overwhelming vote of the unconstitutional \nCommunications Decency Act to regulate constitutionally-protected \nonline speech on the Internet is an example of wrong-headed legislation \nthat Congress still has not lived down. Internet users generally remain \nskeptical about the heavy-headed regulatory actions Congress may take \nbased on bumper-sticker politics.\n  The experience of the Communications Decency Act demonstrates that we \nshould exercise caution in passing new laws for the Internet. This is a \nglobal phenomenon and its freedom from regulation has been primarily \nresponsible for its explosive growth. This principle is important as we \nsee increasingly intense disputes over whether or how to regulate this \nmedium. Encouraging free markets and private sector self-regulatory \napproaches is a particularly American approach.\n  The best way to ``export'' our core American values, to preserve the \nfree flow of commerce and individual expression and community self-\ngovernance on the Internet, is not to declare the Internet a U.S. \nterritory. Rather, we should be seeking to support the growth of the \nInternet's own self-ordering properties, and fostering mechanisms by \nwhich policy will be set by groups accountable to all Internet \nparticipants on a global basis. If we succeed in creating a \ndecentralized and truly global policy-making apparatus for the \nInternet, the core values we care most about will in fact propagate \nacross the world.\n  On a number of issues pertaining to the Internet, from privacy to \npornography to online gambling, governments are more and more faced \nwith the question of when to defer to effective private action, rather \nthan regulating in detail in the first instance. The Internet community \nis rapidly developing new technologies and practices that may well \nsolve many of these new ``public policy'' problems before we can even \nbegin effectively to debate them. For example, new labels for web sites \nwill let users know which sites have privacy policies or content they \ncan accept. New software standards will even allow the automated \nnegotiation of privacy or content preferences. Other technologies will \nallow end users to control what information their web browsers \nsurrender to the sites they visit. And many new types of filters and \nprivate sector practices are being deployed to bring the vice of \nunsolicited commercial E-mail (spam) under control.\n  I fully appreciate that we have some way to go before governments can \ndeclare the private sector self-governance mechanisms of the Internet \nadequate to solve the complex and multi-faceted problems of online \nprivacy or protecting children from inappropriate material. But \nprogress is being made every day, at a rapid pace, thanks to the \ningenuity of engineers and concerted actions of public interest \nadvocates and system operators.\n  We should be trying to persuade other countries to see the virtues of \nfree enterprise and community self-governance. We can demonstrate by \nmeans of the sheer success of electronic commerce, unconstrained by \nheavy-handed top down regulation, that those who allow the market to \nwork will be richly rewarded. We can develop new technological means \nand online trade practices to solve the new public policy problems of \nthe Internet--demonstrating in the process that it is best to let those \nwith the greatest stake in solving those problems and in building \nonline commerce and community to attempt to do so in the first \ninstance. We can show that diversity works best to fit individual needs \nto community rules--by allowing a diverse Internet to flourish and \nusing filters and education and navigational aids to help everyone make \nsure they only go where they want to go and only deal with those they \nare prepared to trust.\n  We can, in short, spread the American faith in liberty and the \npursuit of happiness by avoiding the futile, top-down lawmaking other \ncountries are so fond of--and by demonstrating that an unconstrained \nInternet will form its own new kind of order and become the best kind \nof online place for those who participate there. That kind of American \nleadership cannot be justly accused of being a new form of imperialism. \nWe'll make converts to our values one at a time, throughout the world, \nby showing the path to greater wealth, and the virtues of greater \nfreedom, by example. And we'll be better able to resist \ncounterproductive local regulation by other countries if we can show \nthat we are not attempting to impose rules of our own on others without \ntheir consent.\n  As we debate new bills that directly or indirectly regulate the \nInternet and impose U.S. laws on a global medium, we should remember \nour core values, and try to export those values--free speech, freedom \nto associate, freedom of the press--to the rest of the world via the \nInternet. But the most effective way to do so is by the leadership of \nour example. By inviting Internet stakeholders to work together and \nform a new, private, not-for-profit corporation to manage the domain \nname and addressing system so critical to the governance of the \nInternet, the Administration has set an excellent example, and I \ncommend them for it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3055) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT.

For the information of all Senators, when the Senate \nreconvenes on Monday, July 6, at 12 noon, there will be a period for \nmorning business until 1. Following morning business, it will be my \nintention for the Senate to begin consideration of the VA/HUD \nAppropriations bill. I had earlier indicated that we might go directly \nto the Department of Defense Appropriations bill, but one of the \nmanagers will be necessarily absent. So we will go to the VA/HUD \nappropriations bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor \nduring Monday's session to offer and debate amendments to the VA/HUD \nbill. We need to get a number of appropriations bills done in July, and \nif we could get this one done, working on Monday and Tuesday of that \nweek--certainly not more than Thursday--that would be helpful. There \nwill be no votes, though, during Monday's session.\n  Any votes ordered with respect to the VA/HUD Appropriations bill will \nbe postponed to occur on Tuesday, July 7, at a time to be determined by \nthe two leaders. A cloture motion was filed on the motion to proceed to \nthe products liability bill, with a vote to occur Tuesday morning at \n9:30 a.m. Also, on Tuesday evening, the Senate may vote on the IRS \nreform conference report. When I say Tuesday evening, I mean probably \nnight.\n  Finally, I remind all Members that July will be a very busy month. We \nwill have late night sessions during each week. We should expect to \nhave votes on most Mondays and Fridays. The cooperation of all Members \nwill be necessary for us to complete our work prior to the August \nrecess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7338-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, my colleague, the senior Senator from Utah \ncame to the Senate floor earlier today to continue his lonely and \nincreasingly unsuccessful battle against Microsoft. His statement comes \none day after the successful release of Microsoft's latest operating \nsystem software, Windows 98, and only three days after Microsoft won a \nmajor victory in a ruling by a three-judge panel of the Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  Senator Hatch said this morning that he is disappointed that \nMicrosoft ``has regrettably seen fit to deploy a massive PR campaign, \nas opposed to engaging the American public on the basis of the facts \nand the merits.''\n  I find Senator Hatch's comments interesting, given that the appeals \ncourt panel took a long hard look at the very facts that Senator Hatch \nand the Department of Justice claim Microsoft is hiding and ruled that \nMicrosoft's integration of Internet Explorer in Windows 95 is not a \nviolation of U.S. antitrust law or of the 1995 consent decree. The \nruling is significant because it covers the same issue that is the \ncentral focus of the Justice Department's current case against \nMicrosoft--whether Microsoft can innovate by integrating new products, \nnamely Internet Explorer, into Windows 98.\n  The Senator from Utah and the Department of Justice would have barred \nWindows 98 in its present form, frustrating millions of potential \ncustomers and imposing a major roadblock--the first major roadblock--in \nthe way of the continuing triumph of American technology in this most \ncutting edge of all of our industries.\n  So Senator Hatch, instead, announced that his Judiciary Committee \nwill examine those facts even further, in the hope, apparently, of \nfinding something that the appeals court missed, or, as he explains in \nhis statement, of finding a new issue with which to attack Microsoft.\n\n  The proper course of action would be precisely the opposite--the \nabandonment by both the Department of Justice and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee of an unsuccessful and wrongly directed crusade \nagainst the advancement of American technology.\n  I believe we are now relatively assured that the Department of \nJustice will not get the extra $7 million above the President's budget \nrequest that it asked for to pursue just this course. These actions are \na waste of the taxpayers' money and represent the use of the taxpayers' \nmoney for the pursuit of private antitrust remedies which, if they are \nappropriate at all, should be financed by the competitors who seek \nthem.\n  Regrettably, Mr. President, Senator Hatch and the Department of \nJustice are little interested in the facts or merits of the case but \npurely interested in bringing the most successful software company in \nthe Nation to its knees, so that less successful, less competitive \ncompanies, that do not have the ability to succeed on their own, can do \nso with the help of the Clinton administration's Justice Department \naided and abetted by the senior Senator from Utah.\n  Senator Hatch also discussed the release of a paper this week by the \nSoftware Publisher's Association attacking Microsoft's server business. \nInterestingly enough, this paper was released just 10 days after \nMicrosoft's biggest competitor in the server business, Sun \nMicrosystems, joined the Association.\n\n[[Page S7339]]\n\n  The SPA paper claims that Microsoft is attempting to leverage its \nmarket dominance in desktop computer operating systems to gain control \nof the market for network servers with Windows NT.\n  Mr. President, Windows NT has enjoyed great success because it offers \nthe price and performance Microsoft's customers demand. Microsoft \nWindows NT and the PC model have enabled a new generation of lower-\npriced computing for businesses worldwide. In fact, a recent study by \nthe Business Research Group found that corporate systems based on \nWindows NT Server cost 52 percent less than comparable systems from \nMicrosoft's biggest competitor.\n  It is not rocket science to determine that Microsoft's success is due \nto its ability to provide high performance software at low prices. That \nSenator Hatch and Microsoft's competitors represented by the Software \nPublishers Association want the American people to believe that \nMicrosoft should be punished for providing consumers want at prices \nconsumers like is to turn the public interest on its head.\n  Senator Hatch and the Justice Department are fighting a losing \nbattle, but in the process, are trampling on an American principle I \nand millions of Americans like me hold dear. That principle is that the \nfree market economy, where innovation and unhindered competition have \nmade this country the most successful economy in the world, should \ncontinue untrammeled by either Senator Hatch or the Clinton Justice \nDepartment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/26/senate-section/article/S7338-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 6, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
