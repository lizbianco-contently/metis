Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today \nthe Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 3 \np.m. Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill. We made great progress on \nappropriations bills last week and I hope that will continue. As a \nmatter of fact, we completed action on four bills and completed \neverything on the fifth appropriations bill except for a vote on an \namendment or amendments and final passage. So I ask all Members' \ncooperation in working with the chairmen of the remaining \nappropriations bills to enable us to finish each of these measures in a \ntimely manner. We are hoping that we can complete the bill that we \nbrought over last week, the Treasury, Postal Service, with votes this \nafternoon. As I said, we will begin the VA-HUD and will consider \nagriculture, military construction, and even State, Justice, Commerce \nthis week.\n  So I remind all Senators that at 5:15 today we will temporarily set \naside the VA-HUD appropriations bill and resume consideration for final \npassage and, I believe, one amendment we have pending on the Treasury, \nPostal Service appropriations bill. Senators can expect, at 5:15, a \nseries of rollcall votes on or in relation to those amendments on \nTreasury, Postal Service, and then final passage. Following those \nvotes, I encourage Members who have amendments to the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill to remain and offer their amendments this evening \nso we can make progress also on that measure.\n  There are 2 weeks remaining for business prior to the August recess \nperiod. There are a number of appropriations bills now available, and \nthe committee will be reporting additional bills tomorrow. It is my \nhope that the Senate will be able to finish action on many, if not all, \nof these. Obviously, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the \nSenator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and his ranking member, Senator \nByrd, are doing an excellent job in getting these bills through the \nsubcommittees of appropriations and through the full committee. So we \ncan perhaps also have conference reports available soon, in September, \non appropriations bills, and we will have, hopefully in short order, \nconference reports agreed to which accompany the Tax Fairness Act and \nthe balanced budget amendment, and they will be available later on this \nweek, or certainly early next week. Prior to the recess, we will \nconclude action on those conference reports.\n  Some have suggested that we may not be able to do that, but I think \nwe have made good progress. There has been a lot of work even over the \nweekend, Senators and Congressmen meeting on both sides of the aisle on \nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday and also with administration officials. I \nthink good progress has been made. Obviously, there are some very \nimportant decisions yet to be worked out. But I think we will be ready \nto be doing that today and tomorrow and maybe even Wednesday if it has \nto go over to that day.\n  I previously announced that S. 39, the tuna-dolphin bill, and the FDA \nreform bill could be considered this week, and probably at least one \nwill be brought up. On the tuna-dolphin bill, we will begin the process \non Wednesday to move toward a cloture vote on Friday, if some other \nagreement is not worked out. I believe the interested parties can work \nout a compromise that is acceptable to all sides. I know the \nadministration is very interested in getting this legislation \nconsidered. I have been called by the President to urge that we \nschedule this legislation and we come to an agreement. This is an \ninternational agreement with regard to tuna and dolphin that has been \nlaboriously worked out by 12 or 13 countries. We should not leave for \nthe August recess without acting on it. We intend to do that. Although \nI say to one and all, we cannot tie up the Senate for an extended \nperiod of time on either one of these issues, FDA reform or the tuna-\ndolphin bill.\n\n  Needless to say, the remaining sessions during the legislative period \nwill be busy, and Members should expect rollcall votes occurring \nthroughout each day and into the evening if necessary. Senators should \nbe cautious with their scheduling during the next 2-week period as we \nwill attempt to complete these items just mentioned.\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\nThey should expect votes, obviously, on this Monday and on this Friday. \nThere is even a possibility that we will have to go over in session to \nSaturday to resolve the State, Justice, Commerce appropriations bill \nand/or the tuna-dolphin bill. Then we will have votes the following \nMonday and we will have votes, if necessary, on Friday of next week, so \nthat we can complete action on these two very critical conference \nreports. But I feel very good about the prospects of doing that. There \nare those who are concerned right now, can we complete that work. I \nthink the way to do it is just redouble our efforts and develop the \nattitude that we are going to complete action. I know the President and \nhis administration wants us to get this done before we leave for the \nAugust district and State work periods.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7743-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, too many times in our world today we \nsettle for mediocrity, we settle for just enough to get by. But today, \nI rise to pay tribute to an Iowan who has never settled for anything \nless than excellence. I am referring to Dan Gable, head wrestling coach \nat the University of Iowa. Dan recently announced that he will be \ntaking a year off and turning his coaching duties to others. I think \nthis is the right time to look at the impressive record of Dan Gable.\n  Many of you may recognize Dan's name because of his legendary \naccomplishments in the sport of wrestling. Dan reached the very \npinnacle of this sport in the late 1960's and has stayed there ever \nsince. As a competitor, Dan compiled a nearly flawless record of 182-1 \nin his prep and college career. Dan was a three time all-American and \nthree time Big Eight Champion.\n  After college, Dan went on to win titles at the Pan American Games \nand world championships. Dan also demonstrated his superiority in \nwrestling when he won a gold medal at the 1972 Olympics.\n  His accomplishments as a coach are no less stellar. Teams coached by \nDan have an amazing 355-21-5 record. He has coached 152 all-Americans, \n45 national champions, 106 Big Ten champions, and 10 Olympians, \nincluding four gold medalists. To say Dan is a living legend in his \nchosen field is not an overstatement.\n  But even more admirable is how Dan has handled being at the top of \nhis field for nearly 30 years. We regularly hear about athletes \ninvolved in scandal after scandal--so much that we hardly raise an \neyebrow when the newest controversy makes headlines. But Dan has always \nconducted himself with dignity and a refreshing lack of arrogance. Dan \nhas imparted in the wrestlers he has coached an appreciation of hard \nwork, perseverance, graciousness, and calm under pressure. If you \nbelieve there are no more role models, then you must not know about Dan \nGable. I hope my statement might help correct that misbelief. Dan Gable \nexemplifies the notion that to be a true winner is not just about \nscoring the most points; it means carrying the title of winner with \nintegrity and character. Dan Gable has certainly done that.\n  I thank him for the credit he has brought to his family, his \ncommunity, his sport, and the State of Iowa, and wish him the very best \nin all his future plans. I know he will continue to approach whatever \nhe does with the same commitment and hard work he always has in the \npast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7744-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7744-S7745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to set the \nrecord straight.\n  Defense Week reports that I made inaccurate statements during the \nrecent debate on the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment on executive \ncompensation.\n  The article was written by Mr. Tony Capaccio and appears in the July \n14 issue of his publication.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that portion of the \nDefense Week article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Senate Rejects Maverick Measure\n\n       In endorsing the committee proposal, the Senate in a 83-16 \n     vote rejected an amendment by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), \n     Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and his Democrat counterpart Tom \n     Harkin.\n       Their amendment would have made permanent a $200,000 cap \n     applicable to all government contractors and not just the top \n     five in a headquarters or division.\n       In their floor debate, Boxer and Grassley singled out as an \n     example of the 1995 law's problems the compensation packages \n     of five top McDonnell Douglas Corp. corporate officers, \n     examined by a July 8 report GAO report.\n       The MDC executives, labeled Nos. 1 through 5, earned a \n     total of $14.8 million in 1995, according to information \n     contained in a March 31 DCAA report and repeated by GAO. \n     Boxer and Grassley said the GAO indicated that based on the \n     huge compensation packages, the 1995 cap was riddled with \n     loopholes.\n       Grassley declined to name the executives, saying their \n     identities were ``proprietary.'' Defense Week learned that \n     the unnamed executives, followed by their 1995 compensation \n     packages, are: CEO Harry Stoneciper, $4 million; Chairman of \n     the Board John F. McDonnell, $3.9 million; then-McDonnell \n     Douglas Aerospace Co. Executive Vice President & President \n     John Capellupo, $2.3 million; MDA Deputy President Herbert \n     Lanese, $2.3 million; and, then-Douglas Aircraft Co. \n     president Robert H. Hood, $2.2 million.\n       Grassley was inaccurate when he said during the floor \n     debate that the Pentagon picked up $9.2 million of the \n     compensation.\n       That was the amount corporate MDC allocated to the overhead \n     pools of divisions that had DOD contracts, according to \n     government officials. That overhead would then be divided \n     between commercial, general government and defense contracts.\n       It was not possible to trace how much actually the Pentagon \n     reimbursed.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think there is a misunderstanding, and I would like \nto clear it up.\n  Mr. President, I pride myself on always doing my homework and \nsticking to the facts.\n  So when someone accuses me of straying from the facts, I like to \naddress the criticism head on.\n  I would like to resolve the issue one way or the other.\n  To do that, I went back to the place where I got the information in \nthe first place.\n  That's the General Accounting Office [GAO] in St. Louis, MO--near \nMcDonnell Douglas headquarters.\n  The man with the knowledge there is Mr. Robert D. Spence.\n  I went back to Mr. Spence to check and recheck the facts to be \ncertain my statements were consistent with the facts.\n  The disputed information pertains to the amount of money the \nDepartment of Defense [DOD] pays out to senior executives at the \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp.\n  I presented those facts during the debate over executive compensation \non July 10.\n  The facts that Defense Week questions appear on page S7172 of the \nCongressional Record.\n  This is what I said.\n  The DOD paid the top five executives at McDonnell Douglas a total of \n$9,273,382.00.\n  I said the top executive got $2,713,308.\n  To back up that statement, I will place a table in the Record.\n  This table was prepared by the GAO but the information came straight \nfrom the horse's mouth--the Defense Contract Audit Agency or DCAA.\n  The table shows how much each of the five top executives at McDonnell \nDouglas was paid by the Pentagon.\n  Now, Mr. Capaccio says that information is inaccurate.\n  He says the top five executives were not paid $9,273,382.00 by DOD.\n  He says that is the amount allocated to the overhead pools of the \ncompany's many components or subdivisions.\n  He said that money would then have to be divided between commercial, \ngeneral government, and defense contracts.\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\n  Mr. President, I hate to say it, but Defense Week is flat wrong.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I went back to the GAO and Mr. Spence to \ncheck and recheck my information.\n  It checks out OK.\n  My information comes directly from the DCAA.\n  First, to get the DOD pay figures for the top five executives, DCAA \nhad to query the field offices at each McDonnel Douglas subdivision.\n  This was done to establish the split between DOD, non-DOD government, \nand commerical contracts.\n  This was done to isolate the amounts charged to DOD contracts.\n  That's what the GAO table does.\n  It isolates the $9,273,382.00 as the amount allocated to components \nwith DOD contracts.\n  DOD contracts--that's the key.\n  My numbers have absolutely nothing to do with general government or \ncommercial contracts.\n  So that's a bogus argument.\n  Second, the dollar totals on the GAO table are not 100-percent \naccurate.\n  I will be the first to admit that.\n  They were not audited in every case.\n  But they are considered reasonably accurate. They're in the ballpark.\n  If the GAO and DCAA numbers aren't accurate enough, then Defense Week \nshould produce a better set.\n  And it admits it can't do that.\n  Third, Mr. President, I need to clarify one point.\n  The Pentagon, for example, did not send McDonnell Douglas' top \nexecutive a paycheck for $2,713,308.00.\n  That's not how it really works.\n  There are no individual DOD paychecks that go to executives; \n$2,713,308.00 is the amount McDonnell Douglas is allowed to bill the \ntaxpayers on DOD contracts for that individual's salary.\n  That is the amount set aside in DOD contracts for that individual's \ncompensation package.\n  Once the amount is approved by DCAA, it is then apportioned across \nhundreds of contract payments.\n  It's doled out piecemeal in thousands of U.S Treasury checks.\n  But it's there in those checks.\n  McDonnell Douglas got the money.\n  The money came from DOD.\n  The money was for executive compensation.\n  Just because it was a small part of a big payment doesn't make the \nmoney any less real.\n  It doesn't make it play money.\n  In the end, Mr. President, no matter how you slice it, DOD paid \nMcDonnell Douglas' top five executives $9.3 million.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table I referred to earlier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         MDC ALLOCATION OF COMPENSATION TO COMPONENTS--TOP 5 EXECUTIVES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       Total\n                                                                   compensation                       Amounts\n                                                                        for            Total       allocated to\n                            Executive                             application of   compensation     components\n                                                                   compensation      $250,000        with DOD\n                                                                        cap                          contracts\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1...............................................................      $4,012,833      $3,762,833      $2,713,308\n2...............................................................       3,920,559       3,670,559       2,646,773\n3...............................................................       2,383,974       2,133,974       2,046,481\n4...............................................................       2,303,713       2,053,713       1,833,604\n5...............................................................       2,238,966       1,988,966          33,216\n    Total.......................................................      14,860,045      13,610,045       9,273,382\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                                                                  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7744-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7745-S7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             ACCESSING KIDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last year, many of my colleagues in the \nSenate had a great deal to say about the drug use problem in this \ncountry. This year, half way through the first term of the 105th \nCongress, not much has been said. I will not dwell on the reasons. But \nwe need to recall that the reasons for being concerned about drug use \nin this country have not changed. In fact, all the indicators continue \nto point to a growing problem.\n  Just recently, the administration released drug use data in the Pulse \nCheck, a twice-yearly publication on drug use trends and markets.\n  The information contained in the report is alarming. It confirms the \ncontinuing trend we noted last year of growing drug use particularly \namong young people. I want to share with my colleagues some of the \ninformation the Pulse Check shows.\n  Heroin use in most markets is up or stable, and availability is high.\n  There appears to be a trend of increased use among younger users, \nprimarily in inner cities.\n  Cocaine use is stable, but availability remains high.\n  Marijuana use is growing rapidly and the onset of use is occurring at \nearlier ages.\n  Polydrug use, the use of more than one drug in combination, is on the \nrise. Methamphetamine use is growing and the quality is improving.\n\n  Anyone familiar with this country's last drug epidemic, a problem \nthat we are still coping with, should be alarmed at what this \ninformation tells us. When you put these facts together with \ninformation from other surveys on use, hospital admissions, and trends, \nthe picture is grim. Let me summarize briefly what we are seeing.\n  More kids at younger ages are starting to use drugs. In our last drug \nepidemic, use began typically with 16-year-olds. Today's trend is for \ndrug use onset to begin with 12- and 13-year olds. Along with this, \nmore and more kids are seeing less danger in using drugs. This fact, of \ncourse, leads to more experimentation.\n  Parents are not talking to their kids about drugs. Many believe that \ntheir kids do not listen to them. Many believe that TV and peers have \nmore influence. Further, many of today's parents used drugs when they \nwere young. They now feel ambivalent about talking to their kids about \ndrugs. These parents don't want their kids using drugs, mind you, they \njust don't know how to talk to their kids. We know, however, that the \nmost important source for kids on how to behave, to judge right and \nwrong, comes from parents. Not from TV, not from their peers, but from \nparents. But parents are not speaking up.\n  Public messages and national leadership on drug use have declined in \nthe past 5 years. As we noted last year, the bully pulpit is empty. In \naddition, discussion of legalization in one form or another is on the \nrise. What this means is that kids no longer hear a no-use message. \nInstead, they hear mixed messages from government leaders and others. \nThey see efforts to legalize marijuana under a thinly disguised claim \nof medical need. They see increasing normalization of drug use in \nmovies, music, and on TV.\n  Is it little wonder, then, that we are seeing growing use of drugs \namong kids? This increase comes after almost a decade of decline. The \ndecline of use among kids in the late 1980's and early 1990's was not \nan accident.\n  It came as a result of commitment by this country--by parents, \nschools, community leaders, politicians, and others--to protect our \nyoung people and their future from drugs. In those years, we undertook \nefforts to discourage drug use. To make it harder to get drugs. To roll \nback the notion that drug use was simply a lifestyle choice that caused \nno harm, except maybe occasionally to a user. It worked. But we are now \nin the process of squandering those gains.\n  We need to remember something about how we got into our last drug \nfix. The 1960's and 1970's was a period of collective forgetfulness \nabout the harm that drug use does. It was not our first drug epidemic, \nit was our worst. It also did not happen by accident.\n  Neglect of our public responsibility played a part. Glorification of \ndrug use by the popular culture contributed. A collective public \namnesia about our experiences of earlier epidemics added to the mix. It \nwas a period of exploring the limits of personal freedom. \nUnfortunately, it was also a period that\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\nabandoned notions of personal responsibility. Combined with an active \nlobby that pushed for drug legalization, those years laid the \nfoundations for an explosion of drug use. Most of the burden of that \nuse fell upon young people. Most of our addicts today, who burden our \nwelfare and health systems, are the casualties of that period. They are \npaying the personal price but the rest of us are footing the bill. It \nis also no coincidence that our major crime wave began during the same \nyears and is linked directly to growing drug use.\n  It was the double whammy of kids on drugs and crime on our streets \nthat led to public demands for a speedy and effective response. It led \nto ``Just Say No'' and a concerted effort to reverse the trend and save \na generation of young people. It worked. But now we are in danger of \nforgetting once again what we once knew: That drug use is not a \nvictimless crime. That it is not harmless. That it is simply a matter \nof personal choice with no social consequences.\n  In the last several years, we have seen teenage drug use increase at \nan alarming rate. We have seen drug use messages re-emerge in the \npopular culture. We have seen major public figures and leading members \nof government equivocate on drugs or openly advocate legalization.\n  We have seen major financial figures pour money into pushing drugs-\nare-good-for-you themes. We have also seen the birth of MTV and the \nInternet. These media, aimed at kids, purvey in the most direct way \ndrug use themes to kids of all ages. Today, access to kids by people \nwho want to exploit them is unprecedented. Whether we are talking drugs \nor pornography, there is an open highway into almost every home in the \ncountry. Any household that is home to a tv or computer access to the \nworldwide web is accessible. You cannot lock your doors.\n  Currently, drug information sources on the Internet are dominated by \ndrug legalizers. Their websites are easily accessed. They specialize in \ntrendy formats and cartoon helpers. We hear a lot about Joe Camel.\n  Well, take a look at what those who specialize in drug legalization \nuse. As a recent piece in the New York Times shows, drug messages aimed \nat kids are up to date, stylish, and accessible. High Times, which is \none of the major drug legalization publications in the country, \noperates a site on the net. Their web page is available with only a few \nclicks from the main page. It is filled with lots of helpful tips. You \ncan learn, for example, how to grow marijuana at home. It offers advice \non how to evade or distort drug tests. You can find details on where to \nfind the best drugs. Of course, to access these helpful hints, you have \nto certify that you are not a minor. But there is no way to check on \nthis, so the certification is meaningless. There are many more, similar \nsites.\n  When you link this access to reemerging drug themes in the music most \nlistened to by young people, it is not hard to understand that more \nkids are using. It is not hard to see why more kids believe that drugs \nare not dangerous.\n  These messages come at a time of another wave of ambivalence about \ndrugs. They come at a time when leadership is lacking. They come at a \ntime when many parents do not seem to know how to talk to their kids.\n  Close to 25 percent of the population of this country is under the \nage of 18. Forty-five million are under the age of 12. It is this \npopulation that is most susceptible to drug use messages. It is this \naudience that is most targeted with those messages.\n  We have all the ingredients for another drug epidemic. This one, \nhowever, will come when we are still coping with the walking wounded \nfor our last fling with drugs. We are also seeing much younger kids \nstarting to use. If we fail to respond, seriously and soberly, then our \nnew drug epidemic will be worse than our last. It will also be the \nresult of a colossal act of irresponsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment Senator Murkowski and I \nhave offered strikes section 630 of the bill. If enacted, section 630 \nwould foreclose all Federal agencies from taking advantage of energy \nconservation programs offered by their local utility company. I believe \nsection 630 would needlessly restrict an option that helps the Federal \nGovernment, the Nation's largest energy user, implement cost-effective \nenergy-savings programs at Federal facilities.\n  Mr. President, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 set a goal of reducing \nby 20 percent the average energy consumed by the Federal Government. \nFederal facilities were given various approaches for reducing energy \nconsumption. For example, an agency can sign an energy savings \nperformance contract with an energy service company, or it can work \nwith the local utility company to take advantage of utility-sponsored \nenergy conservation measures. Under current law, Federal agencies may \nselect the option that is best for their situation.\n  It is important to have this flexibility because working with the \nprivate sector to reduce a facility's energy use is not an ordinary \nprocurement. Purchasing energy efficiency isn't like buying paper clips \nor furniture. The Federal Energy Management Program has made \nsubstantial progress in streamlining the contracting process for energy \nmanagement services at Federal facilities. If an agency chooses to work \nwith the local utility company, it may go directly to the utility on a \nsole-source basis to obtain the energy efficiency and management \nservices that are available to all utility customers. In most cases, \nthe utility teams with energy service companies to maximize cost-\neffective energy savings for the Government.\n  Section 630 would eliminate the option of working with the local \nutility. If section 630 remains in the bill, Federal agencies will not \nbe able to take advantage of the financial incentives, goods, or \nservices generally available to all other customers of the utility. \nThis could represent literally millions of dollars lost to the \ntaxpayers. Section 630 could also prevent payments on existing energy \nmanagement contracts between Federal agencies and utilities.\n\n  Over the years, I have spoken frequently here on the critical need \nfor Federal agencies to make better efforts to reduce their energy use. \nAccording to a recent GAO report, the taxpayers' electric bill for \nFederal facilities is more than $3.5 billion a year. There is no \nquestion we could be saving a substantial portion of this amount \nthrough cost-effective energy measures that frequently have payback \ntimes less than 10 years. I am pleased to see the substantial progress \nnow being made.\n  For example, the Government's largest single energy user is the \nDepartment of Defense, which accounts for half of all Federal \nelectricity consumption. The Department is now on a track to save up to \n$1 billion per year in total energy spending by the year 2005. The \nDepartment of Defense believes section 630 would significantly reduce \nits authority and opportunity to take advantage of private sector \nenergy conservation expertise and capital, and would, in fact, \nseriously reduce the amount of work offered to all sectors of the \nenergy community.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter \nfrom Millard Carr of the Department of Defense be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Earlier, I described the options available to Federal \nagencies to secure energy management services. If I could Mr. \nPresident, I'd like to take a moment to give two examples demonstrating \nthat the program is on the right track and illustrating the risks of \nhasty and ill-considered changes.\n  The first example is the New Mexico initiative from my home state. \nThe\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\nGeneral Services Administration has a contract with a local utility, \nPublic Service Co. of New Mexico, that covers the Federal facilities in \nPNM's service territory. Under the terms of this agreement, PNM \npartners with energy service companies on a competitive basis to \nimplement the actual energy-saving measures. This initiative is \nexpected to result in $60 million in new investments in conservation \nand energy efficiency technologies. The initial pilot project is at the \nWhite Sands Missile Range, where I understand that substantial \nreductions of energy and water use have been achieved. This successful \nprogram would be terminated if section 630 were enacted.\n  The other option available to Federal agencies is to contract with \nenergy service companies. I understand there may be concerns that these \ncompanies are left out of the Federal Energy Management Program when \nthe agencies choose to work with their local utilities. Mr. President, \nI don't believe this is the case. An article from the May 22, 1997, New \nYork Times describes the Department of Energy's awarding of five \ncompetitive contracts worth up to $750 million dollars. These contracts \ncover Federal buildings in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, \nNevada, Oregon, and Washington. The winning companies include energy \nservice companies such as Honeywell, Inc., and Johnson Controls. Five \nmore awards are planned over the next 2 years for a total contract \nvalue of $5 billion. It seems to me that all commercial players are \nhelping Uncle Sam reduce his energy bill. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, these are but two examples from the \nFederal Energy Management Program. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 \nsimplified the contracting procedures Federal agencies may use to \nimplement energy conservation measures. The last thing we should be \ndoing is eliminating options. We should be striving for maximum \nflexibility and not hamstringing the agencies as they strive for \nsubstantial progress.\n  Mr. President, last week the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee stated that section 630 ``reflects no change \nin the law'' and that the section ``directs federal agencies to abide \nby the law.'' I must respectfully disagree with the chairman. Section \n630 would make very substantial changes in energy-management measures \nenacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which Senator \nMurkowski and I, and the other members of the Energy Committee, worked \nto pass.\n  Last week, in speaking on section 630, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee listed what he stated were the provisions that \nare, in his view, relevant to Federal agency contracting programs for \nenergy services. However, with all due respect Mr. President, the \ndistinguished Chairman omitted the sections of the existing law that \nsection 630 would overturn. In particular, section 152 of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992 describes the implementation options available to \nagencies. If I may, I'd like to read the exact text: Each agency shall \n``take maximum advantage of contracts authorized under subchapter VII \nof this chapter, of financial incentives and other services provided by \nutilities for efficiency investment, and of other forms of financing to \nreduce the direct costs of Government * * *.''\n  Section 630 would effectively eliminate the option for Federal \nagencies to work with utilities, receive any available financial \nincentives, or take advantage of attractive forms of financing. This \nwould be a bad deal for the taxpayer.\n  Another part of section 152 of the Energy Policy Act that section 630 \nwould repeal specifically describes utility incentive programs:\n\n       (1) Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate \n     in programs to increase energy efficiency and for water \n     conservation or the management of electricity demand \n     conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally \n     available to customers of such utilities.\n       (2) Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods \n     or services generally available from any such utility, to \n     increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage \n     electricity demand.\n       (3) Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations \n     with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-\n     effective demand management and conservation incentive \n     programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized \n     by such agency.\n       (4) If an agency satisfies the criteria which generally \n     apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such \n     agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other \n     incentives.\n\n  Congress placed very similar requirements on the Department of \nDefense in the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1993. Mr. \nPresident, I will not read any more of the existing energy or defense \nauthorizations that would be wiped out by section 630. Instead, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks all the relevant provisions that allow local utility \nparticipation in Federal energy management programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have heard no arguments here as to why \nthese good provisions should now be repealed. In addition, the \nAppropriations Committee's report offers no explanation of the need for \nsection 630.\n  Let me also observe that section 630 attempts to make these \ncontroversial changes in energy legislation through an appropriations \nbill. As far as I can tell, no formal notification to or consultation \nwith the Energy Committee has taken place. I doubt that such a far-\nreaching change would be considered by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee without at least a hearing.\n  The proponents of section 630 should have their views heard in the \nappropriate forum. I am recommending to the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee that hearings be held so that we can get all the issues out \non the table and, if changes are needed, come to a reasonable solution.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and \nstrike section 630.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Defense \n           Pentagon,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1997.\n     To: Mr. Dan Alpert, Office of Senator Bingaman.\n     Subject: Section 630 Senate Treasury and Postal Service \n         Appropriations bill.\n\n       This is in response to your phone request for a Defense \n     position on the proposed Section 630 to the Senate Treasury \n     and Postal Appropriation bill which would preclude any \n     Federal agency from obtaining energy conservation services on \n     a sole source basis.\n       I understand the intent of the section is to assure best \n     value to the government through competition. I cannot comment \n     on the jurisdictional issues, but I believe very strongly \n     that the language as written would significantly reduce the \n     authority and opportunity this Department has to take \n     advantage of private sector energy conservation expertise and \n     capital. I can only assume that the sponsor of this section \n     has been seriously misled as to its implications.\n       The Department of Defense is the single largest energy user \n     in the country and as such we have been and continue, to be \n     committed to achieving the energy efficiency improvement \n     goals of the Energy Policy Act and President Clinton's \n     Executive Order 12902. If those goals are achieved, we will \n     realize a billion dollar reduction in our annual energy bill \n     by 2005 and implement the most cost effective environmental \n     improvement result possible through pollution prevention. \n     With the reduction in available appropriated funds and \n     technical personnel to achieve the buildings and energy \n     systems improvements necessary to meet program goals, we are \n     turning to the private sector for those resources.\n       The Military Departments and this office have worked for \n     over a year to develop a memorandum of agreement with the \n     Edison Electric Institute to expedite participation in \n     existing energy conservation programs offered by many of \n     their member companies to all customers. There is no question \n     that Department of Defense installations, and all Federal \n     agencies, should have the same ability to access those \n     programs provided to other similar customers. The agreement, \n     based on authority in the Energy Policy Act, includes \n     direction that a competitive procurement process be used to \n     select the most cost effective and competent private sector \n     firm capable of doing the specific technical work. It is our \n     belief that this utility ``prime contract'' process will lead \n     to a significant increase in the actual work done by the \n     energy savings performance contractor and Architect/Engineer \n     communities.\n       The intent of the DoD/EEI agreement was simply to expedite \n     the contracting process through which Defense installations \n     could access private sector energy conservation experts and \n     resources. Passage of Section 630 would in fact seriously \n     reduce the amount of work offered to all sectors of the \n     energy community.\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\n       I urge you to work to convince the Congress to strike \n     Section 630.\n                                            Millard E.

Wald)\n\n       Washington.--The Federal Government, the Nation's largest \n     landlord, will undertake a $5 billion renovation of its \n     buildings to cut energy bills by about one quarter, and all \n     the money will come from private companies, the Energy \n     Secretary, Federico F. Pena, announced today.\n       Mr. Pena named five corporate teams that will do the first \n     $750 million of work. When all the Government's 500,000 \n     buildings are renovated, he said, energy costs will be cut by \n     $1 billion a year from the current $4 billion.\n       ``That is real money, even by Washington standards,'' Mr. \n     Pena said.\n       An aide said the improvements, including better lamps, \n     motors, air conditioning systems and heating equipment, were \n     expected to save the Government $22 billion over their \n     lifetime.\n       The Energy Department has tried the approach before, on its \n     headquarters on Independence Avenue here and in other \n     buildings, but has found it cumbersome, as contracts are bid \n     building by building, officials said. Now the Government has \n     a standard contract and a list of vendors and hopes to \n     complete all Federal buildings by 2005.\n       The Government will invite an outside contractor to perform \n     an ``energy audit'' and suggest improvements, stating a price \n     for which it will do the work. If the Government accepts the \n     bid, the contractor installs the new equipment at the \n     contractor's expense, an approach taken by many private \n     building owners.\n       The Government will pay the contractor part of the money \n     that it saves on electric and fuel bills. The payments will \n     continue for a fixed period, usually five years. For the \n     contracts announced today, the maximum payments will be $750 \n     million.\n       John Archibald, the deputy director of the Federal Energy \n     Management Program at the department, said he believed that \n     the contractors would invest about $500 million directly. In \n     addition, officials said, the contractors' burdens include \n     being paid back over several years, and the risk that the \n     savings would not justify their improvements.\n       The buildings to be improved range ``from military posts to \n     post offices, and from Federal monuments to memorials,'' Mr. \n     Pena said. Most are office buildings, officials said. The \n     contracts announced today cover all Federal buildings in \n     Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon \n     and Washington. Electricity prices in Washington and Oregon \n     are among the lowest in the nation, making savings more \n     difficult.\n       The work will be done by Honeywell, Inc., of Minneapolis, \n     which helped devise the concept of contractor-financed energy \n     improvements, Johnson Controls, of Walnut Creek, Calif., ERI \n     Services Inc., of Brideport, Conn., and two corporate teams. \n     One team comprises The Bently Company/BMP Team, of Walnut \n     Creek, Calif., Puget Sound Energy, of Bellevue, Wash., and \n     Macdonald Miller Company, of Seattle. The other team is \n     Enova, which is the parent company of San Diego Electric and \n     Gas, and Pacific Enterprises, also of San Diego.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n              Excerpts From the Energy Policy Act of 1992\n\n\n              Section 152(c)(2) (42 u.s.c. 8253(d)(1)(C))\n\n       Each agency shall take maximum advantage of contracts \n     authorized under subchapter VII of this chapter, of financial \n     incentives and other services provided by utilities for \n     efficiency investment, and of other forms of financing to \n     reduce the direct costs to the Government.\n\n\n                   Section 152(f)(4) (42 U.S.C. 8256)\n\n                       Utility incentive programs\n\n       (1) Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate \n     in programs to increase energy efficiency and for water \n     conservation or the management of electricity demand \n     conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally \n     available to customers of such utilities.\n       (2) Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods \n     or services generally available from any such utility, to \n     increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage \n     electricity demand.\n       (3) Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations \n     with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-\n     effective demand management and conservation incentive \n     programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized \n     by such agency.\n       (4) If an agency satisfies the criteria which generally \n     apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such \n     agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other \n     incentives.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Excerpts From the Department of Defense Authorization, Public Law 102-\n                        484 (10 U.S.C. 2865(d))\n\n                        Energy saving activities\n\n       (1) The Secretary of Defense shall permit and encourage \n     each military department, Defense Agency, and other \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense to participate \n     in programs conducted by any gas or electric utility for the \n     management of electricity demand or for energy conservation.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense may authorize any military \n     installation to accept any financial incentive, goods, or \n     services generally available from a gas or electric utility, \n     to adopt technologies and practices that the Secretary \n     determines are cost-effective for the Federal Government.\n       (3) Subject to paragraph (4), the Secretary of Defense may \n     authorize the Secretary of a military department having \n     jurisdiction over a military installation to enter into \n     agreements with gas or electric utilities to design cost \n     effective demand and conservation incentive programs \n     (including energy management services, facilities \n     alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy \n     saving devices and technologies by the utilities) to address \n     the requirements and circumstances of the installation.\n       (4)(A) If an agreement under paragraph (3) provides for a \n     utility to advance financing costs for the design or \n     implementation of a program referred to in that paragraph to \n     be repayed by the United States, the cost of such advance may \n     be recovered by the utility under terms no less favorable \n     than those applicable to its most favored customer.\n       (B) Subject to the availability of appropriations, \n     repayment of costs advanced under paragraph (A) shall be made \n     from funds available to a military department for the \n     purchase of utility services.\n       (C) An agreement under paragraph (3) shall provide that \n     title to any energy savings device or technology installed at \n     a military installation pursuant to the agreement vest in the \n     United States.

This will be a request from the Clinton administration to \nthe Congress to give them something called fast-track trade authority.\n  This poster behind me will tell my colleagues of course how I feel \nabout fast track.

I want to spend a little \ntime talking about what fast track is. I expect most people in the \ncountry are unfamiliar with the term. What is fast-track trading \nauthority? And why are we debating it?\n  Just the words ``fast track'' tell a story. We all come from towns \nthat have understood what the word ``fast'' means.

Fast track means \nthat Congress will take its authority and essentially subjugate its \nauthority to a process by which an administration will go out and \nnegotiate a trade agreement and then bring it back to Congress with an \nunderstanding that there shall not be any amendments on the agreement. \nFast track means that every Member of Congress will be prevented from \noffering an amendment to the trade agreement.\n  The Constitution of the United States in article 1, section 8 says, \n``The\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\nCongress shall have the power . . . to regulate commerce with foreign \nnations.'' Interpreted, it means that the responsibility for the issue \nof trade resides here in the Congress. We also have an executive branch \nand a President and an office of Trade Ambassador and others who go out \nand negotiate trade agreement with other countries.\n  Of course, it is a different world now than it was. We have much more \ncommerce, back and forth across the oceans, country to country, and \nacross national borders. So then the question is, who wins and who \nloses in this trade? Some would have us believe that everyone wins in \nevery circumstance.\n  I was on an interview show last Thursday in downtown Washington, DC, \nwith Jack Kemp. Jack Kemp has a view about trade, and he is a good \nfriend of mine. I like Jack Kemp a lot, but his view of trade is, ``All \ntrade is just fine, because everybody wins. Open it up and expand it \nand everybody wins.''\n  However, that is not the case in international trade. There are \nwinners and there are losers. Yes, expanded, freer, and more open trade \nis good for the world. There is no question about that. But trade rules \nthat are fair are required in order that one country is not winning at \nthe expense of the other country that is losing. I want to talk a \nlittle about that today and how that fits with my concern about the \nissue of fast track.\n  Now, there are a lot of things that are right in this country at the \nmoment. We have a country that tends almost inevitably to insist on \ntalking about what is wrong. But, there are a lot of things right in \nthis country. Our economy is growing. It has been growing for some long \nwhile. Unemployment is down, way down. Inflation is down, way down, 5 \nyears in a row, and is almost nonexistent. The Federal budget deficit \nis down, and has been for 5 years in a row.\n  The fact is, there is some good economic news in this country. People \nfeel better about the future. Our economy rests on a cushion of \nconfidence. When people are confident about the future, they make \ndecisions that reflect that confidence. They will buy a car. They will \nbuy a house, buy a washing machine, or buy a television set. If they \nare not confident about the future, they make the opposite choice. They \ndecide not to purchase that washing machine or that car or that house. \nSo our economy rests on a notion of confidence.\n  Do people have confidence about the future? At this point they do \nhave more confidence about the future than they had in the past. It is \nbecause most of the fundamentals about our economy are moving in the \nright direction with one exception, and that is the area of \ninternational trade.\n  People look to this country and say, well, gee, in international \ntrade, America is remarkably successful. It is not. Two centuries ago, \nthis country was known as a country of shrewd Yankee traders. We could \nouttrade anybody anywhere any time, the shrewd Yankee traders from that \nnew United States of America. What happened?\n  What happened was that in the last half century, following the Second \nWorld War, our trade policy inevitably became our foreign policy. We \ndid not have a trade policy; we had a foreign policy with other \ncountries. That foreign policy drove all of the trade decisions we \nmade--with Japan, with Europe, with all of our trading partners.\n  Our trade policy was driven by our foreign policy. At the time, of \ncourse, we were bigger, stronger, and had greater capability of dealing \nin international trade. We could whip almost any of these countries \nwith one arm tied behind our back. That is how strong our economy was \ncompared to a Japanese economy that was wrecked by World War II, a \nEuropean economy that was wrecked by World War II and in tatters and \ntrying to rebuild. We could compete easily. We could provide \nconcessions to every one of those countries, even giant concessions at \nthat, and we did. Despite the fact that we did that, in the first 25 \nyears after the Second World War, we saw continual wage gains in this \ncountry up and up and up, and we did very, very well.\n  But then what happened was Japan and the Western European economies \nwere rebuilt and became very strong. And, they became shrewd, tough, \ninternational competitors. Meanwhile, our trade policy with them was \nstill driven by our foreign policy.\n  With Japan, we began to become accustomed to deficits in \ninternational trade relations every single year. In recent years these \nhave amounted to $40 to $50 billion, and even $60 billion a year trade \ndeficits with Japan, every single year. The same has been true with \nsome of our other trading partner relationships.\n  Now in recent times we have had a series of trade negotiations, some \nof them under what is called the fast-track procedure. After every \ntrade negotiation we have had days of feasting and rejoicing by those \nwho negotiated them. They talked about how wonderful the agreements \nwere for America, but at the conclusion of it our trade deficit kept \ngrowing and growing and growing.\n  There has been angst in this Chamber, an enormous amount of \ndiscussion about the other deficit, the fiscal policy budget deficit, \nand it is a very serious problem. Fortunately, we have made significant \nprogress in dealing with it.\n  Yet, the deficit called the trade deficit does not provoke one \nutterance in this Chamber. No one talks about it, no one thinks much \nabout it, and no one appears willing to lift a finger to do anything \nabout it. I will show my colleagues and those watching these \nproceedings what has happened to the trade deficit. The merchandise \ntrade deficit, that is, the imbalance or the deficit between what we \nship into this country versus what we ship out, is this year 21 years \nold. We have had 21 straight years of trade deficits growing worse and \nworse every year. It is now of legal age, since we have had 21 years of \ntrade deficits.\n  Last year, we had the largest merchandise trade deficit in this \ncountry's history. Does it matter? Some say it does not. Some say it \njust does not matter at all. It means that we are importing cheap goods \nfrom around the world and so someone else has the American dollars that \nwe paid for those goods.\n  What will they do with these dollars? They will invest them in \nAmerica. That is what they say. I suppose that suggests it does not \nmatter who owns the productive facilities of our country or the real \nestate of our country or who owns much of the assets of our country. I \ndon't happen to believe that, but I suppose some probably say it does \nnot matter. There are those who believe it is an international economy, \nlet the chips fall where they may, and if you cannot compete, you \ncannot compete.\n  The dilemma is this: The U.S. producer and the U.S. employer can \ncompete with anyone in this world as long as the competition is fair. \nBut no U.S. worker and no U.S. employer ought to be required to compete \nagainst someone who works 14 hours a day, is 14 years old, and makes 14 \ncents an hour. Yet this goes on all across the world, as I speak.\n\n  Is that fair competition? Should we expect someone in Toledo, Fargo, \nDenver, or Los Angeles to have to compete against 14-cent-an-hour \nwages? I don't think so. I don't think anyone actually believes that \nrepresents fair trade.\n  Should we be expected to compete against a country that insists on \nshipping its goods in wholesale quantity to our country but keeps its \nmarket closed to the goods produced by American workers? I don't think \nso. That is not fair trade.\n  Now, as a result of a number of those considerations, and others, we \nhave a trade deficit that continues to grow. Fast track is a process \nthat started back a couple of decades ago of negotiating trade \nagreements under a procedure called fast track so that no one could \namend the trade agreement when it came back to Congress.\n  Look what has happened under fast track. There is nothing but a sea \nof red ink. Is it because of fast track? I don't know. All I know is \nthat within trade agreements there are serious problems. For example, \nthe one we have with Canada results in a massive, massive problem with \na flood of Canadian grain coming into our country unfairly and we \ncannot do a thing about it. We seem powerless to deal with it.\n  I voted against the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement because \nI thought it was negotiated in a way that was fundamentally unfair to \nour country. I thought the negotiators effectively sold out the \ninterests of\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\nAmerican agriculture in negotiating that trade agreement. Now, we find \nourselves now with a growing trade deficit with Canada, and an \navalanche of Canadian grain flooding into our country, undercutting the \nprice that farmers in our country received from an already weak grain \nmarket. Is that fair? I don't think it is fair.\n  Let's take a look at NAFTA, the United States-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement, the Uruguay round of GATT talks, the Tokyo round, all under \nfast track. What happens under fast track is that we negotiate a Tokyo \nround, bring it to Congress, shove it through the Congress, and say you \nhave no right in Congress to amend it.\n  Now, Congress decided that it should have no right to amend it. That \nis what fast track is all about. There was fast track with the United \nStates-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Shove it through Congress, with no \nright to amend it. None. Then there was NAFTA, the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, which includes Mexico--Congress had no right to amend \nit. I led the fight against fast track on this particular agreement \nwhen I was in the House of Representatives. We lost by about 30 or 40 \nvotes. Then the Uruguay round comes to Congress. There was no right to \namend it because fast track means that whatever they negotiate you have \nto accept up or down, with no amendments.\n  The bars on this chart represent the merchandise trade deficits that \nwe have had since these trade agreements were adopted through the use \nof fast track. Can anyone in this country who has not had a fifth of \nWild Turkey take a look at these and say that this is success? You have \nto be dead drunk to believe this is a success. This is an abysmal \nfailure. Part of it, in my judgment, comes from fast track. This is a \nprocess that says to negotiators, go out and negotiate and do what you \nwant to do and bring it back, and then we will have a procedure in \nplace that prevents any Member of Congress from correcting a mistake \nyou might have made. This is not success. This ocean of red ink \nrepresents failure.\n  Let me take a closer look at one of them in particular, the NAFTA \nagreement. The NAFTA agreement is a trade agreement that we negotiated \nwith Canada and Mexico together. We already had the United States-\nCanada Free Trade Agreement. We rolled that into a broader agreement \nwhich included Mexico with NAFTA. Just prior to the time the NAFTA \ntrade agreement was implemented, we had an $11 billion merchandise \ntrade deficit with Canada and a $2 billion merchandise trade surplus \nwith Mexico.\n  Look at what has happened to this country since this agreement was \nphased in: The deficit with Canada has gone from $11 billion to $14 \nbillion to $18 billion to $23 billion. Success? You would have to be \ndead drunk to call that a success. That is not a success. That is a \nfailure.\n\n  With Mexico, we had a $1 billion surplus in the first year of the \ntrade agreement under NAFTA. The next year, we had a $15 billion \ndeficit. The next year, it was a $16 billion deficit. In other words, \nwe now have a nearly $40 billion combined trade deficit with both of \nour neighbors.\n  So what does it matter, some say. ``So what? Things are going fine. \nSo what?'' What it means is that in the past 21 years, we have \naccumulated close to a $2 trillion account deficit that will have to be \nrepaid with a lower standard of living in this country at some point in \nthe future. So what? So it means that we are inevitably weakening the \nproduction and the manufacturing sectors of this country. No country \nwill long remain a world-class economy unless it has a world-class \nmanufacturing sector. If it does not have a strong manufacturing base, \nit will not retain a strong world-class economy. You cannot have a \nstrong economy just selling hamburgers and insurance and so on, back \nand forth to one another; you must have a strong manufacturing base.\n  Now, let me describe a bit about what has happened with the free \ntrade agreement. We were told that if the Congress passed something \ncalled NAFTA with Canada and Mexico that we would receive products that \ncame from low-skilled jobs from Mexico. We were told that as a result \nof NAFTA, we would have more American jobs because of the trade \nagreement. Do you know that now, after a few years of NAFTA, we have \nmore automobiles shipped into this country, produced in Mexico, than \nare shipped from America to the rest of the world?\n\n  Let me say that again because I bet most people don't believe that to \nbe the case. Now that we have opened these borders and we have allowed \nthe largest enterprises in this country to go find the cheapest labor \nthey can find, we now import more automobiles from Mexico than the \nUnited States exports to the rest of the world combined.\n  Think about that. Why does all this matter? It matters because the \nmanufacturing sector in this country is critical to an economy that is \nbased on good jobs with good incomes. If we are going to produce shoes, \npencils, automobiles, electronics products, and we are going to do that \nin Mexico, in Bangladesh, in Sri Lanka, in Indonesia, because we can \nhire a worker in those areas at a fraction of the cost of what it would \nrequire us to pay to hire a worker in the United States, what does that \nmean? It means production moves offshore. Our production moves \noverseas. What does that mean to the core of the economy in this \ncountry? It is weakened.\n  The central question I ask about these trade relationships is whether \nit is fair trade? Is it fair trade for a company to be able to just \npole vault over all of the problems in this country that they have in \nproducing? For example, the problem of having to overcome a prohibition \nagainst hiring kids. We say in this country that you can't go hire a \n12-year-old kid and work him 12 hours a day. That violates the Child \nLabor Act in this country. We say, you can't produce a product and dump \nchemicals into the air and throw chemicals into the water because we \nhave environmental laws that prevent you from doing that. So that \ncompany can say, fine, if you say we can't hire kids, we can't dump \nchemicals and sewage into the water and air, we will go to a country \nwhere we can. We will produce it there and ship it back to Fargo and to \nBuffalo and we will ship it to Dallas and put it on the shelves of the \nstores to compete with products made in the United States, where you \nhave had to pay higher wages and you have had to obey child labor laws \nand you have had to obey environmental laws.\n  I question, is that fair trade? I don't think so. Yet, that is \nexactly what we are facing. Yes, we face it even close to our border, \nbut especially in many other places around the world.\n  We have a trade deficit in which 92 percent of the merchandise trade \ndeficit is with six countries: Japan, with nearly $50 billion; China, \n$40 billion; Canada and Mexico with another $40 billion; and Germany.\n  I was in China last November and met with the President of China and \ntalked about our trade relationship. I have no idea whether I made any \nimpact. He was a wonderful person. China has a terrific deal with this \ncountry. We talk a lot about most-favored-nation status here in this \nChamber. We had a vote on it last week. I didn't think we should vote \non that within an appropriations bill without any significant debate, \nso I voted against that amendment. But I specifically indicated that \nthat wasn't a vote for me on the substance of the MFN issue. I think we \nought to have a vote and a significant debate on most-favored-nation \nstatus for China.\n  But let me say this. We talk a lot about most-favored-nation status \nand about human rights. Certainly human rights is very important. The \nweek I was in China, a fellow--I believe his name was Wang Dan--was \nsentenced to 9 years in prison for criticizing the government. Those \nhuman rights are important.\n  At the same there is something else that is also important. What \nabout a country that is exponentially increasing its trade surplus with \nthis country? We have become a cash cow for the hard currency needs of \nChina. Again, it weakens us and strengthens them. They ship us their \ngoods. In fact, almost half the Chinese exports come to the United \nStates of America, and yet, we get so few goods into China.\n\n  We ought to say to China, to Japan, to Canada, and to others, that we \nexpect and demand reciprocal and fair trade treatment, and if you don't \ngive it to us, the United States marketplace\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\nis not open to you. The U.S. marketplace is open to you if you treat us \nfairly. Yes, we are willing to compete. We should be required to \ncompete. But the competition ought to be fair. If it is not, then we \nought to have the nerve and the will to stand up to these countries and \nsay it is not fair to this country. And, it is not fair to American \nworkers and to American producers either.\n  In September, when we have a debate on fast track, I am going to be \non the floor fighting as hard as I know how to fight to prevent us from \ngranting fast-track authority for new trade talks. Do I support the \ntrade officials? Yes, I want them to succeed. I want them to negotiate \nsomething that they can win for a change. I am really tired of us \nlosing in international trade talks.\n  Let me give you some specifics. Last Saturday morning, in Minot, ND, \nI met with a group of grain producers. These are family farmers, who \nraise Durum and spring wheat. They have one problem. On the horizon of \ntrade problems, is this big or significant? Probably not, on the whole \nhorizon. But to them it is it big. You bet. In many cases, it is a \nquestion of whether they survive and do they make it.\n  Here is their problem. We had a fellow named Clayton Yeutter go to \nCanada and negotiate a trade agreement with the Canadians. I didn't \nvote for that. I said at the time that I thought it was a terribly \nflawed agreement. At that time, I didn't know of the side deal that had \nnot been made public. That side deal that had been made with the \nCanadians was about how to compute whether or not there was a subsidy \nfor grains. When that was made public, it just destroyed my faith in \nthese kinds of negotiations.\n  So now we find ourselves down the road some years from the United \nStates-Canadian Free Trade Agreement and here's what we have. We have a \nNorthern border with wonderful people. They are good neighbors of ours. \nWe share a lot and we have a lot of commerce back and forth.\n  However, in the area of grain, we have had a flood of grain coming \nacross, especially Durum, since this agreement. For those who don't \nknow what that is, let me explain. Durum is the wheat you grind into \nsomething called semolina flour and that is what you use to make \nmacaroni and other pasta. Eighty percent of the Durum produced in \nAmerica is produced in North Dakota. So if you are buying some noodles \nor elbow macaroni or spaghetti, you are likely buying something, if it \nis sourced in this country, that was raised somewhere in a field, or \ngrew somewhere in a field in North Dakota. The Durum market is a very \nimportant market to our farmers.\n  Well, we passed the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement and all \nof a sudden, a flood of Canadian Durum came into our country, a literal \nflood of Canadian Durum and, following it, other wheat and barley. But \nyou can't get much grain into Canada. I have told my colleagues before \nabout the time that I got in a little orange truck with Earl Jensen, \nand we took Earl's orange truck up to the Canadian border with 200 \nbushels of North Dakota Durum to try to get it into Canada. They said, \n``No, you can't go across the border here.''\n  We had a woman from Bowman, ND, who lived in Canada. She married a \nCanadian and went home to Bowman for Thanksgiving, and she had a desire \nto bake some whole wheat bread. So she took a sack of hard red spring \nwheat--good for baking bread--and she couldn't take that back to \nCanada. This was at a time when over 50 million bushels of Canadian \nwheat was coming into our country. Truckload after truckload that were \nclogging our roads. This lady got to the border and wanted to take in \none grocery sack full of wheat in order to make whole wheat bread. \nGuess where it ended up? Dumped on the ground because you can't take \none grocery sack of wheat into Canada these days.\n  Are our farmers angry about this? You're darn right. Do they have a \nright to be angry? Absolutely. They have a right to be furious about a \ntrade relationship that is fundamentally unfair to our side. Now, can \nwe get someone to fix it? We are trying. Mickey Kantor, a former Trade \nAmbassador, took the first step. The fact is that it got better for a \ntime. But once again, this flood of wheat is exceeding the limits we \nhad agreed to with Canada.\n\n  I use that illustration only to say that this example is just but one \nof the examples of problems we have with trade issues that you can't \nsolve anymore, because we pass trade agreements with something called \nfast track. Under fast track you can't fix them when they are here. You \neither have to vote yes or no, up or down, and the result is that these \nflawed agreements then become law. Those treaties or agreements are \nthen wedded into American law and it prevents us from providing \nremedies for the trade problems that exist--yes, with Japan, with \nChina, with Canada, with Mexico, and others.\n  I think it is time for us to decide to put a stop to it. I think it \nis time for us to say to negotiators in trade that you go negotiate \njust as all of the other negotiators do. When we send someone abroad to \nnegotiate arms agreements, they don't do so under fast track. We didn't \nhave fast-track authority to prevent any amendments on the floor of the \nHouse or Senate on the nuclear arms reduction treaties that we had. \nThere was no fast track there. Why on earth, if we don't need fast \ntrack on arms control agreements, do we need it on trade agreements? \nAre our trade negotiators so weak, so inept that somehow they need fast \ntrack when others don't?\n  Last Friday, the Commerce Department released the statistics that \ndescribe what happened to our trade numbers for the month of May. It \nindicated that our trade deficit in goods, the merchandise trade \ndeficit for the month of May, was $17 billion, just for the month of \nmay. That is up from $15.5 billion in the month of April. The big news \nwas that China's trade deficit exceeded Japan's trade deficit for the \nmonth, for the third time in history.\n  These monthly statistics demonstrate another failure in trade. \nUnfortunately, it is greeted with a series of yawns here in the \nCongress and in this town. Were someone to try to put an op-ed piece \nin, for example, the Washington Post about this issue, they would say, \nno, thank you, they don't do those kinds of pieces. You can't have a \ndebate about trade issues in this town, because too many believe there \nare only two sides of this issue. On one side there are those who say \nwe are for free trade, free, expanded, and open trade, and that is good \nfor the world. And they say everyone who doesn't subscribe to that is \nsomehow an uninformed xenophobic stooge who wants to put walls around \nAmerica. Those are the two camps that you are put into. You are either \nfor free trade, period, or you are some sort of xenophobic, \nisolationist stooge. That is just a thoughtless way to deal with what I \nthink is a significant problem for this country.\n  This country needs to understand that our trade policy ought to \ndisconnect from our foreign policy. Our trade policy in dealing with \ntrade competitors who are savvy, tough, and shrewd, ought to be a \npolicy that cares about the well-being of this country. I believe in \nopen and expanded and more trade. I also demand that it be fair. If it \nis not fair, we ought to say to other countries, you either get it fair \nand allow entry to our products on a fair basis, or we are not going to \ncontinue this one-way relationship.\n  This is not going back to some Smoot-Hawley notion of how we should \ntrade. It is not calling for higher tariffs; nothing of the sort. It is \ndemanding of other countries that we stop being mistreated. It is \ndemanding of other countries that those who believe they can continue \nto access our marketplace must understand that their marketplace will \nhave to be open as a consequence of that, and the failure to open it \nmeans that we will impose reciprocal trade treatment on our trading \npartners.\n  Now, we are going to have a meeting in the next day or two with the \nUnited States Trade Ambassador and the Secretary of Agriculture to talk \nabout the issues of United States-Canada grain. That is but one issue \namong these larger sets of issues, but nevertheless it is important. I \nhope that this issue doesn't continue to fester. I hope that this side, \nthat this Government and this country, will say to the Canadians on the \ngrain issue: You can't do that. We are not going to allow you to do \nthat.\n  But my experience has been, regrettably, over many years, that \nstanding\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nup for this country's interests has been the exception rather than the \nrule in trade issues. All too often our country backs away and says, \nwell, we don't want to ruffle any feathers here. I am just a little \ntired of that.\n\n  When China wants to buy airplanes, guess what? China is a huge market \nwith 1.2 billion or so people, and they need to buy airplanes. So I am \ntold that China comes to our country and says to us, ``Well, we need to \nbuy some airplanes, and we don't manufacture airplanes. But instead of \nbuying it from you, what we want you to do is bring your technology and \nproduce it in China.''\n  I don't understand that either. This country ought not be interested \nin that. When we have a country with a $40 billion trade surplus with \nus, or we a deficit with them, and they need something we have, then \nthey ought to buy it from us off the shelf. China ought to buy more \nwheat from us. They ought to buy airplanes from us produced in this \ncountry with U.S. employees and from U.S. companies.\n  We ought not to continue to allow our trading relationships to be \nforeign policy relationships. They ought to be economic relationships \nwith tough, shrewd negotiators working out relationships where the \nrules are fair, where our employees and our producers can expect fair \ntreatment and fair ability to compete.\n  So, in September when the President brings to this Congress a request \nfor fast-track trading authority, I intend to be on the floor of the \nSenate saying no. I have no idea how many of my colleagues will join \nme. I know for sure as I stand here today that those of us who do say \nno will be branded as some sort of isolationists. Those who do that are \nwrong and thoughtless, but they will do it.\n  But I will insist that finally this country have the nerve and the \nwill to stand up for itself and its interests. I believe that my \nchildren will inherit, just as they inherit the budget deficit, a trade \ndeficit that means we will have a lower standard of living in this \ncountry unless we take action to deal with it and deal with it \neffectively.\n  Let me conclude where I began. This country can compete on any terms \nanywhere in this world as long as the rules are fair. But we have not \nbeen able to satisfactorily conclude trade negotiations in recent \ndecades in any reasonable way that gives us the feeling--or at least \ngives me the feeling--that we have succeeded.\n  Time after time after time our trade negotiators celebrate after they \nhave lost. They don't understand they have lost. I am not even sure \nthey do when they see the red ink pile up and the growing, record \nmerchandise trade deficit that now exists in this country.\n  I hope that one day we can have a thoughtful and interesting debate \nabout trade policy. It should not be between camps who think trade is \ngood or bad. Everyone ought to believe that expanded world trade, \nprovided the circumstances and rules of trade are fair, is good for \nthis world. But everyone also ought to believe that when this country \nis taken advantage of with markets that are closed, rules that are \nunfair, and countries that employ child labor and pollute this Earth's \nenvironment, that is not fair trade and is not something we ever ought \nto have to subscribe to.\n  Mr. President, once again, I expect September will be an interesting \nmonth and a challenging month on the issue of trade largely because of \nthe debate on fast track. I intend to be back often to discuss this \nsubject.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered. \nThe Senator has 10 minutes under morning business.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Under the previous order, the hour of 3 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration of \nSenate bill 1034, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1034) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     for sundry independent agencies, commissions, corporations, \n     and offices for fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, with my distinguished ranking member, I am pleased \nto present to the Senate the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD and Independent \nagencies appropriations bill. This bill is not perfect, as is usually \nthe case with the measures that we present, and not everyone is fully \nsatisfied, but, nevertheless, every attempt was made to achieve a \nbalanced, fair bill which meets our highest priority.\n  While I am very grateful for the support of the appropriations \nchairman in the allocation process, it should be recognized that the \nallocation is slightly above the amount assumed in the budget \nagreement. Our job was made extremely difficult once again this year by \nan extraordinarily tight initial 602(b) allocation. I might add that we \nare awaiting final Budget Committee action, which I expect will be \nforthcoming shortly, to achieve the final allocation numbers.\n  The allocation represents a reduction of about $1.4 billion below the \nPresident's request in outlays. Clearly, fulfilling the President's \nrequest in many areas has been impossible under these numbers.\n  The bill totals approximately $69.4 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, plus an additional $21.5 billion in mandatory spending.\n  Our highest priority was adequately funding VA medical programs, \nwhich in the budget agreement took a $300 million cut. Protecting VA \nmedical care meant that fulfilling the President's full request for \nEPA, for which a 12 percent or $850 million increase was requested, \nsimply was not possible.\n  In addition, the subcommittee did not apply cuts totaling $230 \nmillion to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or the \nNational Science Foundation which were assumed in the budget agreement.\n  Finally, the budget agreement suggested that public housing, \ncommunity development block grants, the HOME Program for local \ngovernments to assist in housing, and the McKinney\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\nHomeless programs all be cut. Clearly, those cuts were unacceptable, \nand we did not include them.\n  For the Veterans Administration the committee recommendation totals \n$18.7 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $92 million \nabove the President's request and almost $400 million above the amount \nassumed in the budget agreement. Increases were provided to VA medical \ncare, research, and the State home construction grant program, the \nlatter of which demand far exceeds available Federal matching funds.\n  The recommendation for VA is predicated on enactment of \nreconciliation legislation giving VA authority to retain collections \nfrom third-party payers and copayments. Such collections are estimated \nto total $600 million next year, and together with the medical care \nappropriation will result in an increase over fiscal year 1997 of $617 \nmillion in available discretionary funding for VA medical care. The \namount recommended will enable VA fully to continue on the path of \nimproving the quality of health care services, increase the number of \nveterans served, and increase the provision of care in ambulatory and \ncommunity-based settings.\n  The bill would also require VA to begin implementation of a number of \npreliminary recommendations of the National Academy of Public \nAdministration report regarding the Veterans Benefits Administration. \nThese recommendations are intended to improve and expedite the \nprocessing of veterans' claims for benefits. Addressing this problem is \nlong overdue.\n  For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the committee \nrecommends $25.4 billion, including flat funding for most programs such \nas CDBG, HOME, public housing, and homeless assistance. The budget \nagreement assumes cuts in each of these programs. And as I indicated, \nthe committee did not accept that budget agreement recommendation.\n  In addition, the mark restores the President's budget cut of $365 \nmillion to elderly and disabled housing, with a total of $839 million \nincluded in the recommendation for this program.\n  Furthermore, the bill provides $9.2 billion to fund section 8 \ncontract renewals fully for which the budget resolution included a \nspecial reserve account.\n\n  For the Environmental Protection Agency, the committee recommendation \ntotals almost $7 billion, an increase of $180 million over the fiscal \nyear 1997 level. While this recommendation is $680 million less than \nthe President's request, the reduction is attributable primarily to the \ndecision not to fund a requested 50 percent increase for Superfund.\n  Given that the Superfund Program is sorely in need of reform and \nreauthorization, with the General Accounting Office designating it as a \nhigh-risk program subject to fraud, waste and abuse, coupled with our \nbudget constraints previously described, a $700 million increase simply \ncould not be justified. Senators Chafee and Smith, chairman of the \nauthorizing committee and subcommittee respectively, have indicated \ntheir opposition to a large boost in Superfund appropriations prior to \nreauthorization and reform badly needed in that program. Finally, there \nare serious questions as to whether EPA could even spend the full \namount being requested.\n  In terms of operating programs, which are up almost $100 million over \nlast year, the largest reduction--$122 million--below the request was \ntaken from a laboratory construction project in Research Triangle Park, \nNC. Sufficient funds remain available to continue progress on the new \nbuilding at this time.\n  In addition, all major operating program accounts in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency will receive increases. Again, this \nyear the committee made as its highest priority EPA funding for States \nfor implementation of environmental requirements. A significant \nincrease is recommended for State revolving funds.\n  The committee recommendation restores the President's proposed $275 \nmillion cut to clean water State revolving funds and fully funds the \n$175 million increase for drinking water State revolving funds, for a \ntotal of $2.075 billion. These funds are vitally needed, Madam \nPresident, with the EPA's estimate of drinking water and clean water \ninfrastructure requirements nationally exceeding $200 billion. I \nbelieve every Member of this body, when she or he returns to their \nState, will find that these priority needs are there. They are critical \nand they are absolutely essential to maintaining the health of our \npopulace as well as the quality of our environment.\n  In addition, the committee recommends a $50 million boost to State \nenvironmental assistance grants, in part for additional \nresponsibilities in the area of air quality standards, for a total of \n$725 million. The leaking underground storage tank grants are increased \n$5 million, for a total of $65 million. This program is vital in \nprotecting ground water resources.\n  To minimize controversy and expedite consideration of this bill, \nthere are no EPA legislative provisions included in the committee \nrecommendation. If Members wish to offer such amendments, we ask that \nyou bring them forward. We will deal with those in the full body. We \ndid not deal with them in committee.\n  For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the committee \nrecommends $13.5 billion for NASA, the same as the President's request. \nThe past few weeks in the news have exemplified NASA's situation, from \nthe heady excitement of seeing the American robot Sojourner cruising \nthe surface of Mars to the continued concerns over the safety of our \nAmerican astronaut and his Russian companions on the Mir space station. \nWe have supplied NASA with the President's request and will work with \nthe agency to allow them the flexibility to continue their exciting \nresearch and development missions while at the same time working to \ncontrol their costs.\n  For the National Science Foundation, the recommendation includes \n$3.377 billion for the National Science Foundation, $10 million above \nthe President's request and $60 million above the budget agreement \nassumptions. This subcommittee believes that research and development \nis essential to our Nation's future and wants to give the NSF the \nnecessary resources.\n  Included in the mark for NSF funding is the provision for a new plant \ngenome initiative. An interagency working group convened by the \nPresident's science adviser has recently reported on the exciting \nprospects in genome research. Their report recommends expanding current \nstudies of plant genomes to economically important crop species, \nincluding corn. We have supplied NSF with the resources to jump-start \nthat effort and applaud the agency's interest and support in exploring \nthe broader applications of the research they fund.\n  For the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the recommendation \ntotals the President's request of $788 million exactly, including $320 \nmillion for disaster relief. A prohibition on spending is included in \nthe recommendation, consistent with legislation FEMA recently proposed \nto reform the disaster relief account. This is an area I have long been \ninterested in addressing, as the costs of this program are completely \nout of control. The limitation on spending included in this measure as \nrecommended by FEMA would prohibit disaster relief funds from being \nspent on such projects as golf courses, stadiums, parks, and \nrecreational facilities, trees and shrubs. While the limitation on \nspending is modest, it is at least a first step, long overdue, and an \nimportant one that we should take. I anticipate the authorizing \ncommittee will expedite its consideration of FEMA's proposed Stafford \nAct amendments in September.\n\n  Also in FEMA, the newly authorized dam safety program is fully funded \nat $2.9 million and State and local assistance grants are increased $3 \nmillion.\n  I might add that, as mentioned earlier, we are waiting final action \nfrom the Budget Committee to revise the 602(a) allocation, which is \nanticipated shortly, after which the subcommittee 602(b) allocation \nwill be revised so that we may be in conformance with that allocation. \nThe action is necessary owing to the budget resolution's special \ntreatment of the HUD section 8 contract renewal accounts.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Sarah \nHorrigan, who has worked on space and science issues on this bill, be \nallowed\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\nthe privilege of the floor during consideration on S. 1034, the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill and any votes therein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is now my pleasure to yield to my \npartner in this effort, the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, thank you very much.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that \nduring the consideration of S. 1034, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1998, Ms. Stacy Closson, a detailee from DOD serving with \nthe VA-HUD Subcommittee be provided floor privileges during the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, very much, Madam President.\n  Today, I rise to join my distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nMissouri, to offer for floor debate and the consideration of the Senate \nthe fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill for VA-HUD and independent \nagencies.\n  This is an extraordinary bill because it deals with 7 Cabinet-level \nGovernment agencies and 18 other agencies that are important to the \nUnited States of America. These agencies range from Veterans, Housing, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, the National Space Agency, the \nNational Science Foundation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, as \nwell as the National Corporation for Volunteer Services, and we go on \nto Selective Service.\n  People would be surprised to know that Arlington Cemetery is also \nfunded in this bill. We stand sentry for consumers through the consumer \nproduct safety legislation. Those little pamphlets that taxpayers send \nfor from Pueblo, CO, a big chunk of their funding comes out of this \nbill. So when we say veterans, housing, and independent agencies, this \nis probably, along with defense and the Labor-HHS bill, the most \ncomplex bill. Therefore, when we bring it to the Senate, sometimes our \nfunding sounds like it is significant in terms of its dollar amount, \nbut we really have worked very hard to get a dollar's worth of services \nfor a dollar of taxes.\n\n  The bill before the Senate is a $90 billion bill that includes $21.5 \nbillion in mandatory spending which is primarily directed at veterans, \nand appropriates a total of $69.4 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority. This is almost equal to the House in total funding, and more \nthan $90 million below what President Clinton requested. However, the \nallocation for the Senate, which is the total amount given to us to \nspend, was almost $800 million below that of the House.\n  Given the tight allocation, the chairman and I did the best we could \nto balance the needs of diverse groups of agencies funded within this \nsubcommittee. With a better allocation, we could have funded all the \nagencies in this bill at higher levels. But we were ready to make tough \nchoices and set priorities.\n  On the majority of the aspects of the bill, I want to say \nunequivocally I support Senator Bond, the chairman of the committee, \nthe Republican, on his priorities. There are some yellow flashing \nlights related to President Clinton's agenda that I will address in my \nremarks, but we are very much in sync and in alignment with what we \nwant to do. I am particularly grateful for Chairman Bond's efforts \nreflected in this bill to continue many of the initiatives voted by the \nsubcommittee over the past several years when I chaired it.\n  As I said, I wholeheartedly agree with Chairman Bond's attempt also \nto avoid controversial riders this year and to keep out significant new \nlegislative provisions not dealt with by this subcommittee. We have \nessentially said to Democrats and Republicans alike, don't play pin the \ntail on the donkey with this bill, adding controversial riders, and \nalso, if you have new ideas for new initiatives, hey, why not try the \nauthorizing committee for a change and see if we can move legislation \nthat way.\n  There are several things, though, that I really approve of in this \nbill. Both Chairman Bond and myself consider veterans to be a very high \npriority and veterans medical programs to be of special priority. This \nbill restores $300 million worth of cuts assumed in the budget \nagreement and puts them in veterans medical care and also in veterans \nmedical research. Veterans funding remains a key concern of mine, and I \nwill continue to fight to ensure that promises made are promises kept. \nI will also stand sentry to make sure that the Veterans Administration \nmeets its projections in third-party insurance collections that are \ndesigned to help increase medical care spending.\n  This bill also restores several cuts made to key programs at the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. This was restored as the \ncommunity development block grant funds so important to mayors and \nlocal communities, the project HOME, public housing and homeless \nassistance.\n  Also, something I am particularly pleased to work with Chairman Bond \non is we restored the cuts in elderly and disabled housing. When the \nbudget agreement was first proposed, there was a suggestion that this \nparticular area of funding receive $400 million. Senator Bond and I \nagreed we should fully fund it at last year's level and have $839 \nmillion that will go to being able to build housing for the elderly and \nfor the disabled.\n  The Senate bill has also added a modest increase to the Hope 6 \nrevitalization program. This is a program that is very important \nbecause, hopefully, it ends public housing in the way we know it and \nsays that public housing should not be a way of life, but be a way to a \nbetter life. Always where there is compelling need there is often \nsometimes sloppy administration. I concur with the report language \noffered by Senator Bond directing the Government Accounting Office to \ncontinue its analysis of Hope 6 to make sure that the effectiveness of \nthe program is being monitored to ensure that for those receiving Hope \n6 benefits in public housing, which was designed to community build and \nhave work force readiness, the GAO will make sure that the work force \nreadiness aspect is really doing what it should.\n  Then we move on to our very important science programs as well as \nFederal Emergency Management. Thanks to the efforts of this \nsubcommittee, the national space agency, the National Science \nFoundation, and Federal Emergency Management are all funded at the \nPresident's request level. We, on this side of the aisle, say thank \nyou, thank you to Chairman Bond for working with us to make sure that \ncore science programs are funded and Federal Emergency Management \ncontinues to be fit for duty should other people around the United \nStates have to dial 911. I think all of us who watched Hurricane Danny \nwere glad it was downgraded to a tropical storm, but when it hits \nAlabama with over 25 inches of rain in a very short time and you see \npeople carrying out their children and their most precious possessions, \nwe know why FEMA exists.\n  Despite the tight allocation, I am pleased we were able to meet the \nPresident's request for these key agencies while protecting the funding \nin veterans medical care, disaster relief, critical science and space. \nI think America has to be incredibly thrilled with the breakthroughs \nNASA has made as Sojourner continues to roll across Mars. Scientific \ndevelopments, such as the Sojourner, the Hubble telescope, Mission to \nPlanet Earth, are truly special American projects, and show that we are \nNo. 1 in space. FEMA is another agency that is doing a very good job, \nand this critical agency has shown steady improvement in recent years \nin responding to America's natural disasters.\n\n  Madam President, I also want to call to your attention the fact that \nthe administration does have some serious concerns with the reductions \nin this bill. I call these yellow flashing lights. Given the tight \nallocation, I understand that not all the programs could be funded at \nthe President's request. Measures had to be taken, protective measures, \nfor several key programs. That meant that other important initiatives \ncould not be adequately addressed. So, in looking out for veterans' \nmedical care, that meant fulfilling the President's full request for an \n$850 million increase to the EPA budget\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\nsimply was not possible. As a result, the request for a 50-percent \nincrease in the Superfund was not yet met.\n  As you know, the President is a strong advocate of the Superfund. \nThis will be a key issue to resolve during the upcoming weeks while the \nHouse and Senate are in conference on this bill. I really encourage the \nauthorizers, while we are in conference, to try to pass the authorizing \nbill so that the authorizing bill could match, perhaps, what we were \nable to do in conference.\n  Another yellow flashing light is the $146 million reduction to the \nPresident's request for the Corporation for National and Community \nService. This request was to be used for the President's program called \nthe America Reads Challenge. It is to be a national literacy campaign \nto ensure that every child can read, and read well and independently, \nby the third grade. The budget agreement called for funding in this \nprogram. However, it was not funded in either the House or the Senate \nbill.\n  Illiteracy in this country is of great concern for all, and all ages, \nbut, really, if we could make sure every child was immunized by the \ntime they were 2, could read by the time they were in third grade, had \naccess and knew how to use a computer by the time they were 12, we \nwould do a lot about empowering our children. I support the restoration \nof that funding.\n  A third flashing light to the administration is the elimination of \nfunding for the community development financial institutions, something \ncalled CDFI, another program that was protected in the budget \nagreement, which helps to spur business activity and traditionally \nunderserved communities, and is particularly focused on microenterprise \nendeavors that enable women of modest means to be able to move in terms \nof economic development in business. The House bill funded this at $125 \nmillion, and we hope this will be a restoration where there is some \ntype of agreement. This is a high priority of mine during the \nconference.\n  It will be my intent to offer an amendment or perhaps work with \nSenator Bond as we go through the other amendments to see if we could \nnot address the issues of empowerment zones, America Reads, and Federal \nemergency mitigation efforts to see if we could find some funds to be \nable to have a placemarker in this budget going to conference for these \nvery important programs.\n  I do appreciate Chairman Bond's willingness to fund the EPA \nbrownfields request and the inclusion of the report language allowing \nthe HUD-CDBG money to be used for brownfield activities. A concern for \nthe administration is the absence of the request of increase for the \nHUD brownfields program. The brownfields initiative can play a critical \nrole in restoring urban areas. In my own home State of Maryland, in the \nBaltimore metropolitan area alone, we estimate that there are over \n3,000 acres of brownfields in and around our port area which, if we \ncould clean them up, would offer kind of a second version of an \nempowerment zoning.\n  Madam President, given these concerns, I will be offering an \namendment, as I said, that will restore funding, some funding, modest \nfunding, for the America Reads Program under the Corporation for \nNational Service, empowerment zoning in the HUD budget and predisaster \nmitigation for FEMA. I will in no way make an effort to restore full \nfunding for those programs, because it just is not fair. But I will be \nlooking to see what we could do to have a placemarker to go to \nconference.\n  Madam President, there is mixed news in this bill for the \nadministration. Like you, I am interested in producing a final bill \nthat is agreeable and signable. I believe the bill that we have \nproduced is a very good start. In fact, it is an excellent start to \nensuring funding for many of this Nation's vital programs. I will work \nwith my colleagues now on the floor to see how we could accommodate \nthem. I will work with my chairman during conference and continue to \ntry to address the administration's concern.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senator Bond again for his hard work and \nhis willingness to listen to my side of the aisle's concerns and to \nhonor many of the requests made by President Bill Clinton. I am \npleased, when it came to funding like NASA, like the National Science \nFoundation, the funding for Federal Emergency Management, it knew no \nparty, because when we are up there on Sojourner, when we might have to \nbe part of the rescue operation for Mir, when we are doing so many very \nimportant things at the National Science Foundation and helping rescue \nAmericans who have been hit by national disasters, this is not about \nparty. I commend the cooperative nature in which this bill has been \ncrafted. I believe we have produced a bill that can be signed into law \nwith some of the appropriate amendments in conference consideration.\n  Madam President, before I yield the floor, I say to all of my \ncolleagues from my side of the aisle, if you have amendments, please \nlet us know them. We know that between now and 5:15 when we start \nvoting on Treasury, Post Office, it would be enormously useful to \nSenator Bond and myself to know what any amendments are so that we \ncould either work with you to accommodate you or be able to set the \nstage on how we can proceed with this bill. I believe it is Senator \nBond's intention, and I will do my best to cooperate with him, that we \nwill conclude this bill tomorrow at the earliest possible time.\n  Having said that, I look forward to the debate, as always, on this \nbill and, as always, have enjoyed working with my colleague, Senator \nBond. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, when major measures like this are \nconsidered on the floor, it is usually boilerplate for each side to say \nnice things about the counterpart. In the case of the VA-HUD bill--this \nis a very difficult bill--I say without reservation, and not as a \nmatter of mere formality, that one of the great benefits I have in \nworking through a very, very difficult bill is that I have the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland as my ranking member. She has \nhelped me a great deal learn and understand many of the great \nchallenges in this bill from her position as having chaired this \ncommittee. She has presented to us, in very workable fashion, a number \nof the concerns we have been able to meet in this bill, and I really \ncould not be here with this difficult a bill in as good a shape as I \nbelieve it is without her support. It has been absolutely invaluable to \nme to have her assistance and that of her able staff.\n  She mentioned a modest amendment that I look forward to working with \nher to include.\n  I guess my whole concern over this bill--it was with a slight tear in \nmy eye that I read the statement of administration policy from Budget \nDirector Raines. He said some nice things about working with the \ncommittee. On the first page of his letter, he said, ``We urge the \ncommittee to reduce funding for lower priority programs or for programs \nthat would be adequately funded at the requested level and to redirect \nfunding of programs of higher priority.''\n  Unfortunately, we have looked at the programs. We have not funded the \nlower priority programs to the best of our ability. The priority \nfunding that we have included in this bill does reflect the priorities \nof what I hope will be a bipartisan majority of this body. We do have \nthe option when we go to conference, we hope, of increasing the overall \nallocation, so that there will be more funds available, and that we \nwill be able to put some more money in the higher priority programs. \nBut given the nature of the allocation and the many pressing needs, as \nmy ranking member has outlined and as I have outlined, there are not \nlow-priority programs funded in this bill.\n  I note that on the America Reads Program, it has not been authorized. \nWe don't really have any details on it yet. So we were reluctant to go \nforward with the President's full request. When I first heard about it, \nI thought it would be a program that would be funded in Labor-HHS if it \nis a reading program. But I am certainly willing to work with my \nminority colleagues in trying to make some accommodation of the \nPresident's interests there.\n  With respect to the brownfields HUD program, I have said on this \nfloor many times that HUD is a very troubled agency that is having a \ngreat deal of difficulty running the programs it is supposed to run. \nThat is why I am reluctant to give it a new responsibility in the \nenvironmental area. EPA is handling that program. We have included\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\nmoney for the EPA for the brownfields program. We made brownfields \nclean up an eligible activity for the community development block \ngrants, so that communities without an undue benefit, Federal \nbureaucratic interference, might be able to clean up some of them \nthemselves. So we feel that the brownfields program is not one that \nought to be added to HUD's already too-full plate.\n  After speaking briefly with my ranking member, I join with her in \nurging our colleagues to bring forward the amendments. We hope to know \nby 10 o'clock tomorrow what amendments are pending. We want to be \naccommodating. We want to accommodate our colleagues if they do have \namendments and, if possible, we would try to accommodate them. If we \nsimply do not see the resources available, we would like to move \nexpeditiously to a vote on it, if that is required. I am most \nencouraged by the optimistic thought that we could finish this very \nimportant bill by not too late tomorrow. I am from Missouri and it is \nthe ``show me'' State. I will believe it when we have final passage. \nBut I commit to working with the ranking member and all of my \ncolleagues.\n  In the past, we have been swamped at the end with a large number of \ncolloquies and senses of the Senate. I have found, through very painful \nexperiences, that I need to read those and make sure that we have time \nto consider them fully on both sides. So if colloquies or other \nnoncontroversial items are to be inserted, it would be of great help to \nme and I would appreciate it, as my ranking member would, if we could \nsee those colloquies as soon as possible, so we will be able to give \nthem full consideration.\n  Now, Madam President, I had hopes that one of our very distinguished \ncolleagues would be able to be over this afternoon. We heard that \nSenator Glenn might wish to come and talk about the space station. We \nare open and we are ready to do business. We will be more than happy to \nentertain any measures. If any colleagues have an amendment that may \nneed to go to a voice vote, we would like very much to lay it down \ntoday. We have both the time from now until 5:15 and then after the \nvotes to do it. It is the request, I believe, of the leaders that we \nmove forward. If there is an amendment that we can debate and set for a \nvote tomorrow morning, we would like very much to do so.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I, too, am looking forward to the \nstatement on the space program of our distinguished colleague from \nOhio. I have been advised by his staff that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio is in a meeting and hopes to join us perhaps around 4. In the \nmeantime, if any other Senators have statements they wish to make, they \ncould do that, and this might be a good time to offer an amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, if there is anything that sets this country \napart from other nations around the world, it seems to me it would be \nour, almost our innate curiosity, our questing spirit that led people \nnot only to explore geographically, but led them to explore in the \nlaboratories of our Nation and express our curiosity in learning new \nthings. That is at the heart of science, learning the new and putting \nit to use. We could run through a whole gamut of things in history. We \ncould talk all night tonight about different things that have \nrevolutionized our way of doing things on Earth.\n  The Wright brothers were curious about whether we could fly or not, \nwhether you could get the air to react enough off an airfoil so you \ncould fly--and they were ridiculed for it. Some people said, ``If God \nwanted us to fly, why, he would have made feathers on us so we could \nfly.'' Their curiosity led to airplanes and the aviation industry and \nchanged the nature of the whole world. You can say the same thing about \ncuriosity about the internal combustion engine and automobiles and \ncommunications and how we transmit sounds from one place to another--\nthe telephone, the Bells--computers and plastics and TV and nuclear \nenergy and agricultural research.\n  We never think of agriculture in this country as being such an \nexample of basic research, yet, just in my own lifetime, the corn \nproduction in Ohio has gone from about 48 bushels per acre to something \nlike 137 on the average and, in some places, going close to 240 bushels \nan acre in certain selected spots. That is just enormous. That did not \noccur because people are working three or four times as hard. It \noccurred because of basic, fundamental research, people curious about \nsoil and about fertilizer and seeds and hybrids and so on. We can go on \nwith antibiotics and anatomy and physiology and all the things we know \nin medicine these days. We could talk for many hours about where this \nquesting, curious nature that we have in this country has led us.\n  Part of the bill before us here involves the NASA budget. An area \nwhere we, as a nation, are expressing our curious, questing nature, is \nin the area of space and space research. Every year we are asked why do \nwe invest billions of taxpayer dollars for space exploration and \nresearch. There is one very short answer to it. In my view, we do it is \nto benefit people right here on Earth. This has been true for the whole \nprogram. It was true ever since I was involved in the space program \nmany years ago, during Project Mercury and our first orbital flights. \nThere are a number of examples of research connected just with the \nspace program, and particularly with the space shuttle experiments, \nthat I think everyone can relate to.\n  We will have applied science and scientific research going on through \nthe years with the international space station project. Every year we \ndebate this on the floor. Fortunately, to my way of thinking, we have \ncontinued to fund the space station. It is one of the greatest \nscientific engineering cooperative efforts in the history of this \nworld. We have a number of things that are being looked into now on the \nshuttle that could be done better and longer term on the international \nspace station when it comes along. Parts of it will start being put up \nat the end of next year. But a lot of things that have come out of the \nshuttle program so far are of very, very practical use right here on \nEarth.\n  One experiment that I find most intriguing is protein crystal growth. \nIt is fascinating. It brings a whole new input to medicine, to the \nthousands of different proteins and combinations that make up our \nbodies and literally stands to transform the way medicine looks at \nitself and the way we treat disease and what we can do with regard to \nimmunities.\n  Let me give just one example. We have a chart here I would like to \nhave put up that shows what is going on with treating flu. A flu remedy \nis being developed with space-grown crystals, where you can better find \nout how the flu bug itself reacts. The loss of productivity due to flu \nis staggering. Its costs range as much as $20 billion a year. There are \nhigh-mutation rates of the flu virus. New data from the protein \ncrystals grown in space and on Earth have unlocked the secret of the \nflu bug and revealed its Achilles heel. The secret lies in a small \nmolecule which is attached to the host cell's surface and each flu \nvirus, no matter what strain, must remove this small molecule to escape \nthe host cell to spread infection.\n  But using data from space and Earth-grown crystals, researchers from \nthe Center of Macromolecular Crystallography are designing drugs to \nbind with this protein's active site, in other words, the lock on this \nsite. This lock-and-key reduces the spread of flu in the body by \nblocking its escape route.\n  In collaboration with its corporate partner, the CMC, the Center of \nMacromolecular Crystallography, has refined drug structure in \npreparation for clinical trials, and those clinical trials are \nstarting. When tested and approved, relief is expected from flu \nepidemics by the year 2004. I give some detail on that because I think \nit is an example of the kinds of things that are underway that we can \ndirectly relate to the space program. We have some 20 to 40 million \npeople every year that get\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\nthe flu, and it causes some 20,000 deaths a year in the United States \nalone. This new data of space-grown crystals has helped unlock a secret \nto let us treat flu in a different way. That is just one example.\n  Another example that can benefit from these same kinds of space-grown \ncrystals is trauma from open-heart surgery, which often may lead to \ncomplications due to massive inflammation of heart tissue. Factor D is \na protein which plays a key role in the biological steps that activate \nthis immune response. Being able to block factor D's effects could \nenable heart surgery patients to recover more rapidly, and data from \nspace-grown crystals allowed researchers to develop inhibitors which \nspecifically block factor D. This drug is being readied for clinical \ntrials.\n  We have a new antiparasite drug from space-grown crystals. It is \nestimated that over 1 billion people in this world are infected with a \nround worm known as ascarids. It is a tiny parasite that infects the \nintestinal tract of vertebrates and is often fatal. Ascarids are \ndependent on a substance called malic enzyme to function properly. A \nnew drug, developed in part by Upjohn, with the benefit of crystals \ngrown on the USML-1 Spacelab mission, should interfere with normal \nfunctioning of malic enzyme and, thus, prove deadly to ascarids.\n  Another example: Space crystals and the fight on AIDS. A new \ncombination of drugs, which include protease inhibitors, have proven \nimmensely successful in treating AIDS. In an ongoing experiment with \nDuPont Merck, NASA has crystallized HIV protease enzyme with an \ninhibitor to support structure-based drug design research, and the \nresulting drugs could represent the second generation of this \nsuccessful approach to treating this disease.\n  This chart shows some of the details. I don't know whether the \ncameras will pick this up well enough to show the interaction. This is \nsomething that gives real hope in the treatment of AIDS in the future.\n  Another example on a different chart here indicates how diabetes \npatients may benefit from NASA's bioreactor research. The bioreactor is \na tissue culturing instrument which allows microgravity researchers to \ngrow tissues which are larger and more complex than other tissue \nculturing techniques. The bioreactor has the potential for changing \ndisease treatment through tissue transplants.\n  Forthcoming experiments plan to grow human pancreatic islet cells in \nthe bioreactor for possible transplantation into diabetic patients. \nTrial runs with this technique have proven successful. If the upcoming \nexperiments are successful, diabetic patients will not need to rely as \nheavily on insulin injections and will have less complications from \ntheir disease.\n  Another chart: Modeling colon cancer with bioreactor. Mr. President, \n166,000 cases of colon cancer are diagnosed each year in the United \nStates, and it is a leading cause of death. Colon cancer tissue grown \nin a bioreactor develops remarkably similar to tumors extracted from \nhumans. Studying these tissues outside the human body may allow \nresearchers to understand how cancer spreads, as well as identifying \nnew therapies which may prevent it.\n  This bioreactor is a fascinating thing. It lets tissues be cultured \nin the same way they occur in the human body. If you go into a \nlaboratory and try to do experiments there, quite often the experiment \nbecomes far more two-dimensional because it wants to settle to the \nbottom of the petri dish. A bioreactor in space, with all the right \nfluids that simulate the body, allows growth in a 3-D situation. They \ncan be studied better so possible antidotes for them or possible \ntreatments can be put into a culture there that is very similar to what \nis in the human body. It is not just something that is flattened out in \nthe bottom of an experimental glass in the laboratory.\n\n  Growing cartilage with the bioreactor is another potential \napplication. An application of the bioreactor is culturing cartilage \ntissue for replacement and transplantation. Experiments with the \nbioreactor and space indicates it can successfully culture cartilage \ntissue that is quite similar to human cartilage.\n  I use these few examples today just to illustrate that they are very, \nvery practical and very, very useful for our future on Earth. The \ninternational space station will make it possible to continue some of \nthe same experiments for longer periods of time. I know that every year \nwhen we have the budget battles on the floor, we have attempts made to \ncut out some of the money for the international space station, which \nwould cut out some of the scientific inquiry that we otherwise would be \nable to perform. Let me talk about it very briefly.\n  NASA has already had some 1,000 or more proposals per year for \nground-based and flight investigations involving the international \nspace station project. Selection of principal investigators and \ncommercial developers is beginning this year for flights starting in \n1999, and this population will increase from 650 to 850 principal \ninvestigators and from 100 to 200 industrial affiliates by the time the \nstation assembly is complete.\n  About 650 life and microgravity sciences principal investigators are \nnow participating at over 100 institutions of higher learning around \nthe country, and the number of investigators is expected to grow to \nover 850 before assembly is completed. These researchers, in turn, \nemploy about 1,400 graduate students at present, with that number \nexpected to grow.\n  What are they looking into? Well, a number of different areas, and I \nwon't be able to go into all of them today. Biotechnology with an x ray \ndiffraction system, for instance. Microgravity allows researchers to \nproduce superior protein crystals, which I mentioned a moment ago, for \ndrug development and to grow three-dimensional tissues, including \ncancer tumors, for research and cartilage for possible transplant.\n  The long-term benefits: to provide information to design a new class \nof drugs to target specific proteins and cure specific diseases; to \nculture tissue for use in cancer research and surgery in bone and \ncartilage injury.\n  Another area that can be looked into on the international space \nstation also is in the area of materials science. Researchers use low \ngravity to advance our understanding of the relationships among the \nstructure, the processing and the properties of physical materials.\n  The long-term benefits: We advance the understanding of processes for \nmanufacturing semiconductors, metals, ceramics, polymers, and other \nmaterials. We also determine fundamental physical properties of molten \nmetal, semiconductors, and other materials with precision impossible on \nEarth.\n  There are a number of people involved in this, people from the State \nUniversity of New York, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and MIT up in \nBoston. Researchers indicate great progress from this new research tool \nin having projects in space in microgravity.\n  Another area being looked into, and this one is a fascinating one, is \ncombustion science, fluids and combustion facility, glove-box \nexperiments, as they are called. Scientists are using low gravity to \nsimplify the study of complex combustion processes, burning processes. \nSince combustion is used to produce 85 percent of Earth's energy, even \nsmall improvements in efficiency will have large environmental and \neconomic benefits.\n  The long-term benefits: Improved control of combustion emissions and \npollutants reduce risk from incineration of hazardous wastes and \nenhance efficiency of combustion processes.\n\n  These are only highlights of some of the prestation research that \nhave already occurred. Dr. Robert Cheng and Dr. Larry Kostiuk, \ncombustion science researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \nunder contract to NASA, were awarded a patent for a ring flame \nstabilizer, which significantly reduces pollution from natural gas \nburners. Fitted into an off-the-shelf home heating surface, the device \nreduces nitrogen oxide emissions by a factor of 10 by increasing \nefficiency by 2 percent, and the device can be readily sized to \nindustrial scales. That kind of experiment will continue on the space \nstation.\n  ``Almost every chapter in the combustion textbooks will be rewritten \nas a result of the microgravity work,'' said Prof. Howard Palmer, \nprofessor emeritus at Penn State University. And other statements by \nother scientists say the same thing.\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\n  Furthermore, the international space station will continue research \ninto fundamental physics. Scientists use low gravity to test \nfundamental theories of physics with degrees of accuracy that far \nexceed the capacity of earthbound science. Physics and low gravity \nexpand our understanding of changes in the state of matter, including \nthose changes responsible for high-temperature superconductivity.\n  The long-term benefits will challenge and expand our theories of how \nmatter organizes as it changes state, and that is especially important \nin understanding superconductivity and its advantages. We can also test \nthe theory of relativity with precision beyond the capacity of \nearthbound science.\n  Scientists will study gravity's influence on the development, the \ngrowth and the internal processes of plants and animals, and their \nresults expand fundamental knowledge to benefit medical, agricultural, \nand other industries.\n  The long-term benefits will improve the overall health of people of \nall ages. It can improve plants for agriculture and for forestry, and \nwe will gain an advanced understanding of cell behavior.\n  Biomedical research in space will provide unique insights into such \nthings as how the heart and lungs function, the growth and maintenance \nof muscle and bone, perception cognition, and balance, the whole area \nof neuroscience, and the regulation of the body's many systems, called \nregulatory physiology.\n  The long-term benefits will assist in developing methods to keep \nhumans healthy in low-gravity environments for long, long periods of \ntime; advance new fields of research in the treatment of diseases; \nenhance medical understanding of the role of force on bone in disease \nprocesses, including osteoporosis; advance fundamental understanding of \nthe brain and nervous system and help develop new methods to prevent \nand treat various neurological disorders. These are the long-term \nbenefits.\n  I quote a friend and one of the most respected surgeons in this \ncountry--as a matter of fact, in the world--Dr. Michael DeBakey, \nchancellor and chairman of the department of surgery, Baylor College of \nMedicine, who said:\n\n       The space station is not a luxury any more than a medical \n     research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury. \n     Present technology on the shuttle allows for stays in space \n     of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to \n     only few hours in the laboratory and expect cures for \n     cancer. We need much longer missions in space--in months \n     to years--to obtain research results that may lead to the \n     development of new knowledge and breakthroughs.\n  We also can either look out into space or, from an observation point \nin space aboard a spacecraft, the international space station, look \nback toward Earth. That is planned with the Earth Observation and Space \nScience, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, and SAGE to be deployed in \n2001.\n  The space station will be a unique platform with multiple exterior \nattach points from which to observe the Earth and the universe.\n  Conceptualized by Nobel prizewinning scientist Dr. Sam Ting, of MIT, \nthe alpha magnetic spectrometer experiment will search the universe for \nantimatter and ``dark'' matter in an attempt to prove cosmological \ntheory with direct evidence.\n  Also, the stratospheric aerosol and gas experiment, SAGE-III, will \nalso be delivered. It will obtain global profiles of aerosols, ozone, \nwater vapor, and oxides in order to determine their role in \nclimatological processes. It will allow cross-correlation of \nobservations from SAGE's I and II at different latitudes and different \ntime periods.\n  I cite these examples to briefly indicate what a wide variety of \nscientific effort will go on with the international space station.\n  Now, let me address these next remarks to two sets of people who may \nbe watching or listening here today. How many of you are over 60 years \nof age? If you are not over 60 years of age I know that each of you \nhopes to live to be 60 or older. What I am about to say I believe is \nvery relevant to you.\n  For several years now NASA and the National Institute on Aging, which \nis part of the National Institutes of Health, have been working on some \nprojects looking at what happens to astronauts in space.\n  I became intrigued with this, and I have long been interested in \nissues associated with our aging population. In fact, when I first came \nto the Senate--I was sworn in in January 1975--I asked to be assigned \nto the Special Committee on Aging because I thought there was so much \nwork needed to be done.\n  Today, we find an aging population sometimes referred to as the \ngraying of nations. I conducted hearings years ago on the graying of \nnations, and then had additional Governmental Affairs Committee \nhearings in New York called the Graying of Nations II. Dr. Robert \nButler assisted in putting together those hearings. He was the first \nDirector of the National Institute on Aging and did a superb job in \ngetting that whole agency started.\n  Nearly 45 million Americans today are 60 years of age or older. The \ndemographic experts tell us that that is projected to grow to about 100 \nmillion over the next 50 years, by the year 2050. NASA has begun to \nformally explore the similarities between the aging process and what \nhappens to astronauts in microgravity. There are physical changes that \noccur in space and the National Institute on Aging has been very \ninterested in and has worked with NASA to review these changes. They \nare in the process now of coming up with very specific proposals as \nspecific experiments.\n  But there is a great similarity between what happens to astronauts in \nthe short term--it starts 3 to 5 days after they have been up there on \ncurrent missions--and what happens to the elderly right here on Earth \nby the normal process of aging. This is fascinating because of the \nsimilarities in osteoporosis, for instance, changes in bone density, \nchanges in orthostatic intolerance--in other words, the ability of the \nbody to keep blood in the upper part of the body so you do not just \nblack out--the vestibular and balance problems, sleep disturbances, \ndecrease in muscle strength, the decrease in immune response, and \nsimilar changes in cardiac activity and blood glucose.\n  Now, these changes occur in the younger astronauts in space right \nwhen they go up today. They occur during the first 3 to 5 days, or are \nnoticeable, as I understand them, in the tests that have been run. At \nthe end of the flight when they come back to Earth, the younger \nastronauts return to normal, their bodies recover, their bone structure \nis basically reformed again. They recover from it.\n\n  Now, in the elderly here on Earth there is not that same kind of \nrecovery. But what the National Institute on Aging and NIH is looking \ninto with NASA is to propose experiments to see what happens if you did \nput an older person into space. What would happen? Would the changes \nthat happen to the younger astronauts be additive to the older \nastronaut or would that person be semi-immune from those same changes?\n  Would the change be to the same degree? What happens when you come \nback to Earth again? With these changes, would the older astronaut \nrecover as fast as the younger ones? If not, why not? In other words, \nthe questions being asked are basically what triggers these different \nsystems and why do they change? Why do they change in microgravity? Why \ndo they change in orbit? Would they change the same for an older person \nas they do for the younger people? I think this is a fascinating field. \nI am very hopeful that NASA and NIA will formalize this program \nprimarily for the potentially enormous benefit that may come from it \nfor hundreds of millions of people, not just people in this country, \nbut people literally all over the world, and also because I can think \nof no more powerful and essentially untapped constituency for human \nresearch in space than the elderly.\n  I will say a few words about the importance of international \ncooperation in space research, also.\n  If you had told me some 35 years ago when I made my flight back in \n1962 that in June 1997, a U.S. astronaut would be beginning the 16th \nmonth of continuous U.S. presence on a Russian space station, I \ncertainly would not have believed it.\n  As a veteran of the cold war and the space race, I guess I could not \nbe more pleased to see this kind of progress. Obviously, there is \ntremendous symbolic value when former enemies work together \ncooperatively. But symbolism\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\nisn't the most important reason we cooperate. Again, it gets back to \nbasic research. The quality of research is going to improve if we have \nthe best and the brightest from 15 nations working on a project.\n  The shuttle-Mir program, also called phase I of the international \nspace station, is a perfect example of the benefits of such \ncooperation. As many of you know, this program consists of nine \nshuttle-Mir docking missions. The program is helping both the United \nStates and Russia learn countless valuable lessons which will be put to \nuse on the international space station.\n  Now, obviously, the Mir space station has been having problems. We \nare aware of those from the daily news. Some problems are due to aging \ncomponents of the station; some may have been due to crew or ground \ncontrol errors. We will see what NASA and the Russian space agency \nleadership will recommend.\n  Usually, for both the Russians and the Americans, space operations \nhave been nearly flawless. For example, just a few days ago, the crew \nof STS-89 returned from a 16-day science mission which appears to have \nexceeded all expectations for scientific data.\n  I would like to remind people of two things. First, space travel and \nresearch is still a risky and technologically complex undertaking. \nThings do not always go right. We are dealing with new fields of power \nand speed. There are going to be times when things do not always go \nright. So it would be completely inappropriate for us at the first sign \nof serious trouble to cut and run.\n  Second, NASA emphasizes safety above all else. No one has ever \nintentionally put our astronauts in unsafe or hazardous conditions. \nQuite the opposite. I know from firsthand experience our astronauts are \ntrained to handle emergencies of all sorts that can be foreseen.\n  Some have suggested that before we send another astronaut to Mir, \nNASA must certify to Congress that it has done everything possible to \nmake it safe. I find that an insult to NASA, because that has been \ntheir primary objective all the way through the whole program. For \nCongress to require that NASA had to certify it has done everything \npossible to make it safe before we would have another astronaut sent to \nMir was about as unnecessary as anything I have seen since I have been \naround here. I think such a certification would be an insult to the men \nand women who work on this program every day. No one at NASA \nintentionally ever takes risks with people's lives. But space flight is \nrisky, and we have to accept that.\n\n  I do not know whether people realize the speeds involved up there. I \nmeet with school groups quite often. I find them amazed when you say, \nwell, we have to travel nearly 18,000 miles an hour just to stay in \norbit up there. That is true. But that is such a large number, it does \nnot mean much until you ask the same students, ``What is 5 miles from \nyour school? Is the mall 5 miles from your home?'' It seems the mall \nhas an attraction for a lot of the young people these days. To make \nthat 5 miles trip in a spacecraft would take just 1 second. To stay in \norbit you are traveling about 4.8 miles per second--per second. And \nwhen you come back in and start hitting the atmosphere again with the \nspacecraft, there is tremendous heat buildup just from the friction of \nthe atmosphere, ionized layers out ahead that get up around 9,000 or \n10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and surface temperatures of, say, somewhere \naround 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  We confront many challenges we have come to take for granted almost \nthat we can meet the challenge successfully. We have done it amazingly \nsuccessfully throughout the history of the space program. It has not \nbeen perfect. So to think that it is going to be perfect is just a \nwish.\n  Even if we were forced to curtail the Mir activity, we have already \nlearned a tremendous amount from the seven shuttle flights that have \nbeen made to that station.\n  Let me just enumerate a few of the accomplishments.\n  Most importantly, we have conducted countless joint science \nexperiments in a variety of disciplines.\n  American astronauts have maintained a continuous presence in space \nfor nearly 470 days.\n  We have successfully conducted six shuttle-Mir docking missions, with \nthree more missions for the future.\n  Russian and American engineers, astronauts and cosmonauts, in \nperforming joint operations, have developed mutual understanding in \noriginally dissimilar design philosophies and established close rapport \nbetween counterparts of the two different cultures. That is important \nfor the future.\n  We have learned to plan and execute a typical shuttle mission to a \nspace station.\n  We have verified and developed rendezvous and docking procedures.\n  We have conducted joint ground and mission control operations.\n  We have learned to transport and exchange supplies.\n  We have developed joint extra-vehicular activities.\n  We are testing schedules for long-duration Mir and short-duration \nshuttle crew work rest cycles during the docked and undocked phases of \nmissions.\n  We are jointly resolving safety and acceptance testing differences.\n  And we are developing in-flight training protocols.\n  Most importantly, we are working together on joint research projects.\n  These accomplishments place us in an excellent position for \ninitiating and conducting the assembly and subsequent operation of the \ninternational space station with reduced risk, with greater confidence \nand reduced learning curve expenditures in time and costs. The only \nother way to gain this experience would be to wait until assembly of \nthe ISS and then learn, and that is a little late.\n  Now all of this is leading up to construction and operation of the \ninternational space station. Let me show just a couple of charts here. \nThis effort will be the largest peacetime international science \ncollaboration in the history of this world. These international \npartners will include Canada, Japan, Russia, Britain, Italy, France, \nGermany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, and \nSwitzerland.\n  On-orbit weight will be 470 tons, and almost 20 percent of that, over \n85 tons, of hardware has already been built.\n  This is an example of one piece of hardware now, one of the modules \nright here. When built it will have some 43,000 cubic feet of \npressurized volume, which is the equivalent of a 747.\n  When you think about the number of scientific breakthroughs that can \ncome from such an orbiting laboratory as this, it is sort of mind \nboggling.\n  I want to remind everyone of the critical importance of spreading the \nword about the benefits of human space flight. I hope staffs listening \nin the offices as well as Senators may go back to our communities in \nour States and find new outlets or organizations which may not have \nconsidered the significant impact which space research has had and \ncould have and will have on their lives. If we can just invigorate and \nsustain such an effort I am very confident that the shuttle Mir and the \ninternational space station will merely be steppingstones to a much \ngreater future.\n  I have asked NASA to put together, if they can, a compilation of the \nof the scientific research projects that have gone on on each one of \nthose shuttle flights. I hope I can get that this evening so we can put \nthat in the Record tomorrow because I think it will show the diverse \nnature of the scientific experiments, some of the breakthroughs that \nhave occurred because of those experiments, and I think that is the \nbest way to show what has happened in the shuttle program and the \npotential that gives for the international space station.\n  We have some other pictures of the space station that is already put \ntogether and is being worked on. This shows a technician working on \nthis particular hatch. This shows two of the modules here that are \nalready built, already tested out, and we have one unit that is \nundergoing tests down at the cape right now.\n  This shows another view of what is being done. This is not something \nthat is theoretical into the future. It is being done right now.\n  This is a picture of some of the testing area where the hardware is \nbeing checked out. The hardware is roughly, as I said, almost 20 \npercent complete right now. Now, that 470 tons will be the final size \nof the vehicle once it is up there.\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\n  I see this as an extension of the best that our country has to offer \nin the way of science and research and the questing nature of our \npeople that have given us a standard of civilization beyond anything \nthe world has ever seen. We have been a Nation that did not just say we \nwill live on the Atlantic shore on the coastal plain. We moved beyond \nthat to the Ohio River, to the Mississippi and on to the Plains.\n  I read into the Record last year, and I may bring it to the floor \nagain tomorrow, the statement by Daniel Webster, who for all his other \nbrilliance was a skeptic, sometimes, and had a rather myopic vision. \nWhen they were considering buying lands west of the Mississippi from \nSpain or Mexico, Daniel Webster was against it and he rose and said \nwords to the effect of ``What use can this area west of the Mississippi \nbe, this area of cactus and prairie dogs, of blowing sand, of mountains \nwith snow, impenetrable snow, to their base? Mr. President, I will not \nvote 1 cent from the public Treasury to move the Pacific coast 1 inch \nnearer Boston than it now is.''\n\n  That may show somewhat of a myopic view of even such a learned person \nas Daniel Webster, but it does. And that is repeated somewhat today by \npeople who say, ``What is the possible value of this?'' The possible \nvalue is clear in just a few of the things I have mentioned here today. \nWe have whole catalogs that have come out, things that have benefited \nscience, research, medicine, and engineering in this country, and they \nare continuing. That is what this is about.\n  For the first time we will have some 15 nations involved in an \ninternational space station, working together instead of preparing to \nfight each other, working together using the best brains out of each of \nthose countries to do research that is of benefit to people all over \nthis Earth. That is the importance of it.\n  Some years ago when people would rise on this floor and say what \npossible benefit can it be, we now have a good story to tell them. It \nis a success story that every single American can be very, very proud \nof.\n  I am happy to be supporting the station. I presume we will have some \namendments proposed on the floor that will change some of the program \nand the way it is outlined. I hope we will not approve those. I think \nthe program has been revamped now. It is very well thought out. It is \nbeing done at about the cheapest we can possibly do it and still keep \nsafety paramount, which is No. 1.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a \npaper, ``Microgravity Research and Exploration'' provided by the NASA \nOffice of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Microgravity Research and Exploration\n\n       In the mid-20th Century human ventures into space have \n     ushered in a new era of exploration and defined a new field \n     of research using gravity as a variable. In turn, this \n     research has led to exciting discoveries on how profoundly \n     gravity affects all elements of life on this planet and \n     beyond. Over the years unexpected connections have been made \n     between the findings in microgravity and the many physical, \n     chemical and biological processes here on Earth, opening new \n     vistas for understanding ourselves and our world. These \n     findings have wide-ranging applications from medicine to \n     understanding weather patterns, contributing to economic \n     growth and vitality here on Earth.\n       These findings also serve as a sound foundation for future \n     human and robotic exploration and for settling new worlds in \n     the 21st Century. The International Space Station is the \n     first truly multinational effort by the people on Earth to \n     conduct a final rehearsal in low Earth orbit before spreading \n     into space on a new and exciting quest for the origins of \n     life.\n       Gravity is a force that has profoundly shaped the evolution \n     of all living things. Gravity and its effects drive or \n     constrain the fundamental physical, chemical, and biological \n     processes that surround us. It is the basic force against \n     which every living organism on Earth must work. Gravity gives \n     us our sense of balance, guides the development of our bones \n     and muscles, and challenges our hearts to pump blood against \n     its constant downward pull. Space flight gives humankind the \n     ability to control gravity as an experimental variable for \n     the first time in the history of science. With the control of \n     gravity, we gain a whole new perspective on the physical \n     world and on the world of living things.\n\n\n                        historical perspectives\n\n       The human crew member has been an integral element of the \n     U.S. and Russian space programs since their inception. The \n     harsh environment of space has posed a number of critical \n     challenges for the protection of humans, planning for \n     missions, and the execution of experiments.1,2,3 \n     The role of the human has grown as space missions and \n     programs have increased in duration and complexity. \n     Initially, the goal was to demonstrate man's ability to \n     survive in space. During the 1960s astronauts served mainly \n     as observers and backup operators to ground control \n     personnel. The Gemini and Vostok missions built on the \n     achievements of Mercury and Voskhod, and provided a technical \n     and biomedical foundation for the Apollo lunar landing and \n     Salyut space station programs. The Apollo missions required a \n     broad biomedical support program, including provisions for \n     in-flight illness. Like Gemini, the Apollo millions yielded \n     significant findings on human physiology in space, but few \n     insights into the effects of the space environment on \n     physical and chemical processes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Endnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In the early 1970s Skylab provided the first opportunity to \n     study human adaption to microgravity over extended periods of \n     time, allowing researchers to identify those physiological \n     changes that are self-limiting. For the first time in the \n     history of space flight modest microgravity experiments were \n     conducted--the role of astronaut was expanded to that of \n     scientist/investigator. It is worth noting that during the \n     1970s many more experiments were executed in drop towers, \n     parabolic aircraft and suborbital robotic missions.\n       Since 1981 the reusable Space Shuttle has provided routine \n     access to Earth orbit, expanded the space program to include \n     investigators from industry and academia, and for the first \n     time in the history of experimentation provided an \n     exceptional platform for microgravity research. In 1994 an \n     agreement between NASA and the Russian Space Agency allowed \n     for the deployment of US research hardware on the Russian MIR \n     space station for experimentation by NASA astronauts. Similar \n     experiments to Space Shuttle missions are conducted on this \n     platform but in a more constrained fashion.\n\n\n                            results to date\n\n       Since 1981 an unprecedented amount of scientific data has \n     been accumulated from space research that has revolutionized \n     our understanding of the nature and action of gravity on \n     physical and biological processes. To date the Space Shuttle \n     has flown approximately 720 days in space, of which 120 days \n     were dedicated to microgravity research. NASA astronauts have \n     flown 970 days on MIR with a total of 160 days dedicated to \n     microgravity experiments.\n\n\n research with benefits to industrial processes and earth applications\n\n       Despite the relatively brief duration of actual research in \n     the life and physical sciences on orbit to date, numerous \n     applications have already been identified and acted on by the \n     private sector. These have been based on both scientific \n     findings as well as technological advances. Today, a \n     significant fraction of NASA's microgravity research program \n     is already conducted with substantial financial support from \n     other agencies and from industry, and we expect that \n     contribution to grow.\n       Scientists have successfully used the low gravity \n     environment of space to understand and control gravity's \n     influence on the formation of materials including metals, \n     semiconductors, polymers and glasses. For example, space \n     research has produced cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) \n     crystals that have 50 times lower levels of a key defect than \n     the best commercially available crystals. These experiments \n     help researchers to verify mathematical models for \n     semiconductor crystal growth to improve semiconductor \n     fabrication on Earth. There have been many theories and \n     mathematical models developed to predict the formation and \n     development of dendrites, the tree-like structures that are \n     the building blocks of most metal products. On Earth, \n     gravity's effects limit the power of experiments to validate \n     these fundamental theories. The Isothermal Dendritic Growth \n     Experiment flown aboard the Space Shuttle has become the \n     scientific benchmark for testing our theoretical \n     understanding of metal formation.\\4\\\n       Another field in which microgravity research continues to \n     make major contributions is combustion science. Combustion is \n     a highly complex process involving many factors, such as: the \n     physical flow of fuel and oxygen; the chemical conversion \n     of fuel and oxygen into heat and chemical products and the \n     transfer of heat. In many cases, combustion processes are \n     so complex that scientists have difficulty developing \n     accurate, complete models for them. By significantly \n     reducing gravity's effects, scientists are studying subtle \n     aspects of combustion that are often hidden. Research to \n     date has demonstrated that gravity has a profound effect \n     on combustion phenomena, with microgravity conditions \n     leading to behaviors never before observed. Because \n     combustion is so widely used for energy production and \n     transportation, our growing knowledge of gravity's role in \n     combustion phenomena holds the promise of improving the \n     efficiency of a wide range of everyday technology, with \n     potentially far reaching economic effects. For example, a \n     patented ring flame stabilizer device has been developed \n     by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\n[[Page S7761]]\n\n     based on the results of microgravity combustion research. \n     This device--applicable to residential furnaces and water \n     heaters--reduces emissions of nitrous oxides by a factor \n     of five over existing devices, while increasing overall \n     efficiency by 2%.\n       Closely related to combustion science is fluid physics, a \n     field in which researchers study the behavior of liquids, \n     gases and mixtures. In microgravity, scientists observe \n     aspects of fluid behavior that are difficult or impossible to \n     understand in normal gravity. Microgravity enables scientists \n     to create physical models of important processes and make \n     observations that would be impossible on Earth. For example, \n     results from microgravity research have provided the only \n     controlled experimental observations of the convective \n     motions in physical models of planetary and stellar \n     atmospheres, laying a foundation for scientific understanding \n     of the nonlinear dynamics of planetary and stellar flows, and \n     giving us new insights into the dynamics of the sun and \n     gaseous planets.\\5\\ A new technique for stereo imaging \n     velocimetry to measure fluid flows in space experiments \n     developed by Lewis Research Center has found application in \n     the US industry, where it is being used to quantify fluid \n     flows in the steel casting process.\n       Use of the microgravity environment has allowed researchers \n     to design experiments that achieve a measurement accuracy not \n     possible in the gravity environment of Earth. Areas of \n     investigation include research on general relativity, \n     critical phenomena, laser cooling for ultra-precise \n     measurement of atomic electronic properties, as well as other \n     thermophysical measurements of interest in condensed-matter \n     physics. For example, space flight research has been used to \n     confirm with unprecedented accuracy the validity of a Nobel \n     prize-winning theory describing the conditions under which \n     matter will change between different states, such as from \n     liquid to gas or from conductor to superconductor.\\6\\\n\n\n                    Research with Benefits to Health\n\n       Microgravity provides researchers with new tools to address \n     two fundamental issues in biotechnology: the growth of high-\n     quality crystals for X-ray diffraction studies of large \n     proteins, and the growth of three-dimensional tissue samples \n     in laboratory cultures. Gravity plays central roles in each \n     of these processes and NASA research is providing access to \n     new data and techniques to the broader biotechnology \n     community.\n       NASA's bioreactor, developed to simulate low gravity, has \n     proven dramatically successful as an advanced cell culturing \n     technology. This success has led to an extensive \n     collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \n     Work with NASA bioreactors at the NIH has already produced \n     advanced cultures of lymph tissue for studying the \n     infectivity of HIV. Other areas of outstanding success \n     include cultures of cancer tumors and cartilage.\\7\\ Initial \n     results of tissue culture research on the MIR space station \n     are very positive and suggest the possibility of major \n     advances in tissue culturing once the International Space \n     Station becomes available.\n       Biotechnology researchers also use microgravity to produce \n     protein crystals for drug research that are superior to \n     crystals that can be grown on Earth. Already researchers have \n     produced crystal samples of proteins important to the study \n     of AIDS, emphysema, influenza, diabetes and other \n     diseases.\\8\\ Recently, researchers using space grown crystals \n     determined the highest resolution structure for insulin \n     published to date. By studying the structure and function of \n     insulin, scientists hope to produce improved drugs for \n     diabetics.\n       Life is, of course, dependent on many of the same physical \n     processes I have already discussed. Convection, \n     sedimentation, and buoyancy are features of complex, living \n     systems as well as nonliving systems. But life possesses \n     additional properties--such as adaptation to maintain \n     homeostasis, and evolutionary development in response to \n     environmental factors--that are also affected by gravity.\n       We are now demonstrating that microgravity can be used as a \n     model to study some aspects of the aging process here on \n     Earth. Indeed, astronauts experience bone and muscle loss, \n     inability to maintain balance, posture, gait, and blood \n     pressure, and changes in the general metabolism that mimic \n     some of the symptoms of aging. Thus, microgravity research \n     offers an unusual opportunity for us to study in a laboratory \n     setting this natural phenomena of the life cycle. The \n     symptoms caused by space flight reverse themselves on return \n     to normal gravity, presenting additional opportunities for \n     insight into the aging process.\n       The accumulated data from experiments in the physical \n     sciences has formed the basis for a multidisciplinary \n     investigation of biological phenomena using the findings from \n     fluid physics research. As a result, we are obtaining \n     explanations for complex biological behavior at the cellular \n     and molecular levels. We are able to formulate a new set of \n     hypotheses regarding the behavior of complex ecological \n     systems in relation to multigenerational adaptive responses \n     to the pervasive effects of gravity.\n       We have found that even the tiny single-celled organisms \n     suspended in water are equipped to respond to gravity. We \n     have used the low gravity environment of space to research \n     and establish the mechanisms individual cells use to \n     translate physical force, like acceleration due to gravity, \n     into chemical signals that drive adaptation and response. We \n     have begun work to explore the process by which plants \n     respond to gravity to produce lignin, the primary component \n     of wood. We look forward to exploring the role that gravity \n     has played on Earth, and possibly in other places, in the \n     genesis and evolution of life. If a planetary gravitational \n     environment necessary for the creation or continued existence \n     of life, how would living systems evolve in a different \n     gravitational environment?\n\n\n                research with benefits for space flight\n\n       Research into the effects of gravity on fundamental \n     physical, chemical, and biological processes is increasingly \n     serving as the underpinning for our understanding of how to \n     live and work in space. Space flight induces changes in \n     virtually all body systems. Most appear to be benign \n     adaptations to weightlessness, but if unchecked some \n     physiological changes could become life threatening. It seems \n     today that exposure to the low gravity environment produces a \n     disassociation between the chronological and physiological \n     ages. Thus, our task is to bridge this time gap by developing \n     countermeasures such as exercise and pharmacokinetics.\n       The time course and extent of physiological changes in \n     astronauts must be characterized, and appropriate \n     countermeasures (compatible with the spacecraft design) \n     developed for long-duration orbital and interplanetary space \n     missions. This research promises to improve our general \n     understanding of human physiology and a number of medical \n     conditions. Similarly, the countermeasures that we devise may \n     benefit health care on Earth.\n       To illustrate the breadth of the challenges we face, \n     consider the digestive system. Relatively little work has \n     been done on the effects of low gravity on the digestion, \n     absorption and transport of drugs and nutrients in space. You \n     might think that in a confined space like the human bowel \n     there would be little role for gravity to play. But keep in \n     mind that it is gravity that causes bubbles of gas to rise to \n     the surface of a liquid and dispersed particles to settle \n     out. We know that astronauts do not suffer from malnutrition, \n     but how are digestion and pharmacokinetics affected?\n       Challenged by the need to monitor the health status and \n     deliver health care services to astronauts in ever more \n     remote and hostile environments, NASA is at the cutting edge \n     of medical technology requiring autonomy. Space programs have \n     pioneered the use of telecommunications, computer, and \n     microelectronic and nanoelectronic technologies in health \n     care. While critical for space flight and exploration, these \n     technologies also yield considerable benefit for medical care \n     here on Earth. The highly successful Spacebridge to Russia \n     program--a joint effort between NASA and the Russian Space \n     Agency--is an Internet-based telemedicine testbed that links \n     academic and clinical sites in the US and Russia for clinical \n     consultations and medical education. A predecessor project--\n     Spacebridge to Armenia--was used to provide medical \n     consultation services during the recovery from the Armenian \n     earthquake in 1988. Pilot projects in telemedicine technology \n     have also supported health care delivery in a wide variety of \n     remote locations.\n       NASA has developed a range of technologies in medical \n     informatics, sensors, diagnostic techniques, decision support \n     systems, image compression, and advanced training to support \n     health care delivery in space. These technologies include \n     compact, solid state sensors that permit non-invasive \n     monitoring of crew health and the space-craft environment. \n     NASA's Ames Research Center is adapting technology, \n     originally developed for space-related scientific \n     visualization, to stimulate complex surgery. This \n     application enables surgeons to reconstruct a patient's \n     face and skull from computerized tomographic (CT) scans, \n     allowing doctors to virtually manipulate the bone tissue \n     and visualize possible surgical procedures. Marshall Space \n     Flight Center has worked cooperatively with industry to \n     develop a Sensing and Force-Reflection Exoskeleton \n     (SAFiRE) that senses hand and finger motion as human \n     operator input and provides force-reflective feedback to \n     the operator for both telerobotic and virtual environment \n     applications. The SAFiRE project's technology base could \n     be used to develop a biomechanically sound resistance \n     exercise system.\n\n\n                            future research\n\n       Recent discoveries of life's adaptation to very extreme \n     environments and the potential for past or even present \n     existence of life on Mars or elsewhere in the Universe have \n     raised a range of compelling questions. Life's complex \n     processes are ubiquitous on Earth. Are they present on other \n     worlds as well? What role has gravity itself played in the \n     genesis and subsequent evolution of life on this planet and \n     elsewhere? Humanity's fascination with life and the physical \n     world propels our interest in the exploration of space.\n       As demonstrated by the success of the Mars Pathfinder \n     mission, NASA has embarked on a promising path of \n     technological innovation that is creating a ``virtual'' human \n     presence on other worlds. Future missions of exploration will \n     require crew members to live and work productively for \n     extended periods in space and on planetary surfaces. As in \n     the past, key biomedical, life support and human factors \n     questions must be answered to ensure crew health, well-being, \n     and productivity. To address these\n\n[[Page S7762]]\n\n     challenges, NASA will apply innovative technology to the \n     challenges of robotic and human space exploration, ranging \n     from advances in telemedicine, telepresence, and life support \n     to in situ materials utilization, nanotechnology, and \n     bionics. In the coming decades, fundamental and applied \n     research in gravity's effects will lay the foundation for \n     humans to develop and use space, and to expand outward on \n     missions of exploration.\n\n\n                         protecting crew health\n\n       Our first priority is ensuring the health and safety of our \n     crews. Long duration flights have demonstrated that it is \n     possible to survive extended term exposure to low gravity. \n     Yet, as I have described above, we must not forget that \n     adjusting to microgravity and then back to normal gravity is \n     a traumatic experience for the body. Many of our intuitive \n     theories for explaining these processes have already failed \n     in the light of hard data. Even some of our long-held \n     theories about the gravity dependence of physiological \n     processes for humans on Earth have been proven false by space \n     research. We must remain cautious in drawing general \n     conclusions from the small sample sizes currently available \n     and we must develop a rigorous understanding of the \n     mechanisms behind adaptation to microgravity as well as the \n     dose-response relationship. If we do a thorough scientific \n     job of understanding the mechanisms and dose-response \n     relationships of adaptation of low gravity we will create a \n     new storehouse of knowledge with innumerable applications to \n     Earth-based medical care.\n\n\n                      telescience and Telemedicine\n\n       In the next few years, the International Space Station will \n     serve as a platform for developing and testing systems that \n     will permit future space explorers to respond autonomously to \n     a wide variety of ongoing and emergency health care issues. \n     Medical monitoring will take advantage of noninvasive \n     microminiaturized sensors and advanced wireless \n     communications technology as well as next generation systems \n     for displaying and integrating the data stream. Emphasis on \n     portability and noninvasiveness of medical monitoring will \n     also pay large dividends by reducing the need for storage and \n     transportation of specimens.\n\n\n                    advanced life support technology\n\n       Future exploration missions will rely on advanced, \n     lightweight, closed-loop life support systems to sustain life \n     in the hostile space environment. Research on advanced life \n     support systems include both ground based and flight \n     components. We have already begun a series of closed tests \n     using crews of up to four people in ground based facilities \n     at the Johnson Space Center. Flight testing and validation \n     for life support systems will take place on the International \n     Space Station. Our goal is to demonstrate advanced life \n     support system on ISS that would be suitable for a Mars \n     transit vehicle by 2004, and validate system performance by \n     2008. Space Station environmental monitoring systems will \n     incorporate new miniaturized sensor technology requiring \n     greatly reduced resources to operate.\n\n\n                           physical sciences\n\n       We cannot overlook the vital role that fundamental research \n     in the physical sciences will play in the future of \n     exploration. Materials science research will explore advanced \n     radiation shielding materials vital to long-duration space \n     missions. Research in the behavior of fluids in low gravity \n     will help the designers of future space systems to move from \n     an empirical approach to approaches based on valid \n     mathematical models for such vital systems as thermal \n     control, fuel storage, and delivery, and life support \n     systems. Research on combustion phenomena will contribute to \n     improved technology for detecting and extinguishing fires in \n     spacecraft.\n       Fundamental physical research is also required to lay the \n     foundation for efficient and safe operations on the surfaces \n     of other bodies in the solar system. We must understand the \n     behavior of materials in the novel environments found on \n     other solar system bodies if we are to design efficient \n     systems for in situ resource utilization for fuel, life \n     support, radiation protection, fire detection, and \n     construction. Microgravity researchers are now participating \n     in planning for robotic missions to Mars in 2001 and 2003 \n     that will include experiments designed to explore these \n     issues.\n       The quest for understanding in space is a voyage into the \n     unknown. We cannot accurately predict what we will find, or \n     what we will produce. But if we are to control the risks of \n     human space flight and extract the benefits of space \n     development for future generations, we must continue our \n     efforts to reduce our ignorance. We must focus our research \n     both in the life sciences and the physical sciences, using \n     robotic missions in parallel with crewed missions to reduce \n     the  risks of human space flight. As a result, we will extend \n     human virtual and physical presence further into the solar \n     system, paving the way for broad commercial and scientific \n     development in space. Ultimately, we will learn to send \n     astronauts on long duration missions of exploration. Their \n     work will serve to extend our research to new worlds, and \n     possibly to new forms of life.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Nicogossian, Huntoon, and Pool, Space Physiology and \n     Medicine, 3rd Edition, Lea and Febiger Publishing, 1994.\n     \\2\\ Nicogossian, Mohler, Gazenko, Grigoryev, Foundations of \n     Space Biology and Medicine, Volume II: Life Support and \n     Habitation, American Institute of Aeronautics and \n     Astronautics, 1993.\n     \\3\\ Dehart, Fundamentals of Space Medicine, 2nd Edition, \n     Williams and Wilkins Publishing, 1996.\n     \\4\\ Glicksman, et. al., Physical Review Letters, Vol. 73, No. \n     4, 1993.\n     \\5\\ Hart, et. al., Science, Volume 234, No., 61, 1986.\n     \\6\\ Lipa, et. al., Physical Review Letters, Vol. 76, No. 6, \n     1996.\n     \\7\\ The May 1997 journal published by The Society for In \n     Vitro Biology contains over a dozen original research papers \n     using the NASA bioreactor.\n     \\8\\ McPherson, ``Macromolecular Crystal Growth in \n     Microgravity'' in Crystallography Reviews, Vol. 6, No. 2, \n     1996, 157-308).\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the VA-HUD \nCommittee, of which NASA is one of our key agencies, I thank the \nSenator from Ohio for his detailed speech about what NASA is doing, not \nonly today, but what it will do tomorrow. I believe the Senator, by \ntalking about the exciting projects that we have, many of which have \noriginated from the work at the Johnson space station, in the Presiding \nOfficer's home State, the work in the area of health care. I visited \nthese programs, know the merit they have, particularly in cancer \nresearch, tumor research, the issues outlined by the Senator from Ohio.\n  Also, in 1992, NASA and NIH signed a joint memorandum of agreement on \nhow they can work together to maximize the research being done by the \nspace agency, along with NIH, on issues related particularly to cancer \nand to issues related to women's health. Issues like osteoporosis, the \nsame kinds of problems that the astronauts face being in orbit, are \nwhat many face, particularly we women on Earth. We lose bone density.\n  There has been a lot of joint effort and a lot of joint agreement. I \nthink the Senator made a very valuable contribution and I thank him for \nhis remarks.\n  Sometimes for those of us who seek funding for NASA, it sounds self-\nserving, that we would tout, pull out an item or two. But when Senator \nJohn Glenn, an astronaut-Senator, speaks to it, I think the whole world \nlistens.\n  We thank him for his comments and his contribution to the Senate and \nto the American space program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. I join my distinguished colleague from Maryland in thanking \nour friend from Ohio. No one in this body speaks with more knowledge \nand expertise on space issues than Senator John Glenn. To hear him talk \nabout the exciting things that are happening in space, science and \nmedical advances, it truly is remarkable. It gives one a sense of what \nwe can accomplish with the investments we make.\n  This is extremely helpful, as we go into the debate, because these \nare very tight budget times. We have taken a step of assuring that \nmoney is available for space, for investment in our future by the \nexploration not just of space but of the scientific discoveries that \ncan come from utilizing the space station.\n  I thank him first as one who is interested in science. I envy his \nbackground and his knowledge. I appreciate very much his description of \nthe exciting things that can come from space exploration, not just for \nthose of us who are worrying about the funny-named rocks on Mars but \nthose who want to see concrete and specific medical advances here \ntoday.\n  Mr. GLENN. We have in room S. 211, for the information of Senators or \ntheir staffs, a panoramic view that has been put together by NASA of \nMars as taken from the Pathfinder. A full-sized model is out there for \npeople to look at. It is intriguing. It is so tiny you cannot believe \nit is sending all this information back to us on Earth.\n  We invite staffs or Senators when they come over for a vote which \nstarts at 5:15 to stop in and look at it. It is very worthwhile and \ngives a different concept than just seeing the pictures on TV.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. I had my picture taken with the Sojourner. I thought it was \nquite coincidental that the Sojourner model showed up today. Timing is \neverything.\n  I urge my colleagues who are interested in this space exploration to \nlook at the panoramic view to see how the Sojourner operates.\n  I see my colleague from Texas is anxious to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say it was a pleasure for me \nto hear the Senator from Ohio talk about this very important subject. I \nam\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\nproud the Senator from Ohio was once my constituent when he made the \nhistoric trip into space--that was really the beginning of our space \nprogram--and made us all so proud that we really could conquer space. \nWhat we have learned and what we have done for quality of life and for \nhealth research since his first foray into space has been, perhaps, \nmore than even he could have dreamed would happen.\n  I am very proud he is a supporter of the space station and the NASA \nProgram and knows that what he did in the beginning is certainly not \nthe end and certainly, I hope, we can continue the legacy that he has \nleft for us.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe the leader is going to be here \nshortly to discuss the voting schedule for tonight. I know votes were \nscheduled to begin at 5:15, but pending the arrival of the majority \nleader, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1023, the Treasury-Postal Service bill.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1023) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of \n     the President, and certain Independent Agencies, for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Campbell (for DeWine) amendment No. 936, to prohibit the \n     use of funds to pay for an abortion or pay for the \n     administrative expenses in connection with certain health \n     plans that provide coverage for abortions.\n       Kohl (for Bingaman) amendment No. 937, to strike provisions \n     prohibiting the use of appropriated funds for the sole source \n     procurement of energy conservation measures.\n       Campbell (for Coverdell-Feinstein) amendment No. 940, to \n     provide that Federal employees convicted of certain bribery \n     and drug-related crimes shall be separated from service.\n       Campbell (for Coverdell) amendment No. 941, to require a \n     plan for the coordination and consolidation of the \n     counterdrug intelligence centers and activities of the United \n     States.\n       Campbell (for Hatch) amendment No. 942, to provide for a \n     national media campaign focused on preventing youth drug \n     abuse.\n       Hutchison amendment No. 943, to establish parity among the \n     countries that are parties to the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement with respect to the personal allowance for duty-\n     free merchandise purchased abroad by returning residents.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent-Agreement\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nrollcalls not take place as ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the information of all Senators, a number of votes \nwere scheduled to occur beginning at 5:15 today. Over the weekend, and \nmost of today, the managers of the Treasury appropriations bill have \nbeen working to resolve those outstanding amendments, and it now \nappears that the Campbell amendment offered on behalf of Senator DeWine \nregarding abortion funds and passage are the only remaining votes that \nneed to occur with respect to the Treasury Appropriations bill. There \nmay also be a Bingaman amendment, but we are not clear about that yet.\n  As many Members are aware, the U.S.S. Constitution made its maiden \nvoyage as a refurbished symbol of America's proud past today on the \nwaters off Massachusetts. However, the ceremonies surrounding this \nevent were delayed. Consequently, several of our Members will not be \nreturning in time for the vote.\n  Therefore, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the rollcall votes scheduled to occur today now be postponed to \nbegin at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, July 22. Obviously, needless to say, there \nwill be no rollcall votes that will occur in today's session, but there \nwill be some further matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              data access\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before this body passes the Treasury and \ngeneral government appropriation bill for fiscal year 1998, I would \nlike to raise an important issue concerning how the Government develops \npolicies and regulations. The issue is the public's right to have \naccess to the data that is produced from Government funded studies and \nused to support regulatory rulemakings. As you may know, the Federal \nGovernment does not have a standardized process for making research \ndata available for independent review. Often the public is forced to \ncomply with costly regulations without the assurance that the data \nunderlying the rules has been made available for independent scientific \nevaluation. If the Government is going to force the public to comply \nwith its rules, the public must have confidence that the rules are \nbased on sound science. Similarly, if the Government is going to \nprovide funding for research, the public should be able to access the \ndata that is produced from such research. Unfortunately, the Government \ndoes not have a disclosure policy on research data. I believe this \nundermines the scientific basis of our rulemaking and erodes the \npublic's confidence in the Government's regulatory development process. \nI would like to ask my colleague from Colorado, the chairman of the \nTreasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, if he \nwould be willing to work with me to correct this problem.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for raising this \nimportant issue. The fact that this data is not now made available only \nadds to the public's mistrust of Government. I look forward to working \nwith you to develop an appropriate solution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator for his support on this issue.\n\n\n                       Newport, IRS Hiring Waiver\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to seek clarification on \nreport language which the subcommittee was good enough to include in \nthe Treasury and general government appropriations bill. That report \nlanguage urges the Internal Revenue Service to approve a waiver from \ninternal hiring requirements for the Newport IRS office if a planned \nreduction in force [RIF] does not result in those positions being \nfilled.\n  The Newport IRS office is one of two national centers that process SS \n8 forms and has earned a high reputation for efficiency and excellence. \nTo handle its increased responsibilities, the office has been trying to \nfill a number of lower level positions ranging from GS 3-5. Current IRS \nregulations require that these positions be filled internally. While \nNewport is a beautiful Vermont town, it is also extremely remote, and \nthe office has been unable to fill such low-level positions from within \nthe existing IRS personnel. These new personnel are needed to continue \nNewport's exemplary record in processing SS 8 forms.\n  The committee report also includes a provision, which I strongly \nsupport, directing the IRS to continue to delay its planned field \nreduction in force until it submits another report to Congress with a \ndetailed plan on how the IRS will ensure adequate taxpayer service in \nthe future, especially in rural areas. I share the concerns outlined in \nthe committee report about how taxpayer service will be affected by the \nplanned reorganization, especially in rural areas like Vermont. As a \nresult of this language, the RIF which IRS had planned for July 7 will \nnot be going forward. My understanding is that in the absence of this \nRIF, the committee intends for IRS to move forward immediately with its \napproval for the Newport hiring waiver. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont is correct. The \nSenate report clearly states that if the July RIF did not address the \nemployment shortage at the Newport IRS office, that the Service should \nmove forward with the waiver. Because that RIF will be delayed for some \ntime, IRS should move forward immediately with the Newport hiring \nwaiver.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Colorado, and I appreciate his \nclarification of this language.\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\n                           amendment no. 943\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that Senators Kyl, McCain, \nGramm, Bingaman, and Boxer be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am pleased that I was able to work with Secretary \nRubin and Ambassador Barshefsky's staff on this amendment. I am \nconfident that they will use this directive from Congress to make \nprogress--in the spirit of NAFTA--to correct the personal duty-free \nallowance inequity. I hope that it can be passed by unanimous consent \nwhen it is brought to the floor.\n  Mr. President, my amendment addresses the disparities that exist in \nthe personal duty-free exemption's of the United States, Mexico, and \nCanada. The United States provides each United States resident who is \nreturning from Mexico and Canada with a personal exemption from duty on \nmerchandise valued at up to $400 once every 30 days. This is the same \nduty exemption every U.S. citizen is afforded when they return to the \nUnited States from any country. Mexico, however, has a two-tiered duty-\nfree allowance structure. If you are a Mexican resident and live within \n25 kilometers of the border, when you return to Mexico at a land border \ncrossing, you may only return with $50 in duty-free merchandise. This \nhas become known as the $50 rule, and it is crippling businesses on the \nU.S. side of the border in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. \nIf you are a Mexican resident bringing more than $50 in merchandise, \nyou must pay a 22.8-percent duty rate.\n  This rule, Mr. President, makes it prohibitively expensive for a \nMexican resident to purchase a washing machine, refrigerator, \nelectronics, furniture, or any item costing more than $50 in the United \nStates. In U.S. border communities, countless small businesses have \nclosed their doors and thousands of American jobs have been lost. Our \nlarger retailers are also suffering, as Mexicans who used to travel \nacross the border for goods are now limited to purchasing them on their \nside of the border.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It directs the United \nStates Trade Representative and Secretary of the Treasury to begin \ndiscussions with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada to achieve \nparity in the duty-free allowance structure of the three NAFTA \ncountries. These officials will report to Congress within 90 days on \nthe progress they are making to correct these disparities. If the \nsituation remains unchanged, in 6 months these officials will propose \nappropriate legislation and action to bring the United States duty-free \nallowance into conformance with the allowance levels established by \nMexico and Canada.\n  Mr. President, this is an important issue for my constituents, and I \nlook forward to this amendment's adoption.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1023, the \nTreasury and general Government appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1998.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $25.2 billion and new \noutlays of $22.3 billion to finance operations of the Department of the \nTreasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service, \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Financial Management \nService; as well as the Executive Office of the President, the Office \nof Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, and other \nagencies that perform central Government functions.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation and generally \nconsistent with the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. I also \ncommend the chairman for his strong support for law enforcement, \nincluding the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.\n  When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $25.3 billion in BA and $25.1 billion in \noutlays. The total bill is below the Senate subcommittee's 602(b) \nnondefense discretionary allocation for budget authority by $4 million \nand at its allocation for outlays. The subcommittee is also at its \nviolent crime reduction trust fund allocation for BA and under its \nallocation for outlays by $15 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of S. 1023, as reported \nby the Senate.\n  I urge Members to support the bill and to refrain from offering \namendments that would cause the subcommittee to exceed its 602(b) \nallocation. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1023, the \nTreasury, Postal Service, and general Government appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1998.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            S. 1023, TREASURY-POSTAL APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING COMPARISONS, SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Defense     Nondefense     Crime      Mandatory      Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.............................           --       12,464          131       12,713       25,308\n  Outlays......................................           --       12,269          112       12,712       25,093\nSenate 602(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............................           --       12,468          131       12,713       25,312\n  Outlays......................................           --       12,269          127       12,712       25,108\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.............................           --       12,848          118       12,713       25,679\n  Outlays......................................           --       12,388          105       12,712       25,205\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............................           --           --           --           --           --\n  Outlays......................................           --           --           --           --           --\n        Senate-Reported Bill Compared To\nSenate 602(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............................           --          (4)           --           --          (4)\n  Outlays......................................           --           --         (15)           --         (15)\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.............................           --        (384)           13           --        (371)\n  Outlays......................................           --        (119)            7           --        (112)\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............................           --       12,464          131       12,713       25,308\n  Outlays......................................           --       12,269          112       12,712       25,093\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, we have accepted amendment No. 940, but I do \nwant to mention that we may need to fine-tune it in conference. The \nreason is that, as currently drafted, the proposal is somewhat \nambiguous. And for that reason, the Justice Department has told us that \nit has serious concerns about the amendment.\n  Now, I read the language to apply prospectively; that is, to people \nwho are subsequently convicted of a crime--but not to those employees \nwho were convicted years ago--or at any time prior to when this \nproposal becomes law. And I also believe that parts (a)(1) and (a)(2) \nshould be read conjunctively; that is, to apply to government employees \nwho are convicted of drug-related bribery--but not to employees who are \nconvicted of either bribery or drug-related crimes alone.\n  We have talked to Senator Coverdell's staff and they are willing to \nwork on the language of the amendment to make this clear and I am \noptimistic that we can write it to everybody's satisfaction in \nconference.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Madam President, I would like to speak a little bit \ntonight about taxes and the big controversy over tax cuts--and not only \nover tax cuts themselves but who qualifies for these tax cuts--what is \nfair, what is not fair. And really the basic bottom line is there is \nnot enough money in the pot for the tax cuts that Americans need.\n  Madam President, as negotiators from the House and Senate meet with \nadministration officials to hammer out a tax package, I rise today to \nbe the voice for the millions of Americans who no longer seem to be \nheard here in Washington: the Nation's hard-working, overtaxed, middle-\nclass families.\n  And I want to ask my colleagues, is there no shame in Washington?\n  Madam President, I read the comments made by the minority leader this \nmorning, arguing that the $77 billion tax cut bill ``is not fair.''\n  I have to say that I agree with the Senator from South Dakota. Any \nbill that cuts taxes by just $77 billion is not only unfair--it's an \noutrage.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what happened in 1993.\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\n  In 1993, after campaigning on middle-class tax relief, President \nClinton turned around and raised taxes on working Americans by $263 \nbillion--making his the largest tax increase in the history of this \nNation. Everybody paid more, including: $114.8 billion in new income \ntaxes, $24 billion in additional gas taxes, $34.9 billion in business \ntaxes, $29 billion in payroll taxes, and $24.6 billion in new Social \nSecurity taxes.\n  In other words, if you worked, were retired, drove a car, owned a \nbusiness, or paid income taxes, you paid for the President's 1993 tax \nincrease.\n  Although it was billed as nothing more than a tax increase only on \nthe rich, but using this funny calculation called FEI--or family \neconomic income--the President was able to say only those who worked \nwere rich and, therefore, needed to pay more in taxes.\n  So today President Clinton--again, the same President who in 1993 \nraised taxes on the American people by $263 billion, and also, by the \nway, Madam President, vetoed two Republican bills to cut taxes for \nAmericans--now considers himself to be a champion of the middle class \nbecause he now wants to cut taxes by a measly $77 billion, and only \nallowing the majority of those tax reductions if Americans--this is \nlike your children--if Americans, the people who get up every day, go \nto work to earn this money, now, if they only will do what they are \ntold. And that is to ``be seen, not heard.'' That seems to be the \nphilosophy that we use out of Washington today. And, what is worse, \nboth the House and the Senate are ready to go along with it.\n  Again, the question has to be: Is there no shame in Washington?\n  It doesn't take a math wizard to calculate that if the taxpayers had \ntheir taxes hiked by $263 billion 4 years ago, and will only get back \n$77 billion in so-called ``tax relief'' under the plan being crafted as \nwe speak--the American taxpayers are still $186 billion in the hole to \nthe Federal Government in new taxes in just the last 4 years.\n  And the men and women--the working families who have paid dearly for \nthat tax increase every day since--are supposed to thank Congress and \nthe President for this mere pittance of a tax cut?\n  Is there no shame in Washington?\n  Madam President, since the last meaningful tax cuts were signed into \nlaw by President Reagan in 1981, Washington has raised taxes on 10 \noccasions--10 different times tax increases have been imposed on \nAmericans, and always with the caveat if we can only raise taxes again \none more time we are going to be able to get our budget under control.\n  Every time the Washington politicians have wanted to spend more \nmoney, so they could brag to the folks back home, Look what I did for \nyou. But I need to raise your taxes in order for you to pat me on the \nback for all those projects that I am going to do for you back home. \nBut they have raised taxes on working families 10 times. They have done \nthat.\n\n  You hear this complaint on the floor many times, ``Oh, that tax cut \nthat we had back in 1981 led to all these deficits that we have \ntoday.'' If you put that in real technical economic terms, you could \nsay that is a bunch of hooey. It has not raised the deficit. It has \nbeen Congress not controlling the spending that has raised the deficit.\n  The $77 billion now slated for tax relief amounts to barely one-tenth \nof the amount that taxes were raised in the great tax hikes of 1990 and \n1993.\n  You know, this little tax cut that we are talking about--$77 billion \nover 5 years in a $7-plus trillion annual economy in this country--this \nlittle tax cut would actually be like a car dealer taking one penny off \nthe price of a new car and bragging to the buyer that, Boy, I am giving \nyou a great deal. That is what Congress is doing. They are saying, We \nare going to knock a penny off the price of this new car for you, and \nyou had better come out to Washington and thank us for allowing you to \nkeep some of the money that you have worked for.\n  With a track record like that, I am afraid the Congress and the \nPresident have a long way to go before they can claim true victory on \nbehalf of the American taxpayer.\n  Again, they said that the 1981 tax cut led to all of these deficits. \nIf that was the problem, wouldn't you think that the 10 tax increases \nover the last 16 years would have solved that problem? No. No, that \nhasn't done it.\n  I have seen enough of the way Washington works to know that if we \neliminated the tax cuts from this budget entirely--if we could take the \nadvice of some on the floor here and say, We don't need any tax cuts at \nall, we can't afford any tax cuts, we have to save this $77 billion, we \ncan't let Americans keep any more of the money they make--that $77 \nbillion would never be dedicated to deficit reduction. The politicians \nwould spend it faster than you can say reelection, and they would spend \nit on more Government programs and more pork. It certainly would not go \ntoward reducing the deficit and giving our children and grandchildren a \ndebt-free future. If you want evidence, you can just ask yourself: What \nhappened to that $225 billion that was miraculously found just before \nthe budget deal was put together a couple of months ago? It all went to \nspending. Nothing went to tax relief. Nothing went to deficit \nreduction.\n  So to say that if we could give up this tax package now of tax relief \nthat somehow it would go to deficit reduction, the record doesn't show \nthat. I guarantee you that the more we allow Washington to keep, the \nmore Washington will spend. And that is what makes the entire debate \nover what is fair and what is equitable in this tax relief package so \nridiculous. Washington is not willing to give up dollars, and it is not \nwilling to give up the power that those dollars represent to the \ntaxpayers. Therefore, a $77 billion tax cut will never be fair, and it \nwill never be equitable because the pie can never be cut into enough \npieces to give a fair slice to everyone. The pie is just simply too \nsmall. And once it is divvied up, working families will be left with \nlittle more than crumbs.\n\n  Clearly, Madam President, there is no shame in Washington. It is \nabsurd to expect the American taxpayers to fall on their knees to \nWashington in thanks for a tax relief plan that offers them dollars \nthat were rightfully theirs to begin with.\n  Again, giving $10 and getting $1 back I do not think is fair. It is \nnot equity. If my colleagues want to talk about tax fairness, we can do \nit. Let us repeal the 1993 tax increase on our senior citizens--$24.6 \nbillion. If my colleagues want to talk about tax fairness, repeal the \n1993 tax increase on motorists--that is $25 billion. If my colleagues \nwant to talk about tax fairness, repeal the 1993 tax increase on \nworking families. If we could do even a part of that, only then will \nthis Congress and this President have the credibility to discuss \nmeaningful tax relief for America's working families. Until then, Madam \nPresident, it has been just a lot of empty talk.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The bill calls for a \nnewly designated, golden-colored $1 coin to replace the Susan B. \nAnthony dollar coin.\n  The argument for a $1 coin is simple: it saves money. According to \nestimates of the General Accounting Office and the Federal Reserve, \nreplacing the $1 bill with a coin saves the Government $2.28 billion \nduring the first 5 years it circulates. As we consider plans to balance \nthe budget and eliminate Government waste, I believe that carrying a $1 \ncoin along with $2 bills is a relatively painless option compared to \nthe alternatives of raising taxes or cutting important programs.\n  A public opinion poll conducted in May 1997 reveals that 58 percent \nof the American public favors replacing the $1 bill with a coin when \ninformed that such a change would save the Government $456 million \nannually.\n  I want to stress that the Efficiency Currency Act of 1997 does not \ncall for a phase out of the $1 bill until 1 billion $1 coins authorized \nunder this legislation are in circulation. If the public rejects the \nnew coin, the phase-out will not occur.\n  Unless this legislation is approved in the near future, the U.S. Mint \nwill begin the process of minting more of the unpopular Susan B. \nAnthony coins by 1999. The supply of Anthony coins in Government \ninventories fell by a total of 137 million coins in 1995 and 1996. Only \n146 million remains as of May 30. The inventory has been falling at the \nrate of about 5 million per month, because Anthony dollars are used at \nhundreds of vending locations, by more than a dozen major transit \nsystems, and by the U.S. Postal Service. Contrary to reports by \nopponents of the dollar coin, the U.S. Postal Service has no plans to \ndiscontinue the use of the Anthony dollar in their self-service \noperations. The timeframe for a decision by Congress is short, because \nthe U.S. Mint has stated that it needs 30 months to design and \nfabricate a new $1 coin.\n  I think one of the most compelling reasons to replace a $1 bill with \na $1 coin is the cost savings. First, the Treasury Department will save \nmoney. A $1 coin lasts about 30 years while costing about 8 cents. A $1 \nbill is significantly more expensive, as it lasts only 1 year and 1 \nmonth at a cost of 4 cents per bill.\n  Second, the private sector will save money. A $1 coin is easier to \nprocess than a $1 bill. Paper money received on buses must be hand-\nstraightened at a cost of over $20 per 1,000, or about 2 cents for each \ndollar. Coins can be processed for less than one-tenth of the cost. The \nchange to a $1 coin is estimated to save the mass transit industry $124 \nmillion annually.\n  Furthermore, vending operators could avoid placing dollar bill \nacceptors, which cost between $300 and $400 each, on each vending \nmachine. The additional cost of these machines eventually must be \npassed on to customers. In addition, bill acceptors frequently do not \nwork and are more expensive to maintain than coin mechanisms.\n  Another benefit is that many consumers will actually have less, not \nmore, change in their pocket. Instead of having to use 4, 8, or 12 \nquarters to pay for mass transit, parking meters, phone calls, and car \nwashes, they will use dollar coins weighing a fraction the weight of \nmany quarters.\n  The visually impaired support the introduction of a $1 coin because \nthe $1 bill can be confused with bills of higher denominations. A \nuseable $2 coin will permit them to complete small transactions without \never having to use paper money.\n  This legislation is called the Efficiency Currency Act because \npassage would bring efficiencies to the private sector as well as to \nGovernment. This commonsense approach to modernizing our currency is \nnot an original idea. In fact, the United States is the only major \nindustrialized country that does not have high denomination coins.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both a copy of the \nEfficient Currency Act of 1997 and a summary of its contents be entered \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1038\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Efficient Currency Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ONE DOLLAR COINS.\n\n       (a) Color and Content.--Section 5112(b) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``dollar,''; and\n       (2) by inserting after the fourth sentence, the following: \n     ``The dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a \n     distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make \n     the denomination of the coin readily discernible, be minted \n     and fabricated in the United States, and have similar \n     metallic, anticounterfeiting properties as United States clad \n     coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of the \n     Efficient Currency Act of 1997.''.\n       (b) Design.--Section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the third sentence, by striking ``the dollar, half \n     dollar,'' and inserting ``half dollar''; and\n       (2) by striking ``The eagle'' and all that follows through \n     ``Anthony.'' and inserting the following: ``The Secretary of \n     the Treasury, in consultation with Congress, shall select \n     appropriate designs for the reverse and obverse sides of the \n     dollar coin.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--Before the date on which the \n     Government inventory of Susan B. Anthony $1 coins is \n     depleted, the Secretary of the Treasury shall place into \n     circulation $1 coins authorized under section 5112(a)(1) of \n     title 31, United States Code, that comply with the \n     requirements of subsections (b) and (d)(1) of that section \n     5112 (as amended by this section). The Secretary may \n     include such coins in any numismatic set produced by the \n     United States Mint before the date on which the coins are \n     placed in circulation.\n       (d) Increase Capacity.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     increase capacity at United States Mint facilities to a level \n     that would permit the replacement of $1 Federal Reserve notes \n     with $1 coins minted in accordance with section 5112 of title \n     31, United States Code, as amended by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. CEASING ISSUANCE OF ONE DOLLAR NOTES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Federal Reserve banks may continue to \n     place into circulation $1 Federal Reserve notes in accordance \n     with section 5115 of title 31, United States Code, until \n     Susan B. Anthony coins and coins minted in accordance with \n     this Act and the amendments made by this Act total \n     1,000,000,000 coins in circulation, at which time no Federal \n     Reserve bank may order or place into circulation any $1 \n     Federal Reserve note.\n       (b) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall produce only such number of \n     $1 Federal Reserve notes as the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve System orders from time to time to meet the \n     needs of collectors of that denomination. Such notes shall be \n     issued by 1 or more Federal Reserve banks in accordance with \n     section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act and sold by the \n     Secretary, in whole or in part, under procedures prescribed \n     by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 4. REGULATORY AUTHORITY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue appropriate rules \n     and regulations to carry out this Act and the amendments made \n     by this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Summary of the Efficient Currency Act of 1997\n\n       New and Unique Coin: Section 2(a) of the bill authorizes \n     production of a new dollar coin that (1) is golden in color, \n     (2) has a distinctive edge, (3) has tactile and visual \n     features that make the denomination of the coin readily \n     discernible, and (4) has similar metallic anti-counterfeiting \n     properties of U.S. clad coinage. This will make the dollar \n     coin easily distinguishable from a quarter.\n       Images on the Coin: Section 2(b) authorizes the Treasury \n     Department to select new designs, in consultation with \n     Congress, for the obverse and reverse sides of the dollar \n     coin.\n       Timetable for Circulation: It is expected that the mint \n     will have to issue new Susan\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\n     B. Anthony coins by September 1999. Section 2(c) of the bill \n     requires that the Treasury Department must replace the Susan \n     B. Anthony dollar coin with a new (and more usable) dollar \n     coin before the mint's inventory of Susan B. Anthony coins \n     are depleted.\n       Termination of $1 Bill: The Efficient Currency Act \n     effectively lets the public decide whether the Treasury \n     Department should retain or terminate the dollar bill. \n     Section 3(a) states that if the use of the new dollar coins \n     dramatically increases so that there are at least one billion \n     coins in circulation, then the dollar bill shall be \n     terminated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1039. A bill to designate a commercial zone within which the \ntransportation of certain passengers or property in commerce is exempt \nfrom certain provisions of chapter 135, of title 49, United States \nCode; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   The New Mexico Commercial Zone Act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the New Mexico \nCommercial Zone Act of 1997. This legislation will establish a much \nneeded zone in New Mexico to facilitate the trade and transportation of \nraw materials and merchandise across our border with Mexico.\n  Mr. President, now that America is witnessing the economic benefits \nof the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and trade with \nMexico is growing at a record pace, it has become clear to New Mexico \nthat we must establish a commercial zone to take full advantage of the \neconomic possibilities available to border States.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has the support of New Mexico's \nGovernor, Gary Johnson, the State Economic Development Department, the \nNew Mexico Border Authority, the United States-Mexico Chamber of \nCommerce, the New Mexico food processing industry, the New Mexico Motor \nCarriers Association, and the Cities of Las Cruces and Deming.\n  In the past, commercial zones were created by the Interstate Commerce \nCommission in numerous States to facilitate local border trade and \ntransportation activities. They also serve to control movement and \nuphold American vehicle safety requirements for foreign vehicles \noperating within the United States.\n  It is within the limits of these zones that commercial vehicles of \neither Mexican or Canadian registry are authorized to deliver products \nfrom their country to a United States distribution point or warehousing \nfacility. In addition to permitting these vehicles to pick up loads of \nproducts which are destined for export into their respective countries.\n  Mr. President, commercial zones similar to the one I propose today \nhave been established in the States of: New York, South Carolina, West \nVirginia, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Washington, Illinois, Colorado, \nKentucky, Minnesota, California, Texas, Arizona, and the District of \nColumbia.\n  Since the passage of NAFTA, these zones have been very important to \nborder States because they are serving as the transition boundaries for \nall Mexican commercial traffic.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that if we do not establish a commercial \nzone in New Mexico, my State will remain at a tremendous disadvantage \nto other border States. We will continue to be one step behind in \nattracting NAFTA-related businesses and building upon our current trade \nrelationship with Mexico.\n  Despite the fact that New Mexico does not yet have a commercial zone, \nwe are taking steps to increase trade with our neighbors. We have began \nto put the necessary border infrastructure in place and are laying the \nfoundation for a winning partnership with Mexico.\n  We have moved to develop a state-of-the-art Port of Entry at Santa \nTeresa which will facilitate efficient border crossings and will soon \nbegin construction on a intermodal transportation center. This center \nwill help expedite international cargo transfers not only for New \nMexico, but for the rest of the country once its construction has been \ncompleted.\n  Since the passage of NAFTA, New Mexico has witnessed its exports to \nMexico increase by over 1,000 percent--a percentage which represents \none of the largest explosions in exports by any State in the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, New Mexico still lags behind 35 other States in the \namount of exports being sent to Mexico. It is becoming \nincreasingly clear to the people of New Mexico that one component is \nstill missing. The establishment of a New Mexico commercial zone.\n\n  Mr. President, this dilemma will not be more apparent than late this \nsummer when the Mexican chili crops are ready for harvest. Because \nwithout a commercial zone, these farmers will not be able to process \ntheir chili crops in the many food processors located in southern New \nMexico.\n  For a Mexican farmer to sell chili to our food processors, that \nfarmer must transport the chili crop to the border station, unload the \ncargo, and then reload it onto an American carrier to travel the \nremaining 30 miles to the processing plant.\n  Mr. President, this is clearly not an economic incentive for \nconducting business with New Mexico food processors.\n  Mr. President, we passed NAFTA to begin creating new jobs and \nbusiness opportunities for American businesses.\n  Unfortunately, what we are seeing in New Mexico, is one of the first \nopportunities for new business, just slip through our finger tips--\nbecause we do not have a commercial zone.\n  Mr. President, this issue will not only affect the owners of these \nprocessors, but also the 3,000 New Mexicans who work at these plants \nand rely on that income to survive.\n  The apprehension among these workers is growing everyday because if \nCongress does not resolve this issue, there will not be enough work to \ngo around this summer in southern New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I believe that by establishing this commercial zone we \nwill not only be helping New Mexico but also the American consumer. \nBecause as trade with Mexico continues to increase, so will the demand \nfor more efficient border crossings. And if you have ever traveled to \nany of the busier border crossings, you would quickly notice the long \nlines of commercial trucks sitting idle and waiting for hours to cross \ninto the United States.\n  By establishing this commercial zone in New Mexico, we can help \nalleviate some of this traffic and make the process more efficient.\n  Mr. President, this is the economic reality we are facing in New \nMexico unless this legislation is passed. I believe New Mexico has laid \nthe foundation for developing a winning trade partnership with Mexico.\n  Simply put, this legislation puts New Mexico on a level playing field \nwith other border States so that we can continue our efforts to make a \nbrighter future for New Mexico residents.\n  In closing, I have three letters supporting this legislation, and I \nwould ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      M.A. & Sons,\n\n\n                                               Chile Products,\n\n                                          Derry, NM, June 9, 1997.\n     Senator Pete Domenici,\n     Building D, Suite 1,\n     Las Cruces, NM.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: We are writing to thank you for your \n     leadership in working to resolve the D.O.T. enforcement of \n     the ``Commercial Zone'' at the Port of Columbus, New Mexico. \n     Your sponsorship of legislation to address this problem is \n     very much appreciated and will ensure that the Port of \n     Columbus will remain a viable Port of Entry for New Mexico.\n       We, as importers of red chile from Mexico for processing, \n     need the Port of Columbus ``Commercial Zone'' to be expanded \n     as your legislation is proposing in order to remain \n     competitive and continue to employ people in the State of New \n     Mexico at our chile processing plant. We have found the Port \n     of Entry at Columbus to be efficient and able to provide the \n     service that we need. We want to continue to use this Port \n     instead of other Ports of Entry that are located further away \n     from the origin of the chile in Mexico. Using other Ports of \n     Entry would add time and money to the product and this can be \n     avoided by using the Port of Columbus.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in this issue that is \n     important to us and the State of New Mexico. If you need any \n     additional information please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary Alice Garay,\n     Owner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              State of New Mexico,\n\n\n                              Economic Development Department,\n\n                                      Santa Fe, NM, June 18, 1997.\n     Senator Pete V. Domenici,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The New Mexico Economic Development \n     Department and the New Mexico Border Authority wish to \n     express their\n\n[[Page S7770]]\n\n     support for a Southern New Mexico Border Commercial Zone.\n       The establishment of a commercial zone to cover portions of \n     two counties (Dona Ana and Luna) will encourage warehouses \n     and manufacturing plants in New Mexico's border areas. The \n     historical means of establishing Commercial Zones has been to \n     use a population formula which does not work for sparsely \n     populated Southern New Mexico. New Mexico is poised for \n     industrial and commercial growth in the border area, and \n     needs a Commercial Zone to avoid being at a competitive \n     disadvantage with other border states. Of particular and \n     immediate interest is the use of a Commercial Zone for \n     produce from Mexico moving to food processing plants in New \n     Mexico.\n       We strongly applaud your efforts to establish a New Mexico \n     Commecial Zone.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gary D. Bratcher,\n     Cabinet Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n         United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, Camara de \n           Comercio Mexico-Estados Unidos,\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC,\n       Dear Senator Domenici: The United States-Mexico Chamber of \n     Commerce is happy to hear of your sponsorship of the New \n     Mexico Commercial Zone Act of 1997. The legislation will \n     certainly benefit the economic development of your state \n     while supporting jobs on both sides of the border. Regional \n     prosperity is crucial to an economically and environmentally \n     stable border region.\n       Until NAFTA's cross-border trucking provisions take effect, \n     the extension of commercial zones at the state level is both \n     commercially and politically viable. In the case of New \n     Mexico, it is especially crucial because it does not have the \n     same ``twin city'' arrangements as other border states and, \n     therefore, cannot take advantage of existing commercial \n     zones. Economic development and jobs in Las Cruces and Deming \n     are left vulnerable to transportation inefficiency.\n       As NAFTA continues to benefit its three signatory nations, \n     it would be unfortunate to keep regions, states or cities \n     from enjoying its full benefits. Current trucking provisions \n     amount to non-tariff barriers. The Chamber supports removal \n     of those barriers and we support your initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Albert C. Zapanta,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 1040. A bill to promote freedom, fairness, and economic \nopportunity for families by reducing the power and reach of the Federal \nestablishment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE FREEDOM AND FAIRNESS RESTORATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, although the tax reconciliation bill \npromises to cut taxes by approximately $76 billion over 5 years and \n$238 billion over 10 years, it should be viewed as only a small step \nforward in providing tax relief to the American people.\n  I remind my colleagues this afternoon that we must not forsake our \nbroader agenda to seek comprehensive reform of our tax system. \nPiecemeal tax cuts are not, and I want to say it again, are not a \nsubstitute for broad-based tax reform. Therefore, I rise today to offer \nthe Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act which will scrap the entire \nIncome Tax Code as we know it and replace it with a system that taxes \nall income once and only once at one low, flat rate of 17 percent.\n  A flat tax, I believe, will correct the vast and pervasive problems \nof the current system. As illustrated before here, the complexity of \nFederal tax laws costs taxpayers approximately 5.3 billion hours to \ncomply with the current Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Code is so \ncomplicated that even the IRS doesn't understand it.\n  In 1993, the IRS gave 8.5 million wrong answers to taxpayers seeking \nassistance, and the IRS sent out 5 million correction notices which \nturned out to be wrong.\n  In 1996, this past year, taxpayers spent a staggering $225 billion \ntrying to comply with the Tax Code. Think about it--$225 billion in \nAmerica spent by the taxpayers trying to comply with the Tax Code. This \nis a deadweight loss to the economy that is, as the Presiding Officer \nknows as a member of the Armed Services Committee, about equal to our \nnational defense budget.\n  We live in a society that accepts the notion that some level of \ntaxation is necessary to finance the cost of Government, but it is \nimportant that it does no more harm than is necessary to achieve the \nstated goal. The current Tax Code is the product of a 40-year \nexperiment with social engineering that has hampered the effort of the \nAmerican people to be free, bear the fruit of their labor and \nultimately live the American dream.\n  Recently, the bipartisan national commission on restructuring the IRS \ncame out with a report laying out their vision for a new and improved \nIRS. One of the key recommendations of this commission that was made \nwas that simplification of the tax law is necessary to reduce taxpayer \nburden and to facilitate improved tax administration.\n  We need to address significant tax policy changes that will not only \nprovide taxpayers with relief, but will simplify and equalize the tax \ncollection in this country. Taxation is bad enough without \nadministering that tax through the inefficient, inequitable, and \noppressive tax system that we have today.\n  Rather than wading through stacks of complicated IRS forms and \ninstruction manuals, under a flat tax taxpayers would file a simple, \npostcard-size return. When fully phased in, the family allowance would \nbe $11,600 for a single person, $23,200 for a married couple filing \njointly and $5,300 for each dependent child.\n  These allowances will be indexed to inflation under our bill. For a \nfamily of four, this will mean that their first $33,800 of income would \nbe exempt from taxation by the Federal Government, which will assure a \nprogressive average rate for low-income households.\n  The flat tax, I believe, will restore fairness to tax laws by \ntreating everyone alike, regardless of what business they are in, \nwhether or not they have a lobbyist in Washington or how much money \nthey make. If you earn more, under the flat rate tax, you would pay \nmore. Under the current system, one taxpayer may pay little or no taxes \nbecause they have paid an accountant or tax attorney to figure out the \nTax Code for them. At the same time, another person with the same exact \nincome but who does not have the professional assistance may pay much \nmore in taxes. I say that is not fair.\n  Under a flat tax, this would end. People would not have to hire an \naccountant or tax attorney simply to comply with the law. Everyone \nwould fill out the same simple, postcard-size return. Everyone will be \ntaxed at the same rate. And, yes, everyone will pay their fair share.\n  Furthermore, the flat tax will eliminate the double taxation of \nsavings and promote jobs and higher wages in this country. Because the \nflat tax applies a single low rate to all Americans, I feel it is the \nbest replacement of the current system. I do not think that Americans \nshould have to jump through hoops just to keep the money they have \nearned through their hard work. The current Tax Code basically says you \ncan keep your money only if you do what we think you should do. This is \nnot freedom; it is serfdom. The flat tax does away with Government \nmicromanagement of people's personal lives and allows them to spend \ntheir hard-earned money as they see fit.\n  But perhaps the most important virtue of the flat tax is that it \nsupports the basic value of work, savings, and individual liberty. It \nhas been a commitment to these principles that has made America the \nmost successful economy in the world. In recent years, we have watched \nas the private sector has streamlined itself. I think it is now time \nfor us to streamline the Tax Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1041. A bill to amend section 5314 of title 49, United States \nCode, to assist compliance with the transit provisions of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act of 1990; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            THE ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION ACTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Accessible \nTransportation Act of 1997. This legislation will continue the progress \nwe have made improving access to transportation services for \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  There are 25 million Americans with disabilities who are transit \ndependent. Access to transportation for these Americans is the critical \nfactor that determines whether they can pursue opportunities in \nemployment, education, housing, and recreation. I believe that assuring \naccess to transportation is critical to promoting maximum independence \nand achieving\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\nmeaningful integration for persons with disabilities.\n  In 1987, Congress created Project Action to promote transportation \naccessibility and to enhance cooperation between transit providers and \nthe disability community.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act [ADA] to \nensure that every American has access to transportation, buildings and \nother necessary locations, services, and activities which are essential \nto lead an active life. The ADA guarantees equality of accessibility \nfor all Americans regardless of the challenges that their disabilities \npresent.\n  In order to facilitate the implementation of the transportation \nprovisions included in ADA, I sponsored the Accessible Transportation \nAction Act of 1991 which was included in the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991. This legislation authorized \nfunding of $2 million each year for the Easter Seals Society to \nundertake a national program of research, demonstrations, and technical \nassistance to provide new solutions to the problems of providing \ntransportation for persons with disabilities. Project Action has become \nthe Nation's foremost resource for information and guidance on \nimplementing the transportation provisions of ADA.\n  The National Easter Seals Society has administered Project Action and \nhas assisted in building strong working relationships between transit \noperators, disability organizations, and the U.S. Department of \nTransportation in order to find cost-effective ways to promote \ntransportation accessibility.\n  Project Action has developed an impressive resource center of \ninformational materials for a wide variety of transit and disability \ncommunity audiences on the nature and progress of ADA implementation. \nIt has initiated consumer campaigns to insure that people with \ndisabilities are aware of their rights.\n  The positive effects that have developed from Project Action \nactivities have been impressive. Nationwide bus fleet accessibility has \ngrown. Rail station access has increased. Paratransit services have \nimproved and expanded. And the disability and transit communities have \nlearned how to work together to promote accessible transportation.\n  However, there are a number of challenges which remain in order to \nassure that the disabled have full access to transportation services. \nThe chief concern is how to insure the implementation of ADA in the \nmost cost-effective manner. Paratransit costs are high and resources \nare limited. At the same time, overall Federal assistance for \ntransportation and mass transit has been limited. America needs Project \nAction to continue to find innovative ways to allow every disabled \nperson to gain equal access to our Nation's public transportation \nsystems.\n  Therefore, I am today introducing legislation which will continue the \nProject Action for the next 5 fiscal years to continue the vital \nprocess of implementing the transportation facets of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Graham and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1042. A bill to require country of origin labeling of perishable \nagricultural commodities imported into the United States and to \nestablish penalties for violations of the labeling requirements; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   THE IMPORTED PRODUCE LABELING ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nGraham, to introduce the Imported Produce Labeling Act of 1997.\n  For the past 67 years, since Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, \nalmost everything imported from abroad has been labeled as to its \ncountry of origin. Guidelines now exist for products of virtually every \nkind--from clothing and toys to prepared food. Pick up almost anything \nin your local supermarket or department store and you're likely to see \nits country of origin clearly displayed.\n  This is sound trade policy, which has served our Nation well. It is \nnow time, Mr. President, to extend these same labeling requirements to \nimported produce.\n  Currently, containers carrying imported produce from abroad are \nrequired, by the same Tariff Act of 1930, to be labeled as to where \nthat produce was grown and packed. This information makes it possible \nfor American importers, shippers, and retailers to know the produce's \ncountry of origin. However, that information is never revealed to the \nconsumer.\n  What this legislation would require, Mr. President, is for this \nimportant information, already in the hands of our retailers and \nshippers, be passed on to those who ultimately purchase and consume the \nimported produce. We're asking, quite simply, for retailers to let the \nAmerican consumer know what they're eating and where it was produced.\n  The United States imports approximately 1.7 billion dollars' worth of \nfruit and vegetables every year. Almost all of this produce is \npurchased and consumed by unsuspecting shoppers who have no idea where, \nor under what conditions, it was grown.\n  While some might claim these new labeling requirements are unfair or \nburdensome, these claims are simply not true, and aim to distract the \nreal issue: the consumer's right to know.\n  I would point out to these critics, Mr. President, that most of our \ninternational trading partners already require such labeling. While I \nwon't take the time to read the names of all these nations now, I would \nlike to draw your attention to two of those with the strictest labeling \nrequirements, Canada and Mexico--our two closest trading partners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of countries which \ncurrently require country of origin labeling for produce to be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                  Produce Labeling Requirements Abroad\n\n (From the National Food and Agriculture Policy Project/Arizona State \n                              University)\n\n       Countries which require country of origin labeling on all \n     produce, including bulk produce: Bulgaria, Canada, Costa \n     Rica, Egypt, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Malaysia, \n     Mexico, Romania, Spain, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom.\n       Countries which require country of origin labeling only on \n     prepackaged products: Austria, Brazil, Ecuador, Hong Kong, \n     Israel, Iraq, Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland, and \n     Venezuela.\n       Countries where country of origin labeling is an industry \n     practice, though not required: Denmark, Finland, Italy, \n     Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and Sweden.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is about time we start giving American \nconsumers the same information granted in these other nations.\n  Likewise, this legislation is not overly burdensome. The bill \nprovides for a wide variety of labeling options, any number of which \nmight be easily employed by American retailers to display information \nthey already know.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to consider this legislation \nseriously. It is time to close the gap of knowledge that currently \nexists relative to where imported produce is grown. American consumers \nhave the right to know where their food came from and, given the \nopportunity, will use that information to protect and provide for their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill both support our national agricultural industries and bolster the \nabilities of American consumers to make educated choices about the \nfruits and vegetables that they purchase for their families: the \nImported Produce Labeling Act of 1997.\n  This important legislation extends our current country-of-origin \nlabeling laws--enacted as part of the Tariff Act of 1930--to require \ncountry-of-origin labeling of imported produce at the final point of \nsale, which for most Americans is the grocery store. It would bolster \nfood safety, give consumers more information, and allow American \ngrowers to achieve some benefit from the heavy investment they make in \ncomplying with health, labor, and environmental laws.\n  Mr. President, country-of-origin labeling is not a new idea. For \ndecades, European nations, Japan, and Canada have informed consumers \nabout the origins of the produce available for purchase.\n  One need only to walk through a supermarket in Paris to notice the \ninternational nature of the produce sold. Shoppers can purchase apples \nfrom the United States, tomatoes from Holland, grapes from Spain, pears \nfrom France,\n\n[[Page S7772]]\n\npeaches from Italy, and oranges from Israel.\n  Our American supermarkets also carry agricultural products from a \nwide range of exporting nations. Why, then, do our consumers lack the \nadvantage that their French, Japanese, and Canadian counterparts enjoy: \nthe ability to make informed choices about the food they feed to their \nfamilies?\n  It doesn't have to be that way. For 18 years, Florida grocery store \ncustomers have enjoyed the benefits of a law very similar to what I am \nproposing today.\n  In 1979, during my first term as Governor, the Florida State \nLegislature enacted the Produce Labeling Act, a law that is now \nadministered by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer \nServices.\n  The law has been implemented with almost no additional regulation and \nat extremely small cost to Florida taxpayers.\n  Extra supermarket inspections are not required. Department of \nAgriculture inspectors verify compliance with the law as a part of \ntheir already planned, routine inspections of all retail food stores in \nthe State.\n  Florida's policy also expends limited time and money. A standard \ninspection takes approximately 15 minutes, the time needed to review \ndisplays and document discrepancies. And enforcement costs are \nestimated to be less than $40,000 annually for the department's \ninspection of over 23,000 retail food establishments.\n  While costs are low, the benefits that Floridians have enjoyed as a \nresult of this policy are significant.\n  Most importantly, consumers are armed with important information \nabout the products upon which they spend their hard-earned paycheck. \nHere's what that means:\n  The ``Made In The USA'' label can draw more customers to domestic \nproduce, thus supporting American farmers and the U.S. economy as a \nwhole.\n  Consumers have the ability to seek out foreign produce that is known \nfor its high quality.\n  Shoppers have the information needed to boycott products from \ncountries that exploit workers with low pay, poor working conditions, \nor child labor.\n  American families can protect their own health from products \nsubjected to unsafe or unsanitary produce-handling practices.\n  The Florida Department of Agriculture reports that the State's \nlabeling law has been both well-received and cost-effective. It costs a \nstore only $5 to $10 per week to implement, and the estimated industry \ncompliance costs statewide are less than $200,000 annually.\n  In plain terms, this means that for less than $200,000, consumers in \na State that has 14 million residents and each year welcomes over 30 \nmillion visitors have the basic information regarding the origins of \nthe produce on their supermarket shelves. That's a small price to pay \nfor the ability to make educated choices in the marketplace.\n  It is my goal--and that of my cosponsors, Senator Craig of Idaho and \nSenator Johnson of South Dakota--to ensure that all American consumers \nare armed with the same ability to make informed choices as their \ncounterparts in Florida, Europe, and Japan.\n  We are introducing this legislation because the changing nature of \nthe agriculture market demands changes in our Nation's trade policy.\n  Sixty-seven years ago, when the Tariff Act of 1930 was enacted, fresh \nfruits and vegetables were exempt from labeling laws.\n  The Tariff Act dictates that items are required to be labeled with \ntheir country of origin only on their outermost container. In the case \nof fresh fruit and vegetables, the outermost container is the shipping \ncontainer, from which produce is removed long before it ever reaches \nthe consumer.\n  Obviously, the consumer market has changed dramatically since 1930. \nWhereas imported produce was once almost nonexistent in the United \nStates, it now constitutes a $1.7 billion industry. In fact, 60 percent \nof our winter fruits and vegetables come from Mexico alone.\n  As imports have become a fixture in the domestic marketplace, our \ngrowers and their associations have argued for country of origin \nlabeling. But this is an issue that unites producers and consumers. \nResearch has shown that an overwhelming number of American consumers \nwould like to know where their produce is grown--and they want that \ninformation made readily available.\n  Our bill is not cumbersome. It simply says that a retailer of a \nperishable agricultural product imported into the United States shall \ninform consumers as to the national origins of that product.\n  Nor is it designed to give American products an unfair advantage in \nthe marketplace. In fact, foreign growers who believe that they grow a \nsuperior product to ours see this legislation as a prime opportunity to \nsell more of their goods in American supermarkets.\n  And finally, this bill does not suppress free trade or the free \nmarket system. It simply seeks to level the regulatory playing field. \nShoppers in the European Union and Canada benefit from a county-of-\norigin labeling requirement. American consumers should have access to \nthe same kind of information.\n  The Imported Produce Labeling Act constitutes one of the most \nimportant agriculture trade initiatives that will come before us during \nthis Congress. It is a vital part of efforts to bolster one of the most \ncritical elements of our free-enterprise system: informed choice. I \nurge its speedy passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1044. A bill to amend the provisions of titles 17 and 18, United \nStates Code, to provide greater copyright protection by amending \ncriminal copyright infringement provisions, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             THE CRIMINAL COPYRIGHT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf of \nSenator Kyl and myself, the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997. \nThis bill would close a significant loophole in our copyright law and \nremove a significant hurdle in the Government's ability to bring \ncriminal charges in certain cases of willful copyright infringement. By \ninsuring better protection of the creative works available online, this \nbill will also encourage the continued growth of the Internet and our \nnational information infrastructure.\n  This bill reflects the recommendations and hard work of the \nDepartment of Justice, which worked with me to introduce a version of \nthis legislation in the 104th Congress. I want to commend the \nDepartment for recognizing the need for action on this important \nproblem. This bill was noted with approval in the September, 1995 \n``Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights,'' \nchaired by Bruce Lehman, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, and \nhas been cited by the Business Software Alliance as one of its major \nlegislative priorities.\n  For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law a defendant's \nwillful copyright infringement must be ``for purposes of commercial \nadvantage or private financial gain.'' Not-for-profit or noncommercial \ncopyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no \nmatter how egregious the infringement or how great the loss to the \ncopyright holder. This presents an enormous loophole in criminal \nliability for willful infringers who can use digital technology to make \nexact copies of copyrighted software and other digitally encoded works, \nand then use computer networks for quick, inexpensive and mass \ndistribution of pirated, infringing works. This bill would close this \nloophole.\n  United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is an \nexample of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In that \ncase, an MIT student set up computer bulletin board systems on the \nInternet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software programs. \nThis resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over $1 \nmillion over a 6-week period. Since the student apparently did not \nprofit from the software piracy, the Government could not prosecute him \nunder criminal copyright law and instead charged him with wire fraud. \nThe district court described the student's conduct ``at best * * * as \nirresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking \nin any fundamental sense of values.''\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\n  Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because \nit viewed copyright law as the exclusive remedy for protecting \nintellectual property rights. The Court expressly invited Congress to \nrevisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, stating:\n\n       Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach \n     to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software \n     even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer. \n     One can envision ways that the copyright law could be \n     modified to permit such prosecution. But, ``[i]t is the \n     legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and \n     ordain its punishment.''\n\n  This bill would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful \ncopyright infringements in the following ways: First, serious acts of \nwillful copyright infringement that result in multiple copies over a \nlimited time period and cause significant loss to the copyright \nholders, would be subject to criminal prosecution.\n  The bill would add a new offense prohibiting willful copyright \ninfringement by reproduction or distributing, including by electronic \nmeans, during a 180-day period of 10 or more copies of 1 or more \ncopyrighted works when the total retail value of the copyrighted work \nor the total retail value of the copies of such work is $5,000 or more. \nThe bill makes clear that to meet the monetary threshold either the \ninfringing copies or the copyrighted works must have a total retail \nvalue of $5,000 or more. The penalty would be a misdemeanor if the \ntotal retail value of the infringed or infringing works is between \n$5,000 and $10,000, and up to 3 years' imprisonment if the total retail \nvalue is $10,000 or more.\n  By contrast, the penalties proposed for for-profit infringement are \nmuch stiffer. Specifically, under the existing 17 U.S.C. section \n506(a)(1), for-profit infringements in which the retail value of the \ninfringing works is less than $2,500, would constitute a misdemeanor; \nand, if the retail value of the infringing works is $2,500 or more, the \npenalty is up to 5 years' imprisonment. As discussed below, this bill \nwould change the monetary threshold amount for felony liability under \nsection 506(a)(1) from $2,500 to $5,000.\n  The monetary, time period and number of copies thresholds for the new \noffense, under 17 U.S.C. section 506(a)(2), for not-for-profit \ninfringements, combined with the scienter requirement, would insure \nthat criminal charges would only apply to willful infringements, not \nmerely casual or careless conduct, that result in a significant level \nof harm to the copyright holder's rights. De minimis, not-for-profit \nviolations, including making a single pirated copy or distributing \npirated copies of works worth less than a total of $5,000, would not be \nsubject to criminal prosecution.\n\n  This bill would require that at least 10 or more copies of the \ninfringed work be made, which is a quantity requirement that was not \npresent for the new not-for-profit infringement offense in the version \nof the bill introduced in the 104th Congress. Thus, it would not be a \ncrime under the bill to make a single copy of a copyrighted work, even \nif that work were very valuable and worth over $10,000. Such valuable \nintellectual property, whether or not copyrighted, that is stolen could \nbe protected under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, if it is a trade \nsecret, or under the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act \nof 1996, which Senator Kyl and I sponsored, if the means used to \ncomplete the theft involved unauthorized computer access.\n  Second, the bill would increase the monetary threshold for the \nexisting criminal copyright offense, which makes it a misdemeanor to \ncommit any willful infringement for commercial advantage or private \nfinancial gain, and a felony if 10 or more copies of works with a \nretail value of over $2,500 are made during a 180-day period. The bill \nwould increase the monetary threshold in this offense from $2,500 to \n$5,000 for felony liability.\n  Third, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly \nrecidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony criminal copyright \noffense. Under existing law, repeat offenders who commit a second or \nsubsequent offense of copyright infringement for commercial advantage \nor private financial gain are subject to imprisonment for up to 10 \nyears. The bill would also double the term of imprisonment from 3 years \nto 6 years for a repeat offense for noncommercial copyright \ninfringement. Such a calibration of penalties takes an important step \nin ensuring adequate deterrence of repeated willful copyright \ninfringements.\n  Fourth, the bill would extend the statute of limitations for criminal \ncopyright infringement actions from 3 to 5 years, which is the norm for \nviolations of criminal laws under title 18, including those protecting \nintellectual property.\n  Finally, the bill would strengthen victims' rights by giving \nvictimized copyright holders the opportunity to provide a victim impact \nstatement to the sentencing court. In addition, the bill would direct \nthe Sentencing Commission to set sufficiently stringent sentencing \nguideline ranges for defendants convicted of intellectual property \noffenses to deter these crimes.\n  Technological developments and the emergence of the national \ninformation infrastructure in this country and the global information \ninfrastructure worldwide hold enormous promise and present significant \nchallenges for protecting creative works. Increasing accessibility and \naffordability of information and entertainment services are important \ngoals that oftentimes require prudent balancing of public and private \ninterests. In the area of creative rights, that balance has rested on \nencouraging creativity by ensuring rights that reward it while \nencouraging its public availability.\n  The Copyright Act is grounded in the copyright clause of the \nConstitution and assures that ``contributors to the store of knowledge \n[receive] a fair return for their labors.'' Harper & Row ``The Nation \nEnterprises'', 471 U.S. 539, 546 (1985). I am mindful, however, that \nwhen we exercise our power to make criminal certain forms of copyright \ninfringement, we should act with ``exceeding caution'' to protect the \npublic's first amendment interest in the dissemination of ideas. \nDowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 221 (1985). I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with interested parties to make any necessary \nrefinements to this bill to insure that we have struck the appropriate \nbalance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be placed in the \nRecord together with the bill and a sectional summary.\n  There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

98 Stat. 1987) and \n     section 21 of the Sentencing Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-182; \n     101 Stat. 1271; 18 U.S.C. 994 note) (including the authority \n     to amend the sentencing guidelines and policy statements), \n     the United States Sentencing Commission shall ensure that the \n     applicable guideline range for a defendant convicted of a \n     crime against intellectual property (including offenses set \n     forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and \n     sections 2319, 2319A and 2320 of title 18, United States \n     Code)--\n       (A) is sufficiently stringent to deter such a crime;\n       (B) adequately reflects the additional considerations set \n     forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and\n       (C) takes into account more than minimal planning and other \n     aggravating factors.\n       (2) Implementation.--In implementing paragraph (1), the \n     Sentencing Commission shall ensure that the guidelines \n     provide for consideration of the retail value of the \n     legitimate items that are infringed upon and the quantity of \n     items so infringed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997--Summary\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the ``Criminal \n     Copyright Improvement Act of 1997.''\n       Sec. 2. Criminal Infringement of Copyrights. As outlined \n     below, the bill adds a new definition for ``financial gain'' \n     to 17 U.S.C. Sec.  101, and amends the criminal copyright \n     infringement provisions in titles 17 and 18. The bill also \n     ensures that victims of criminal copyright infringement have \n     an opportunity to provide victim impact statements to the \n     court about the impact of the offense. Finally, the bill \n     directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure that guideline \n     ranges are sufficiently stringent to deter criminal \n     infringement of intellectual property rights, and provide for \n     consideration of the retail value and quantity of the \n     legitimate, infringed-upon items and other aggravating \n     factors.\n       (a) Definition of Financial Gain. Current copyright law \n     provides criminal penalties when a copyright is willfully \n     infringed for purposes of ``commercial advantage or private \n     financial gain.'' The bill would add a definition of \n     ``financial gain'' to the copyright law, 17 U.S.C. Sec.  101, \n     and clarify that this term means the ``receipt of anything of \n     value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.'' \n     This definition would make clear that ``financial gain'' \n     includes bartering for, and the trading of, pirated software.\n       (b) Criminal Offenses. The requirement in criminal \n     copyright infringement actions under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a) \n     that the defendant's willful copyright infringement be ``for \n     purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain,'' \n     has allowed serious incidents of copyright infringement to \n     escape successful criminal prosecution.\n       For example, in United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. \n     535 (D. Mass. 1994), the defendant allegedly solicited users \n     of a computer bulletin board system on the Internet to submit \n     copies of copyrighted software programs for posting on the \n     system, and then encouraged users to download copies of the \n     illegally copied programs, resulting in an estimated loss of \n     revenue to the copyright holders of over one million dollars \n     over a six week period. Absent evidence of ``commercial \n     advantage or private financial gain,'' the defendant was \n     charged with conspiracy to violate the wire fraud statute, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec.  1343. The district court described the \n     defendant's conduct as ``heedlessly irresponsible, and at \n     worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any \n     fundamental sense of values,'' but nevertheless dismissed the \n     indictment on the grounds that acts of copyright infringement \n     may not be prosecuted under the wire fraud statute.\n       The bill would add a new criminal copyright violation to \n     close this loophole in circumstances where no commercial \n     advantage or private financial gain may be shown. New section \n     17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2) would prohibit willfully infringing \n     a copyright by reproducing or distributing, including by \n     electronic means, during any 180-day period, 10 or more \n     copies of 1 or more copyrighted works when the total retail \n     value of the copyrighted works or of the copies of such works \n     is $5,000 or more. The penalty would be a misdemeanor if the \n     total retail value of the infringed or infringing works is \n     between $5,000 and $10,000, and up to 3 years' imprisonment \n     if the total retail value is $10,000 or more.\n       Not-for-profit willful infringement would thus be subject \n     to similar threshold requirements as for a felony offense of \n     willful infringement for commercial advantage or private \n     financial gain under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(1), which \n     requires that 10 or more copies of copyrighted works with a \n     total retail value of more than $5000 be made during a 180-\n     day period. The penalties applicable to an offense under 17 \n     U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(1) are more stringent than for the new \n     offense under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2). Specifically, under \n     17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(1), if the retail value of the \n     infringing works is less than $5,000, the penalty is a \n     misdemeanor; and, if the retail value of the infringing works \n     is $5,000 or more, the penalty is up to 5 years' \n     imprisonment.\n       The monetary, timing, and number of copies prerequisites \n     for the new offense under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2), combined \n     with the scienter requirement, insure that merely casual or \n     careless conduct resulting in distribution of only a few \n     infringing copies would not be subject to criminal \n     prosecution. In other words, criminal charges would only \n     apply to not-for-profit willful infringements of 10 or more \n     copies during a limited time period resulting in a \n     significant level of harm of over $5,000 to the copyright \n     holder's rights. De minimis violations would not be subject \n     to criminal prosecution.\n       The offenses under Sec.  506(a)(1) and (a)(2) would \n     overlap. For example, someone selling 10 or more copies of a \n     copyrighted work during a 180-day period may violate both \n     provisions if the value of those copyrighted works is $5,000 \n     or more. The key, however, is that the new provision in Sec.  \n     506(a)(2) requires that the infringement involve, at a \n     minimum, harm in the amount of $5,000. By contrast, any \n     offense, regardless of value, involving private financial \n     gain or commercial advantage constitutes at least a \n     misdemeanor, and the crime reaches felony level under the \n     bill once the retail value of the copyrighted or infringing \n     material exceeds $5,000.\n       The new crime would also require that at least 10 or \n     more copies of the infringed work be made. It would not be \n     a crime under the bill to make a single copy of a \n     copyrighted work, even if it were very valuable and worth \n     over $10,000. Such valuable intellectual property, whether \n     or not copyrighted,\n\n[[Page S7775]]\n\n     that is stolen could be protected under the Economic \n     Espionage Act of 1996 (if it is a trade secret), or under \n     the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of \n     1996, if the means used to complete the theft involved \n     unauthorized computer access.\n       (c) Limitation on Criminal Procedures. The bill would amend \n     17 U.S.C. Sec.  507(a) to extend the statute of limitations \n     for criminal copyright infringement actions from three to \n     five years. A five year statute of limitations is the norm \n     for violations of criminal laws under Title 18, including \n     those that relate to protecting intellectual property. See, \n     e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2319A (Unauthorized fixation of and \n     Trafficking in sound recordings) and Sec.  2320 (Trafficking \n     in counterfeit goods or services).\n       (d) Criminal Infringement of a Copyright. The bill would \n     amend the penalty provisions in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2319 to \n     comport with the proposed amendments to 17 U.S.C. Sec.  \n     506(a), and would also add a new subsection providing for a \n     victim impact statement.\n       First, under current law, willful copyright infringement \n     for commercial advantage or private financial gain is a \n     felony punishable by up to five years' imprisonment only when \n     the offense consists of the reproduction or distribution \n     during a 180-day period of ten or more copies with a retail \n     value of over $2500. Willful infringements for commercial \n     advantage, which do not satisfy the monetary threshold or \n     quantity requirement during the statutory time period, are \n     misdemeanor offenses. The bill would modify the felony \n     penalty provision for willful copyright infringement for \n     commercial advantage or private financial gain to cover \n     reproductions or distributions ``including by electronic \n     means''. The bill would also change the monetary threshold \n     from $2,500 to $5,000.\n       Second, the bill would provide a new penalty in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  2319(c) for the new offense in 17 U.S.C. Sec.  \n     506(a)(2) of willfully infringing a copyright by reproduction \n     or distribution, including by electronic means, during a 180-\n     day period of 10 or more copies of copyright works when the \n     total retail value of the copyrighted work or of the copies \n     of such work is $5,000 or more. Violations would be \n     punishable by up to 1 year imprisonment and fine if the total \n     retail value of the infringed or infringing works is between \n     $5,000 and $10,000, and by up to 3 years' imprisonment and a \n     fine if the total retail value is $10,000 or more.\n       The penalty structure under the bill is as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Infringed work values--            Under $5,000           $5,000 to $10,000             Over $10,000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWillful infringement for            Misdemeanor..........  FELONY (up to 5 years), if  FELONY (up to 5 years),\n commercial advantage/private                               10 or more copies within    if 10 or more copies\n financial gain [17 U.S.C. Sec.                             180-day period.             within 180-day period.\n 506(a)(1)].\nWillful infringement by             No criminal liability  Misdemeanor, if 10 or more  FELONY (up to 3 years),\n reproduction or distribution of                            copies within 180-day       if 10 or more copies\n works with value over $10,000 for                          period.                     within 180-day period.\n any reason [17 U.S.C. Sec.\n 506(a)(2)].\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Third, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly \n     recidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony offense \n     under new 18 U.S.C. 2319(c), which refers to new 17 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  506(a)(2). Under existing law, 18 U.S.C. 2319(b)(2), \n     recidivists are subject to up to ten years' imprisonment and \n     a fine for a second felony offense for willful copyright \n     infringement for commercial advantage or private financial \n     gain. The bill would double the penalty to up to six years' \n     imprisonment and a fine for a second felony offense under new \n     17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2) for not-for-profit willful \n     copyright infringement.\n       Finally, the bill would add new subsection Sec.  2319(d), \n     requiring that victims of the offense, including producers \n     and sellers of legitimate, infringed-upon goods or services, \n     holders of intellectual property rights and their legal \n     representatives, be given the opportunity to provide a victim \n     impact statement to the probation officer preparing the \n     presentence report. The bill directs that the statement \n     identify the victim of the offense and the extent and scope \n     of the injury and loss suffered, including the estimated \n     economic impact of the offense on that victim.\n       (e) Unauthorized Fixation and Trafficking of Live Musical \n     Performances. The bill would add new subsection 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  2319A(d) requiring that victims of the offense, \n     including producers and sellers of legitimate, infringed-upon \n     goods or services, holders of intellectual property rights \n     and their legal representatives, be given the opportunity to \n     provide a victim impact statement to the probation officer \n     preparing the presentence report. The bill directs that the \n     statement identify the victim of the offense and the extent \n     and scope of the injury and loss suffered, including the \n     estimated economic impact of the offense on that victim.\n       (f) Trafficking in Counterfeit Goods or Services. The bill \n     would add new subsection 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2320(e) requiring \n     that victims of the offense, including producers and sellers \n     of legitimate, infringed-upon goods or services, holders of \n     intellectual property rights and their legal representatives, \n     be given the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement \n     to the probation officer preparing the presentence report. \n     The bill directs that the statement identify the victim of \n     the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss \n     suffered, including the estimated economic impact of the \n     offense on that victim.\n       (g) Directive to Sentencing Commission. The Sentencing \n     Commission currently takes the view that criminal copyright \n     infringement and trademark counterfeiting are analogous to \n     fraud-related offenses, and that appropriate sentences are to \n     be calculated according to the retail value of the infringing \n     items, rather than of the legitimate copyrighted items which \n     are infringed. This may understate the harm. The bill would \n     direct the Sentencing Commission to ensure that applicable \n     guideline ranges for criminal copyright infringement and \n     violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2319, 2319A and 2320 are \n     sufficiently stringent to deter such crimes, provide for \n     consideration of the retail value and quantity of the \n     legitimate, infringed-upon items, and take into account more \n     than minimal planning and other aggravating factors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Kempthorne, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Gorton):\n  S.J. Res. 35. A joint resolution granting the consent of Congress to \nthe Pacific Northwest Emergency Management Arrangement; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ngrant congressional consent to the Pacific Northwest Emergency \nManagement Arrangement entered into between the States of Alaska, \nIdaho, Oregon, and Washington and the Provinces of British Columbia and \nthe Yukon Territory.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that so many of my colleagues from the \nPacific Northwest have joined me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  This agreement, negotiated and signed by the Governors of the four \nPacific Northwest States and their colleagues in Canada, would \nsignificantly improve multi-State and binational cooperation during the \nresponse phase of natural disasters in the Northwest. In addition, it \nwould provide for region-wide civil defense coordination and guarantee \nresidents of each State emergency services. The agreement does this \nwhile protecting the individual sovereignty of each State and Province.\n  Mr. President, given the impact of recent natural disasters across \nthe Pacific Northwest, my colleagues can easily understand why this \nmeasure is so important. I hope the Senate will act quickly in seeing \nthis measure approved without delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 35\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress Assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT.\n\n       Congress consents to the Pacific Northwest Emergency \n     Management Arrangement entered into between the State of \n     Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, and the Province of \n     British Columbia and the Yukon Territory.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nAmerican and Austrian hero, Baron Georg von Trapp, on the 50th \nanniversary of his death. During his lifetime, Baron von Trapp stood \nfor honor and courage. He held a deep devotion for both his country and \nhis family. Baron von Trapp was remembered on the week-end of July 11, \nin a celebration at the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, VT. I regret that \nI was unable to attend, however I would like to take this opportunity \nto remember the significance of his life, made famous by the 1965 \nmovie, ``The Sound of Music.''\n  It is a reflection of Baron von Trapp's spirit that he is not only an \nAmerican legend, but he is also considered a hero in Austria, the \nhomeland that he fled 60 years ago. It is a tribute to his excellence \nthat the 89 members of the 1997 graduating class of the Theresianum \nMilitary Academy, the Austrian equivalent to West Point, voted Baron \nvon Trapp their class hero, someone whom they all wished to emulate.\n  Baron von Trapp was a celebrated military commander. He was honored \nwith two medals for courage in battle, including the Maria Theresian \nRitter Medal, Austria's highest, for sinking a French submarine in \n1915. He was also influential in the development of submarine warfare \nand torpedoes. However, his love and devotion for his country never \nunderscored the importance of his family. He made an intense connection \nwith his children through music. Out of this connection came the famous \nTrapp Family Singers. When the Nazis invaded and were pressuring Baron \nvon Trapp to join Hitler's ranks, he asked his family if they wanted to \nleave for America, saying that if anyone wanted to stay, they would all \nstay. Everyone wanted to leave.\n  Although nothing could replace the love he had for his homeland, \nBaron von Trapp did grow to love his new home in Vermont. He found new \npassions in maple sugaring and farming. Because they spent most of the \nyear touring, they rented out rooms in their lodge to skiers, starting \nwhat would eventually become a landmark in Vermont, the Trapp Family \nLodge.\n  Once again, I would like to express my admiration for Baron von Trapp \nand his entire family on the anniversary of his death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7777-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          USDA REORGANIZATION\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk briefly about \nthe recent consolidation of administrative functions at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, recently announced by Secretary Dan \nGlickman.\n  In my contact with Secretary Glickman he has said that the changes \nare being aimed at the national headquarters and State offices, but \nthat there will be no additional field office closings or cut in \nservices as a result of this directive.\n  Secretary Glickman has also informed me that an outside study is \nbeing commissioned to assess the workload of parts of the agency, in \nlight of current and anticipated program activity, and will report on \nrecommendations on the county delivery systems.\n  The recent administrative convergence by the Secretary is an effort \nto make the USDA a more efficient and cost-effective agency. No doubt, \nto streamline the agency and improve efficiency, there is a need to \neliminate any duplication of administrative services. However, there is \nalso a need to maintain a vital local field staff with the necessary \nresources available to them so that they can deliver services to our \nproducers.\n  As the USDA continues to make adjustments to its operations, I will \ncontinue to work with the Secretary and solicit feedback from our local \nNebraska offices.\n  The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996, for better or worse, has brought us \ninto a new era of our farm program. To some extent producers, Members \nof Congress, and USDA staff are entering unchartered waters. I will be \ndiligent in my efforts in making sure the USDA, and Congress, is up to \nthe navigational task.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7777-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7777-S7778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO ROLAND AND CLAIRE JUTRAS, NATIONAL 1997 PARENTS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Roland and Claire Jutras of Peterborough, NH, the National \n1997 Parents of the Year. The National Parents' Day Foundation bestowed \nthe honor on the Jutrases after searching the Nation for the parents of \nthe year.\n  Roland Jutras came to town in 1972 to run the town of Peterborough's\n\n[[Page S7778]]\n\nRecreation Department. His 25 years of service to the town's children \nhas earned him much praise and esteem from the community around. Roland \nmet Claire playing at the co-ed evening volleyball league in 1972. They \nwere later married in 1975.\n  Roland and Claire are active members of their community. Roland \nreceived the Peterborough Rotary Club Paul Harris Award in 1989, \nPeterborough Citizen of the Year in 1987, and he was VFW Man of the \nYear in 1981. Roland also served on the ConVal District School Board \nfor 2 years and he taught at St. Peter's Church. Claire is involved in \nmany community activities as well. She has been a Brownie leader for 3 \nyears, a St. Peter's religious education teacher for 4 years, preschool \nteacher, recreation volunteer, and a member of a local sorority \norganization. Claire is also a full-time special education aide at \nPeterborough Elementary School and is known for her warm smile and \ngenerous heart to all of those people she has touched.\n  Roland and Claire have strengthened their family with pride, \ndedication, and love, always first. The Jutras' four daughters have \nearned as much community recognition as their parents. Christine and \nMichelle are seniors at Norwich University, Veronica will be a \nsophomore at Holy Cross in Worcester, MA, in the fall, while Natalie \nwill be a junior at St. Anselem College in Manchester, NH.\n  The National Parents' Day Foundation was founded in 1994 after \nPresident Bill Clinton signed into law the creation of National Parents \nDay on the fourth Sunday of July each year. Every year the foundation \nlooks for parents who are intact married couples with children, people \nof good reputation, couples who mirror in their lives behavior the \nideals we want to see replicated, and people with strong religiously \nbased moral values.\n  Roland and Claire will join 13 other U.S. couples who were finalists \nfor the award this week in a reception here on Capitol Hill. Mr. \nPresident, on Wednesday evening, I look forward to meeting the Jutrases \nhere in a reception to honor this wonderful Granite State couple.\n  Roland and Claire represent the very best in parenting and embody the \nfinest in sacrificial and caring love for children. New Hampshire is \nfortunate to be blessed by their leadership and dedication. I applaud \nRoland and Claire Jutras for their outstanding and caring spirit for \ntheir community and family. I am proud to represent them in the U.S. \nSenate. Congratulations Roland and Claire. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7777-5", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HANLEY JAMES NORMENT\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Mr. Hanley \nNorment, a great civil rights leader and dedicated family man who died \nThursday, July 10, 1997.\n  In 1966, Hanley James Norment came to Washington and a year later, he \nbecame a civil rights officer with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. \nAbout that time, he started volunteering on the local level, rising \nfrom director of media relations to president of the Montgomery County \nbranch of the NAACP. Mr. Norment's political and professional successes \nwere a direct measure of his character. He was an unselfish man, one \nwho put aside the personal for the common good. As his son, Julian, \ncommented, Regardless of philosophical differences, he got along with \nyou, he respected your opinions.\n  Throughout the course of his career as a civil rights leader, Hanley \nNorment relentlessly championed educational causes, pushing for higher \nstandards and equal opportunities for all children, regardless of race. \nHe knew firsthand the value of a good education. Born in Marianna, AR \non January 16, 1932, to Ruby and Samuel Norment, Hanley received his \nearly education in the Arkansas public school system in the Jim Crow \nera. Undaunted by the circumstances of time and place, Norment earned \ntwo B.A. degrees and nearly finished a doctoral degree in political \nscience at the University of Michigan. He used his talents and \nknowledge generously. For more than 20 years, he tutored individual \nstudents through various organizations such as the Alpha Phi Alpha \nfraternity and the NAACP.\n  Mr. Norment was extremely proud of the contributions of his wife, \nChrista, former principal of Montgomery Knolls Elementary School in \nSilver Spring, MD, to the field of education. Their children, Camille \nand Julian, continue the family tradition of academic achievement and \npublic service. Camille is pursuing her second master's degree at New \nYork University and I am proud to have Julian working on my Washington \nstaff. The fruit does not fall far from the tree.\n  Mr. Norment retired in September as director of the Office of Civil \nRights at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Mr. President, I noted in Friday's New York \nTimes the demise of Woolworth's, one of the Nation's best known \nretailers and one with its origins in upstate New York. The Times \narticle quotes Hofstra professor Robert Sobel; ``Woolworth was\n\n[[Page S7779]]\n\n100 years ago what Walmart is today.'' Perhaps in a century Walmart \nwill similarly be remembered as an icon of a by-gone era, but the \nmercantile comparison is apt. With over 8,000 stores worldwide, and \nwith an emphasis on volume purchases and discount prices, Woolworth's \nwas a retailing giant.\n  The early efforts of Frank Winfield Woolworth did not portend such \nsuccess. Born on a farm in Jefferson County in 1852, his favorite \nboyhood game was playing store but initially he was not very good at \nit. At 19 he began working in a village grocery store at no pay, and \ndid so for 2 years. After a similar 3-month internship at Moore & Smith \nin Watertown, he finally secured gainful employment as a store clerk at \n$3.50 a week.\n  Dollar stores might seem to be a late 20th century development, but \nin 1875 there was a profitable 99 cent store in Watertown. Mr. A. \nBushnell hired Woolworth as a $10-dollar-a-week clerk in a 99 cent \nstore he was opening in Port Huron, MI. Woolworth's lack of \nsalesmanship led to a $1.50 cut in his salary. Still, he saw the \npossibilities of a store with all merchandise priced the same. In 1877 \nWoolworth returned to Moore & Smith. The next year he persuaded his \nemployers to try a counter at a county fair on which all items sold for \nfive cents. It was a great success.\n  Woolworth persuaded Mr. Moore to back him with $300 for a five cent \nstore on Bleeker Street in Utica, but it failed after 3 months. \nWoolworth realized that he had not had enough variety in his stock so \nin 1879 he opened a new store in Lancaster, PA with a line of ten-cent \nitems as well. This one succeeded. Woolworth soon perfected the \ncombination of inexpensive items you occasionally needed with \ninexpensive items you occasionally wanted. He opened his second store \nin Reading in 1884 and continued to expand. By 1909 Woolworth was in a \nposition to commission the tallest building in the world, which the \nWoolworth Building was when it was completed in 1913.\n  Woolworth's early partners had opened their own chains of five and \ntens. In 1912 they all were absorbed by the F.W. Woolworth Co., giving \nWoolworth control over 596 stores. He constantly strived to expand his \nline of five and ten cent merchandise, and was able to keep costs down \nby having goods manufactured especially for his chain, sometimes buying \nan entire year's output from a factory.\n  Frank Woolworth died in 1919. His empire continued to grow. By 1954, \n75 years after his first sale, Woolworth's had 2,850 stores and $700 \nmillion in annual sales. Six years later sales topped $1 billion. But \nchanges on the American landscape and in the retail world were \nunderway, and they would eventually lead to Friday's announcement. The \nemigration to the suburbs and competition from drug stores, specialty \nstores, malls, and large retailers along the highways finally wore down \none of the pillars of Main Street.\n  Woolworth's will be fondly remembered by millions of its customers \nwho dined at the lunch counter and purchased some of life's little \nnecessities there. The company also stands as a testament to the \npossibilities when one person has one good idea and endless \ndetermination. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7778-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE VERMONT STATE POLICE FOR 50 YEARS OF EXEMPLARY SERVICE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nextend my heartfelt congratulations to the Vermont State Police on the \noccasion of their 50th anniversary.\n  It all started on July 1, 1947, when the Department of Public Safety, \nhome of the Vermont State Police, was established by the Vermont \nGeneral Assembly. Although Vermont was one of the last in the Nation to \ncreate a State police force, it is widely regarded as one of the \ncountry's best. At its inception, it was comprised of 55 State troopers \nand 7 civilians.\n  During the department's 50 years of service, Vermont's population has \nincreased by over 50 percent. As Vermont changed, so did the \ndepartment. Today, it also includes a larger civilian force to assist \nwith laboratory procedures and other non-law enforcement related work. \nTechnological advances such as the introduction of radar as a speed \nenforcement tool, the purchase of the first polygraph instrument, and \nthe creation of a mobile crime lab unit all increased the department's \nability to deal with the rising challenges facing law enforcement \ntoday.\n  The changing societal and family dynamics have greatly impacted our \npolice force. Today, our troopers must be trained differently to meet \nthese challenges. What remains the same, however, is the dedication, \nprofessionalism, and exemplary service we have been accustomed to--in \nspite of the ever present dangers of the job. On any given day, a \ntrooper's job might range from assisting a stranded motorist on \nInterstate 89 to a homicide call in the northeast kingdom.\n  For 50 years the department has helped improve our communities and \ngiven our citizens a sense of security. On behalf of all Vermonters I \nwould like to thank the Department of Public Safety, and wish them \ncontinued success. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7779-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MONTANA WORLD TRADE CENTER\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in today's world, trade doesn't \nstop at the borders. Whatever business you're in, and whether you \noperate a Fortune 500 company or a small family farm, every day you \nhave more opportunities and more competitors overseas.\n  That's why an organization like the Montana World Trade Center is so \nvaluable to our State. We are a small business State. We have small \ntimber mills, environmental technology firms, Indian manufacturing \ncompanies, and family farms.\n  And, Mr. President, our Fortune 500 companies may well have all the \ninformation and all the connections they need to succeed in world \ntrade. More power to them. But a small Montana farmer, or a specialized \nhigh-techology business, simply doesn't have the money and manpower to \nkeep up with overseas opportunities.\n  Even at the most basic logistical level, the paperwork and customs \nforms associated with imports and exports can be too much for a small \nbusiness to handle. Additional burdens include finding foreign partners \nin faraway countries--and while Canada makes up about half our exports, \nother Montana markets range around the world, from Kuwait to the \nPhilippines to Bangladesh.\n  So our Montana farms, ranches, and businesses can gain a lot from the \nworld marketplace. But they often need expert assistance in finding \nlikely markets and partners abroad. And they need early warning when \nforeign competitors try to take advantage of them--as one firm found a \nChinese company pirating its hunting decoy designs and advertising them \nin sportsmens' magazines.\n  That is what the Montana World Trade Center provides. And the $2.5 \nmillion grant included in this bill will help the center meet that \ngoal. It will help Montanans compete in the world marketplace and \nexport more effectively. That is critical to our State's economic \nfuture. So this grant is a good investment that will pay off in new \nexports and more jobs.\n  I hope the Senate will approve it. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7779-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7779-S7780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FRANK AND MARION HAWKINS' 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Geofferey was \nchosen to represent the Granite State at the national program.

These are \ncertainly accomplishments of which he should be very proud, and I \napplaud him for his achievements.\n  Boys State and Boys Nation are week-long programs that aim to teach \nyoung men to be responsible citizens by teaching them how the \nGovernment works. The students set up a legislature where they \nintroduce and debate bills in order to learn the complexities of \ndemocracy. While learning about the ins and outs of the Government, he \nwill also learn interpersonal skills and the importance of listening, \nunderstanding and working together.\n  Geofferey enjoys politics and may pursue a career in a related field. \nI congratulate Geofferey on his outstanding accomplishments. I commend \nhis hard work and perseverance and wish him luck at Boys Nation. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/21/senate-section/article/S7780-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7780-S7783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  Mr. BOND.
