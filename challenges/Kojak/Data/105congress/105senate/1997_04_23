Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty. Under the \nprevious order, there will be 10 hours of debate to be equally divided \nbetween the chairman and the ranking member or their designees and 1 \nhour under the control of Senator Leahy. Also, in accordance with the \nagreement, a limited number of amendments are in order to the \nresolution of ratification.\n  The Senate will recess at 12:30 p.m. until the hour of 2:15 to allow \nfor the weekly policy meetings, and when the Senate reconvenes, we will \nresume consideration of the treaty. I hope that perhaps we could get an \nagreement to have one of the votes occur later on this afternoon. I \nbelieve there may have been some discussions on that. If not, we will \nhave the votes on motions to strike, if any. There, I believe, were \nfive agreed to in our unanimous-consent agreement, and, of course, we \nare anticipating that the final vote will occur sometime tomorrow \nnight, I assume between 5, 6 and 8 o'clock. And, of course, as always, \nwe will notify Senators of anticipated rollcall votes as early as \npossible. But there would not be one, if any, today until late in the \nday. There will be a number of votes throughout the day on Thursday, \nand I urge Senators to be prepared to answer the votes quickly so that \nwe can get through the five motions to strike that may be offered under \nthe agreement and to final passage at a reasonable hour tomorrow.\n  Also, unless there were a lot of yielding back of time, I do not \nanticipate that we could finish even in the early afternoon or late \nafternoon on Thursday. I think it clearly is going to go into the \nevening.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would be glad to yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will withhold yielding the floor and yield to the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Before the clock starts to toll here on the 10 hours, I \nunderstand the distinguished chairman of the committee is running just \na little bit late, and he asked whether or not it would be permissible \nto have a 10-minute quorum call; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. He is willing to go ahead if you would like.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to just wait and give the chairman the \nopportunity to make his statement.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will put in a quorum then until the chairman is here and \nready to resume the discussions. I know they are going to be very \ninteresting.\n  The Senator from Delaware is not going to go through that whole book, \nis he?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished leader, \ndepending on how many votes we have, I may go through only a very small \nportion of it.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Jeanine Esperne, John \nRood, and David Stephens be granted the privilege of the floor for the \nduration of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the Senate begins final consideration of \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, the immortal words of Yogi Berra come \nto mind. Everybody remembers them. ``It's deja vu, all over again.''\n  If anyone is wondering why Jesse Helms, Senator from North Carolina, \nis quoting a New York Yankee, it is because I always liked Yogi. And we \nhave been here before, meaning the Senate. The point being that the \nSenate scheduled a time certain last September to take up this very \nsame treaty. But, on the day of the scheduled vote, the White House \nasked to withdraw the treaty. Why? Well, because there were not 67 \nvotes necessary to pass it.\n  The White House stonewalled and refused to address the key concerns \nraised by Senators about the treaty, concerns relating to its \nuniversality, its verifiability, and crushing effect on business \nbecause they had opposed even the most reasonable modifications \nproposed by this Senator and many others. That is why the treaty was \nwithdrawn last year. So, here we go again, with most of those critical \nconcerns remaining in the treaty: The Chemical Weapons Convention \ncertainly is not global, it is not verifiable, and it will not work. \nEven its proponents admit it cannot effectively prevent the spread of \nchemical weaponry.\n\n  Time and time again, the administration has portrayed this agreement \nas one that will provide for a global ban on chemical weapons. I \nrecently read a poll showing that 84 percent of the American people \nbelieved that this body should ratify a treaty which would ``ban the \nproduction, possession, transfer and use of poison gas worldwide.'' \nThat was the question asked in the poll. I quoted it verbatim. If this \ntreaty accomplished such a ban, I would be the first Senator on this \nfloor, along with Senator Kyl, urging its approval. Had the pollster \ncalled me at home, I--if I knew nothing about the treaty, as most \nAmericans do not--I probably would have been among the 84 percent.\n  In any event, more than 8 years ago, at the confirmation hearing of \nJim Baker to be Secretary of State, I noted President Bush's statement \nthat he wanted to be able to tell his grandchildren that he, ``was able \nto ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the Earth.'' \nQuote, unquote, George Bush. I remarked at that hearing that I, too, \nwould like to be able to tell my grandchildren that I helped the \nPresident and the Secretary of State attain such a goal. And that \nstatement that I made then is just as true today as it was on the day \nthat I made it. But I cannot and will not sign off on a multilateral \ntreaty that accomplishes none--n-o-n-e--none of the goals it purports \nto address.\n  I have, on 5 January first days of the Senate, stood right over there \nby the dais, raised my right hand, and pledged to support and defend \nour country and its Constitution. I have presided over many hearings \ndedicated to the careful examination of this treaty. Earlier this \nmonth, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony by and \nfrom four former U.S. Defense Secretaries--Dick Cheney, Cap Weinberger, \nJim Schlesinger, Don Rumsfeld, all four urging the Senate not--not to \nratify this dangerously defective treaty.\n  These distinguished Americans are by no means alone. More than 50 \ngenerals and admirals and senior officials from previous \nadministrations have joined them in opposing this chemical weapons \ntreaty--convention--call it what you will. And why have all these great \nAmericans urged that the Senate reject this treaty? I will tell you \nwhy. Their case can be summarized this simply: It is not global, it is \nnot verifiable, and it will not work. No supporter of this treaty can \ntell us with a straight face how this treaty will actually accomplish \nthe goals that they have advertised so profusely for it.\n  The best argument they have mustered to date is, as I understand it, \n``Oh, yes, it is defective, but it is better than nothing,'' they say. \nOr they tell us that ``It creates an international norm against the \nproduction of these weapons.'' But, in fact, this treaty is worse then \nnothing.\n  But, in fact, Mr. President, this treaty is worse than nothing, for \nthis treaty gives the American people a false sense of security that \nsomething is being done in Washington, DC, to reduce the dangers of \nchemical weaponry when, in fact, nothing is being done with or by this \ntreaty. If anything, this treaty puts the American people at greater \nrisk.\n  That is why the administration wants to avoid at all costs a real \ndebate on the merits of this treaty. They know that they cannot defend \nit. They say it is better than nothing. No, it is not. So they have \nresorted to a number of assertions that simply do not hold up under \nscrutiny. They have put forward, for example, the ``America as a rogue \nstate'' argument. They have said it over and over again. ``Rogue state, \nrogue state.''\n  They say if we don't ratify the CWC, we will be left ``in the company \nof pariah nations, like Iraq and North Korea,'' who have refused to \njoin. And then they have hit us with, ``Well, everybody's doing it. It \nis going to go into effect anyhow,'' they say, and have said over and \nover again, ``with or without the United States, so we might as well go \nwith the flow and sign up.''\n  Sorry, Mr. President--and I mean the distinguished Senator who is \npresiding, Mr. President, and I mean the President down on Pennsylvania \nAvenue as well--sorry, Mr. President, the oath that I have taken five \ntimes standing right over there forbids my taking part in such \nsophistry.\n  Anyhow, since when did America start letting Belgium and Luxembourg \nand France and Bangladesh dictate our national security policy? The \nSenate should decide whether or not to approve this treaty on the basis \nof whether it is in the national interest of the United States and the \nAmerican people, not to respond to diplomatic momentum of the moment. \nFrankly, I take offense at the argument that this administration is \nmaking widely and\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nfrequently, that rejecting this dangerous and flawed treaty would make \nAmerica the moral--get this--the moral equivalent of terrorist states--\nthat means governments, countries--terrorist governments like Syria and \nIraq and Libya and North Korea. These pariahs are, at this very moment, \nmanufacturing chemical weapons to use against us. Don't make any \nmistake about that. That is what they are doing right now as we meet.\n  We are unilaterally destroying our chemical stockpiles with or \nwithout the Chemical Weapons Convention, and I think that such \nrhetorical blackmail may offend the American people. We will see. The \npolls are already turning around, by the way.\n  Mr. President, I made a commitment to the American people that I \nwould bring this chemical weapons treaty to the Senate floor only if it \ncontained all the key protections necessary to ensure that this treaty \ndoes no harm, even if it can do no good, and that is exactly what is \nhappening. That is exactly why this treaty is the pending business in \nthe U.S. Senate at this moment.\n  The resolution of ratification that is now pending before the Senate \naddresses all the inherent weaknesses of this treaty. With this \nresolution of ratification, I can vote for this treaty in good \nconscience, and I would dissuade no Senator from doing the same, \nobviously. But if those key protections are removed, taken out--and the \nadministration says it is going to happen, they are going to be taken \nout, they boast--then we should refuse to ratify this treaty for the \nreasons that we will discuss in greater detail in the hours ahead.\n  I doubt that there is a Senator in this body who has not heard a \ngreat deal about the 28 conditions in this resolution of ratification \nthat have been agreed upon by the distinguished Senator Biden, who is \nthe ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nadministration, and me. I commend my friend, Joe Biden, for his \nwillingness to work with me in good faith to address those issues. I \nhave told him so privately, and I now tell him so publicly. As Joe \nBiden has pointed out, he spent many hours in my office in direct \nnegotiations with me and my staff in an effort to reach some common \nground.\n  Many of the 28 conditions contain commonsense provisions that never \nshould have been contested by the administration in the first place. \nFor example, these conditions, among other things, require the creation \nof an inspector general. They limit the burden on the American \ntaxpayer. They preserve the Australia Group. They assert the right to \nuse tear gas in combat situations.\n\n  Let me tell you something, if they had not yielded on that question \nabout our using tear gas to help our downed pilots escape from the \nenemy, this treaty would never have come to the floor. Unfortunately, \nthe Clinton administration has made clear--made clear--that it intends \nto remove five vital protections that Senator Lott and I and others \nhave included to address the defects of the treaty, or some of them. By \nstripping those key conditions from this resolution, the administration \nis asking the Senate to ratify a treaty which, first, will affect \nalmost none of the terrorist regimes whose possession of chemical \nweapons actually threatens the United States, such as Libya, Iraq, \nSyria, and North Korea; second, which the administration admits that \nthey can't verify, and they can't verify this treaty. Do you remember \nwhat Ronald Reagan used to say? Trust but verify. Ronald Reagan is sort \nof halfway implicitly credited with this treaty. I think I knew Ronald \nReagan as well as anybody. I was the first sitting Senator to support \nRonald Reagan's candidacy, and I knew how he felt about treaties \nbecause he felt then as I feel now about treaties.\n  Third, the administration knows that Russia is already violating the \nchemical weapons treaty, even before it goes into effect, by pursuing \nan entirely new generation of chemical agents specifically designed to \ncircumvent the CWC, as we call it around this place, violating Russia's \nexisting bilateral chemical weapons agreement with the United States \nsigned some years ago and--I have to use this word--lying about their \nchemical stockpiles. And we are supposed to trot in and ratify this \ntreaty? Not this Senator. Not this Senator.\n  Fourth, the administration is supporting a treaty which allows \ninspectors from China and rogue states, such as Iran, to descend upon \nAmerican businesses, rifle through the business confidential documents \nin each of these places, to interrogate the employees of the business, \nand to remove secret business information and chemical samples whenever \nthey want to.\n  A law enforcement officer in the United States cannot do that. You \nhave to get a search warrant issued by a court.\n  Fifth, the administration feels that under articles X and XI, which \ninvolve the transfer of dangerous chemicals, chemical manufacturing \ntechnology and advanced chemical defense gear to any nation who signs \non, including terrorist states like Iran and Cuba and known \nproliferators, such as Russia and China, the administration said, ``No, \nno, we can't have that. We can't have that.'' That's what they say. We \nare going to find out tomorrow, or perhaps earlier, how the U.S. Senate \nfeels about that, because there is going to be a vote on that specific \nquestion.\n  We have protections in the current resolution of ratification which \naddress all of these issues, as I have said before, and while all of \nthese matters are vitally important, the final concluding issue, I \nbelieve, is the key to this entire debate. What is it?\n  The proponents of this treaty have been telling the American people \nover and over and over again that this treaty will ``ban chemical \nweapons from the face of the Earth.'' How many times have I heard that \nby some very good friends of mine in the administration? Let me tell \nthem something, and let me tell you something, Mr. President. With \narticles X and XI intact, this treaty will, in fact, do the exact \nopposite. It will, in fact, facilitate the spread of poison gas to the \nvery rogue countries most likely to use it against American citizens.\n  So I guess the question is, who would give the terrorist crowd in \nIran chemical agents and chemical technology that they can use to build \nchemical weapons? Who would do that? Who would vote to give Iran the \nsecrets to our most advanced chemical defensive equipment, the \ntechnology we have designed to protect our troops from poison-gas \nattack? Not this U.S. Senator. I will never, never vote to do that, \nbecause I stood over there five times and said I would not. But that is \nexactly what the Clinton administration is asking us to do by insisting \nthat we ratify this treaty with articles X and XI intact.\n\n  Do not take my word about all of this. Heed the warnings of some \npeople that I believe most Americans admire and respect. Let's take \nSecretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who served in a previous \nadministration, the Bush administration. Dick Cheney provided written \ntestimony to the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month. Let me \nquote him. This is Dick Cheney talking:\n\n       Articles X and XI amount to a formula for greatly \n     accelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare \n     capabilities around the world.\n\n  I have heard Dick Cheney make many a speech, but I never before heard \nhim as emphatic in his declaration about anything previous to this.\n  Mr. President, anybody who wants a road map for how this will work \nneed only examine how Russia has taken advantage of similar provisions \nin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Today, Russia is using the \nNNPT to justify, what? To justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors \nunder a provision known as atoms for peace. Under the chemical weapons \ntreaty, articles X and XI, or poisons for peace provisions, as we call \nthem, Russia and/or China could decide, for example, to build a \nchemical manufacturing facility in Iran and argue not only that are \nthey allowed to give Iran this technology, but that they are obligated \nto do it under a treaty, mind you, that a lot of people are advocating \nthat the United States Senate ratify tomorrow before dark.\n  Worse still, the Chemical Weapons Convention also requires that we \nshare our latest advanced chemical defensive gear with all of these \ncountries. What that means is that, through reverse engineering, Iran \ncould figure out how to penetrate our chemical defense, increasing not \nonly the risk of American\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\ntroops being exposed to poison gas but the chances of a chemical attack \nactually taking place by undermining the defensive deterrent value.\n  The administration has agreed that it will not give such American \ntechnology to Iran. I think they mean it as far as it goes, but this \nagreement with the President will not stop other countries from doing \nit. Articles X and XI still facilitate trade in these technologies with \nmore than 100 countries, many, if not most, of which do not share our \npolicy of isolating Iran, don't you see. If they get access to United \nStates defensive technology under the chemical weapons treaty, they \nwill share it with other signatories, like Iran. And they could do so \nlawfully without violating the treaty. Further, they will share their \nown defense technology against dangerous dual-use chemicals regardless \nof what the United States says or does.\n  What will happen once we put a plethora of chemical and defensive \nsecrets out on the world market? I think you know, Mr. President. It \nwill be only a matter of time, and a short time, before these rogue \nstates which do not sign the treaty will get access to these defensive \nsecrets. Iran will certainly share them with Syria and Libya. And who \nknows who they will, in turn, share them with.\n  Ronald Reagan, as I said earlier, said that our policy in arms \ncontrol--arms control of all types--must be ``trust but verify.'' With \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention we can do neither. So why would we \nagree to a treaty which would share advanced chemicals and know-how and \ndefensive gear with unworthy regimes? That is precisely the question \nbefore the U.S. Senate today.\n  We can ratify the CWC with these key protections in place. But if the \nadministration insists on stripping them out, taking them out, then \nthey will have invited the Senate to refuse to ratify the chemical \nweapons treaty. It is up to them. Unless we include protections on \nthese issues, any agreement we have reached on other matters amounts to \nlittle more than adding sweetener to hemlock. They may make the treaty \neasier to swallow, but it remains, Mr. President, just as deadly as \never before and just as injurious to the national security interest of \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, we know Senators plan to address important aspects of \nthis convention; therefore, at this time I shall defer to my colleagues \nwho may wish to discuss this convention in greater detail, beginning \nwith my distinguished friend, Senator Biden.\n  For the reasons I have discussed and for the reasons that Senators \nwill hear in the hours ahead, obviously, I am strongly urging the \nSenate to oppose any amendments to strike key protections from the \nresolution of ratification.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself as much time as may be necessary.\n  Mr. President, as my distinguished friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, leaves the floor, let me note that he and I came to the \nSenate the same year, 1972. I, like he, on five occasions --four here \nand one in a hospital--raised my right hand and swore to uphold the \nConstitution. We have both done that, to the best of my knowledge, for \nthe past 24 years.\n  Let me just say that just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, \nsecurity and upholding the oath of office, how to protect and defend \nthe United States of America, is in the eye of the Senator. I do not \ndoubt for one single second that my friend from North Carolina believes \nwhat he says, that he does not believe this treaty is in the interest \nof the United States of America and, by inference, he would not be \nupholding or defending the Constitution of the United States were he to \nvote for it, other than with the killer amendments attached to it that \nwould effectively end the treaty.\n\n  I think it is important for the listeners to put in perspective a \nlittle focus here as to how much verification is necessary to defend \nour interest and how much is enough and what tradeoffs constitute our \ninterests.\n  Let me just say that my friend and I have worked together for years \nand years. As I said, we came here together, 1972. We got elected in \nthe same year. To the best of my knowledge, my friend has not voted on \nthe floor for an arms control agreement, ever.\n  Although the Senate overwhelmingly passed the START Treaty negotiated \nby Ronald Reagan--``trust but verify'' Reagan--my friend from North \nCarolina voted against it because he did not think it was verifiable. \nRonald Reagan thought it was verifiable. Ronald Reagan, who said \n``trust but verify,'' he negotiated the treaty. He sent it to the U.S. \nSenate. We voted for it. Senator Helms did not.\n  I do not say this as a criticism but an observation. Because if you \nlisten to Senator Helms, it makes it sound as though he is just like \nRonald Reagan. Well, he is not like Ronald Reagan. Bush finally \nconcluded the START I agreement, but it was Reagan who had negotiated \nit. Reagan supported the START I agreement. President Reagan, I \nunderstand, supported the START II agreement. Senator Helms voted \nagainst both of them because he did not believe they were--and I \nbelieve he meant it--he did not believe they were in the security \ninterests of the United States of America.\n  So again the reason I mention it is that you will hear a lot of \nappeals to authority today. You will hear a number of ad hominem \narguments and a number of infallible arguments invoked on the floor of \nthe Senate today by all of us. It is a debating technique. But I think \none of my objectives today is going to try to be sort of the truth \nsquad here, to make sure we are comparing apples and apples and oranges \nand oranges and we remember who did what.\n  So before the day is over, someone probably will invoke the name of \nGeorge McGovern, somehow. I do not know how George McGovern will get \ninto this, but I promise you that will happen as evidence that these \narms control treaties are bad things that just soft-headed liberals do. \nRonald Reagan is no soft-headed liberal.\n  My friend from North Carolina is a staunch conservative, but he \nparted company with other staunch conservatives who thought START I, \nSTART II and the INF agreements were all bad treaties. We negotiated \nthe INF agreement when Senator Helms and I were here. Ronald Reagan \nproposed that. I do not know how he voted on that. But I would not be \nsurprised if he voted against that. And ``trust but verify'' Reagan not \nonly negotiated it, but submitted it.\n  Mr. President, the debate we are commencing today is not only about a \nglobal treaty--it is important, it is global, and it addresses the \nchemical weapons threat. Quite frankly--and my distinguished friend \nfrom Indiana, Senator Lugar, will speak to this at length because he is \nso articulate when he does--it is about nothing less than America's \nleadership in the post-cold-war era. I mean, it really is that simple.\n  It is above and beyond the issue of merely the chemical weapons \ntreaty, which I will speak to in detail, and why this treaty is such a \ngood treaty. But it is well beyond that. It is well beyond that.\n  Over the course of two decades and three administrations, the United \nStates of America has led--has led--the world in developing a \ncomprehensive treaty designed to outlaw chemical weapons. Now, less \nthan a week before this treaty goes into effect, with or without the \nUnited States of America, the world watches to see what the world's \ngreatest deliberative body is going to do. I mean, it sounds a bit \nmelodramatic, but it is literally that serious. It is that fundamental.\n  This treaty is going into effect no matter what happens, because the \nway the treaty is, if over 65 nations signed on to it, it automatically \ngoes into effect 6 months later. So whether we vote for it or not, a \ntotal of 74 nations of the world have now said, ``This is a good \ntreaty. We sign on to it. We commit to it.'' So it is going into \neffect.\n\n  What is it going to look like, as the world watches us--and, believe \nit or not, they watch us; the American public may not watch us a lot \nhere in the Senate but the rest of the world is watching--when the \npossessor of the one of the two largest stockpiles of chemical weapons \nin the world, who unilaterally agreed to destroy those weapons--us--\nwhen we do not ratify a\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\ntreaty that 74 nations have already ratified?\n  But there are the anti-arms controllers who believe there has never \nbeen an arms control agreement that is worth having. I respectfully \nsuggest that the Senator from North Carolina is among them.\n  He stood up on the floor when we were debating this before it came on \nthe floor, and he said, quoting someone, that America ``has never lost \na war, nor has it ever won a treaty.''\n  Remember, that is what this is about. This dividing line is between \npeople who believe that there is no way in the world you can \nmultilaterally sign on to anything because you cannot trust anybody; \nthe only thing we can trust is ourselves. Therefore, whatever we do, do \nit unilaterally. Senator Helms has never voted for an arms control \ntreaty on the floor of the U.S. Senate, including the ones negotiated \nby Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush. We have all been here for all \nthose Presidents.\n  I am not being critical. I just want to make you understand the \ndividing line here. This is not about the little pieces. This is about \nwhether or not you think we can have any kind of multilateral \nagreements relative to controlling any kind of arms.\n  Our friend from Arizona, the distinguished Senator, Senator Kyl, \nintroduced a unilateral effort to stem chemical weapons. It was great, \nbut it does not affect any other nations. No one else signed on to it. \nThat is sort of the mantra you get from our friends who oppose arms \ncontrol--we can do it ourselves. But how can we control the rest of the \nworld unless they are part of an agreement that we are part of?\n  The real issue is, will we remain in the forefront of the battle to \ncontain weapons of mass destruction, the preeminent security threat of \nthis era, or will we retreat from the challenge and be lulled into \nbelieving we can combat this scourge of chemical weapons on our own? I \nknow what the answer to that is. The answer is: We cannot do it on our \nown. I hope the Senate will answer in the affirmative that we have to \ndo this globally.\n  But before we face that moment of decision sometime tomorrow evening, \nwe are going to spend 2 days in debate here, and we are going to vote \nwhen I move to strike five specific conditions on the Helms proposal \nthat is before us.\n  As we commence this debate, I think it is instructive to briefly \ntrace the history of the problem of poison gas and the efforts of the \nworld community to address the threat.\n  Today is April 23. And 82 years ago, almost, today, 82 years ago \nyesterday, April 22, at 5 o'clock in the evening, a green cloud boiled \nup out of the east near the town of Ypres in Flanders.\n  The modern use of chemical weapons had begun. On that day, the use of \nchlorine gas achieved a significant tactical advantage for the German \nattackers in World War I. But within 8 days, gas masks were made \navailable to the allies and, thereafter, in World War I, the use of \npoison gas as a method of warfare was not especially effective as \ncompared to the primary weapons of artillery and machine guns. But \n``terrible beauty had been born,'' to paraphrase Yeats--poison gas had \nbeen used.\n  As a weapon of terror, poison gas continued to be exceedingly \neffective in World War I and had an appalling effect on its victims \nalong the front lines. Soldiers in trenches knew all too well the \nterror and horror of gas. Wilfred Owen, who was killed in action in \n1918 described the terror in his poem, ``Dulce et Decorum Est.'' I \nwould like to read from that poem.\n\n     Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!--An ecstasy of fumbling,\n     Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,\n     But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,\n     And floundering like a man in fire or lime.\n     Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,\n     As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n     In all my dreams, before my helpless sight.\n     He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n\n     If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace\n     Behind the wagon that we flung him in,\n     And watch the white eyes writing in his face,\n     His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;\n     If you could hear, at every jolt the blood\n     Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\n     Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\n     Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\n     My friend, you would not tell with such high zest.\n     To children ardent for some desperate glory,\n     The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est,\n     Pro patria mori.\n\nTranslated, it means: It is sweet and fitting to die for the \nfatherland.\n  The international revulsion against the use of poison gas in World \nWar I led the United States, once again, to press for an international \nagreement banning the practice. The result, in 1925, was the Geneva \nProtocol, which prohibits the use in war of poison gas and \nbacteriological weapons. For much of this century, with a few \nexceptions, this norm was honored. During the Second World War, where \nrestraints were hardly the rule, no party saw fit to violate the norm. \nEven Adolf Hitler obeyed it, although presumably not out of any sense \nof honor, but out of fear of allied retaliation. Hitler's restraint on \nthe battlefield, unfortunately, did not carry forward to the \nconcentration camps where he used gas to slaughter defenseless \ninnocents, millions of them.\n  The norm contained in the Geneva Protocol eroded considerably in the \n1980's, when both parties in the Iran-Iraq War employed gas during a \nwar of attrition that ended in stalemate. The use of chemical weapons \nin that war provided no significant breakthroughs on the battlefield, \nbut it did give Saddam Hussein an idea, and that idea was to use poison \ngas against defenseless civilians in Iraqi Kurdistan following a cease-\nfire in the war with Iran.\n  In August 1988, Saddam launched his final offensive against dozens of \nvillages, killing hundreds and causing tens of thousands to flee to \nneighboring countries. A staff report prepared for the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee by our present Ambassador to Croatia, Peter \nGalbraith, was based on interviews with survivors. He described the \natrocities in vivid detail in that report: ``The bombs''--meaning the \nchemical bombs--``did not produce a large explosion, only a weak sound \nthat could be heard, and then a yellowish cloud spread from the center \nof the explosion. Those who were very close to the bombs died almost \ninstantly. Those who did not die instantly found it difficult to \nbreathe and began to vomit. The gas stung the eyes, skin, and lungs of \nthe villagers exposed to it. Many suffered temporary blindness. After \nthe bombs exploded, many villagers ran and submerged themselves in \nnearby streams to escape the spreading gas. Many of those that made it \nto the streams survived. Those who could not run from the growing \nsmell--mostly the very old and the very young--died. The survivors, who \nsaw the dead reported that blood could be seen trickling out of the \nmouths of some of the bodies, a yellowish fluid could also be seen \noozing out of the noses and mouths of some of the dead. Some said the \nbodies appeared frozen. Many of the dead bodies turned blackish blue.''\n  Saddam's outrageous act, unfortunately, prompted only muted response \nfrom the world community. One of the few sounds of protest came from \nthis body, where Senator Claiborne Pell, now retired, and the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Helms, promptly introduced legislation to \nimpose sanctions against Iraq. The bill sailed through the Senate on a \nvoice vote the day after it was introduced. Unfortunately, the Reagan \nadministration, at that time still operating under the delusion that it \ncould deal with Saddam, denounced the chairman's bill as premature and \nlater succeeded in blocking its enactment in the final days of the \n100th Congress--a fact we tend to forget.\n  Saddam's atrocities, although not a violation of the Geneva \nProtocol--you know, it wasn't a violation of the Geneva Protocol. That \nGeneva Protocol only banned the use of chemical weapons in war. This \nwas not a war. So the irony of all ironies is that the first guy to use \npoison gas since the Italians in Ethiopia in the 1930's, didn't even \nviolate the Geneva Protocol. It was used in the Iran-Iraq War, which \nwas a violation because that was international war.\n  The Geneva Protocol bans the use of chemical weapons in warfare, and \nthe extensive use of gas in the Iran-Iraq War was banned but still \noccurred. Ironically, it had a positive effect, Mr. President. They \ncatalyzed the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on \nstrengthening the Geneva\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\nProtocol, which were already underway. President Reagan gave the effort \na very important push--that is, the effort to deal with containing \nchemical weapons--during his annual address to the U.N. General \nAssembly that fall, where he urged the parties to the protocol, as well \nas other concerned states, to convene a conference to review the \ndeterioration of respect of the norm against the use of chemical \nweapons.\n\n  France obliged President Reagan by hosting a special conference in \nJanuary 1989. Eighteen months later, Saddam Hussein struck again by \ninvading Kuwait this time. But this time the international community, \nled by President Bush, reacted forcefully to Saddam's latest outrage. \nThankfully, chemical weapons were not used in the gulf war, although \nSaddam suggested he might do so. And an Iraqi weapons depot containing \nsuch weapons was destroyed by coalition forces after the war. \nIronically, the only reported exposure to poison gas for allied troops \nresulted from an Iraqi stockpile that was perfectly legal under \ninternational law. The only thing illegal is to use it in international \nconflict--not to manufacture it, not to stockpile it, and not to use it \ninternally.\n  The specter that chemical weapons might have been used in the gulf \nwar, however, gave a new urgency to the negotiations on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. In May 1991, President Bush who, as Vice President, \nhad first proposed the draft treaty in 1984 on behalf of President \nReagan--so Reagan proposed the first draft--President Bush announced \nseveral steps that spurred the negotiations to a successful conclusion. \nSpecifically, he declared that the United States would forswear the use \nof chemical weapons against any state, effective when the Chemical \nWeapons Convention enters into force. Additionally, the United States \ncommitted to destroy all its chemical weapons stockpile.\n  So I want to get something straight here. Whether or not we are \nmembers of this treaty and have the benefits, we are going to destroy \nour chemical weapons anyway. We have already decided to do that. We \nhave already pledged to do that. President Bush pledged that once the \nconvention went into force, we would also forswear the use, period. The \nBush proposal, made at the time, had the desired effect. Within months, \nthe negotiations on the Chemical Weapons Convention were completed. The \ntreaty was signed by Secretary of State Eagleburger on January 13, \n1993, 1 week before President Bush left office.\n  Now, Mr. President, this review of the history of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention is necessary not only to set the stage for this \ndebate, in my view, but also to rebut the myth which has arisen in some \nquarters that this is President Clinton's treaty. This is President \nBush's treaty and President Reagan's treaty. The treaty was initiated \nby Reagan, concluded by Bush. This week, we can continue that \nRepublican legacy by giving the Senate's consent to ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention. So this is not a product of anything other \nthan the intensive efforts on the part of this administration to pass a \ntreaty signed by a Republican President, of which this President did \nnot change a single word, did not have one bit of input on. The only \ninput the present President had is on seeking the Senate's approval. \nHad President Bush been reelected, it would be real clear that this is \na total Republican product, which is a good thing, not a bad thing. The \nreason I am bothering to say this is, if you listen here, you hear a \nlot of confusing talk, because some of my Republican friends \nunderstandably aren't real crazy about President Clinton, you will hear \nthis talked about, saying the President did this and that, and the \nPresident promised this or that. This President had nothing to do with \nthis treaty, zero, nothing. In getting it ratified, he has been \ntremendous in helping that process. So I do not want anybody getting \nconfused here. If you do not like this treaty, dislike it for a good \nreason. Don't dislike it because you do not like the foreign policy of \nClinton or you do not like the domestic policy of Clinton or you do not \nlike President Clinton. This is a Republican treaty, born and bred.\n\n  By the way, I think it is one of their proudest achievements. I think \nit is a fine thing, and they deserve the credit. But let's not get into \nthese--you will hear these ad hominem arguments this day about this \nliberal President did this liberal thing; we got sucked in by these \nall-knowing and smarter nations to get us to do these things with the \ntreaty. Malarkey. Bush and Reagan said we are not going to use any \nchemical weapons; we are going to destroy our stockpiles; whether there \nis a treaty, or not, we will put that in the legislation; we are going \nto destroy our stockpile. They negotiated a treaty and sent it up here. \nUnfortunately for President Bush, he was not reelected. So it is left \non the watch of this President to get it ratified. There are the facts.\n  The question still remains, though, regardless of who negotiated this \ntreaty, why do we need it? The answer still, in essence in my view, is \nvery simple. Notwithstanding the Herculean efforts of my friend from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, who is on the floor, we cannot contain the threat \nof chemical weapons on our own. Let me repeat that. We cannot contain \nthe threat of chemical weapons on our own. I would love it if we could. \nIt should be obvious that our objective of combating the global threat \nof chemical weapons cannot be met without working in concert with other \nnations. We may be the world's lone superpower, Mr. President, but that \ndoes not empower us to solve the chemical weapons problem on our own.\n  Mr. President, the convention is quite detailed, as it necessarily \nmust be. This is the treaty. It is quite detailed in its several \nprovisions upon which there will be specific debate over the course of \nthe next 2 days. But, for the moment, let me highlight the reasons why \nthis treaty will advance our national interests.\n  First, the convention addresses two key flaws in the Geneva \nProtocol--that is the thing that outlaws the use of chemical weapons in \ninternational war--which focused on a single wrong. The Geneva Protocol \nfocused on one thing. It banned the use of chemical weapons in \ninternational armed conflict, period. A good thing, but not nearly \nenough.\n  The reason we need this treaty: The first reason is the Geneva \nProtocol doesn't ban the internal use of chemical weapons, and it says \nnothing about stockpiling the development of or the production of \nchemical weapons. Today, roughly 20 countries are believed to either \npossess chemical weapons or have a program aimed at acquiring such \nweapons. Included on this list are such pariah states as Iraq, Iran, \nLibya, or North Korea. Under current international law there is nothing \nillegal about these programs--nothing, zero, nothing illegal about \nthese programs. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make them illegal \nand thus serve to isolate those who ignore this international norm.\n  My friends will later point out today and tomorrow that unless these \ncountries all ratify and become signatories, we should not. Let me \nexplain to you why it is equally important that we determine who is \ninside the norm and who is outside the norm. The convention will \nprovide a moral, if not legal, basis for taking military action against \na chemical weapons program that poses a threat to peace whether or not \nthat nation is a signatory to the convention. Let me explain what I \nmean by that.\n  Let's assume that North Korea or Libya never entered this convention. \nLet's assume we enter it and the other nations who have signed it enter \nit. Let's assume that number, which I think is realistic to assume, \ngets closer to 100. Let's assume Libya, that we find out, or are able \nto demonstrate to the world through this international group of \ninspectors or through our own national technical means, that Libya is \nproducing and stockpiling chemical weapons. Even though they have not \nsigned onto the treaty, let's assume that we conclude that we should \ntake military action to take out that capability--``take out'' meaning \nbomb it, destroy it, get rid of it--I believe, and I predict that you \nwill see the world community sanctioning that action, at a minimum by \ntheir silence and probably with an overwhelming degree of support.\n\n  But let my ask it another way. Let's say we don't sign onto this \ntreaty. Libya develops a significant stockpile of chemical weapons. We \nidentify it, show the world, and decide we are\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\ngoing to take it out. What do you think will happen then? Do you think \nthere is any reasonable prospect the world will coalesce around our \neffort to protect us and the rest of the world? I respectfully suggest \nto you that there is not a chance. So this is a significant inhibitor \neven to those nations that do not sign onto the treaty because it \nestablishes an international norm.\n  The second reason why this treaty is important is that the Chemical \nWeapons Convention provides this strict regime for controlling trade in \nprecursor chemicals used in making chemical weapons because chemicals \ncommonly used in industry are also able to be used to produce chemical \nweapons. The only way to effectively control chemical weapons on a \nglobal basis is to provide a strict control and monitoring regarding \nthe commercial trade in these kinds of chemicals that can ultimately \nproduce chemical weapons. Accordingly, the convention provides several \nmechanisms, including annual reporting by companies and export \ncontrols, to track the chemicals. Parties which do not join the treaty \nwill be left on the outside of the system subject to cutting off trade \nin those certain chemicals, along with other restrictions that the \nconvention will impose.\n  Failure to ratify the convention will in time impose onerous costs on \nany chemical industry in any state that does not sign, including our \nown. In our case, it will be the loss of--at minimum--hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in lost export earnings annually. This financial \nloss would be a cruel irony because the United States pushed to put \nthese controls in the treaty.\n  Do you all remember when we were trying to track down who sold the \ntechnology and the material to the Iraqis to build their nuclear and/or \nchemical capability? Remember all of that? We tried to track down, and \nwe tracked down some German companies which had provided the \nengineering and other companies from France, and other countries had \nprovided some of the material, et cetera.\n  Guess what? It is important to know who is selling what. Any outfit \nthat signs onto this treaty could not sell without reporting in detail \nwhat they sold to each of these countries who are signatories to the \ntreaty. Guess what? If you don't ratify the treaty and you sell certain \nchemicals abroad, you will be unable to sell them to the countries that \nhave ratified, including our largest trading partners. Chemicals are \nour single largest export. OK? I know people who think I am a little \nprejudiced on this because I come from Delaware, occasionally referred \nto by some facetiously as ``The State of DuPont.'' Chemicals and the \nchemical industry make up 51 percent of the industrial products of my \nState. If we do not sign onto this treaty, we are in real trouble \nbecause then we can't trade our chemicals. We can't trade certain \nchemicals, which is our State's biggest export and which produces the \nmost jobs, other than agriculture. We can't trade. We will have tariffs \nput up against us in other countries.\n  Why do we do that? We, the United States, President Bush did that \nbecause we were so sure that we would sign on and see the wisdom of \nthis. We wanted to make sure that countries who didn't sign on suffered \na penalty for not signing on.\n  So now, if we vote this voice vote which we are going to have after \nour caucuses, as Senator Helms proposes, guess what? We kill the treaty \nand our chemical industry, and the jobs associated with it will be in \nreal trouble.\n  But remember why that was put in there. It was put in there because \nwe want to track chemical trade. You know everybody is watching the \nTimothy McVeigh trial. You don't have to be a rocket scientist or an \nexpert in chemicals to know that one of the things the prosecution is \ntrying to do is they are trying to find out whether he purchased any \nmaterial that could be used to make the bomb. So they are trying to \nfind a chain. They are trying to work their way back. That is the way \nyou stop the building of chemical weapons. If you are going to go make \nchemical weapons, you need certain chemicals. Countries like Iraq and \ncountries like Libya don't have them. They need to buy them from \nsomeplace that manufactures them and then go make their chemical \nweapons.\n\n  So another inducement to prevent the construction of chemical weapons \nis that we track the material that could be used, components, to make \nthe chemical weapons. If company officials know they are going to be \nviolating the law if they don't record that they sold 10 barrels of \nsuch and such, that is one side of the sanction. But they also know \nthat, if they sell it to countries that use it to produce poison gas, \nand report it, then they are going to be responsible in the world's \neyes.\n  What do you think would happen if we knew today each of the chemical \ncompanies around the world that sold to Iraq the components of the \nchemical weapons that they used against the Kurds? What do you think \nwould happen if we are able to identify company A, B, C, and D? I bet \nyou that there would be a serious change in attitudes on the part of \nthose companies.\n  There is no reason to believe this, but let's assume that we \nidentified American corporations which had sold the material to the \nIraqis to build their chemical weapons stockpiles. I will lay you 8 to \n5 that the Senators on the floor of this Senate and Congressmen in the \nHouse of Representatives would immediately be introducing legislation \nto sanction those companies, and those companies would know that was \nabout to happen to them.\n  So you see the logic here. If you can trace the chemicals being sold \nto produce the weapons, you inhibit the likelihood that any company \nwill sell that precursor because they don't want to be listed as the \ncompany or the nation that helped North Korea build chemical weapons.\n  Technically, not all trade in the chemicals on what they call \nschedule 2 of this treaty would be banned immediately if we do not sign \non, and trade in schedule 3 chemicals, would also not be banned \nimmediately. But trade between countries that ratify and countries that \ndon't in all of those chemicals that appear in schedule 2 will be \nbanned in 3 years, and in schedule 3, possibly in 5 years. That means \nthat, if we are not signed onto that at the front end or along the way, \nall those chemicals that have legitimate uses could not be sold for \nlegitimate purposes without the chemical company being at a distinct \ndisadvantage with the competitors in Europe and elsewhere.\n  The third reason we need the Chemical Weapons Convention is that the \nUnited States has already decided by law--voted on in this body--to \ndestroy most of our chemical weapons stocks anyway, a decision jointly \nmade by the Congress and, guess who, ``trust but verify'' Reagan. In \nthe 1980's, President Reagan, after consulting with his military \nadvisers, said, look, these chemical stockpiles, the hundreds and \nhundreds of tons of chemicals weapons that we have stockpiled in the \nUnited States, have little or no efficacy. Our military tells us we \ndon't need them to defend against other nations that use chemical \nweapons, and we don't need them for offensive purposes and they are \nunstable, so we are going to independently destroy them. And we passed \na law saying you are right, Mr. President Reagan, destroy them.\n\n  So think of the irony. We are going to destroy our chemical weapons \nno matter what, and we may not join a treaty that requires other \nnations to destroy their chemical weapons.\n  After the gulf war, President Bush announced that we would destroy \nthe rest of our chemical weapons other than the ones that President \nReagan said we are going to destroy anyway. Then President Bush, after \nthe Gulf war, said we are going to destroy anything that is left once \nwe ratify the chemical weapons treaty.\n  There is a connection here. I used to practice law with a guy who was \na very good trial lawyer, Sidney Balick, still a great trial lawyer. He \nwould stand before a jury, teaching me how to do jury trials, and he \nwould look at the jury and say now look, it is very important you keep \nyour eye on the ball here. The issue is whether or not my client robbed \nthe store, not whether my client is a nice guy, not whether or not you \nwould want my client to go out with your daughter, not whether my \nclient is well dressed, not whether my client is nice looking. It is \nabout whether or not he robbed the store. So keep your eye on the ball \nand connect the dots.\n  Well, one of the things we have to do is keep our eye on the ball \nhere and connect the dots. One of the reasons\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nwhy President Bush said we will destroy the rest of our chemical \nweapons was to help get ratified this treaty that we were the major \narchitects of--a Republican President. And so because we have already \ndecided to dismantle our chemical stockpiles, this convention we are \ntalking about, this treaty will ensure that other nations do so as \nwell.\n  As Secretary of State Albright said: ``This treaty is about other \npeople's weapons, not our own.''\n  Let me repeat that. ``This treaty is about other people's weapons, \nnot our own.'' We are going to destroy our own anyway. This is about \nother people's weapons. You are going to hear our colleagues stand up \nand say, you know, we should not ratify this treaty, although it has \nbeen signed by Russia, until it is ratified by their Duma, their \nCongress.\n  Now, we are going to destroy our weapons anyway. We then do not \nratify this treaty. Failure to ratify this treaty then gives Russia the \nexcuse not to ratify the treaty. We will have destroyed all of our \nchemical weapons and Russia will still have millions of tons of \nstockpiled chemical weapons. Now, isn't that smart. Isn't that smart. \nWhat are we talking about here? This is about other people's weapons, \nnot ours, not ours.\n  The conclusion that we do not need chemical weapons to protect our \nmilitary superiority, by the way, is based not on some reckless \nidealism but on hardheaded pragmatism on the part of the Joint Chiefs. \nMilitary leaders like Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, Gen. Colin Powell, \nformer Secretaries of Defense Harold Brown and William Perry tell us \nthat we do not need chemical weapons to defeat any potential adversary \nwhether or not that adversary is armed with chemical weapons. We can \nengage in massive retaliation.\n  This treaty, by the way, is also endorsed by several highly respected \nveterans organizations. The list includes the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, and the Jewish War Veterans of the United States.\n  Of course, Mr. President, we have to maintain a capacity and \ncapability to defend against chemical weapons, against parties that may \nchoose not to join the treaty or those which do not abide by its norms. \nBut the danger that our forces will face chemical attack will in time \nbe greatly reduced once this treaty is passed. So too will the threat \nthat innocent civilians will be subject to such attacks by rogue \nstates.\n  The fourth reason we need this convention is because it will greatly \nenhance our ability to detect and deter chemical weapons programs. \nThrough a detailed accounting procedure and an elaborate regime of on-\nsite inspection, the most intrusive inspection regime of any arms \ncontrol agreement ever negotiated, the Chemical Weapons Convention will \nstrengthen our ability to ensure compliance.\n\n  You are going to hear another argument which I kind of find \nfascinating. As the Senator from Indiana and I tried to answer each of \nthe arguments of the opponents of this treaty, we realized that by \nanswering one we make their other argument. They argue at cross-\npurposes. For example, you will hear some stand up one moment and say \nthis treaty is not adequately verifiable. And we say OK, we have an \ninspection regime that allows you to go into plants in other countries, \nchallenge inspections without notice, et cetera. They say, well, it is \nnot enough. It is not enough. And we say OK, want to do more? They say, \nno, no, no, no, we can't do more. We don't want to do more. We don't \nwant to verify.\n  Why don't we want to verify? Because to verify intrudes upon your \nsovereignty.\n  So you hear a second argument. Senator Helms made it. He says, you \nknow, this treaty will allow people to go into the plants of chemical \nindustries in the United States and pharmaceutical industries--and soap \nmanufacturers, which is not true--and steal their trade secrets. So \nsomeone is going to challenge the DuPont Co., the international \ncommunity, saying we think you are making chemical weapons. So this \nteam of inspectors will go into the DuPont Co., they will have us \nbelieve, and they will root around the DuPont Co.'s books and look at \nall their patents and look at everything and steal their trade secrets, \ntake them back to Iraq and now make nylon or make Corfam, which no one \nuses anymore. And we say, well, to the degree we protect against that, \nwe lessen the ability to verify. And to the degree we increase the \nverification, we can protect less against that.\n  The truth is neither are real. There is an entire regime built into \nthis convention that will prevent anybody from being able to steal any \ntrade secrets. But the point is you will hear these arguments. Ask \nyourself as this debate is going on, if they are really concerned about \nverification, why do they not want a greater ability to verify. And if \nthey are really concerned about the loss of proprietary business \ninterests and secrets, why do they not understand that they really do \nnot want to verify.\n  With or without the treaty, Mr. President--this is a key point--\nwhether we sign this treaty or not, the United States intelligence \ncommunity, the defense intelligence establishment, the CIA, our entire \nintelligence apparatus, is still going to have the duty to monitor \nchemical weapons programs in other States. The President will demand no \nless, nor would we as a Nation. So no matter what we do, we are still \ngoing to be attempting to monitor through any means we can what is \ngoing on in Iran with regard to chemical weapons or Iraq with regard to \nchemical weapons, whether or not we verify. But what happens if we do \nnot verify? Well, if we do not verify, then we do not get the ability \nto go into Iran, a signatory to this convention--and look at their \ncompanies, look at their facilities, challenge whether or not they are \nin fact lying to us. We do not get to be part of that. We have to do it \nfrom a distance.\n  Now, how does that help us? No matter how weak you think the \ninspection regime is, how are we better off in our ultimate objective--\nand that is finding and getting rid of chemical weapons programs around \nthe world--how are we better off by not having access to the \ninspections that we could be part of conducting if we are part of the \ntreaty?\n  In my view, every single criticism you will hear of this treaty is \nworse without the treaty. Every single problem you will hear raised is \nworse for the United States if we are not in the treaty. I will not \ntake the time now to go into all of them but this is just one. Since we \nhave to have our intelligence guys and women find out what other \ncountries are doing, how are we better off when we do not give them the \ntools that this treaty provides to find out what other nations are \ndoing.\n\n  This view is confirmed by George Tenet, the acting director of \nCentral Intelligence, who testified:\n\n       In the absence of the tools that the Convention gives . . . \n     us, it will be much harder for us to apprise . . . the \n     military and policymakers (about) developments.\n\n  Developments meaning chemical weapons. Of course, there are going to \nbe cheaters. But the extensive verification regime will surely raise \nthe stakes considerably for cheaters and act as a deterrent.\n  Ron Lehman, the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \nunder President Bush and the Deputy National Security Adviser under \nPresident Reagan, stated:\n\n       We do not have the highest confidence that we will detect \n     cheating, but the cheater must still worry that we might. \n     Should we deny ourselves the strategic warning that comes \n     from the detection of indications of chemical weapons \n     activity, even if there is not complete proof? With the \n     inherent difficulties in monitoring chemical weapons \n     activities, we need all the help we can get.\n\n  Mr. President, it comes down to a simple question. Given that the \ntreaty will enter into force next week without regard to our action, \nwill we be better off inside the treaty or outside the treaty grouped \nwith the pariah nations? I believe the answer is absolutely clear. We \nshould be on the inside helping to implement the treaty that can be a \npowerful instrument in containing the threat posed by chemical weapons. \nIt is not perfect, but we should not let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good. This is a good treaty and the Senate should consent to its \nratification forthwith.\n  Before we go to the final vote on the treaty itself, however, we will \nhave a full day of debate and then tomorrow consider the various \nconditions contained in the proposed resolution of ratification. As \nprovided for in the unanimous consent agreement reached last week, we \nwill consider two sets of conditions. The first is a group of 28\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\nconditions upon which all the parties have negotiated.\n  Senator Helms laid out how long and hard he and I negotiated. I asked \nhim and all opponents, I said list the entire universe of objections \nyou have to this treaty, every single, solitary, conceivable reason to \nbe against the treaty. And after months they listed them all. It came \nto 33 there was no agreement on. I sat down with Senator Helms and we \nworked out agreement on 28 of the 33. Hear what I said, 28 of the 33. I \nasked every argument of the treaty; list it; let me try to answer it \nfor you--every single one. So the entire universe of objections comes \ndown to 33. We agreed after laborious negotiations on 28 of the 33, \nleaving five in disagreement.\n  We are going to, at some point, move to adopt all 28 of those by \nvoice vote. But that leaves the five, the five that are killer \nconditions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Was the Senator aware that Senator Dole, former majority \nleader, has just announced his support of the treaty with the changes \nthat have been made, which the Senator from Delaware was able to \nachieve in this agreement? I think this is a very important expression \nof support and one that I feel will be very much respected by our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Also, I was curious, for purposes of the time, how much longer the \nSenator from Delaware statement will be?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will just take a few more minutes and reserve the \nremainder of my time. But let me answer the question. As the Senator \nfrom Arizona stood up to tell me that, my staff just handed me the news \nrelease. I was not aware until he just told me, but it does not \nsurprise me and it pleases me a great deal. You and I worked with \nSenator Dole for a long time, I for 24 years, and have great respect \nfor him. I was absolutely convinced that the conditions that we agreed \non would take care of every conceivable problem he had with the treaty. \nI think it does for everyone, frankly.\n  I know my friend from Arizona was very concerned about several \nprovisions of this treaty. He has been deeply involved in the \nnegotiations relating to this, and I think we have taken care of every \ncondition that can possibly be dealt with, without killing the treaty.\n  The remaining five conditions are conditions that cannot be met and \nwill kill the treaty. So the reason we could not agree to the last five \nis they are what we call, in the parlance of the Senate, ``killer \namendments,'' or ``killer conditions.''\n  But I am very pleased, as I say, not surprised. Because in all the \nyears I have worked with Senator Dole I have had the greatest respect \nfor him and I have no doubt that he has thought about this long and \nhard. I am glad to see he has spoken out, now, which is very important.\n  As I said, as provided for in the unanimous-consent agreement reached \nlast week, we will consider two sets of conditions. The first is a \ngroup of 28 conditions, upon which all parties to the negotiations \nagree. The second is a set of five conditions that remain in \ndisagreement among the parties; these five will be the subject of a \nseparate debate and vote tomorrow.\n\n  The 28 agreed conditions are the product of hours of negotiation that \noccurred in two complimentary phases. The first involved discussions \nbetween the administration and a task force of Republican Senators \nestablished by the majority leader. The second involved extensive \nnegotiations between the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand me.\n  At this point, I would like to express my personal appreciation to \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and his able staff, \nfor engaging in hours of discussions with me and my staff. Throughout \nthe past few months, we held over 40 hours of meetings. Although we did \nnot always agree--obviously, we would have been here on the floor a lot \nsooner if we had--the discussions were carried out in good faith, and \nthe Senator from North Carolina was always a gentleman.\n  I would also like to pause here to express my appreciation to the \nmajority and minority leaders, who spent many hours on this over the \npast few months, and to the President, the National Security Adviser \nand his dedicated team, and the Secretary of State, for all their \nefforts in trying to forge common ground and narrow the issues.\n  And we have narrowed the issues considerably. The negotiations \nsucceeded in addressing many key issues of concern. Let me elaborate \nbriefly on these conditions.\n  Among the 28 agreed conditions are the following:\n  A condition [No. 28] ensuring that fourth amendment rights will be \nprotected by requiring search warrants in cases where consent to search \na facility is not granted.\n  A condition [No. 26] providing for the continued use of riot control \nagents by U.S. troops to save lives when rescuing pilots or when \nattacked by both combatants and civilians.\n  Several conditions which augment existing protections for industry, \nincluding: No. 9, which requires an annual certification that the CWC \nis not significantly harming legitimate commercial activities; \ncondition No. 16, which adds teeth to the convention's provision on \nprotecting confidential business information by withholding U.S. \ncontributions to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons--the body that will implement the treaty--if an employee \ndiscloses information that results in financial loss to a U.S. firm; \nthe money will be withheld until the immunity of that employee is \nwaived; and condition No. 18, which prohibits samples collected from \nU.S. firms from being taken to foreign laboratories, thus reducing the \nrisk of the loss of proprietary information to foreign espionage.\n  Conditions No. 2, 3, and 4, which hold down U.S. costs under the \nconvention and require establishment of an inspector general for the \nbody that will implement it.\n  A condition [No. 5] which establishes strict standards for the \nsharing of U.S. intelligence information.\n  And a condition [No. 14] which rejects any attempt by Russia to link \nits own ratification of the CWC to the receipt of U.S. assistance for \nchemical weapons destruction.\n  Some treaty opponents have attempted to characterize these \nachievements as relatively minor. That is hardly the case.\n  For example, throughout the debate on the convention, opponents have \ncontended that it would violate the fourth amendment prohibition \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures. Though this was never the \ncase, condition No. 28 makes it explicitly clear that search warrants \nwill be required whenever consent is withheld for an inspection.\n  Similarly, CWC opponents have frequently criticized the Clinton \nadministration's decision to interpret the convention as requiring \nmodifications to U.S. policy, codified in Executive Order 11850 of \nApril 8, 1975, on the use of riot control agents by U.S. forces in \ncertain situations.\n  Condition No. 26 states, unequivocally, that Executive Order 11850 \nshall not be altered or eliminated.\n  In short, many arguments about the treaty's perceived flaws are \nsimply no longer valid in light of the agreed conditions contained in \nSenate Executive Resolution 75.\n  Unfortunately, our success in addressing so many concerns has not \nbeen enough for some treaty opponents. They insist on voting on five \nextreme conditions, which, if adopted, will prevent the United States \nfrom ratifying the convention or will significantly undermine the \nconvention.\n  An opportunity to vote on these extreme conditions was coupled with a \nrefusal to give the supporters of the treaty an opportunity to offer \nany substitutes.\n  So we will be left with one course--to vote against the conditions \noffered by the opponents of this treaty. I regret that outcome--but \nthat is the hand we have been dealt.\n  During the next 2 days, we will debate these five conditions, and at \nan appropriate time, I will discuss them in detail. Let me now address \na few of them briefly.\n  First, the opponents of the convention will argue that we shouldn't \njoin the convention until Russia, as well as several countries with \noffensive chemical weapons programs, do so, too. We will have 2 hours \nof debate on these issues tomorrow, but for now let me just say this: \nthis approach holds American policy hostage to the decisions of other \nnations, which is not only bad policy,\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\nbut it also undermines our claim to international leadership.\n  Opponents will also say that even if the rogue states join, the \ntreaty won't be worth much because they will cheat. To this charge, \nthere is an easy answer, provided by our Secretary of State: to say \nthat we shouldn't try to make chemical weapons illegal because there \nwill be cheaters, is like saying that we shouldn't have laws because \npeople will break them.\n  Next, you will hear the argument that we must amend article XI of the \ntreaty, or else it will lead to the end of export controls on dangerous \nchemicals. This argument is based not only on a flawed reading of the \ntreaty text, but on a willful ignorance of commitments already made.\n  The CWC is completely consistent with continued enforcement of \nexisting controls enforced by the Australia Group, an informal alliance \nof supplier countries.\n  Moreover, the 30 nations that comprise the Australia Group have \nspecifically stated their intention--individually and collectively--to \nmaintain export controls that are equal to, or exceed, those in place \ntoday.\n  Finally, we have added a condition--condition No. 7--which makes \nclear our interpretation that we may maintain export controls, and \nwhich requires the President to certify annually that the Australia \nGroup continues to control the trade in vital chemicals.\n  Even after all of this debate--and all of the voting--I suspect that \nthe opponents of this treaty will still not be satisfied, even if they \nsucceed in attaching killer conditions. That is because, at bottom, \nthey have a theological opposition to arms control. That is defensible \nposition. I respect it. But I strongly disagree with it.\n  In essence, opponents of arms control fear that a treaty like this \nwill lull us into a false sense of security. This proposition, I \nconcede, has considerable force. But I am not persuaded.\n  There is, of course, always a risk that a nation will lower its guard \nin the face of a reduced threat. But today's debate is not the end of \nour efforts on the chemical weapons problem. To borrow a phrase from \nWinston Churchill, it is not even the beginning of the end; it is the \nend of the beginning.\n  From this day forward, if we approve this convention, as I sincerely \nhope we will, both the Senate and the executive must remain ever \nvigilant against the threat of chemical weapons--and ensure that we \nhave an effective convention.\n  We have added several conditions to the resolution of ratification to \nadvance this objective. We have made a commitment, in condition No. 11; \nthat requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that U.S. forces are \ncapable of carrying out military missions regardless of any foreign \nthreat or use of chemical weapons. We have required, in condition No. \n10, an annual report on compliance issues. We have established, in \ncondition No. 13, a mechanism for ensuring that the President promptly \npursues potential violations that threaten our national security \ninterests.\n  Aside from these concrete conditions, however, our experience with \nother arms control agreements demonstrates that the political \ncommitment remains, and that the dangers of complacency are greatly \nexaggerated.\n  Nearly 30 years ago, we signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \namid predictions that dozens of states would have nuclear weapons \nwithin a decade. Today, we are more concerned than ever about the \nthreat of nuclear proliferation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty has been \nextended permanently, and just a handful of states have the bomb.\n  During the 1980's, we had constant debates about whether the Soviet \nUnion was complying with its obligations under the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. Not once did we let down our guard against the Soviet \nthreat.\n  The thesis that we will be lulled into a false sense of security \napplies not to the convention, but to the alternative: to doing nothing \nother than strengthening our domestic laws against chemical weapons--\nwhich was all the Senate achieved last week in passing S. 495.\n  Revision of our domestic laws to criminalize possession and \nstockpiling of chemical weapons is necessary--with or without the \ntreaty. But it is a delusion to believe that merely enacting domestic \nlegislation will suffice to combat an international problem of this \nmagnitude and gravity. Rather, it will take close cooperation by the \ncivilized nations of the world to enforce the new international norm \nset forth in the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, as I stated at the outset, the world--and this is no \nexaggeration--is watching the U.S. Senate today and tomorrow. They are \nwaiting for the answer to the question, will we, the United States, \nremain in the forefront of the battle to combat proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction? We must answer that in the affirmative. \nPut it another way, does anybody believe that 74 nations would have \nsigned onto this treaty if they believed the United States of America \nwas not going to support them? We have led people down the primrose \npath, if in fact we do not sign onto this treaty.\n  I see that my friend from Indiana, who probably knows more about the \nchemical weapons treaty than anyone in the U.S. Senate, or maybe anyone \nin the country, has risen. I will be happy, if he is seeking \nrecognition, to yield as much time to him as he believes he needs.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for a \nremarkable speech in favor of the Chemical Weapons Convention, and for \nhis leadership. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, for a very important announcement. I have in front of me the \nstatement given by Senator Dole at the White House. I point out the \ncontext of this statement was a meeting with Senator Dole and President \nClinton, in which these two statesmen came together this morning for a \nvery important purpose, namely to say to America, in a unanimous way, \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention is important for our security.\n  Senator Dole stated:\n\n       Last September, the Senate Majority Leader, Trent Lott, \n     asked me to express my opinion on the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. In my response, I raised concerns about the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention and expressed hope that the \n     President and the Senate work together to ensure that the \n     treaty is effectively verifiable and genuinely global. They \n     have, and as a result, 28 conditions to the Senate's \n     Resolution of Ratification have been agreed to. These 28 \n     agreed conditions address major concerns.\n       I commend Senator Lott, Senator Helms, Senator Lugar, and \n     many other former colleagues, as well as President Clinton \n     and administration officials for their constructive efforts, \n     is it perfect--no--but I believe there are now adequate \n     safeguards to protect American interests. We should keep in \n     mind that the United States is already destroying its \n     chemical weapons in accordance with legislation passed more \n     than 10 years ago. The CWC would require all other parties to \n     destroy their stockpiles by April 2007.\n       In addition, the Administration has agreed to a number of \n     provisions dealing with rogue states that remain outside the \n     treaty.\n\n  The Senator attaches a letter from President Clinton to Senator Dole \ndated April 22, 1997, outlining those provisions. And then Senator Dole \ncontinues:\n\n       I also understand there is a possibility of an additional \n     agreement with respect to sharing of information. If so, it \n     would further strengthen the treaty. I understand that even \n     with all the added safeguards, not every Senator, for their \n     own good reasons, will support ratification.\n       As a member of the Senate, I supported the START I, START \n     II, INF, and CFE treaties because they met the crucial tests \n     of effective verification, real reductions, and stability. If \n     I were presently in the Senate, I would vote for ratification \n     of the CWC because of the many improvements agreed to.\n       Those who may still have concerns can look to Article XVI, \n     which allows withdrawal from the treaty on 90 days notice if \n     it fails to serve America's vital interests. There is little \n     doubt in my mind that if this convention increases \n     proliferation of chemical weapons, it would lead to public \n     outrage which would compel any President to act. The bottom \n     line is that when it comes to America's security, we must \n     maintain a strong national defense that is second to none.\n\n  As the Senator has pointed out, we will have in front of the body \nthis afternoon, first of all, all 33 conditions, including 5 that are \nkiller amendments. We must vote those down. We will have, then, before \nus, 28 agreed amendments that Senator Dole has referenced. We should \nvote in favor of those, and then proceed in this debate to strike the \nother 5.\n  We are here today to discuss the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\n  I say to my colleagues that, in performing its constitutional \nresponsibilities with respect to treaties and international agreements, \nthe Senate has to reach a judgment as to whether, on balance, U.S. \nacceptance of the obligations contained in the treaty serves the \nnational interests of the United States. That phrase, on balance, is \nimportant, because in arriving at our judgment, we have to weigh the \nstrengths and weaknesses of a treaty's provisions and decide whether \nthe advantages or benefits outweigh any real or potential costs.\n  If one believes that the benefits outweigh the costs, one will write \nand support one kind of resolution of ratification that consents to the \ntreaty while utilizing conditional language to clarify or minimize \nperceived weaknesses. However, if one believes that the costs of U.S. \nparticipation outweigh the benefits, one will write and support a very \ndifferent kind of resolution of ratification.\n  It is my belief that the Chemical Weapons Convention, on balance, is \nin the national security interests of the United States, and thus I \nbelieve the Senate should ratify a resolution of ratification which \nallows the United States to deposit its instrument of ratification and \nbecome a state-party to the CWC.\n  As Senator Biden pointed out, this international treaty was \nnegotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush and was signed by Secretary of \nState Eagleburger in January 1993--just before George Bush left office.\n  Senator Biden was generous in pointing out that these were two \nRepublican Presidents, Secretary Eagleburger was a Republican Secretary \nof State. It is appropriate that Senator Dole, as Republican candidate \nfor President, join with President Clinton today, once again affirming \nthat the CWC is in the best national interests of our country.\n\n\n                          THE NEED FOR THE CWC\n\n  Mr. President, we need as many tools as possible to combat the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, given the fact that many \ncountries of concern have the capability to manufacture these weapons. \nWe need this treaty as a global norm whereby nations foreswear the use \nof their domestic capabilities to produce chemical weapons. In this \nregard, the CWC is the most comprehensive nonproliferation and arms \ncontrol treaty in history and is a critical supplement to the Geneva \nConvention of 1925.\n  The CWC fills the gap that the Geneva Convention does not address. \nWhile, the Geneva Convention bans the use of chemical weapons as an \ninstrument of warfare, the CWC forbids even the mere possession of \nchemical weapons.\n  It prohibits member-states assistance to any chemical weapons \nprogram, thereby helping to cut off supplies to rogue nations such as \nNorth Korea and Libya who are not likely to subscribe to the CWC. Some \nhave criticized the treaty because they say participation will not be \ntruly global. I certainly recognize that a number of problem countries \nare not likely to join the CWC. So be it. The CWC will serve to isolate \nthem in the international community and compel participating countries \nto restrict chemical trade with them. Participating countries who may \nnow support the chemical weapons proliferation projects of outlaw \nstates in a variety of ways will be obliged to terminate any such help \nas soon as the treaty enters into force. In this context, it is \nimportant to note that the CWC prohibits any assistance to another \ncountry's chemical weapons program--not just chemical transfers.\n  As Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf has said, ``We don't need chemical weapons \nto fight our future warfares. And frankly, by not ratifying that \ntreaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea, and \nI'd just as soon not be associated with those thugs in that particular \nmatter.''\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that we shouldn't ratify the CWC \nuntil the Russians do so. I disagree. United States ratification of the \nCWC will put pressure on Russia to follow suit since they don't want to \nbe outside of the broad consensus of the international community. \nHowever, even if the Russians fail to ratify, the treaty still serves \nUnited States national interests because we have already made a \nunilateral decision never to deploy CW, even if such weapons are used \nagainst us. This treaty commits other nations to do what we have \nalready done. It will make less likely that U.S. forces will face \nchemical weapons in future confrontations.\n  On April 4, 16 retired generals and admirals wrote to President \nClinton supporting the Senate's consent to ratification of the CWC. \nGen. Colin Powell, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, Gen. John Vessey, Adm. \nWilliam Owens, Adm. Stansfield Turner, Adm. Zumwalt and others joined \nGen. Brent Scowcroft and the current Joint Chiefs of Staff in \nsupporting the treaty. They wrote:\n\n       Each of us can point to decades of military experience in \n     command positions. We have all trained and commanded troops \n     to prepare for the wartime use of chemical weapons and for \n     defenses against them. We all recognize the limited military \n     utility of these weapons, and supported President Bush's \n     decision to renounce the use of an offensive chemical weapons \n     capability and to unilaterally destroy U.S. stockpiles. The \n     CWC simply mandates that other countries follow our lead. \n     This is the primary contribution of the CWC: to destroy \n     militarily-significant stockpiles of chemical weapons around \n     the globe.\n\n  Our military leaders concluded:\n\n       On its own, the CWC cannot guarantee complete security \n     against chemical weapons. We must continue to support robust \n     defense capabilities, and remain willing to respond--through \n     the CWC or by unilateral action--to violators of the \n     Convention. Our focus is not on the treaty's limitations, but \n     instead on its many strengths. The CWC destroys stockpiles \n     that could threaten our troops; it significantly improves our \n     intelligence capabilities; and it creates new international \n     sanctions to punish those states who remain outside of the \n     treaty. For these reasons, we strongly support the CWC.\n  The CWC will compel other countries to pass domestic laws \ncriminalizing all chemical weapons related activities on their soil and \nthereby give them an effective tool to deal with terrorists. In this \nregard, it is interesting to note how quickly Japan ratified the CWC \nafter the poison gas attack in the Tokyo subway.\n  Mr. President, I understand well that some have argued that the \ntreaty is not completely verifiable and therefore not worthy of U.S. \nratification. No--the treaty is not 100 percent verifiable and we who \nsupport the CWC do not argue that it is a perfect and infallible \ninstrument. We all recognize that a dedicated proliferator may be able \nto conduct a clandestine chemical weapons program and not be \ndiscovered. But that's not a fair test for an up or down vote on \nratification. The CWC will complicate life for proliferators by making \naccess to technical assistance and supplies more difficult and \nexpensive to acquire. The treaty's verification provisions cover every \naspect of a chemical weapons program from development through \nproduction, stockpiling, transfer, and use.\n  The CWC provides the necessary incentives for states who are \nconsidering entering the chemical weapons business to refrain from so \ndoing. It provides an incremental yet substantial step forward in the \nfight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The allegation that the treaty is unverifiable is ironic, given \nfearmongering from the same quarters about the treaty's allegedly \ndraconian inspection and reporting requirements. How can it be both too \ntough and not tough enough? How can critics who supported, during the \nnegotiations of the CWC, an inspection regime based on the principle of \n``any time, anywhere'' now argue that the present inspection regime is \ntoo intrusive.\n\n\n                         WHY MUST WE RATIFY NOW\n\n  Mr. President, we should not let the CWC enter into force without \nUnited States participation. In fact, I regret that we have waited as \nlong as we have to debate this treaty. On April 29, 1997, this \nmultilateral convention will enter into force whether the Senate has \nacted or not.\n  What are the consequences for the United States if it is not a party \nto the CWC when it enters into force.\n  First, instruments lost: First of all, without the CWC, there is no \nbasis on which the United States can ``bound'' the chemical weapons \nproblem. The CWC will help diminish the challenge in a way that allows \nthe full panoply of policy tools--export controls, economic sanctions, \ndiplomacy, chemical defense, and military options--to be brought to \nbear against the real miscreants such as Syria, Libya, and North Korea.\n  The existing 1925 Geneva Protocol only bans use; there are currently \nno\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nrestrictions on anything related to chemical weapons short of use \nincluding development, production, storage, deployment, or transfer. \nIraq demonstrates that states interested enough to develop and produce \nchemical weapons have a reason to use them and would likely do so, \nregardless of the Geneva Protocol. There is no certainty that states \nwho may have--undeclared--CW stockpiles will be under obligation to \ndestroy them, as the United States has already unilaterally decided to \ndo.\n  Without the CWC the international norms against chemical weapons will \nerode, increasing the likelihood of their use. Despite the emphasis on \npower in international politics, norms do count. They provide the \nstandards by which acceptable behavior of states can be judged and \nserve as the basis for action by the international community when \ncertain behavior is deemed unacceptable. Strong global norms against \nchemical weapons could be one factor shaping the decision not to pursue \nthem by countries who might consider exploring the option.\n  U.S. credibility in pushing its specific positions in arms control \nforums will be undermined. Why should other countries pay attention to \nthe United States and seek to accommodate its concerns if the United \nStates is not going to support the final product at the end of the day? \nThe standards on which the CWC is based are those put forward by \nPresident Reagan and President Bush. The balance of intrusion and \nconstitutional and commercial protection displayed in the CWC is the \nend product of a long and deliberate debate by both Republican \nadministrations in an attempt to reach an appropriate balance.\n  Second, a credibility problem: If the United States is not a state \nparty to the treaty, the United States will have no legal basis--no \nlegal basis--to take actions against other nonstates parties. On what \ngrounds, for example, could we contemplate action against Libya for \nproceeding with the Tarhuna facility if it decided to proceed? Nor \nwould the United States have any moral grounds for criticizing the \ndecision of others to stay outside the treaty.\n  U.S. credibility and leadership will be undermined, not just on arms \ncontrol but more broadly. Washington will have to deal with a \nperception that already exists but that nonparticipation in the CWC \nwill only reinforce: that the United States bullies countries into \nassuming obligations that it is not willing to assume itself. Such \nviews only strengthen the sense that others already have that the \nUnited States sees itself as not bound by the constraints it tries to \nimpose on others. In a world that increasingly requires cooperation to \naccomplish major objectives, such a perception is damaging to the point \nof endangering vital American interests.\n  Third, lacking U.S. leadership: If the United States is not a state \nparty to the CWC when it enters into force on April 29 we will have no \nrole in the governing body of the CWC. This is important because while \nthe procedures for conducting the OPCW's business will be agreed on \npaper, how they are in fact translated into actual practice will be the \nreal point at which precedents are set and work habits established.\n  The United States will not have a seat on the executive council, the \ncritical policy decisionmaking group of the CWC. The United States will \nnot have any representation in the inspection regime. We will have no \naccess to the information that inspectors and others accumulate on \nchemical weapons use, proliferation, and terrorism.\n  The information that will be provided to the governing body through \ndeclarations and inspections will be important in its own right. Even \nmore important, when it is put together with other information \navailable to our intelligence community, it will help to provide a more \naccurate picture of a state's activities which may provide leads to \nuncover illicit, noncompliant activities. Not being a part of the \ngoverning body will mean that this valuable source of information for \nthe intelligence community will be closed off.\n  Why do the critics wish to hamstring our own intelligence community \nand deny it the additional pieces of information that could prove \ncritical to an intelligence determination and finding that bears on \nthreats to our national security interests.\n  Fourth, U.S. industry will pay the price: On April 29 the clock will \nstart on the 3-year period after which trade in schedule 2 chemicals--\nthose which can serve as direct pre-cursors to chemical weapons--with \nnonstates parties will be cut off. The U.S. chemical industry estimates \nthat as much as $600 million in overseas chemical trade could be at \nrisk. In fact, the impact of the cutoff is likely to be felt sooner \nthan the 3 years, as trading partners begin to change their trading \npatterns--that is, shifting to new suppliers--in anticipation of the \ncutoff.\n  If the United States is not a party to the CWC, it will also play no \nrole in the OPCW's decision regarding whether or not the trade cutoff \nwill be extended to schedule 3 chemicals--dual-purpose chemicals which \ncan be used in chemical weapons--a decision that will likely be made \nsoon after entry into force. Given the chemicals on schedule 3, if the \ndecision is made to extend the trade cutoff, the economic impact on the \nU.S. chemical industry could be enormous, making the $600 million look \nlike small change.\n\n  Some critics have sought to intimidate American business by spreading \nunsubstantiated rumors and fears that ``Iranian inspectors are coming'' \nor that proprietary information will be at risk. But those large firms \nthat might, in fact, be inspected support the treaty and the small \nfirms have determined it will have no impact on them.\n\n\n                        THE DEFENSE SECRETARIES\n\n  Many of the arguments of CWC critics were crystallized in the \ncomments of three former defense Secretaries.\n  They repeat several old arguments used by other critics of the CWC.\n  Many critics act as if this is the first time these concerns have \nbeen expressed and that Members have not taken actions to deal with \nthem. How many of these critics are familiar with the resolution of \nratification passed out of the Committee on Foreign Relations last year \nfor example? How many of them are familiar with the draft resolution of \nratification that has been under negotiation this year? A resolution of \nratification is precisely the vehicle through which contentious matters \nof interpretation are taken up and conditions added to conform U.S. \ndomestic law to U.S. interpretations.\n  First, the complacency argument: One old argument is about the \ncomplacency situation; namely, that the CWC would lull the country into \na false sense of security and a tendency to neglect defenses against \nchemical weapons.\n  This is a matter of political will at home in the United States; it \nhas nothing to do with the treaty. This is what we pay Secretaries of \nDefense to guard against. This is what we are paid in the U.S. Senate \nto guard against.\n  Perhaps I have more faith in the U.S. Senate's willingness to carry \nout its responsibilities under the Constitution than do critics of the \ntreaty. There is nothing inevitable about arms control agreements \ncontributing to a lessened perceived need and therefore support for \ndefenses against such threats. But there is something wrong with the \nnotion that by allowing our potential adversaries to have chemical \nweapons, we are sure to be reminded to defend against them.\n  It may be that the Defense Department was willing to reduce its \nrequest in 1995 for funds for chemical defenses, but the Congress has \nnever had any problem in the past in plusing up administration requests \nfor defense situations. Funding for ballistic missile defense is a \nperfect example. Indeed, Secretary of Defense Cohen recently indicated \nthat an additional $225 million is being requested for chemical \ndefenses.\n  One should have little sympathy for the complacency argument employed \nagainst the CWC. Rather than whining about complacency, Congress ought \nto do its job and authorize and appropriate what funds are necessary to \nprovide for a robust chemical defense capability.\n  By the same token, concerns are expressed about a possible reduction \nin the priority accorded to monitoring emerging chemical weapons \nthreats. That is not the way recent budget requests from the \nintelligence community came across. Moreover, the community itself \nwants the CWC precisely because it will provide additional tools to the \ncommunity to monitor the chemical weapons situation. Again,\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\nCongress has every ability to add or shift funds to ensure that CWC \nmonitoring remains a funding priority.\n  In fact, one of the conditions included in the resolution of \nratification deals with the preservation of robust defenses against \nchemical weapons. It states the necessity for preserving and further \ndeveloping robust defenses against chemical and biological weapons. \nIncreased readiness must be emphasized at the highest levels and \nsupported with the necessary funding within the executive branch of the \nGovernment and the United States Armed Forces.\n\n  Second, Article XI: Some critics have placed much emphasis on the so-\ncalled poisons for peace argument--namely, that the CWC will obligate \nmember states to facilitate transfers of CWC-specific technology, \nequipment and material to member states of the convention. Further, \nthey charge that the treaty commits new member states not to observe \nany agreements that would restrict these transfers.\n  It is tragic that American critics of the CWC would swallow the \nIranian interpretation of Article XI rather than that of the American \ndelegation to the convention, and the interpretation of the Commerce \nDepartment, and the U.S. chemical industry. Why are these critics so \nintent on giving credibility to the Iranian interpretation? Why do they \nwish to align themselves with the rogue states on this issue?\n  To be sure, the issue of assistance, Article XI, was one of the more \ncontentious issues during the end game of the CWC negotiations. The \nmore radical, nonaligned states, led by Iran, demanded that this \nprovision be interpreted so as to require the elimination of any export \ncontrols in the chemical arena for states parties in good standing.\n  But the United States and others rejected that argument and \nmaintained that their interpretation of article XI did not require them \nto do so, that mechanisms such as the Australian Group were legitimate \nunder the CWC, and that the work of the Australia Group would continue. \nThe members of the Australia Group did propose to review their \npractices and procedures at some undefined time in the future, but only \nafter they had a period of experience with the treaty in force, during \nwhich they could judge whether that practical experience might justify \na reconsideration of their export controls.\n  The basic CWC obligation is contained in article I--this is, to \n``never under any circumstances: . . . (d) To assist, encourage or \ninduce in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited . . .'' \nAnd it means what it says. This basic obligation overrides any \nrequirement--any requirement--to facilitate trade or technical \ncooperation when there is a proliferation concern.\n  There is nothing automatic about the assistance provisions of article \nXI, and it will certainly not mean that the floodgates will be open for \nthe exchange of chemical materials and equipment with rogue states, as \ncritics have stated. It merely affirms the right of the parties to \nengage in chemical commerce for peaceful purposes, that is, industrial, \nagriculture, research, pharmaceutical, medical or other pursuits as \nthey do today. A state with chemical weapons aspirations has no treaty \nright to anything that furthers those aspirations. And nothing in the \ntreaty requires the elimination of our export controls on chemical \nmaterials and equipment. The United States and other Western countries \nhave made clear to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons, the OPCW, the governing board, as well as all states parties \nthat the provision in question does not entail any obligation to \neliminate existing export control regulations on chemical material and \nequipment.\n  One condition in the resolution of ratification deals specifically \nwith the issue of interpretation over article XI. It states in part \nthat: ``the various provisions of the CWC preserve the right of State \nParties to maintain or impose export controls for foreign policy or \nnational security reasons, and that nothing in the Convention obligates \nthe United States to accept any weakening of its existing national \nexport controls.''\n  If, as the critics state, the CWC would likely leave the United \nStates more, not less, vulnerable to chemical attack, then the blame \nresides with political leaders in the United States, not with the \nconvention. The treaty in no way constrains our ability as a nation to \nprovide for a robust defense against chemical weapons or to impose or \nmaintain export controls for foreign policy and national security \nreasons.\n  Third, Dumbing Down of Intelligence: There is also the charge that, \nif the United States is not a CWC participant, the danger is lessened \nthat American intelligence about foreign chemical programs will be \ndumbed down or compromised. This is a variation on the politicizing of \nintelligence argument taken to the extreme. Again, any dumbing down of \nintelligence has nothing to do with the convention. Moreover, a \nwillingness to act in the face of noncompliance by other signatories is \na political decision, not an intelligence decision. If critics want to \nfault American political leadership, fine, but this has nothing to do \nwith the strengths or weaknesses of the convention.\n  Fourth, Costs and the Constitution: Fourth, various critics worry \nabout the costs associated with U.S. participation in a multilateral \nregime and cite the outlandish estimate of $200 million annually. This \nhardly squares with the estimates offered by the Congressional Budget \nOffice and fails to take account what the administration has actually \nrequested for fiscal year 1998--namely $46 million. And quite \npredictably, the critics drift from the cost charge into the \nconstitutional charge that U.S. participation in the convention could \nleave U.S. citizens and companies vulnerable to burdens associated with \nreporting and inspection arrangements, jeopardize confidential business \ninformation, and other charges.\n  Industry is expected to pay its own costs associated with reporting \nand receiving an inspection. Industry does not contribute to the cost \nof carrying out international inspections. Inspection costs are covered \nin the OPCW budget to which the U.S. Government will contribute. Annual \ncosts to industry are expected to be about $4 million in the first year \nand less in subsequent years. Inspection costs are not expected to be \nmore than an EPA or OSHA inspection--this means no more than $10,000 \nper inspection and probably much less. Based on practice inspections, \nno shutdown of facilities is anticipated, which would be an important \ncost factor.\n  U.S. industry would not support the CWC, as it does, if it posed \nsignificant risks to confidential business information. Protections \nagainst the loss of confidential business information are incorporated \ninto the CWC and the administration's proposed implementing \nlegislation. Industry has worked intensively on both to ensure these \nprotections are adequate.\n  Unlimited inspector access is not required. For routine inspections, \neach facility has the right to define the degree of access through a \nnegotiated facility agreement and may thus protect sensitive \ninformation. Furthermore, routine inspections can be anticipated, \nproviding ample time for preparation.\n\n  In challenge inspection scenarios access to the site must be provided \n120 hours after a request for a challenge inspection is received by the \nOPCW. Once access is granted, the principles of managed access apply. \nUnder managed access, the inspected facility can negotiate the degree \nof access on the spot, and, while obligated to provide alternative \nmeans to satisfy concerns about compliance, the facility is not \nobligated to allow inspectors to go anywhere they like.\n  Allegations that the CWC will require violations of the Constitution \nare wrong. The proposed implementing legislation provides for search \nwarrants if routine or challenge inspections must be carried out \nwithout consent. So does the resolution of ratification. The CWC also \nallows the United States to take into account constitutional \nobligations regarding searches and seizures and proprietary rights in \nproviding access under challenge inspections.\n  When CWC negotiations commenced, President Reagan wisely decided to \ninclude representatives from the American chemical industry in the \nformation and evolutionary decisionmaking process of U.S. negotiating \npositions. Thus, the American chemical industry has participated every \nstep of the way in the development of the convention and played a major \nrole in crafting the language with regard to constitutional\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nsafeguards and protection of industry rights and information during any \ninspections.\n  In September 1996, the National Federation of Independent Business \nexpressed some concern regarding the potential impact of CWC reporting \nrequirements on the U.S. small business community.\n  More recently, the National Federation of Independent Business has \nrevised its position on the CWC. A February 14, 1997, Wall Street \nJournal article by Carla Robbins quoted Dan Danner, vice president of \nFederal Government Affairs, as saying, ``It is now our belief our \nmembers are not going to be impacted.'' The article went on to convey \nNFIB's view that treaty opponents who suggested that NFIB was opposed \nto the CWC were ``100% incorrect.''\n  Mr. Danner reiterated the National Federation of Independent Business \nposition in a March 5 letter to me in which he said, ``It is now our \nbelief that the small business owners that we represent will not likely \nbe included in the reporting requirements and, therefore, not affected \nby the CWC. Our concerns have been answered to our satisfaction.''\n  Fifth, Russia and the CWC: Some critics claim that Russian activities \nwith regard to its stockpile will be unaffected by whether the United \nStates joins the convention and that Russia has, in any event, been \ndeveloping new chemical agents that would circumvent the treaty's \nconstraints.\n  Let us be clear about one thing. Russian activities will surely be \nunaffected if the United States does not ratify the CWC. Some Russians \nare grateful for the support they find for their position on the CWC \nfrom many American critics of the convention. One thing is certain: The \nRussians do not want the United States to ratify the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. Why? Because they know they cannot afford to have the \nUnited States participating in the OPCW without them. By the same \ntoken, if the United States does not join, the Russian Government has \nvery little incentive to expend the political resources necessary to \nbring various elements of the military-chemical complex into line with \ntreaty provisions. However, the Russian Government and the branches of \nthe Russian Parliament are moving the CWC through the ratification \nprocess to the point where it could be acted upon in short order if the \nUnited States ratifies.\n  Second, the point is not that Russia is developing agents that would \ncircumvent the treaty's constraints. Rather, the point is that we know \nthat they are developing them, they are or can be added to the treaty's \nprohibited list, and that without the CWC, there is absolutely nothing \nillegal or noncompliant about Russian activities in this area.\n  The CWC is not perfect, but it is necessary for the additional tools \nit provides the United States,\n  No. 1, giving us leverage not just for the United States, but for the \nentire international community to pressure Russia to destroy its huge \nchemical weapons stockpile;\n  No. 2, it acts as a means to reinforce the norms against chemical \nweapons;\n  No. 3, it gives an ability to track chemical trade;\n  No. 4, it gives procedures for evaluating important information for \nthe intelligence community;\n  No. 5, it gives a requirement for state parties to pass \ndomestic legislation criminalizing activities prohibited by the treaty; \nand\n\n  No. 6, the CWC gives a legal basis for the international community to \ntake action in the face of unacceptable behavior.\n\n\n                             A SUBSTITUTE?\n\n  What are the critics of the treaty offering to accomplish these same \ntasks? What are they proposing that will help diminish the \ninternational chemical weapons threat?\n  To be sure, a piece of legislation was passed last week--Senate bill \n495--which overlaps the CWC and its implementing legislation in several \nareas. But by no means can one consider this domestic piece of \nlegislation equal to or a substitute for an international multilateral \ntreaty which not only bans use of chemical weapons but bans the \nmanufacturing, stockpiling, trade, and deployment of chemical weapons.\n  Senate bill 495 calls for U.S. leadership in adding ``teeth'' to the \n1925 Geneva Protocol banning chemical weapons use. But the United \nStates has already done this and the final product is the document \nbefore us today--the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Reagan and Bush \nadministrations wisely decided to pledge not to manufacture, produce, \nor stockpile chemical weapons; the CWC forces other members to do the \nsame. Without the CWC, the rest of the world would be allowed to make, \nstockpile, and deploy chemical weapons, and the United States would \nonly be able to react after a Syria, Libya, Iraq, or North Korea has \nused chemical weapons on its population, its neighbors, or on American \ntroops. At that point it will be too late for the victims.\n  S. 495 does nothing to address the concerns of the U.S. chemical \nindustry. In a letter signed by 53 chief executive officers of \nAmerica's largest chemical companies they state: ``our industry's \nstatus as the world's preferred supplier of chemical products may be \njeopardized if the U.S. does not ratify the [CWC]. If the Senate does \nnot vote in favor of the CWC, we stand to lose hundreds of millions of \ndollars in overseas sales, putting at risk thousands of good-paying \nAmerican jobs.'' S. 495 does nothing to solve industry's concerns \nregarding the negative impact the CWC would have on their international \ncompetitiveness if the United States does not ratify the convention \nbefore April 29.\n  Indeed, S. 495 is designed primarily to deal with the consequences of \na chemical incident on American soil, not on its prevention or \ndeterrence, as is the case with the CWC.\n  Whereas the CWC specifies illegality without qualification or \ncondition--the use or possession of chemical weapons is absolutely \nprohibited--the enactment of S. 495 without CWC ratification would mean \nthat the United Staes is not obligated to destroy those chemical \nweapons that is not already committed to destroy under the 1986 law. In \nthis respect S. 495 is most certainly for the United States a law that \nauthorizes the retention of the most dangerous chemical weapons. Thus, \nwhile the CWC would establish a clear and binding international \nprohibition against the possession of chemical weapons, enactment of S. \n495 without CWC ratification would establish a clear U.S. position in \nsupport of those nations, including the United States, who choose to \nmaintain these weapons.\n  In fact, S. 495's prohibitions against possession or use, and so \nforth, of chemical weapons are merely antiterrorism provisions, without \nsignificant transnational strategic implications, which are already \nprovided for by existing United States law. As to the law's provisions \nthat the U.S. will impose sanctions against nations that use chemical \nweapons, it is highly questionable whether such sanctions will be \neffective; in any event, these sanctions expressly do not apply to \nnations that stockpile but do not use chemical weapons.\n  S. 495 merely reinforces the status quo. Without the CWC, states \ninterested in developing chemical weapons--Syria, Libya, Iran, Iraq, \nand North Korea--will have free rein to pursue their programs. As we \nsaw in the case of Iraq, existing policy tools are not adequate.\n\n\n        THE RESOLUTION OF RATIFICATION: EXECUTIVE RESOLUTION 75\n\n  I have spent considerable time reviewing the resolution of \nratification to the Chemical Weapons Convention to be laid before the \nSenate, Senate Executive Resolution 75, and measuring the proposed \nconditional remedies against perceived and/or real shortcomings in the \nconvention and against the benefits to the United States of full \nparticipation in the convention.\n  Exhaustive negotiations over the past several months have produced a \nset of 33 conditions to the resolution of ratification; 28 of these \nconditions enjoy the support of those involved in the negotiations. I \nsupport them. Under a unanimous-consent agreement, the Senate will \nconsider these 28 conditions as a package--on a voice vote.\n  Then the Senate will turn to the remaining five conditions which are \nin dispute. I have concluded that the effect of these remaining \nconditions proposed in Senate Executive Resolution 75 would be to \ndestroy the Chemical Weapons Convention in a supposed effort to save \nit.\n  I firmly believe that these remaining conditions--the Senate will \nhave a separate vote on each--would, if accepted,\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nbe tantamount to killing the Chemical Weapons Convention outright, or \nwould have a significant adverse impact on its implementation.\n  Any condition that requires, as the price of ratification that all or \nparts of the treaty be renegotiated before it can enter into force is a \nkiller. It is unrealistic to expect that we can renegotiate a treaty \nwith over 160 signatories. Additionally, a U.S. condition of this \nnature would not only prevent U.S. participation in the convention but \ncould encourage other signatories contemplating ratification to attach \nsimilarly unacceptable conditions.\n  Four of the proposed conditions would require the President to make \ncertain certifications to the Senate prior to depositing instruments of \nratification, certifications that certainly cannot be made by April 29, \nif ever. Consequently, approval of any of these conditions would \nprevent the United States from joining the treaty. The fifth would be \nvery bad policy, at once undermining two U.S. objectives: to maintain \nan effective onsite inspection regime and to have U.S. inspectors \nparticipate in inspections of suspect states.\n  The unanimous-consent agreement is carefully configured so that no \nsubstitute amendments or conditions in these five areas of disagreement \ncan be offered. Only motions to strike will be in order.\n  Let me deal with each of the five conditions.\n\n\n                       Condition No. 29 on Russia\n\n  One of the items on which the Senate will be asked to vote is a \ncondition--proposed condition 29--that would prohibit the United States \nfrom ratifying the CWC until the President certifies that Russia has \ndone the following: ratified the CWC, complied with the 1990 Bilateral \nDestruction Agreement [BDA], fulfilled its obligations under the 1989 \nWyoming Memorandum of Understanding [MOU], and ceased all chemical \nweapons activities.\n  This is a killer condition that would prevent the United States from \njoining the CWC. It must be struck.\n  This condition effectively holds hostage U.S. participation in the \nCWC to a group of hardliners in the Duma. It would let Russia off the \nhook and give them an excuse to withhold ratification. Why should we \nlet Russia decide our foreign policy?\n  This condition would hold hostage our ability to join the CWC to the \nhardliners in the Russian Duma. As the President said, ``this is \nprecisely backwards. The best way to secure Russian ratification is to \nratify the treaty ourselves. Failure to do so will only give hardliners \nin Russia an excuse to hold out and hold on to their chemical \nweapons.''\n  The prospect of Senate ratification is clearly putting pressure on \nRussia to ratify. The Duma announced last week that it will begin \ndebate on the CWC today. Russia does not want to be left behind, \nespecially if the United States is on the inside setting the rules.\n  In sum, we should not give Russia the power to decide our \nparticipation in and leadership of this crucial treaty. As General \nRowny testified, ``I think if we fail to ratify this Chemical Weapons \nConvention, it is going to give the Russians an excuse on a silver \nplatter to say well, the United States did not ratify and we won't \neither.''\n  Vil Mirzayanov, a Russian scientist who blew the whistle on the \nSoviet Union's chemical weapons programs and strongly supports the \ntreaty, recently wrote to me and said: ``Senate ratification of the \nConvention is crucial to securing action on the treaty in Moscow * * * \nthe Russian government does not want America to dominate the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the important \ndecisions that the body will soon be making about the Convention's \nimplications.''\n  By not ratifying, the United States would be giving a present to \nhardline opponents of the CWC and of relations with the West more \ngenerally. By ratifying, the United States would not be giving a \nChristmas present to Russia; instead, it would provide a powerful tool \nfor bringing further pressure to bear on Moscow to get on with chemical \ndisarmament--and to stay engaged more generally in cooperative \ninternational measures that promote arms control and nonproliferation.\n  The 1990 BDA was never ratified by the United States or Russia. It \nwas explicitly designed to provide a boost to negotiations on the CWC \nand gain Russian ascent to the United States position for an immediate \ncessation of chemical weapons production and the destruction of the \nchemical weapons stockpiles. It served that purpose. Many of the BDA's \nprovisions were adopted by the CWC. The BDA has several shortcomings \nthat are corrected in the CWC. For example, the BDA allows both \ncountries to retain 5,000 tons of chemical weapons, while the CWC \nrequires the destruction of all chemical weapons. Also, the BDA has no \nprovision for challenge inspections that are contained in the CWC.\n  The 1989 Wyoming MOU was also designed to jumpstart CWC negotiations \nby providing for reciprocal data exchanges and inspections of chemical \nweapons facilities by the United States and Russia. It, too, served its \npurpose. The United States has some questions that linger over Russian \ndata, but we can gain valuable information about Russia through the \nCWC's verification provisions.\n  Key officials in Moscow do not dispute that there are individuals, \nboth civilian and military, who wish to retain an offensive chemical \nweapons capability and thus oppose CWC ratification. This is hardly \nsurprising, given the fact that we have individuals in an out of the \nAmerican Government who oppose CWC ratification for the same reason. \nMany of these individuals associated with Russian chemical weapons \nresearch and development as well as production are the very ones tasked \nto provide the data called for under the Wyoming MOU. Moreover, various \nRussian military officials have argued that, given the near \ndisintegration of the Russian conventional military capability, only \nnuclear and chemical weapons may be able to compensate for such \nconventional weaknesses.\n\n  While Russian Government officials express their concerns about the \npolitical and economic costs of finalizing the BDA and/or ratifying the \nCWC before it enters into force, they do acknowledge, however \ngrudgingly, that only United States ratification of the CWC will force \nthem to deal decisively with the economic, political, and military \ndilemmas associated with chemical weapons. They also acknowledge that \nif the United States fails to ratify the CWC, then those military and \ncivilian voices in Russia who favor the retention of an offensive \nchemical weapons capability could well become the majority.\n  The fourth certification requirement of this condition is apparently \ndriven by reports of Russian ``novel'' chemical agents. If these \nreports are correct, then the CWC and its challenge inspection regime \nis the best tool for exposing and ending such activities. Without the \nCWC, we will be denied important information and Russia will be under \nno legal obligation to end its suspected activities.\n\n\n                    Condition No. 30 on Rogue States\n\n  Proposed condition 30 would prohibit the United States from ratifying \nthe CWC until all states determined to possess offensive chemical \nweapons programs, including China, North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, and \nIraq, as well as other state sponsors of terrorism, have ratified.\n  This is a killer condition that would prevent the United States from \never joining the CWC. It, too, must be struck.\n  This condition would make our joining this treaty hostage to Saddam \nHussein, Qadhafi, other leaders of rogue states. This condition would \nallow these outlaw states to continue business as usual with no \nconstraints, while our industry suffers, our leadership is undermined, \nand our ability to influence and benefit from the CWC regime is \ncompromised.\n  By allowing the world's most recalcitrant regimes to decide for us \nwhen we join the CWC, this condition borders on a dangerous surrender \nof U.S. national sovereignty. It effectively lets the world's villains \nwrite the rules of international conduct.\n  Supporters of this condition say that we should not have a CWC \nbecause there will be cheaters. As Secretary of State Albright has \nsaid, that is a bit like saying that we shouldn't have laws because \npeople will break them. But the CWC was not written with the illusory \nexpectation that all of the world's bad actors would immediately sign \nup. Instead, it was negotiated with the cold-eyed recognition that \nrogue states\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\nwould stay out and, therefore, should be isolated and targeted. That is \nwhy the CWC contains mandatory sanctions for those states that remain \noutside of the regime.\n  After years of providing international leadership in the fight to \nstop the spread of chemical weapons, we would be siding, not with our \nallies, on the inside, but with Libya, Syria, and Iraq on the outside. \nAs General Norman Schwarzkopf has testified, ``by not ratifying that \ntreaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea, and \nI just as soon not be associated with those thugs in this particular \nmatter.''\n  Our industry will be subject to automatic trade restraints beginning \non April 29 if we don't ratify. Ironically, these are the same \nrestrictions the United States fought for in the negotiations to put \npressure on the rogue states to join the treaty.\n  Today, there is nothing illegal in international law about the \nchemical weapons programs in any of the countries mentioned in this \ncondition. That will change once the CWC enters into force. It will \nestablish a norm against the stockpiling, development, transfer, and \nproduction of chemical weapons--all perfectly legitimate activities \ntoday. It will provide the basis for harsh action against those that \nviolate this norm. In plain English, that means the CWC will legitimize \nmilitary action we might take against a rogue state that develops \nchemical weapons illegally. It will also increase the likelihood of \nforging international coalitions. Conversely, accepting this condition \nwould undermine our ability to lead on nonproliferation matters.\n  This condition also ignores the fact that regardless of what these \ncountries do, we are unilaterally destroying our chemical weapons \nstockpile. Chemical weapons are no longer a part of our military \ndoctrine. Instead, as the gulf war demonstrated, we will rely on our \noverwhelming nonchemical capabilities to deter chemical weapons use.\n  In sum, this condition will not promote ratification in any of the \nrogue states but instead will give leverage to those factions within \nthese countries who do not want their governments to be parties. As \nGen. Brent Scowcroft has testified, ``by remaining outside the CWC, we \nlet these rogue states off the hook by making it easier for them to \nignore pressures to abandon the chemical weapons option. In all these \ncases, we undermine the effectiveness of the CWC to do unto others what \nwe have decided to do for ourselves: get out of the chemical weapons \nbusiness.''\n  This condition turns the present global arrangement on its head. \nInstead of the United States sustaining our historic leadership role in \nsetting nonproliferation norms, this condition would have us take a \nbackseat to the likes of Saddam Hussein and Mu'ammar Qadhafi. That does \na grave disservice to our record of leadership over the past 40 years \nfrom the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, to the missile technology \ncontrol regime, to the CWC itself.\n  No country, especially outlaw states, should have a veto over our \nnational security. As Jim Baker has stated, ``It makes no sense to \nargue that because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention \nthe United States should line up with them rather than with the rest of \nthe world.''\n\n\n                Condition 31 on Rejecting CWC Inspectors\n\n  A third condition on which the Senate will be asked to vote is \ncondition 31, which would require the United States to reject all CWC \ninspectors from countries that supported terrorism or violated U.S. \nnonproliferation law.\n  This is an unnecessary condition, one that has the potential to do \ngreat harm to the implementation of the CWC, and one that is a poor way \nto get at the perceived problem of untrustworthy CWC inspectors. It \nshould be struck.\n  The dangers that CWC inspectors will learn some trade secrets of U.S. \nfirms in the course of onsite inspections are limited. Many CWC \nprovisions limit what inspectors will learn. Facility agreements \ngoverning routine inspections and managed access in challenge \ninspections will specify what inspectors can see. U.S. firms are free \nto use such devices as shrouding, removal of papers, and limiting the \nnumber of inspectors who see a particular area or how long they are \nallowed to see it. No employees need answer questions that are \nirrelevant to the question of whether the CWC is being violated. An \nagreed condition, No. 16, adds teeth to the CWC provision permitting \nthe director-general to waive the immunity of any employee who betrays \nconfidential U.S. information.\n  The CWC already provides the U.S. Government the right to bar \ninspectors on an individual-by-individual basis each year when the CWC \norganization proposes its list of inspectors, just as a defense \nattorney can peremptorily challenge a prospective juror in a trial.\n  Condition 31 is unnecessarily rigid. This condition takes a meat ax \napproach to whom we would allow to come to the United States, which is \nalmost certain to provoke reciprocity. In other words, adoption of this \ncondition would most likely result in other nations blackballing all \nAmerican inspectors in advance. This would defeat one of our principal \nobjectives in our joining the treaty: to ensure American inspectors \ntake the lead in finding violations, just as we have for UNSCOM in \nIraq.\n  It also fails to require rejection of inspectors from other countries \nwho might be known spies or have a record of improper handling of \nconfidential information.\n  As Admiral Zumwalt recently testified, ``the ability for us to get \nmore access is an important thing to me as a member of the President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board; the opportunity to inspect is \ngoing to give us additional information which can be cross-compared \nwith what we get through the intelligence community. And it will, \nwithout a doubt, enhance our ability to know more about what is going \non.''\n  A better approach would have been to require the President to tell \nthe intelligence committees of Congress the nationality of all \ninspectors the United States approved, as well as any derogatory \ninformation about them that U.S. agencies might have. This would enable \nthose committees to weigh in with the executive branch if the U.S. \nNational Authority were ignoring serious information or other agencies' \nconcerns regarding an inspector.\n  A substitute condition was prepared embodying this more flexible \napproach. CWC critics would not even consider this, and instead \ninsisted that no substitutes be in order. We can avoid this Hobson's \nchoice, however, between rigidity and doing nothing. All we have to do \nis vote to strike condition 31 and then enact more sensible language in \nthe implementing legislation that will come to the floor next month. I \nurge you to do just that.\n\n\n                   Condition 32 on Articles X and XI\n\n  The fourth condition is condition 32, which requires the President, \nprior to depositing the instrument of ratification, to certify that the \nparties to the convention have agreed to strike article X from the \nconvention, and amend article XI.\n\n  This provision is a killer, plain and simple, and will prevent the \nUnited States from joining the convention. The President cannot make \nsuch a certification prior to April 29, and probably never will be able \nto do so, because the convention permits a single State party to veto \nsuch amendments. This provision must be struck.\n  Proponents of this condition contend that the convention requires the \nUnited States and other parties to share critical technology that will \nassist countries of concern to develop offensive chemical weapons \nprograms. But this is just not so.\n  Article X focuses, in large measure, on assistance and protection for \ncountries attacked, or facing attack, by chemical weapons. Opponents of \nthe CWC have contended that paragraphs 3 and 7 require the United \nStates to provide defensive technology to other members. But the \nadministration has made clear that paragraph 3 leaves it up to the \nUnited States to decide precisely what, if anything, it will exchange, \nand has committed that the only assistance it will provide under \nparagraph 7 is medical antidotes and treatment. This latter promise is \nlocked in--by condition 15 of Senate Executive Resolution 75.\n  Only countries that have joined the CWC and renounced chemical \nweapons can request assistance under article X and only then if they \nare threatened or attacked with chemical weapons.\n  Thus, article X is intended to encourage states to do what the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nwants them to do: join the CWC and eliminate their chemical weapons \nprogram.\n  The President has committed in resolution of ratification condition \nNo. 15 that the United States will only give medical help to certain \ncountries or concern, under this article. The United States will not be \ngiving them our best gas masks or any other chemical weapons defense \ntechnology.\n  With regard to other states, the United States will use every \ninstrument of U.S. diplomacy and leverage to make sure transfers do not \noccur that could undermine U.S. national security interests. As \nSecretary Cohen said Sunday, we will be better able to do this if we \nare inside the treaty rather than out.\n  U.S. absence from the treaty will do nothing to keep another state \nfrom giving Iran and Cuba gas masks.\n  Article XI addresses the exchange of scientific and technical \ninformation. Opponents of the CWC contend that this article also \nrequires the sharing of technology, and will result in the erosion of \nexport controls not only in U.S. law, but also among nations of the \nAustralia Group, an informal alliance of potential supplier countries. \nThis is simply not so. The administration, and the other Australia \nGroup nations, have clearly stated their commitment to retain the \ncurrent level of export controls. And condition 7 binds the \nadministration to this promise. It requires the President to certify \nthat ``nothing in the convention obligates the United States to accept \nany modification of its national export controls,'' and, among other \nthings, to certify annually that the Australia Group is maintaining \ncontrols that are equal to, or exceed, the controls in place today.\n  Regarding article XI, the critics further claim that a treaty \nexpressly devoted to eliminating chemical weapons somehow would force \nits parties to facilitate the spread of chemical weapons. This \ninterpretation is totally at odds with the plain language of the \ntreaty.\n  To repeat, in order to reinforce the treaty's constraints, the \nPresident has committed in an agreed condition on the resolution of \nratification to obtain assurances from our Australia Group partners \nthat article XI is fully consistent with maintaining strict export \ncontrols on dangerous chemicals. This condition also requires an annual \ncertification that Australia Group members continue to maintain equally \neffective or more comprehensive controls over chemical weapons related \nmaterials and that the Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for \nlimiting the spread of chemical and biological weapons related material \nand technology.\n  The critics concern about dangerous exchanges under article XI misses \nthe main point, which is that any such exchanges can take place now \nwithout the CWC. With the CWC, the countries undertaking exchanges are \nlegally bound by the fundamental obligation of the treaty to renounce \nchemical weapons.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention will mean not only that all relevant \ntrade is subject to closer scrutiny, especially with countries whose \ncompliance may be in doubt, but it will also provide the legal basis as \nwell as the verification and compliance measures to redress those \nconcerns.\n  As Ron Lehman recently stated in testimony before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, ``we made it very clear throughout the \nnegotiations that all of this was subject to article I, which is the \nfundamental obligations not to assist, but the most important, telling \nfactoid in support of the U.S. interpretation is the fact that after \nthe convention was done so many of the usual list of suspects were so \nunhappy that they did not get what they wanted in these provisions.''\n  Renegotiation is not a realistic approach, as Brent Scowcroft \nrecently testified. ``Starting over is pure fantasy. If we reject this \ntreaty, we will incur the bitterness of all of our friends and allies \nwho followed us for 10 years in putting this together. The idea that we \ncan lead out again down a different path I think is just not in the \ncards. We have got to deal with the situation we face now, not an ideal \none out in the future.''\n\n\n                      Condition 33 on Verification\n\n  The last condition on which the Senate will be asked to vote is \ncondition 33--strictly a killer condition--that would bar the United \nStates from ratifying the CWC until the President can certify high \nconfidence in U.S. capabilities to detect, within 1 year of a \nviolation, the illicit production or storage of a single metric ton of \nchemical agent.\n  The United States will never be able to certify this level of \nmonitoring confidence, so condition 33 would bar U.S. participation in \nthe CWC forever. It, too, must be struck.\n  This condition sets an unrealistic and unachievable standard for \nmonitoring the treaty and would therefore ensure that we would not \nbecome a party to the agreement.\n  Nobody denies that compliance with some aspects of the CWC will be \ndifficult to verify. Other aspects of the CWC--like the storage and \ndestruction of declared chemical weapons stocks --will be verifiable \nwith fairly high confidence. But a determined country could probably \nhide a small-scale program of producing or stockpiling illegal chemical \nagent. We all know that. The important point is that without CWC, such \nactivities won't violate anything. Only if we join the convention, can \nwe effectively combat chemical weapons production and stockpiling.\n  Our Intelligence Community has testified that it would be very \ndifficult to detect production of small quantities of chemical weapons. \nWe do have high confidence, however, that we can detect cheating where \nit matters most: that is, if an adversary tries to translate illegal \nproduction into a militarily significant capability on the battlefield.\n  This condition defines production of 1 ton as ``military \nsignificant''. But Richard Perle, a CWC critic, has testified that \n``the possession of lethal chemicals is not by, itself, sufficient to \nconstitute a military capability.''\n  And as Gen. Brent Scowcroft noted in testimony to the Foreign \nRelations Committee, CWC declarations on chemical exports will be a \nuseful new tool: ``Right now, it is possible for a country to buy a few \npounds of a precursor here or a few pounds there, a few pounds \nsomewhere else, and to amass an abnormal supply without anybody ever \nnoticing it. That won't be possible anymore. Therefore, we will have a \nbetter idea of what's going on and who the bad guys seem to be.''\n  There is no need to adopt a 1-ton threshold for effective \nverification of the CWC. General Shalikashvili has testified that a \nsingle ton might have a real political impact, especially if used in a \nterrorist attack against unprotected persons. But Iran and Iraq used \ntens of tons per month against each other without altering the course \nof their war; studies for the Department of Defense found that it would \ntake several hundred to a thousand tons to seriously disrupt U.S. \nlogistics in a war; and the U.S. stockpile of chemical weapons--which \nwe are committed to destroy whether we join the CWC or not--is about \n30,000 tons.\n  General Shalikashvili went on to say that tonnage is not the only \nfactor to consider. If a country's illicit chemical agent stockpile is \nto be translated into something militarily usable, there must also be \nweapons in which to put the agent. There must be an infrastructure for \nthe handling of chemical weapons. And troops must be trained in the use \nand effective employment of the weapons. Each aspect of developing a \nreal chemical weapons capability is potentially open to monitoring, and \neach aspect constitutes both a CWC violation and sufficient \njustification for the United States to request a challenge inspection.\n  To quote General Shalikashvilli fully, ``a militarily significant \nquantity of chemical weapons is situationally dependent. Variables \ninvolved in determining this quantity are the military objective, \nweather, terrain, number of troops, type of chemical agents used, the \nchemical agent weapons system and method of deployment, and the \nchemical weapons defensive capability of the targeted force . . . the \nquantity is totally scenario dependent, and it would be difficult to \ncite a specific amount as militarily significant.''\n  U.S. intelligence officials have testified that the CWC will add to \ntheir monitoring tools to cover a significant target--one that they \nwill have to monitor whether we join the CWC or not. Data declarations \nwill give the\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nUnited States an important baseline from which to work. Routine \ninspections will make it more difficult and expensive for declared \nfacilities to be used in illicit chemical weapons activities. And \nchallenge inspections pose further risks to would-be violators, while \ngiving the United States and other countries the opportunity to have \nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons seek further \nindications or hard evidence of violations.\n  U.S. information can go a long way toward helping the organization to \nmount effective inspections. That is what the United States did with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency in North Korea, and it worked. \nAn important agreed condition--condition No. 5--has been worked out \nwith Senator Shelby, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, to require that intelligence sharing will be conducted \nonly after U.S. information is sanitized to minimize any risk to \nsensitive sources or methods. That is what the United States does \ncurrently, and what it should continue to do.\n\n  With the United States an original member of the organization, we \nwill be able to work for effective inspection procedures and to provide \nthe organization the information it needs to maximize its \neffectiveness. The organization's effectiveness will aid our own \nagencies, in turn, to monitor activities that are of major concern to \nU.S. military leaders and policymakers. That is why the CWC has been \nendorsed by every Chairman from the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the last \n20 years.\n  As David Kay former chief U.N. inspector in Iraq, Ronald Lehman, \nformer Assistant Secretary of Defense and Director of ACDA, and James \nWoolsey, former Director of Central Intelligence, wrote recently in The \nWashington Post, ``It is hard to understand why critics of the CWC \nbelieve it is to the advantage of U.S. forces--who one day may have to \nface an adversary armed with chemical weapons--to let such development \nproceed unhindered by vigorous inspection. Such inspections can slow a \nchemical weapons program, make it more expensive and less effective and \ncan develop the usable evidence needed to convince doubting allies.''\n  There is no such thing as perfect verifiability in a treaty, but the \nCWC provides useful tools. As Woolsey, Lehman and Kay put it ``the CWC \noffers at the outset verification tools that go beyond those of other \narms-control treaties.''\n  We should all support giving the U.S. Intelligence Community the \nnecessary resources to monitor worldwide chemical weapons activities--\nand, in the process, to monitor CWC compliance--as well as possible. \nThe CWC will aid in that monitoring, as well as in focusing \ninternational sanctions on any violators. All of these gains for our \nIntelligence Communities' ability to monitor global chemical weapons \nproliferation will be lost unless this condition is struck from the \nresolution of ratification. The national security requires a vote to \nstrike this condition.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  In conclusion Mr. President, the Defense Department's position on the \nCWC is simple. As offensive weapons, chemical munitions are overrated. \nTherefore, keeping them in our arsenal offers scant military advantage. \nDOD does not believe that chemical weapons are needed for deterrence. \nThey believe there are plenty of other options.\n  We have heard a good deal of discussion about the verification \nproblems associated with the CWC, and past and current intelligence \nofficials will be quoted in and out of context on Intelligence \nCommunity's confidence levels. But let us remember that the \nIntelligence Community has to monitor the chemical-weapons capabilities \nof foreign powers in any event. In open and closed briefings and \nhearings over the past 3 years, the community has been consistent in \nsaying that its ability to monitor various provisions of the convention \nis severely limited. But the community has also been consistent in \narguing that the convention will provide it with additional tools to go \nalong with national technical means in monitoring developments in \nchemical-weapons states, something that the intelligence community must \ndo whether there is a CWC or not. The intelligence community believes \nthat, the convention is a net plus to its efforts to monitor the \nactivities of chemical-weapons states around the globe.\n  The CWC is not without blemishes. The United States had to make \nconcessions in a negotiating process that involved nearly 40 states \nrepresenting all possible world views. These are not easy to accept in \na U.S. political process that has a hard time accepting tradeoffs in \nbilateral negotiations and, increasingly, even in domestic political \nbargaining. The Senate should not be surprised that the treaty is not \nperfect. But that is not the point. The proper question is whether, on \nbalance, does the CWC serve the national interest.\n  For some, no arms control treaty is good enough. Indeed, the very \nhigh stakes of the cold war and the fact that arms control cheating by \nthe Soviet Union represented a potential threat to the survival of the \nUnited States led to a legitimate focus on treaties with high \nstandards, especially for verification and the ability to detect even \nminor violations.\n  The cold war, is over, and treaty requirements must suit U.S. \nnational interests as they exist today. Despite the CWC's tradeoffs, it \nis widely supported by U.S. industry, the U.S. military, and \nnonproliferation experts. They know it not to be a panacea or perfect--\nbut nonetheless clearly in the service of U.S. military, economic and \npolitical interests. They also know it to be better than the \nalternative defined by CWC opponents as reliance on chemical weapons \nretaliation in kind and unilateral enforcement of export controls or \nother punitive actions. This alternative is a recipe for broader \nproliferation extending well beyond chemical weapons. The United States \nis much better served by a choice to help lead a cooperative \ninternational effort to manage the problem than by one that manifestly \nhas not worked as these weapons have proliferated in recent decades. \nSenators must look beyond the shouting match between the two camps \nof treaty supporters and treaty opponents and look at arguments based \non the national interests as they exist today.\n\n  Failure to ratify the CWC this year would harm that national interest \nand accentuate the image among both friends and foes of a rudderless \nAmerica unable to chart a course on uncertain new seas. A belief that \nthe United States is unreliable and uncooperative--or simply confused--\nwill harm not just the chemical arms control effort but \nnonproliferation goals more broadly. If the United States drops the CWC \nball, the consequences for stable alliance relationships, for U.S. \nsecurity in an era of rapid technology diffusion, and for a free and \nopen trading regime will prove far reaching.\n  The Congress completed legislation last fall on how best to respond \nto terrorism and to the threats posed by the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction, including nuclear, biological, and chemical \nweapons and materials. The so-called Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislative \nresponse to these threats passed the Senate unanimously and was agreed \nto in the House-Senate conference on the DOD authorization bill. If the \nSenate were to vote against ratification of the CWC, we would in effect \nbe taking a large step backward in our positive efforts to work toward \ndenying our enemies the tools of destruction they desire and protecting \nU.S. citizens from acts of terror and war.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for us to join the growing worldwide \nconsensus to ratify the treaty we invented. I believe that we are far \nbetter off with the CWC than without it. We have always been the \nworld's leader in fighting the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and we must not recoil from that challenge at this critical \njuncture. Further, we must not betray the American chemical industry \nwho worked with us for so many years to develop this treaty and who \nwould be badly disadvantaged in world markets if we fail to act \nresponsibly. We asked them for their help; they gave it willingly and \nnow face the possibility of an international Mark of Cain if we fail to \nratify. The time is now. The choice is clear.\n  I urge my colleagues first, to support the motions to strike the five \nconditions in disagreement in the resolution of ratification, second, \nto then vote yes to approve the resolution of ratification and consent \nto treaty ratification, and third, to then proceed quickly to\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\npass the domestic implementing legislation that is a necessary \ncompanion of this treaty.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention offers the United States one more \ntool in our arsenal to help prevent, deter, or to manage the threat \nposed by chemical weapons. It is up to the Senate, after weighing the \nbenefits and costs of the Convention, to determine whether the CWC \ntool, on balance, provides major value-added to the United States in \nachieving that objective. I believe it does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a previous order to recess.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before you rule, I would like to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Indiana yield?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Is the order that the Senate should recess at 12:30? Has \nthat been adopted earlier?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Under a previous order, we would recess \nfrom 12:30 to 2:15 for the policy luncheons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for at least 10 \nminutes so that the distinguished occupant of the chair can be \nrecognized to make a statement. While we get a replacement for him in \nthe chair, let me say this before the matter gets too cold. The \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, in good faith, I know, raised a \nnumber of concerns about the Chemical Weapons Convention in terms of \nthis. Senator Dole, in a letter dated September 11, 1996, contrary to \nwhat the distinguished Senator from Indiana said, said the following:\n\n       To achieve this goal, a treaty must be effectively \n     verifiable and genuinely global--encompassing all countries \n     that possess, or could possess, chemical weapons. If the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention now before you achieves this \n     goal, I will support it.\n\n  Now, of course, Senator Dole wrote that letter in good faith, and I \nsuppose that the administration has assured him, incorrectly, that all \nof his concerns have been taken care of.\n  In any case, I ask unanimous consent that the letter written by Bob \nDole on September 11, 1996, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: Thank you for seeking my views on the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention which will soon be considered by the \n     United States Senate. You do indeed have an important \n     national security decision before you and I am pleased to \n     offer you my views.\n       I am sure that I share with all my former colleagues--on \n     both sides of the aisle--a strong aversion to chemical \n     weapons. They are horrible, and there should be no doubt that \n     I am unequivocally opposed to their use, production or \n     stockpiling. Their widespread use during World War I provoked \n     an outcry which resulted in the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which \n     bans the use of chemical weapons in war. Unfortunately, the \n     Geneva Protocol has not prevented all use of chemical \n     weapons, and we have been reminded just in the last week of \n     the dangers presented by tyrants such as Saddam Hussein.\n       In fact, Saddam used chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War \n     and against his own Kurdish population in the North. And, \n     lest anyone think this is no concern of ours, there is a \n     distinct possibility that American troops were exposed to \n     Saddam's chemical weapons during the Gulf War. The United \n     States needs and wants a treaty which effectively bans \n     chemical weapons from every point on earth. To achieve this \n     goal, a treaty must be effectively verifiable and genuinely \n     global--encompassing all countries that possess, or could \n     possess, chemical weapons. If the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     now before you achieves this goal, I will support it. If it \n     does not, I believe we should pass up illusory arms control \n     measures. As President, I would work to achieve a treaty \n     which really does the job instead of making promises of \n     enhanced security which will not be achieved.\n       I supported the START I, START II, INF and CFE Treaties \n     because these agreements met three simple criteria \n     established by President Reagan: effective verification, real \n     reductions and stability. In evaluating the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, I suggest you apply these same criteria, adapted \n     to these particular weapons and to the post-Cold War multi-\n     polar world. Thus, I have three concerns. First, effective \n     verification: do we have high confidence that our \n     intelligence will detect violations? Second, real reductions, \n     in this case down to zero: will the treaty really eliminate \n     chemical weapons? Third, stability; will the treaty be truly \n     global or will countries like Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and \n     North Korea still be able to destabilize others with the \n     threat of chemical weapons?\n       Furthermore, I believe it is important that the Senate \n     insure that the implementation of this treaty recognize and \n     safeguard American Constitutional protections against \n     unwarranted searches.\n       It is my understanding that the Senate will have the \n     opportunity to address these matters in debate and, perhaps, \n     in amending the Resolution of Ratification. It is my hope \n     that President Clinton will assist you in resolving them. If \n     we work together, we can achieve a treaty which truly \n     enhances American security.\n           Best regards,\n                                                         Bob Dole.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in connection with that, statements were \nmade about the chemical industry losing $600 and $800 million. It is a \nmoving target. They say several things at one time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement correctly altering the \nmisstatements already made, and probably will be reiterated, be printed \nin the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n   the united states chemical industry will not lose $600 million in \n                annual exports from u.s. nonratification\n\n       The argument that U.S. chemical companies will be subject \n     to trade sanctions and will have their exports dramatically \n     harmed if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC is patently \n     untrue.\n       The Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), which has \n     been making this argument, has contradicted itself time and \n     again, calling into serious doubt the credibility of its \n     claims.\n       Throughout the fall of 1996, the Senate was bombarded with \n     claims from the Administration and CMA that $600 million in \n     export sales would be ``placed at risk'' if the U.S. did not \n     ratify the treaty.\n       Unable to substantiate such claims, the CMA cut its \n     estimate by more than half in February, 1997, to $280 million \n     in potential lost sales.\n       On March 10, 1997, under further scrutiny, CMA dropped its \n     estimate to $227 million in potential lost exports.\n       However, $142 million of CMA's estimate comes from the sale \n     of Amiton, a pesticide which Western countries do not use \n     (for environmental reasons) but which is sold to many African \n     countries (many of which have not ratified the CWC).\n       The truth of the matter is that less than one-quarter of \n     one percent of CMA's annual exports could be subject to trade \n     restrictions if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC.\n       CMA is now claiming that European countries will impose \n     broader ``non-tariff'' barriers on U.S. chemicals, despite \n     the fact that 30 percent of all CMA members are owned by \n     Europeans or other countries (such as Akzo Nobel Chemicals, \n     which is Dutch).\n       CMA companies must not be all that concerned since CMA \n     admitted in March that no CMA member company had filed a \n     report with the Securities and Exchange Commission to notify \n     stockholder regarding the impact of U.S. nonratification.\n\n\n    just what types of chemicals are subject to trade restrictions?\n\n       The CWC has three schedules of chemicals. Schedule 1 \n     compounds are those which constitute chemical weapons or only \n     have chemical weapons applications. They are not traded by \n     U.S. companies anyway.\n       Schedule 2 chemicals are also usable in or as weapons, and \n     they are ``not produced in large commercial quantities for \n     purposes not prohibited under [the CWC].'' (Annex A, \n     paragraph 2 of the CWC) Thus, these chemicals also are not \n     traded, or are traded in insignificant quantities, by U.S. \n     companies.\n       Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals are controlled under U.S. export \n     regulations and would not be traded freely by U.S. companies \n     regardless of membership of the U.S. in the CWC.\n       Schedule 3 chemicals are common commercial chemicals which \n     may be used in chemical weapons, but which have many other \n     uses. These chemicals, together with chemicals not on any of \n     the three schedules, comprise the vast majority--virtually \n     all--of U.S. chemical trade.\n       There are no restrictions on trade of Schedule 3 chemicals \n     implied or stated in the CWC. U.S. nonmembership in the \n     treaty will not affect trade in chemicals on Schedule 3 or \n     which do not appear on any schedule.\n       The CWC states that ``Schedule 2 chemicals shall only be \n     transferred to or received from States Parties.'' Therefore, \n     if the U.S. is not a party, it cannot export to or receive \n     from CWC member states any Schedule 2 chemicals. This does \n     not matter to U.S. trade, however, because the U.S. \n     manufactures all of the Schedule 2 chemicals it needs and \n     does not export them in significant quantities.\n       There is no basis in the claim that nonmembership in the \n     CWC will harm U.S. imports or exports, or harm U.S. industry \n     in any significant manner. In fact, the opportunity for \n     smaller chemical companies to break into the domestic market \n     and compete in the production of the limited amount of \n     Schedule 2 chemicals that cannot be imported would prove a \n     net plus for the economy.\n\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Now, I am taking this advantage as the chairman of the \ncommittee. I spoke for 26 minutes this morning. The distinguished \nranking member spoke for an hour. Just for the record, how long did the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana speak? I ask that of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lugar). The Senator from Indiana spoke for \n41 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I see. So the Senator from North Carolina feels that maybe \nthey have had ample opportunity thus far into the debate.\n  Now, I ask that the distinguished Senator from Minnesota be \nrecognized for 7 minutes, after which time we will stand in recess for \nthe policy luncheon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Minnesota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nChemical Weapons Convention [CWC] with the full complement of 33 \nconditions on U.S. participation, which are now being considered by the \nSenate.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have been reviewing \nand studying this treaty for over a year now and have had some serious \nreservations about the CWC throughout that process.\n  Therefore, I believe the conditions in Senate Executive Resolution 75 \nare essential to ensuring that the CWC has real benefits for American \nnational security and will be truly verifiable and effective. Before we \ncommit the American taxpayers to paying more than $100 million annually \nfor U.S. participation in the treaty, we owe them nothing less.\n  Let me outline the conditions I believe are the most important.\n  First, I am pleased the Clinton administration has finally reversed \nits long-standing position that the CWC would prevent U.S. soldiers \nfrom using tear gas to rescue downed pilots or to avoid deadly force \nwhen enemy troops are using civilians as human shields.\n  Second, we must be sure that Russia will both comply with the \nexisting chemical weapons destruction agreements it has already signed, \nand that it will ratify the CWC. Russia has the largest chemical \nweapons stockpile in the world and its compliance with earlier \nagreements will help the United States be more confident of its ability \nto monitor Russian compliance with the CWC.\n  This is especially important given reports that Russia has already \ndeveloped new chemical weapons programs specifically designed to evade \nthe treaty. More than 15 months after the United States ratified the \nSTART II Treaty, Russia has refused to follow suit. What makes us think \nthat if we join the CWC before Russia does, it will then follow our \nexample?\n  Third, the CWC will not protect American soldiers from chemical \nattack unless it has a serious and immediate impact on those countries \nthat have hostile intentions toward the United States. This means that \ncountries which are suspected of having chemical weapons programs and \nare sponsors of terrorism--such as Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North \nKorea--must participate in the CWC. Just this morning, a newspaper \narticle reported that a prominent North Korean defector has warned that \nhis former country is fully prepared to launch a chemical weapons \nattack on its neighbors. North Korea has not yet signed the CWC.\n  Fourth, we need to provide as much protection as possible for U.S. \nGovernment facilities and businesses when faced with international \ninspections. While the CWC does allow the United States to refuse \nspecific inspectors, it should be a matter of policy that we will not \naccept inspectors from terrorist states like Iran. We are certainly \njustified in suspecting that these inspectors would be intent on \ngaining access to classified or confidential business information.\n  Fifth, I understand the administration has offered assurances that \nthe United States will not seek to transfer chemical technology or \ninformation about chemical defenses to countries that might put it to \nharmful use. But because of the vagueness of the treaty language, we \nneed to go further to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons. We \nneed to close off the possibility that other countries could use \nlanguage in the treaty as cover for their desires to transfer chemical \ntechnology to countries like Iran. As we have seen in Iraq and North \nKorea, nuclear technology acquired supposedly for peaceful purposes can \nadvance weapon capabilities.\n\n  Sixth and finally, we need to be sure that the CWC is effectively \nverifiable, meaning that the United States has a high degree of \nconfidence in its ability to detect significant violations. I strongly \nsupported the START II Treaty because it met this traditional standard. \nIf we don't think we can detect cheating under the CWC, it seriously \ncalls into question the value of the treaty.\n  Recently, there have been reports that China is selling chemical \nweapons components to Iran. Both countries have signed the CWC and, \ntherefore, are supposedly committed to banning such activity.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, there are conditions in the current \nresolution of ratification for the CWC that address every single one of \nthe concerns I have mentioned.\n  I sincerely intend to support and vote for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention as long as the resolution of ratification is fortified with \nsuch strong conditions. They will help ensure that this treaty will \nhave a real impact on the proliferation of chemical weapons and provide \nproven protection for U.S. forces.\n  However, I understand that some of my colleagues may try to strip out \nthese important conditions on the CWC. This would be very unfortunate \nand would cause me to reconsider my current support for the treaty.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against any killer amendments that would \nstrike these conditions and, therefore, deprive the United States of \nassurances that the Chemical Weapons Convention is effective, \nenforceable and verifiable. The American taxpayers, who will be funding \nU.S. participation in the CWC, deserve a treaty that unquestionably and \nunambiguously advances our national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3468-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

or\n       (ii) supersede or otherwise affect the provisions of title \n     V of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 413 et \n     seq.).\n       (F) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (i) Appropriate committees of congress.--The term \n     ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate and the Committee on International Relations and \n     the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (ii) Organization.--The term ``Organization'' means the \n     Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \n     established under the Convention and includes any organ of \n     that Organization and any board or working group, such as the \n     Scientific Advisory Board, that may be established by it.\n       (iii) Organization affiliated with the organization.--The \n     terms ``organization affiliated with the Organization'' and \n     ``affiliated organizations'' include the Provisional \n     Technical Secretariat under the Convention and any laboratory \n     certified by the Director-General of the Technical \n     Secretariat as designated to perform analytical or other \n     functions.\n       (6) Amendments to the convention.--\n       (A) Voting representation of the united states.--A United \n     States representative will be present at all Amendment \n     Conferences and will cast a vote, either affirmative or \n     negative, on all proposed amendments made at such \n     conferences.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n       (B) Submission of amendments as treaties.--The President \n     shall submit to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification under Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the \n     Constitution of the United States any amendment to the \n     Convention adopted by an Amendment Conference.\n       (7) Continuing vitality of the australia group and national \n     export controls.--\n       (A) Declaration.--The Senate declares that the collapse of \n     the informal forum of states known as the ``Australia \n     Group,'' either through changes in membership or lack of \n     compliance with common export controls, or the substantial \n     weakening of common Australia Group export controls and non-\n     proliferation measures in force on the date of United States \n     ratification of the Convention, would constitute a \n     fundamental change in circumstances to United States \n     ratification of the Convention.\n       (B) Certification requirement.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to Congress that--\n       (i) nothing in the Convention obligates the United States \n     to accept any modification, change in scope, or weakening of \n     its national export controls;\n       (ii) the United States understands that the maintenance of \n     national restrictions on trade in chemicals and chemical \n     production technology is fully compatible with the provisions \n     of the Convention, including Article XI(2), and solely within \n     the sovereign jurisdiction of the United States;\n       (iii) the Convention preserves the right of State Parties, \n     unilaterally or collectively, to maintain or impose export \n     controls on chemicals and related chemical production \n     technology for foreign policy or national security reasons, \n     notwithstanding Article XI(2); and\n       (iv) each Australia Group member, at the highest diplomatic \n     levels, has officially communicated to the United States \n     Government its understanding and agreement that export \n     control and nonproliferation measures which the Australia \n     Group has undertaken are fully compatible with the provisions \n     of the Convention, including Article XI(2), and its \n     commitment to maintain in the future such export controls and \n     nonproliferation measures against non-Australia Group \n     members.\n       (C) Annual certification.--\n       (i) Effectiveness of australia group.--The President shall \n     certify to Congress on an annual basis that--\n\n       (I) Australia Group members continue to maintain an equally \n     effective or more comprehensive control over the export of \n     toxic chemicals and their precursors, dual-use processing \n     equipment, human, animal and plant pathogens and toxins with \n     potential biological weapons application, and dual-use \n     biological equipment, as that afforded by the Australia Group \n     as of the date of ratification of the Convention by the \n     United States; and\n       (II) the Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for \n     limiting the spread of chemical and biological weapons-\n     related materials and technology, and that the \n     effectiveness of the Australia Group has not been \n     undermined by changes in membership, lack of compliance \n     with common export controls and nonproliferation measures, \n     or the weakening of common controls and nonproliferation \n     measures, in force as of the date of ratification of the \n     Convention by the United States.\n       (ii) Consultation with senate required.--In the event that \n     the President is, at any time, unable to make the \n     certifications described in clause (i), the President shall \n     consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a \n     resolution of continued adherence to the Convention, \n     notwithstanding the fundamental change in circumstance.\n       (D) Periodic consultation with congressional committees.--\n     The President shall consult periodically, but not less \n     frequently than twice a year, with the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives, on Australia Group \n     export control and nonproliferation measures. If any \n     Australia Group member adopts a position at variance with the \n     certifications and understandings provided under subparagraph \n     (B), or should seek to gain Australia Group acquiescence or \n     approval for an interpretation that various provisions of the \n     Convention require it to remove chemical-weapons related \n     export controls against any State Party to the Convention, \n     the President shall block any effort by that Australia Group \n     member to secure Australia Group approval of such a position \n     or interpretation.\n       (E) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) Australia group.--The term ``Australia Group'' means \n     the informal forum of states, chaired by Australia, whose \n     goal is to discourage and impede chemical and biological \n     weapons proliferation by harmonizing national export controls \n     chemical weapons precursor chemicals, biological weapons \n     pathogens, and dual-use production equipment, and through \n     other measures.\n       (ii) Highest diplomatic levels.--The term ``highest \n     diplomatic levels'' means at the levels of senior officials \n     with the power to authoritatively represent their \n     governments, and does not include diplomatic representatives \n     of those governments to the United States.\n       (8) Negative security assurances.--\n       (A) Reevaluation.--In forswearing under the Convention the \n     possession of a chemical weapons retaliatory capability, the \n     Senate understands that deterrence of attack by chemical \n     weapons requires a reevaluation of the negative security \n     assurances extended to non-nuclear-weapon states.\n       (B) Classified report.--Accordingly, 180 days after the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall submit to the Congress a classified report \n     setting forth the findings of a detailed review of United \n     States policy on negative security assurances, including a \n     determination of the appropriate responses to the use of \n     chemical or biological weapons against the Armed Forces of \n     the United States, United States citizens, allies, and third \n     parties.\n       (9) Protection of advanced biotechnology.--Prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, and \n     on January 1 of every year thereafter, the President shall \n     certify to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives that the legitimate \n     commercial activities and interests of chemical, \n     biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms in the United States \n     are not being significantly harmed by the limitations of the \n     Convention on access to, and production of, those chemicals \n     and toxins listed in Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals.\n       (10) Monitoring and verification of compliance.--\n       (A) Declaration.--The Senate declares that--\n       (i) the Convention is in the interests of the United States \n     only if all State Parties are in strict compliance with the \n     terms of the Convention as submitted to the Senate for its \n     advice and consent to ratification, such compliance being \n     measured by performance and not by efforts, intentions, or \n     commitments to comply; and\n       (ii) the Senate expects all State Parties to be in strict \n     compliance with their obligations under the terms of the \n     Convention, as submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification;\n       (B) Briefings on compliance.--Given its concern about the \n     intelligence community's low level of confidence in its \n     ability to monitor compliance with the Convention, the Senate \n     expects the executive branch of the Government to offer \n     regular briefings, not less than four times a year, to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives on compliance issues related to the \n     Convention. Such briefings shall include a description of all \n     United States efforts in bilateral and multilateral \n     diplomatic channels and forums to resolve compliance issues \n     and shall include a complete description of--\n       (i) any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     at meetings of the Organization, in advance of such meetings;\n       (ii) any compliance issues raised at meetings of the \n     Organization, within 30 days of such meeting;\n       (iii) any determination by the President that a State Party \n     is in noncompliance with or is otherwise acting in a manner \n     inconsistent with the object or purpose of the Convention, \n     within 30 days of such a determination.\n       (C) Annual reports on compliance.--The President shall \n     submit on January 1 of each year to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a full and complete \n     classified and unclassified report setting forth--\n       (i) a certification of those countries included in the \n     Intelligence Community's Monitoring Strategy, as set forth by \n     the Director of Central Intelligence's Arms Control Staff and \n     the National Intelligence Council (or any successor document \n     setting forth intelligence priorities in the field of the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction) that are \n     determined to be in compliance with the Convention, on a \n     country-by-country basis;\n       (ii) for those countries not certified pursuant to clause \n     (i), an identification and assessment of all compliance \n     issues arising with regard to the adherence of the country to \n     its obligation under the Convention;\n       (iii) the steps the United States has taken, either \n     unilaterally or in conjunction with another State Party--\n\n       (I) to initiate challenge inspections of the noncompliant \n     party with the objective of demonstrating to the \n     international community the act of noncompliance;\n       (II) to call attention publicly to the activity in \n     question; and\n       (III) to seek on an urgent basis a meeting at the highest \n     diplomatic level with the noncompliant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n\n       (iv) a determination of the military significance and \n     broader security risks arising from any compliance issue \n     identified pursuant to clause (ii); and\n       (v) a detailed assessment of the responses of the \n     noncompliant party in question to action undertaken by the \n     United States described in clause (iii).\n       (D) Countries previously included in compliance reports.--\n     For any country that was previously included in a report \n     submitted under subparagraph (C), but which subsequently is \n     not included in the Intelligence Community's Monitoring \n     Strategy (or successor document), such country shall continue \n     to be included in the report submitted under subparagraph (C) \n     unless the country has been certified under subparagraph \n     (C)(i) for each of the previous two years.\n       (E) Form of certifications.--For those countries that have \n     been publicly and officially identified by a representative \n     of the intelligence community as possessing or seeking to \n     develop chemical weapons, the certification described in \n     subparagraph (C)(i) shall be in unclassified form.\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n       (F) Annual reports on intelligence.--On January 1, 1998, \n     and annually thereafter, the Director of Central Intelligence \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed \n     Services, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate and to the Committees on International Relations, \n     National Security, and Permanent Select Committee of the \n     House of Representatives, a full and complete classified and \n     unclassified report regarding--\n       (i) the status of chemical weapons development, production, \n     stockpiling, and use, within the meanings of those terms \n     under the Convention, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (ii) any information made available to the United States \n     Government concerning the development, production, \n     acquisition, stockpiling, retention, use, or direct or \n     indirect transfer of novel agents, including any unitary or \n     binary chemical weapon comprised of chemical components not \n     identified on the schedules of the Annex on Chemicals, on a \n     country-by-country basis;\n       (iii) the extent of trade in chemicals potentially relevant \n     to chemical weapons programs, including all Australia Group \n     chemicals and chemicals identified on the schedules of the \n     Annex on Chemicals, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (iv) the monitoring responsibilities, practices, and \n     strategies of the intelligence community (as defined in \n     section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947) and a \n     determination of the level of confidence of the intelligence \n     community with respect to each specific monitoring task \n     undertaken, including an assessment by the intelligence \n     community of the national aggregate data provided by State \n     Parties to the Organization, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (v) an identification of how United States national \n     intelligence means, including national technical means and \n     human intelligence, is being marshaled together with the \n     Convention's verification provisions to monitor compliance \n     with the Convention;

and\n       (viii) the United States Armed Forces should place \n     increased emphasis on potential threats to forces deployed \n     abroad and, in particular, make countering chemical and \n     biological weapons use an organizing principle for United \n     States defense strategy and development of force structure, \n     doctrine, planning, training, and exercising policies of the \n     United States Armed Forces.\n       (B) Actions to strengthen defense capabilities.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall take those actions necessary to \n     ensure that the United States Armed Forces are capable of \n     carrying out required military missions in United States \n     regional contingency plans, despite the threat or use of \n     chemical or biological weapons. In particular, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall ensure that the United States Armed Forces \n     are effectively equipped, organized, trained, and exercised \n     (including at the large unit and theater level) to conduct \n     operations in a chemically or biologically contaminated \n     environment that are critical to the success of the United \n     States military plans in regional conflicts, including--\n       (i) deployment, logistics, and reinforcement operations at \n     key ports and airfields;\n       (ii) sustained combat aircraft sortie generation at \n     critical regional airbases; and\n       (iii) ground force maneuvers of large units and divisions.\n       (C) Discussions with regional allies and likely coalition \n     partners.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretaries of Defense and State \n     shall, as a priority matter, initiate discussions with key \n     regional allies and likely regional coalition partners, \n     including those countries where the United States currently \n     deploys forces, where United States forces would likely \n     operate during regional conflicts, or which would provide \n     civilians necessary to support United States military \n     operations, to determine what steps are necessary to ensure \n     that allied and coalition forces and other critical civilians \n     are adequately equipped and prepared to operate in chemically \n     and biologically contaminated environments.\n       (ii) Reporting requirement.--Not later than one year after \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     Secretaries of Defense and State shall submit a report to the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the \n     Senate and to the Speaker of the House on the result of \n     these discussions, plans for future discussions, measures \n     agreed to improve the preparedness of foreign forces and \n     civilians, and proposals for increased military \n     assistance, including through the Foreign Military Sales, \n     Foreign Military Financing, and the International Military \n     Education and Training programs pursuant to the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961.\n       (D) United states army chemical school.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall take those actions necessary to ensure that the \n     United States Army Chemical School remains under the \n     oversight of a general officer of the United States Army.\n       (E) Sense of the senate.--Given its concerns about the \n     present state of chemical and biological defense readiness \n     and training, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (i) in the transfer, consolidation, and reorganization of \n     the United States Army Chemical School, the Army should not \n     disrupt or diminish the training and readiness of the United \n     States Armed Forces to fight in a chemical-biological warfare \n     environment;\n       (ii) the Army should continue to operate the Chemical \n     Defense Training Facility at Fort McClellan until such time \n     as the replacement training facility at Fort Leonard Wood is \n     functional.\n       (F) Annual reports on chemical and biological weapons \n     defense activities.--On January 1, 1998, and annually \n     thereafter, the President shall submit a report to the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations, National Security, and Appropriations of the House \n     of Representatives, and Speaker of the House on previous, \n     current, and planned chemical and biological weapons defense \n     activities.

and\n       (xiii) a description of progress made in resolving issues \n     relating to the protection of United States population \n     centers from chemical and biological attack, including plans \n     for inoculation of populations, consequence management, and a \n     description of progress made in developing and deploying \n     effective cruise missile defenses and a national ballistic \n     missile defense.\n       (12) Primacy of the united states constitution.--Nothing in \n     the Convention requires or authorizes legislation, or other \n     action, by the United States prohibited by the Constitution \n     of the United States, as interpreted by the United States.\n       (13) Noncompliance.--\n       (A) In general.--If the President determines that \n     persuasive information exists that a State Party to the \n     Convention is maintaining a chemical weapons production or \n     production mobilization capability, is developing new \n     chemical agents, or is in violation of the Convention in any \n     other manner so as to threaten the national security \n     interests of the United States, then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate, and promptly submit to it, a \n     report detailing the effect of such actions;\n       (ii) seek on an urgent basis a challenge inspection of the \n     facilities of the relevant party in accordance with the \n     provisions of the Convention with the objective of \n     demonstrating to the international community the act of \n     noncompliance;\n       (iii) seek, or encourage, on an urgent basis a meeting at \n     the highest diplomatic level with the relevant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n       (iv) implement prohibitions and sanctions against the \n     relevant party as required by law;\n       (v) if noncompliance has been determined, seek on an urgent \n     basis within the Security Council of the United Nations a \n     multilateral imposition of sanctions against the noncompliant \n     party for the purposes of bringing the noncompliant party \n     into compliance; and\n       (vi) in the event that the noncompliance continues for a \n     period of longer than one year after the date of the \n     determination made pursuant to subparagraph (A), promptly \n     consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a \n     resolution of support of continued adherence to the \n     Convention, notwithstanding the changed circumstances \n     affecting the object and purpose of the Convention.\n       (B) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed \n     to impair or otherwise affect the authority of the Director \n     of Central Intelligence to protect intelligence sources and \n     methods from unauthorized disclosure pursuant to section \n     103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     403-3(c)(5)).\n       (C) Presidential determinations.--If the President \n     determines that an action otherwise required under \n     subparagraph (A) would impair or otherwise affect the \n     authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to protect \n     intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized \n     disclosure, the President shall report that determination, \n     together with a detailed written explanation of the basis for \n     that determination, to the chairmen of the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence not later than 15 days after making \n     such determination.\n       (14) Financing russian implementation.--The United States \n     understands that, in order to be assured of the Russian \n     commitment to a reduction in chemical weapons stockpiles, \n     Russia must maintain a substantial stake in financing the \n     implementation of both the 1990 Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement and the Convention. The United States shall not \n     accept any effort by Russia to make deposit of Russia's \n     instrument of ratification contingent upon the United States \n     providing financial guarantees to pay for implementation of \n     commitments by Russia under the 1990 Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement or the Convention.\n       (15) Assistance under article x.--\n       (A) In general.--Prior to the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Congress that the United States shall not provide \n     assistance under paragraph 7(a) of Article X.\n       (B) Countries ineligible for certain assistance under the \n     foreign assistance act.--Prior to the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to the Congress that for any State Party the \n     government of which is not eligible for assistance under \n     chapter 2 of part II (relating to military assistance) or \n     chapter 4 of part II (relating to economic support \n     assistance) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961--\n       (i) no assistance under paragraph 7(b) of Article X will be \n     provided to the State Party; and\n       (ii) no assistance under paragraph 7(c) of Article X other \n     than medical antidotes and treatment will be provided to the \n     State Party.\n       (16) Protection of confidential information.--\n       (A) Unauthorized disclosure of united states business \n     information.--Whenever the President determines that \n     persuasive information is available indicating that--\n       (i) an officer or employee of the Organization has \n     willfully published, divulged, disclosed, or made known in \n     any manner or to any extent not authorized by the Convention \n     any United States confidential business information coming to \n     him in the course of his employment or official duties or by \n     reason of any examination or investigation of any return, \n     report, or record made to or filed with the Organization, or \n     any officer or employee thereof, and\n       (ii) such practice or disclosure has resulted in financial \n     losses or damages to a United States person,\n\n     the President shall, within 30 days after the receipt of such \n     information by the executive branch of Government, notify the \n     Congress in writing of such determination.\n       (B) Waiver of immunity from jurisdiction.--\n       (i) Certification.--Not later than 270 days after \n     notification of Congress under subparagraph (A), the \n     President shall certify to Congress that the immunity from \n     jurisdiction of such foreign person has been waived by the \n     Director-General of the Technical Secretariat.\n       (ii) Withholding of portion of contributions.--If the \n     President is unable to make the certification described under \n     clause (i), then 50 percent of the amount of each annual \n     United States contribution to the regular budget of the \n     Organization that is assessed pursuant to paragraph 7 of \n     Article VIII shall be withheld from disbursement, in addition \n     to any other amounts required to be withheld from \n     disbursement by any other provision of law, until--\n\n       (I) the President makes such certification, or\n       (II) the President certifies to Congress that the situation \n     has been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the United \n     States person who has suffered the damages due to the \n     disclosure of United States confidential business \n     information.\n\n       (C) Breaches of confidentiality.--\n       (i) Certification.--In the case of any breach of \n     confidentiality involving both a State Party and the \n     Organization, including any officer or employee thereof, the \n     President shall, within 270 days after providing written \n     notification to Congress pursuant to subparagraph (A), \n     certify to Congress that the Commission described under \n     paragraph 23 of the Confidentiality Annex has been \n     established to consider the breach.\n       (ii) Withholding of portion of contributions.--If the \n     President is unable to make the certification described under \n     clause (i), then 50 percent of the amount of each annual \n     United States contribution to the regular budget of the \n     Organization that is assessed pursuant to paragraph 7 of \n     Article VIII shall be withheld from disbursement, in addition \n     to any other amounts required to be withheld from \n     disbursement by any other provision of law, until--\n\n       (I) the President makes such certification, or\n       (II) the President certifies to Congress that the situation \n     has been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the United \n     States person who has suffered the damages due to the \n     disclosure of United States confidential business \n     information.\n\n       (D) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) United States confidential business information.--The \n     term ``United States confidential business information'' \n     means any trade secrets or commercial or financial \n     information that is privileged and confidential, as described \n     in section 552(b)(4) of title 5, United States Code, and that \n     is obtained--\n\n       (I) from a United States person; and\n       (II) through the United States National Authority or the \n     conduct of an inspection on United States territory under the \n     Convention.\n\n       (ii) United States person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' means any natural person or any corporation, \n     partnership, or other juridical entity organized under the \n     laws of the United States.\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\n       (iii) United States.--The term ``United States'' means the \n     several States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United \n     States.\n       (17) Constitutional prerogatives.--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (i) Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States \n     Constitution states that the President ``shall have Power, by \n     and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make \n     Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present \n     concur''.\n       (ii) At the turn of the century, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge \n     took the position that the giving of advice and consent to \n     treaties constitutes a stage in negotiation on the treaties \n     and that Senate amendments or reservations to a treaty are \n     propositions ``offered at a later stage of the negotiation by \n     the other part of the American treaty making power in the \n     only manner in which they could then be offered''.\n       (iii) The executive branch of Government has begun a \n     practice of negotiating and submitting to the Senate treaties \n     which include provisions that have the purported effect of--\n\n       (I) inhibiting the Senate from attaching reservations that \n     the Senate considers necessary in the national interest; or\n       (II) preventing the Senate from exercising its \n     constitutional duty to give its advice and consent to treaty \n     commitments before ratification of the treaties.\n\n       (iv) During the 85th Congress, and again during the 102d \n     Congress, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     made its position on this issue clear when stating that ``the \n     President's agreement to such a prohibition cannot constrain \n     the Senate's constitutional right and obligation to give its \n     advice and consent to a treaty subject to any reservation it \n     might determine is required by the national interest''.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) the advice and consent given by the Senate in the past \n     to ratification of treaties containing provisions which \n     prohibit amendments or reservations should not be construed \n     as a precedent for such provisions in future treaties;\n       (ii) United States negotiators to a treaty should not agree \n     to any provision that has the effect of inhibiting the Senate \n     from attaching reservations or offering amendments to the \n     treaty; and\n       (iii) the Senate should not consent in the future to any \n     article or other provision of any treaty that would prohibit \n     the Senate from giving its advice and consent to ratification \n     of the treaty subject to amendment or reservation.\n       (18) Laboratory sample analysis.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that no sample collected in the \n     United States pursuant to the Convention will be transferred \n     for analysis to any laboratory outside the territory of the \n     United States.\n       (19) Effect on terrorism.--The Senate finds that--\n       (A) without regard to whether the Convention enters into \n     force, terrorists will likely view chemical weapons as a \n     means to gain greater publicity and instill widespread fear; \n     and\n       (B) the March 1995 Tokyo subway attack by the Aum Shinrikyo \n     would not have been prevented by the Convention.\n       (20) Constitutional separation of powers.--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (i) Article VIII(8) of the Convention allows a State Party \n     to vote in the Organization if the State Party is in arrears \n     in the payment of financial contributions and the \n     Organization is satisfied that such nonpayment is due to \n     conditions beyond the control of the State Party.\n       (ii) Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution \n     vests in Congress the exclusive authority to ``pay the \n     Debts'' of the United States.\n       (iii) Financial contributions to the Organization may be \n     appropriated only by Congress.\n       (B) Sense of senate.--It is therefore the sense of the \n     Senate that--\n       (i) such contributions thus should be considered, for \n     purposes of Article VIII(8) of the Convention, beyond the \n     control of the executive branch of the United States \n     Government; and\n       (ii) the United States vote in the Organization should not \n     be denied in the event that Congress does not appropriate the \n     full amount of funds assessed for the United States financial \n     contribution to the Organization.\n       (21) On-site inspection agency.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that the On-Site Inspection Agency of the Department \n     of Defense should have the authority to provide assistance in \n     advance of any inspection to any facility in the United \n     States that is subject to a routine inspection under the \n     Convention, or to any facility in the United States that is \n     the object of a challenge inspection conducted pursuant to \n     Article IX, if the consent of the owner or operator of the \n     facility has first been obtained.\n       (22) Limitation on the scale of assessment.--\n       (A) Limitation on annual assessment.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of the Convention, and subject to the requirements \n     of subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) the United States shall \n     pay as a total annual assessment of the costs of the \n     Organization pursuant to paragraph 7 of Article VIII not \n     more than $25,000,000.\n       (B) Recalculation of limitation.--On January 1, 2000, and \n     at each 3-year interval thereafter, the amount specified in \n     subparagraph (A) is to be recalculated by the Administrator \n     of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the \n     immediately preceding 3-year period.\n       (C) Additional contributions requiring congressional \n     approval.--\n       (i) Authority.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     President may furnish additional contributions which would \n     otherwise be prohibited under subparagraph (A) if--\n\n       (I) the President determines and certifies in writing to \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the failure to \n     provide such contributions would result in the inability of \n     the Organization to conduct challenge inspections pursuant to \n     Article IX or would otherwise jeopardize the national \n     security interests of the United States; and\n       (II) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the \n     certification of the President.\n\n       (ii) Statement of reasons.--The President shall transmit \n     with such certification a detailed statement setting forth \n     the specific reasons therefor, and the specific uses to which \n     the additional contributions provided to the Organization \n     would be applied.\n       (D) Additional contributions for verification.--\n     Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for a period of not more \n     than ten years, the President may furnish additional \n     contributions to the Organization for the purposes of meeting \n     the costs of verification under Articles IV and V.\n       (23) Additions to the annex on chemicals.--\n       (A) Presidential notification.--Not later than 10 days \n     after the Director-General of the Technical Secretariat \n     communicates information to all States Parties pursuant to \n     Article XV(5)(a) of a proposal for the addition of a chemical \n     or biological substance to a schedule of the Annex on \n     Chemicals, the President shall notify the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate of the proposed addition.\n       (B) Presidential report.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     Director-General of the Technical Secretariat communicates \n     information of such a proposal pursuant to Article XV(5)(a) \n     or not later than 30 days after a positive recommendation by \n     the Executive Council pursuant to Article XV(5)(c), whichever \n     is sooner, the President shall submit to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate a report, in classified and \n     unclassified form, detailing the likely impact of the \n     proposed addition to the Annex on Chemicals. Such report \n     shall include--\n       (i) an assessment of the likely impact on United States \n     industry of the proposed addition of the chemical or \n     biological substance to a schedule of the Annex on Chemicals;\n       (ii) a description of the likely costs and benefits, if \n     any, to United States national security of the proposed \n     addition of such chemical or biological substance to a \n     schedule of the Annex on Chemicals; and\n       (iii) a detailed assessment of the effect of the proposed \n     addition on United States obligations under the Verification \n     Annex.\n       (C) Presidential consultation.--The President shall, after \n     the submission of the notification required under \n     subparagraph (A) and prior to any action on the proposal by \n     the Executive Council under Article XV(5)(c), consult \n     promptly with the Senate as to whether the United States \n     should object to the proposed addition of a chemical or \n     biological substance pursuant to Article XV(5)(c).\n       (24) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the Constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty. For purposes of this declaration, the term ``INF \n     Treaty'' refers to the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols, approved by the Senate on May \n     27, 1988.\n       (25) Further arms reductions obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power as set forth in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n       (26) Riot control agents.--\n       (A) Permitted uses.--Prior the the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to Congress that the United States is not restricted \n     by the Convention in its use of riot control agents, \n     including the use against combatants who are parties to a \n     conflict, in any of the following cases:\n       (i) United states not a party.--The conduct of peacetime \n     military operations within an area of ongoing armed conflict \n     when the United States is not a party to the conflict (such \n     as recent use of the United States Armed Forces in Somalia, \n     Bosnia, and Ruanda).\n       (ii) Consensual peacekeeping.--Consensual peacekeeping \n     operations when the use of\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\n     force is authorized by the receiving state, including \n     operations pursuant to Chapter VI of the United Nations \n     Charter.\n       (iii) Chapter vii peacekeeping.--Peacekeeping operations \n     when force is authorized by the Securtity Council under \n     Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\n       (B) Implementation.--The President shall take no measure, \n     and prescribe no rule or regulation, which would alter or \n     eliminate Executive Order 11850 of April 8, 1975.\n       (C) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``riot control \n     agent'' has the meaning given the term in Article II(7) of \n     the Convention.\n       (27) Chemical weapons destruction.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification of the \n     Convention, the President shall certify to the Congress that \n     all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n       (A) Exploration of alternative technologies.--The President \n     has agreed to explore alternative technologies for the \n     destruction of the United States stockpile of chemical \n     weapons in order to ensure that the United States has the \n     safest, most effective and environmentally sound plans and \n     programs for meeting its obligations under the Convention for \n     the destruction of chemical weapons.\n       (B) Convention extends destruction deadline.--The \n     requirement in section 1412 of Public Law 99-145 (50 U.S.C. \n     1521) for completion of the destruction of the United States \n     stockpile of chemical weapons by December 31, 2004, will be \n     superseded upon the date the Convention enters into force \n     with respect to the United States by the deadline required by \n     the Convention of April 29, 2007.\n       (C) Authority to employ a different destruction \n     technology.--The requirement in Article III(1)(a)(v) of the \n     Convention for a declaration by each State Party not later \n     than 30 days after the date the Convention enters into force \n     with respect to that Party, on general plans of the State \n     Party for destruction of its chemical weapons does not \n     preclude in any way the United States from deciding in the \n     future to employ a technology for the destruction of chemical \n     weapons different than that declared under that Article.\n       (D) Procedures for extension of deadline.--The President \n     will consult with Congress on whether to submit a request to \n     the Executive Council of the Organization for an extension of \n     the deadline for the destruction of chemical weapons under \n     the Convention, as provided under part IV(A) of the Annex on \n     Implementation and Verification to the Convention, if, as a \n     result of the program of alternative technologies for the \n     destruction of chemical munitions carried out under section \n     8065 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1997 \n     (as contained in Public Law 104-208), the President \n     determines that alternatives to the incineration of chemical \n     weapons are available that are safer and more environmentally \n     sound but whose use would preclude the United States from \n     meeting the deadlines of the Convention.\n       (28) Constitutional protection against unreasonable search \n     and seizure.--\n       (A) In general.--In order to protect United States citizens \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall certify to Congress that--\n       (i) for any challenge inspection conducted on the territory \n     of the United States pursuant to Article IX, where consent \n     has been withheld, the United States National Authority will \n     first obtain a criminal search warrant based upon probable \n     cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and describing with \n     particularity the place to be searched and the persons or \n     things to be seized; and\n       (ii) for any routine inspection of a declared facility \n     under the Convention that is conducted on an involuntary \n     basis on the territory of the United States, the United \n     States National Authority first will obtain an administrative \n     search warrant from a United States magistrate judge.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of this resolution, the term \n     ``National Authority'' means the agency or office of the \n     United States Government designated by the United States \n     pursuant to Article VII(4) of the Convention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that under the previous \norder the five remaining conditions are now part of the resolution and \nare open to motions to strike.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask that the Record reflect my ``aye'' vote \non the two resolutions just voted, and that the Record also reflect \nthat Senator Smith of New Hampshire voted ``aye.''\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 10 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish the Record to reflect that the \nSenator from Virginia was on the floor present and voting ``aye'' on \nthe resolution.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I further ask that the Record reflect \nthat the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, was present and voting \n``aye''; and that Senator Kempthorne, Senator Abraham, Senator Roberts, \nand Senator Hutchinson also voted ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield 10 seconds for a \nunanimous-consent request regarding a staff member?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Greg Suchan, a fellow on \nthe staff of Senator McCain, be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring the discussion of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are now going to commence additional \ndebate on the Chemical Weapons Convention. I would like to begin with \nsome general observations about treaties in general and about this \ntreaty in particular.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin by making what should be an obvious \npoint. But in view of some of the rhetoric, I think it is important to \nreiterate it; that is, that the opponents of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention abhor chemical weapons just as much as proponents do. If \nthis treaty performs as it is advertised to perform, I think everyone \nin this body would be supportive of it. Certainly those who oppose the \nconvention support eliminating our chemical weapons, which will happen \nwith or without the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  As has been noted by previous speakers, the United States is \ncommitted to eliminating all of our chemical weapons, and I suspect \nthat everyone in this Chamber supports that position. So opposition is \nnot based on the notion that we would retain our chemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that the Record reflect that the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Grassley, was present and voted ``aye'' on the last \ntwo votes.\n  Mr. President, let me move forward to this proposition. Last week the \nSenate approved Senate Resolution 495, which demonstrates our \ncommitment to do more. Whether one supports the Chemical Weapons \nConvention or not, this was an important bill to demonstrate our \ncommitment, both here at home and abroad, to do more to try to stop the \nspread of chemical weapons, and not doing it alone, as my friend from \nDelaware has said, because Senate Resolution 495 contains several \nprovisions that call for additional multilateral action on the part of \nthe United States. It requires the President, for example, to use his \nbest efforts to keep the Australia Group intact and to work against any \nweakening of the Australia Group restrictions on trade in chemicals; to \nwork with Russia to ensure that it conforms to its obligations under \nthe bilateral destruction agreement; for the President to impose \nsanctions on countries that violate international law with respect to \nchemical weapons.\n  So Senate Resolution 495 was not a go-it-alone resolution. Quite to \nthe contrary. Though it did close some loopholes in American law, it \nalso reached out in various specific ways to enable us to deal with the \nproblem of the spread of chemical weapons in more practical and \nspecific ways than the Chemical Weapons Convention itself does.\n  We have just had a vote on the resolution of ratification as \npresented by Senator Helms, the resolution that is currently before us. \nMany of us voted for that resolution, to make the point that we favor \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention so long as it has certain protections \nbuilt into it. I think it should also be clear that the opposition to \nthe Chemical Weapons convention is not based on politics.\n  As one of my colleagues said, there will be criticism of President \nClinton. I don't think you will hear criticism of President Clinton. \nThe opposition to this treaty is not based on politics. Indeed, it is \nnot an easy treaty to oppose. I think those who oppose it must be \nrecognized as doing so because of a firm principle and commitment \nrather than anything political.\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\n  Another general point I would like to make is this. The Senate has a \nconstitutional obligation to independently scrutinize treaties. It has \nbeen said that treaties are forever. Most of the treaties that have \nbeen ratified by the U.S. Senate are still in force--treaties that are \nmany, many, many years old, some undoubtedly far beyond this time. It \nis like amending the Constitution. It requires a two-thirds vote. It \nrequires a great deal of thought, therefore, on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, we are not a rubber stamp. No one should feel that \nthey have to support this treaty just because it has been proposed. \nTreaties are no substitute for sensible action. They are in many \nrespects inherently limited in their value, especially when the nations \nwith whom they are entered into are not committed to the principles of \nthe treaty. There are examples in past history that demonstrate this.\n  The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, which outlawed war, was obviously \nsomething that everyone felt good about supporting. But the actions \ndidn't follow the words, and we know what happened.\n  Also, this morning one of my colleagues quoted Will Rogers, who said, \n``We have never lost a war or won a treaty.'' While that has a certain \nring of truth to it, I don't think anyone would suggest that, \ntherefore, all treaties are bad. As a matter of fact, we have supported \nvery specific treaties that we think have done some good--arms control \ntreaties like the INF Treaty, the START I Treaty, and the START II \nTreaty. As a matter of fact, I was asked to support the START II Treaty \non the grounds that Russia would not ratify the START II Treaty until \nthe United States did. So we did. We support the START II Treaty. It \nwas ratified here. And 2 years later, the Russians still have not \nratified the START II Treaty. So I agree with my colleagues who say \nthat some treaties can be useful. I also make the point that one should \nnot rely strictly on treaties.\n  I also am troubled by the proposition that we somehow feel that we \ncould do internationally that which we could never do domestically. I \ndon't think any of us would contend, for example, that we think we can \nsolve the problem of crime by going to the criminals in our \nneighborhoods and making a treaty with them to stop committing crime. \nInstead, we have police forces, we have laws, we have specific \npunishments, we have a court system, and we put people in prison when \nthey violate those laws. In other words, we take specific action to \ndeal with the problem. We don't rely upon the written word of someone \nwho may be unreliable. Yet, in the international forum that seems to be \nvery much in vogue.\n\n  I don't think there is any reason that we can believe that a treaty \nwith Iran, for example, is going to change its behavior, or Iraq, or \nLibya, or North Korea, or many of the other rogue states throughout the \nworld. I think it is countries like Iran that want the benefits of the \nCWC and the lifting of the trade restrictions that we currently have \nwith Iran, secure in the knowledge that it can avoid detection and/or \nany punishment that might follow that. Treaties generally do not modify \nthe behavior of states. The law-abiding will abide, and those that \nintend to cheat will either cheat or not join at all.\n  That is why these multilateral treaties, unlike some of the bilateral \ntreaties that we entered into earlier, are more difficult to make work. \nFrequently what they do is complicate diplomacy and encourage \ndishonesty. We know that there are numerous examples of violations of \nexisting treaties and previous treaties. But it was uncomfortable for \nus to bring those violations to light because, frankly, we thought that \nwe had bigger fish to fry. We had more important matters with those \nstates than the violation of a particular treaty. As a result, \nparadoxically it was more difficult to enforce these conditions once \nthe treaty went into effect than it was before, because once the treaty \nwent into effect, in order to upset the applecart, we have to find \nviolations. We take it to the body that is going to find a violation \nand sanction, and we decide that would be diplomatically difficult \nbecause we want to accomplish some greater purpose with the state that \nis in violation. So we just forget the whole thing. What that does is \nliterally put into law the violations that are occurring currently. So \nthey can complicate diplomacy and encourage dishonesty.\n  The bottom line about this general discussion is this: Sometimes \ntreaties can be very useful and sometimes not. We have an obligation to \nmake that distinction--not just to take the word that, if a treaty has \nbeen proposed, we have an obligation to support it. That is not the job \nof the U.S. Senate. Treaties are not an excuse to do that which is \ndifficult. It is like making a New Year's resolution rather than \nbeginning to diet. Sometimes we have to have the courage to begin the \ndiet rather than just relying on a New Year's resolution.\n  Mr. President, a second set of general comments:\n  Reasonable people can differ over the Chemical Weapons Convention. We \nhave a series of former governmental officials on both sides of this \nissue. We have former Secretaries of Defense, ambassadors, generals, \ncolumnists--all of whom have come out very publicly against the treaty. \nThere is undoubtedly an equal number who have come out for the chemical \nweapons treaty. I hope we can begin this debate with the proposition \nthat reasonable people can differ on this very important matter. \nFrankly, when former Secretaries of State--like Dick Cheney, Casper \nWeinberger, Don Rumsfeld, James Schlesinger; former Defense officials, \nsuch as Jeane Kirkpatrick and Richard Perle, Gen. P.X. Kelley, and \nFreddie Clay--when people like this say that they are opposed to the \ntreaty, it ought to be clear that there are reasonable arguments on \nboth sides and that neither side should claim that all right and truth \nand justice are on their side.\n  Important columnists have also weighed in to this and find themselves \non both sides of the issue.\n  That is why I am troubled by the slogan of some people in the \nadministration--and, in particular, I will cite the Secretary of State, \nwho has said on national television that one of the reasons to vote for \nthis treaty is that it has ``Made in America'' written all over it. Mr. \nPresident, that is not a substitute for reasoned argument. It is a \nslogan. It misrepresents the Reagan administration's position on the \nchemical weapons treaty, which, by the way, was very much different \nthan the treaty that is before the Senate today.\n  I can point out the fact that there have been other treaties proposed \nto the U.S. Senate that also had ``Made in America'' written all over \nthem--like the League of Nations, which this Senate in its judgment \ndecided not to rubberstamp but to reject.\n  There were cries at the time similar to the cries you hear today that \nit would isolate America; that it would hurt our business; that we \nwould be the laughingstock of the world; that, after all, President \nWilson was the one who created this treaty and how could we vote \nagainst it. Moreover, we would be the pariah in the world if we voted \nagainst the League of Nations. But in 1919, this body exercised its \njudgment, its constitutional prerogative and it declined to allow the \nUnited States to participate. And I do not think today there are very \nmany people who believe this country made a mistake by waiting and \ncreating instead the United Nations.\n  We, I think, should be able to go forward. I think it takes more \ncourage sometimes to go forward with a position that acknowledges a \nmistake than it does to simply blindly go forward and perhaps have in \nthe back of your mind the idea that you have made a mistake but it \nwould not look good if you backed out at this time.\n  That is another one of the arguments being made by the opponents; we \nwould be embarrassed internationally if we backed out of the treaty at \nthis point or caused part of it to be renegotiated. I submit that \nknowing we have made a mistake at least with regard to articles X and \nXI in this treaty, we should have the courage to fix articles X and XI \nbefore our resolution of ratification is deposited at The Hague.\n  Now another general comment, Mr. President. No one has a monopoly on \nmorality. Ours is a disagreement about means, not about ends. I want to \nmake this point very clear because some people, perhaps a little \noverzealous to push this treaty, have inferred that those who vote \nagainst it somehow\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nsupport the use of chemical weapons. I watched my grandfather die, Mr. \nPresident, from emphysema acquired as a result of his being gassed in \nWorld War I in Europe. Therefore, I take a back seat to no one in \nexpressing my abhorrence for these despicable weapons and why I fully \nsupport the United States eliminating our chemical weapons and leading \nthe world in that regard. We are the only country in the world with \nchemical weapons that has declared we will eliminate all of our stocks \nof those weapons.\n  So I hope no one tries to lecture me about the evils of poison gas \nand how the only way to deal with that is through this Chemical Weapons \nConvention. We have been the moral leader of the world by imposing \ntrade restrictions on countries like Iran, for example, restrictions \nthat will probably have to be lifted as a result of this treaty because \nof articles X and XI. So I believe that insisting on renegotiation of \narticles X and XI would confirm our moral position. Our negotiators \ntried but failed to win key concessions on those provisions. In the \nfuture, they will be strengthened by the knowledge that the Senate will \nnot go along with such halfway measures with a defective treaty.\n  So, Mr. President, my point here is this. It matters how we make a \nmoral statement, and simply ballyhooing a treaty that everyone knows is \nflawed does not enhance our moral stature.\n  Now to some specific comments. Those of us who have reservations \nabout the treaty have said that it fails in its key objectives, that if \nit met these objectives we would support it, that our opposition is \nbased on two simple points. It fails to meet the objectives and it does \nmore harm than good.\n  In what way does it fail to meet its objectives. It was proposed as a \nglobal and verifiable and enforceable treaty. Unfortunately, it is none \nof those. First, it is not global. It does not cover the key countries \nand the key chemicals that are currently suspected of being the \nproblems. Nine of the 14 countries suspected of possessing chemical \nweapons have not even signed this treaty. These countries include \nLibya, Iraq, Syria, North Korea, Egypt, Sudan, Serbia, South Korea, and \nTaiwan. So many of the countries in the world that possess the \nchemicals are not signatories. They are not going to bind themselves to \nit. And there is nothing we can do in terms of verification or \ninspection or anything else that is going to deal with it. The best way \nto deal with those countries is to do what we are currently doing, \nwhich is to maintain and enforce the restrictions of the Australia \nGroup.\n  Now, I spoke of that before. What is it? It is a group of 29 \ncountries, including the United States, that have agreed among \nthemselves not to trade these chemicals to countries that they think \nmight want to develop chemical weapons with them. And we have these \nrestrictions in place now. That is the best way to prevent the spread \nof these chemicals. Unfortunately, as an incentive to get countries to \njoin the chemical weapons treaty, articles X and XI call into question \nthe existence of those conditions and in fact in our view require that \nthe states remove those restrictions and trade with the countries that \nare parties to the treaty.\n  Second, the treaty is not verifiable. Now, proponents have said, \nwell, nothing is 100-percent verifiable. That is a false standard, Mr. \nPresident. Nobody is claiming that it should be 100-percent verifiable. \nThe question is whether it is effectively verifiable. And on that there \nis virtually unanimous agreement that, no, it is not effectively \nverifiable. I read to you a recently unclassified national \nintelligence estimate conclusion published originally in August of 1993 \nwhich stated:\n\n       The capability of the intelligence community to monitor \n     compliance with the CWC is severely limited and likely to \n     remain so for the rest of the decade. The key provision of \n     the monitoring regime, challenge inspections at undeclared \n     sites, can be thwarted by a nation determined to preserve a \n     small secret program using the delays and managed access \n     rules allowed by the convention.\n\n  And there are a variety of other statements I could read, including \nstatements of the former Director of the CIA, all of which confirm the \nfact that this is not a verifiable treaty.\n  Nor is the treaty enforceable. Even if you were to find a violation \nand you brought it to the bodies that are supposed to run this treaty, \nyou would have to have a three-quarter vote, and there is no sanction \nin place. Once they found a violation, they would go to the country and \nsay, would you please stop violating. If the country continued to \nignore them, although the likelihood is the country would say, well, \nsure, we would be happy to, and eventually hide the material in such a \nway that you could not find a violation in the future, but assuming the \nviolation continued and you continue to prove that, what is the \nsanction? There is none. Where do you go? The United Nations, the \nGeneral Assembly.\n  Mr. President, that is not a place where at least the United States \nhas been treated very kindly in the past. And if you have to go all the \nway to the Security Council, Russia, China, other states have a veto. \nSo it is unlikely that significant punishment would be meted out. As a \nmatter of fact, the evidence of that probably most clearly is the case \nof Iraq which admittedly--I should not say admittedly. They denied it, \nbut after inspection it was confirmed that chemical weapons were used \nagainst both Iran and against the Kurdish population of Iraq itself and \nyet the United Nations, the peace-loving nations of the world were \nincapable of mustering the courage to even name Iraq in a meaningless \nresolution about the use of these weapons. So it does not seem likely \nto me that the United Nations would muster the courage to impose any \nkind of particular sanction.\n  Now, another one of the selling points of this treaty, according to \nits proponents, is, well, it is better than nothing. In other words, \ngranted, it does not cover a lot of the countries we wished it covered \nand it is not very verifiable and there are not any particular \nsanctions in the treaty, but at least it is better than nothing.\n  Our response to that is essentially twofold. First of all, it is very \ncostly both in terms of money and potential constitutional restrictions \nand, second, there are some other very significant reasons why it is \nnot better than nothing.\n  In terms of cost, we know that the cost to the Government is going to \nbe $150 million to $200 million annually. Businesses are going to have \nto pay between $200,000 and $500,000 for inspections. Just to fill out \nthe forms, and there are thousands of businesses in this country that \nwill have to fill out the forms, it is going to be a $50,000 to $70,000 \nproposition, and, of course, untold amounts lost in confidential \nbusiness information which can result as a result of the industrial \nespionage that most people believe will result from the inspections \nunder this treaty.\n  Second, we mentioned the constitutional issues. There has been an \nattempt to fix about half of the constitutional issues. One deals with \nthe fourth amendment, and there has been an amendment to say a search \nwarrant would be required. The problem with that is that it would \nprobably be found to be in violation of the treaty if a constitutional \nrequirement were imposed to prevent the treaty from operating as it was \nwritten.\n  So if we actually go ahead with a protection from fourth amendment \nsearches and seizures, we may very well be found in violation of the \ntreaty. On the other hand, those responsible for making such a decision \nmay decide that we can have such a constitutional protection in which \ncase I think we can count on all of the other nations that want to \navoid detection doing the same thing and, of course, as a nation that \nlives under the rule of law we will abide by it in a proper way. And I \nthink we can count on countries like Iran or China or Cuba, for \nexample, to use that as an excuse not to allow the kind of inspections \nthat would result in detection.\n  The other part of the Constitution, the fifth amendment, presents a \nspecial problem that nobody has figured out how to fix. The fifth \namendment provides that if there is a taking by the Government of \nproperty one is entitled to be paid. The problem is that when the U.S. \nGovernment imposes this regime on American businesses and individuals, \nit has not yet made the commitment to pay them. My own guess is that I \nwould have a right to sue and the U.S. Government would have to pay but \nthere is no provision for that. You cannot sue under the Federal Tort \nClaim Act, and so we would have to somehow construct an ability to sue\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\nthe U.S. Government and provide for the unlimited liability that would \nresult from such an undertaking. So that has not been dealt with \neither.\n\n  The bottom line is the constitutional issues remain very much up in \nthe air.\n  Now, those are some of the costs. I think, however, the biggest costs \nare the following two. The mere fact that this treaty has been proposed \nhas caused many to decide that we do not have to worry as much about \ndefending our troops. I know the President has made a big matter out of \nsaying that this treaty would help to protect our troops. Well, I think \nhe is very wrong and his own administration officials verify this \nbecause for the last 2 years his representatives have come to the \nCongress and based on the fact that the United States signed this \ntreaty and they presumed we would ratify it, this administration has \ncalled for reductions in spending on defensive measures for our troops.\n  How can a President who tries to sell the treaty on the basis that it \nwill be good for our troops, that it will protect them, come before the \nCongress not once but twice and call for a reduction in funding to \nprovide defenses for our troops? Two years ago, $850 million. \nFortunately, we restored it. What was the reason? The reason expressly \nwas because this treaty is going to enter into force and we will be a \npart of it, as if the treaty were going to make the threat go away.\n  And this year General Shalikashvili let us cut another $1.5 billion \nover 5 years out of this part of the defense budget, this despite the \nfact that the General Accounting Office in a very critical report \nfollowing the Persian Gulf war, updated just last year, has found that \nour defenses are in a very serious state of disrepair; that we are not \nadequately prepared; that we have not provided our soldiers, our \nmarines, our fighting people who are going to be confronting chemical \nor biological warfare the kind of training, the kind of equipment, the \nkind of antidotes, the kind of protection they deserve. So you have GAO \nin a very current finding that we are not doing enough for our troops, \nthe administration trying to cut the funding to do more, and the \nPresident saying that the chemical weapons treaty will solve the \nproblem.\n  That is what I had reference to when I said that treaties can make \nyou feel good, like you have solved a problem, but when it comes to the \nlives of American soldiers, we will not have done enough to protect \nthem. And that is why we should not be lulled into a sense of false \nsecurity by signing a piece of paper that I do not think people would \nloan money on if they wanted to get it back, frankly. So, this treaty \ndoes damage. It is worse than nothing.\n\n  What is another example? You have heard me talk about articles X and \nXI. You are going to hear a lot about that, because articles X and XI \nturn out not to be such a good idea. I am going to discuss that in more \ndetail later. They were put into the treaty at a time when it seemed \nlike a good idea. Now it does not seem like such a good idea. The \nadministration and everybody else acknowledges we have a problem here. \nThe problem is, everybody is embarrassed to go back and change it. The \nadministration says, ``Well, we negotiated the best deal we could.'' We \nsay, ``Because it is flawed, let us go back and take those two sections \nout.'' But the administration does not want to do that. Not taking them \nout is going to result in a proliferation of chemical weapons and \ntechnology, not a restriction of it. Again, I will get into that in \nmore detail later.\n  The point I want to make here is that as long as this treaty has \narticles X and XI in it, it is going to be worse than nothing because \nit is going to result in the proliferation of chemicals rather than a \nrestriction. I will just quote one sentence that a letter that former \nDefense Secretary, Dick Cheney wrote in this regard. He said, ``In my \njudgment, the treaty's article X and XI amount to a formula for greatly \naccelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities around \nthe globe.'' So, in this second significant respect, the treaty makes \nthe situation worse than it was before.\n  Finally, as I made a point to mention before, it is going to \nsignificantly reduce our diplomatic options. Claiming violations will \ntake back seat to more pressing diplomatic considerations. We have seen \nthis in a variety of situations. When the Russians were in violation of \nthe ABM Treaty and had a radar at a place called Krasnoyarsk, we were \nin delicate negotiations with them in a variety of other things and \ntherefore it was ``see no evil,'' basically. ``We are really not all \nthat sure they violated the treaty,'' when in fact our intelligence \ncommunity knew full well they had. And after the Soviet Union broke up, \nits leaders said, ``Sure we were in violation.'' The question is, why \ndidn't we do anything about it? Well, because we did not want to upset \nthe diplomatic applecart.\n  Think about China with MFN. Are we going to upset the diplomatic \napplecart? You see, today we do not have to because there is no treaty. \nOnce a treaty is in place we have an obligation. If we know there are \nviolations--perhaps, for example, with China--we would have an \nobligation to send inspectors over there and ask them to see what they \ncould find. One of two things will happen. Either they are going to \nconfirm there are violations--unlikely, in which case we are then going \nto have to do something about it. More likely, they will come back and \nsay, ``Well, we couldn't prove it.''\n  As a result, China or whoever is doing the violating will have the \nGood Housekeeping stamp of approval. We set up this regime. You try to \nfind people guilty. But the burden is so difficult you are not going to \nfind people guilty. They are going to, in effect, be acquitted. And \nwhen they are acquitted we have then diminished our opportunity to \nnegotiate with them, to tell them to stop selling chemicals, for \nexample, to Iran or other countries we do not want to have them. In \nthat respect, again, the treaty reduces our diplomatic options. It puts \nus into a box. It makes it more difficult to deal with these kinds of \nviolations and in that respect again it is not better than nothing, it \nis worse than doing nothing.\n  What are some of the administration's claims? First of all, they have \nmade the astonishing claim that failure to ratify the treaty would mean \nthat we are aligned with the pariah states of Iraq and Libya because \nIraq and Libya are not going to sign or ratify this treaty. I hope the \nSecretary of State and the President of the United States could \ndiscriminate a little better than that. I could make the same argument \nto them. If we sign the treaty, we are going to be in with a bunch of \nother pariah states. Do they think it is any better to be with Iran or \nCuba? These are states that have signed the treaty and presumably will \nratify it. Obviously, that is not an argument that gets you anywhere. \nBut it is the kind of simplistic, superficial argument that this \nadministration is using to sell the treaty. It is an affront to the \nintelligence of the Senate. As I said, I hope the President and \nSecretary of State can make better distinctions than that.\n  I also note it is a bit meaningless at this point to join the treaty, \nthough 67 other nations have joined it, because they do not have \nchemical weapons. The countries that have chemical weapons have not \njoined it, and many of them are not going to. About 99 percent of the \nworld's chemical weapons, according to open source material, are held \nby three countries, none of whom have joined the treaty: The United \nStates, Russia, and China. We have a bilateral destruction agreement \nwith Russia, in which we are trying to get them to destroy their \nchemical weapons--and they decided they are not going to follow through \nwith that, apparently. So, what makes us think that we are going to do \nany good by joining the treaty, when about 80 percent-plus of the \nchemicals in China and Russia would be outside the purview of the \ntreaty?\n\n  The next comment made is, ``No treaty is 100 percent verifiable.'' I \nthink I dealt with that before. Nobody is claiming it needs to be 100-\npercent verifiable, but when we say this treaty is not adequately \nverifiable or effectively verifiable, their comeback is, ``Well, no \ntreaty is 100 percent.'' That is not the issue. The issue is whether it \nis effectively verifiable, and unfortunately no one claims that this \ntreaty is effectively verifiable.\n  No one, for example, has said that they have high confidence that \nthis treaty will timely detect significant violations. As a matter of \nfact, one of\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\nthe strong supporters of the treaty, a friend and someone who has \nserved this country well, and we have a difference of opinion about the \ntreaty, Ron Adelman, said in an op-ed piece he wrote on February 20, \n``Granted, the treaty is virtually unverifiable and granted it doesn't \nseem right for the Senate to ratify an unverifiable treaty. . .'' he \nwent on to say: ``however, I think we are still better off by going \nahead.''\n  My point is that even treaty proponents acknowledge it is not \nverifiable, so let us not get into a debate as to whether it has to be \n100-percent verifiable or not. It is not effectively verifiable. That \nis the point.\n  I discussed a bit ago the argument that the CWC will protect American \ntroops and prevent a terrorist attack. No one who has spoken to this \nfrom an intelligence point of view can credibly make the claim that \nthis treaty will, in any way, shape or form, reduce the threat of \nterrorism. Let me repeat that. Our intelligence community is unwilling \nto say that this treaty would stop terrorist attacks. And even one of \nthe much vaunted agreements that was entered into between our friends \non the other side of the aisle and Senator Helms recognizes the fact \nthat the CWC is not effective to deal with the problem of terrorism. \nLet me quote one of the recently unclassified assessments of our \nintelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency:\n\n       In the case of Aum Shinrikyo [this is the cult in Japan \n     that gassed Japanese citizens] the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention would not have hindered the cult from procuring \n     the needed chemical compounds needed in the production of \n     sarin. Further, the Aum would have escaped the requirement \n     for an end-use certification because it purchased the \n     chemicals within Japan.\n\n  The point is, here, that chemicals are so easily secreted, chemical \nweapons are so easily made in small, confined spaces, that it is \nessentially impossible to find all of them. And a terrorist group, in a \nroom the size of a large closet, in Japan, was able to make the sarin \ngas that they used. This Chemical Weapons Convention has no capability \nto deal with that. I will say it this way: It is a fraud on the \nAmerican people to suggest that we have to adopt this treaty in order \nto do away with terrorist use of chemical weapons. It will not be \neffective for that purpose. It may have some other beneficial effects, \nbut no one should contend that it is going to help with regard to \nterrorism.\n  The same thing, as I said, is true with regard to the defense of our \ntroops. If this administration were actually pursuing a strong \ndefensive capability for our troops, that would be one thing, but it is \nnot. As a result, I think it is not an appropriate argument for this \nadministration to base the ratification of the treaty on.\n  Another argument of the administration is that this is important to \nprotect the jobs in the chemical industry and that there would be some \nlosses to our chemical companies if the treaty were not adopted by the \nUnited States. First, I would say that this is no reason for the United \nStates to enter into a treaty, simply to enhance the financial balance \nsheets of American companies. We are all for doing that, we are all for \nhelping American businesses do well, but one does not enter into a \ntreaty for that purpose. I think there should be a question about \nwhether our chemical companies ought to be selling these kinds of \nchemicals to countries like Iran and Cuba and China in any event, \nbecause that is the new market that will open up. These are countries \nthat have signed the treaty, not yet ratified. Presumably they will \nratify it at some point so there will be an added market for us to sell \nour chemicals.\n  The other added market is that if the Australia Group restrictions \ncome off, then our companies would not be restricted by the Australia \nGroup limitations. In both cases they would be able to sell more \nchemicals. I would argue that that is not necessarily a good thing, \neven though it might enhance their balance sheets.\n  And to the argument that somehow there will be a downside to them, \nthat they will actually lose money, it is an argument that does not \npersuade me. Because folks should know that the only limitation that \ncan be imposed on companies in countries that do not sign the treaty is \nwith respect to so-called schedule 1 and schedule 2 chemicals. These \nare the chemicals of chemical warfare, of chemical weapons and their \nprecursors, by definition, made in noncommercial quantities. So the \nonly limitation that could ever be imposed upon American companies, if \nit ever were, would be on such a small amount of chemicals that, even \nby their own definition it would constitute only a fraction of 1 \npercent of the chemicals that are traded. We should pass the treaty for \nthat? I do not think so.\n\n  Another argument is that at least we will get more intelligence if we \nare a party to the treaty. This is the argument that says granted it \nmay not solve all the problems but it is better to be inside than \noutside. I think this particular argument deserves a little bit of \nattention.\n  I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I know how this works. \nI think I should explain a little bit about it. The claim is not true. \nOur intelligence agencies, of course, always are looking for new \nopportunities to get information, but it is not correct to say that the \nchemical weapons treaty provides us that mechanism. The chemical \nweapons treaty says that if you want to inspect another country for a \nsuspected violation, you bring the matter to the council in charge of \nthe treaty, and if it decides to go forward, it will appoint three \ninspectors--but it cannot be somebody from your country. So, it would \nbe somebody from three other countries that go do the inspection. They \ncome back and they deposit their findings with this body, this \nexecutive council. And by the treaty terms they cannot share that \ninformation with anybody else. It is secret. So the United States, not \nbeing a party to the inspection, does not have the information, and \ncannot have it, under the terms of the treaty. So there is only one way \nthat we would gain more information under the terms of the treaty and \nthat is by cheating, by violating the treaty, by somehow trying to \nsteal the information, by somehow trying to turn one of those \ninspectors to be an agent for us in violation of the treaty terms. That \nis how we would get more information--not legally, under the treaty.\n  What would we do if we found somebody cheating? Let us assume that we \nfind that Russia or China has chemical weapons, is not destroying \nthem--in other words, does possess in violation of this treaty. Would \nwe insist on sanctions? How about today? Take the case of China. Would \nwe insist on sanctions? We shake in our boots when the President of \nTaiwan comes over, attends his 25th class reunion at Cornell, and the \nChinese Government threatens to lob missiles into Los Angeles and \nsteams in the Straits of Taiwan and sends missiles over Taiwan. Are we \ngoing to impose sanctions on China because of a finding that they have \nmaintained a chemical weapons stock? Are we going to have to prove to \nthis international body, this executive council, that they are in \nviolation? And at what cost to our relations?\n  The problem is, with the treaty you can no longer ignore violations. \nYou either object or it ends up in a whitewash. Either way it creates \nsignificant problems.\n  There is a final argument that has been made recently and it \nmystifies me because it doesn't go anywhere but they have been making \nit, so I will try to respond. Proponents say we are getting rid of our \nweapons, and therefore the chemical weapon convention will force others \nto do so, too. It is absolutely true the United States is getting rid \nof our weapons. We are committed to doing that. We do not need the \nChemical Weapons Convention to prove to the world that we are the moral \nleader of the world. We have said we are getting rid of ours. Nobody \nelse has, but we have.\n  So you don't need the Chemical Weapons Convention. I challenge my \nfriends who propose the treaty, in what way will the chemical weapons \ntreaty make the other countries get rid of theirs? That is the purpose, \nthat is the goal, but there is no effective mechanism to make it \nhappen, and there is no intelligence estimate or assessment to that \neffect, Mr. President.\n  We are going to have an opportunity tomorrow to go into classified \nsession and hear just what our intelligence community has to say about \nthe chemical weapons programs of other nations and about what we think \nthey are going to be doing in the future, and I urge my colleagues to \nattend that session.\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Finally, Madam President, there has been much made of the \nfact that in the negotiations over this treaty, numerous improvements \nwere made and, therefore, we should remove our objections and go along \nwith the treaty.\n  First of all, I want to set the stage. Last fall when the treaty came \nbefore the Senate, the statement was that we couldn't touch it, that we \ncouldn't negotiate anything, we had to use the resolution that came out \nof the committee and there were no changes that were possible; ``You \ncan't change the treaty; we're not interested in negotiating any \nterms.''\n  It turned out there was not sufficient support for the treaty and, \ntherefore, the administration had it pulled. Interestingly enough, last \nnight I saw a news program, the Jim Lehrer News Hour, in which it was \nmisstated that Senator Dole, the previous majority leader, asked the \ntreaty to be withdrawn. He did not ask the treaty to be withdrawn. He \nwas not even in the Senate at the time. He wrote a letter in opposition \nto the treaty, but he did not ask it be withdrawn. He just said he \nwouldn't vote for it if it were still in the Senate. It was withdrawn \nby the administration, by the Clinton administration, not by anyone \nhere in the Senate.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that the administration took the position \nthat nothing could change, once the treaty was found not to have \nadequate support, the administration began to change its tune, and \nlittle by little, they began to sit down and talk to those who had \nobjections. Over many months, various concessions were made which \nmarginally improved the situation. Now, they are not concessions with \nrespect to the treaty itself because it can't be changed, but there are \nsome things which at least help to clarify how the United States is \ngoing to proceed, and had it not been for the considerable efforts of \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, these changes would \nnot have been made. So while they were critical of the chairman for his \nopposition to the treaty, it turns out that now they are bragging about \nthe changes that he sought to have made, and I think that is a very \nimportant point, Madam President. Let me just repeat it. While \ninitially deriding the concerns of the chairman of the committee, they \nare now bragging about the changes that he forced them to make, \nclaiming that this makes it a better treaty, now we should all support \nit. It does make it a better treaty, but at the margins, not at the \ncore.\n  What has been negotiated? First of all, there are nine specific \nconditions that merely restate existing constitutional protections. \nThose could not have been taken away in any event, but it was helpful \nto get the administration to acknowledge that they existed. They were \neven reluctant to acknowledge some of these constitutional protections. \nWe could do without them, because they are in the Constitution anyway, \nbut at least it was handy to get the administration to acknowledge that \nthey existed.\n  Second, there are two conditions that merely allow the Congress to \nenact appropriations or approve reprogramming. As every Senator knows, \nwe have that right. We are the body, along with the House, that enacts \nappropriations or approves reprogramming. So that was essentially \nmeaningless, though handy to have the administration acknowledge.\n  There are four conditions that call for reports. Whenever you see a \ncall for a report, Madam President, you know that that means we tried \nto reach agreement on something, we couldn't, so we said, ``By golly, \nwe'll have a study on it, we'll have a report.'' And that is what this \ncalls for. There are seven conditions that call for Presidential \ncertifications, all of which he can make today. These were not \nconcessions by the administration. They were able to agree to these \nbecause these are certifications they can currently make. So one should \nnot brag about those.\n  Four additional conditions are a restatement of current U.S. policy. \nAgain, we thought these were good to have on paper in connection with \nthe treaty so there would be no mistake about what U.S. policy was. It \nisn't new, it isn't new policy, it isn't a compromise, it isn't a \nnegotiated settlement; this is just a restatement in the resolution of \nratification about existing U.S. policy. One of the conditions doesn't \ntake effect until 1998.\n  I conclude, then, with the two that have some meaning. One deals with \nsearch and seizures under the fourth amendment, and I discussed that \nbriefly a moment ago. The other deals with the subject of riot control \nagents. We do not know what the courts will do with either of these \ntwo.\n\n  I spoke to the issue of the fourth amendment. The resolution includes \na statement that we will require search warrants, either administrative \nwarrants or criminal warrants in the appropriate case. That may or may \nnot be effective under the treaty. It may be declared in violation of \nthe treaty. If not, other countries are going to be able to do the same \nthing. While the United States will assiduously adhere to the law and \nto the Constitution, my guess is if other States are able to do the \nsame thing, we will suddenly find interesting provisions in the Iranian \nConstitution or Chinese Constitution that are going to constitute \nloopholes big enough to drive a truck through.\n  The other matter is important, but in the overall scheme of things, I \nthink perhaps more has been made of it than was generally warranted, \nand it is still not certain that it is resolved, but at least the \nallegation is that it is. This has to do with riot control agents, tear \ngas to most people. This was one of the areas in which the Bush and \nReagan administrations had been very clear, and the Clinton \nadministration changed policy, another example of a situation where \nthis is not the same treaty that the Bush and Reagan administrations \nhad in mind. They always thought you could use tear gas in certain \nsituations; for example, to rescue a downed pilot, to deal with a \nsituation where you had civilians surrounding an American hostage, for \nexample. Rather than having to shoot those people, we say it makes \nsense to use tear gas to disperse the crowd and rescue the American. \nThis administration said, no, we don't interpret the treaty as allowing \nthat. Even people who support the treaty, like Gen. Brent Scowcroft, \nsaid, that's crazy, that has to be changed. It took a long time to get \nthe administration to finally agree in concept to a change. I am still \nnot persuaded the language does it, but let's assume in good faith they \nhave really agreed to a change in this policy. What that will mean is \nthat, at least in that limited kind of situation, we will be able to \nuse tear gas. That is a positive development, but in light of the final \npoints that I want to make here, it is not reason to change from \nsupporting a treaty that is not global, not verifiable, not effective, \ndoes more harm than good. That change is helpful but not dispositive.\n  What are the five unresolved issues? The way this treaty comes before \nthe Senate, it is the Helms resolution of ratification. In other words, \nit is a resolution wrapped around the treaty. It has 28 agreed-upon \nitems, and then, in addition, there are 5 that are not agreed upon. \nThose are the items that constitute the Helms resolution of \nratification. To approve the treaty, we will vote on the resolution of \nratification. The proponents of the treaty have the right under the \nrule here to seriatim move to strike each of these five remaining \nconditions. If they are all stricken, then we will end up voting for \nthe Helms resolution of ratification sans these five protections. If \nfour of them are stricken, we will have one, and so forth.\n  What are these five unresolved issues? These are the core of the \ndispute. This is really what it is all about. And this is what I will \nspend the rest of my time on.\n  The first issue says the country that has the most chemical weapons \nin the world, Russia, is not a party to the treaty. It has not complied \nwith various agreements that we have concerning destruction of its \nchemical weapons stocks and its biological weapons, incidentally, and \nit has not agreed to abide by a memorandum of understanding with this \ncountry under which it would list its stocks of chemicals. These were \nkey agreements that were part of the basis for the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations' sponsorship of this treaty. Russia had agreed to these \nthings. One is called the bilateral destruction agreement. The other is \ncalled the Wyoming memorandum of understanding.\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\n The Reagan and Bush administrations believed that if the Russians \ncomplied with these provisions, that the chemical weapons treaty might \nbe a good thing. But they are not complying with them. Again, we will \nhear some details in the session tomorrow. But the fact of the matter \nis, we ought to require that Russia at least demonstrates some good \nfaith to proceed down the path toward declaring what they have and \ngetting rid of those things. If there is no indication by the Russians \nthat they intend to do this, then it seems a little odd to be entering \ninto a treaty where 60 percent of the world's chemical weapons are not \neven being dealt with and we are basically conceding to the Russians \nthat they don't have to agree with these other agreements with us. What \nwe are saying is, to try to apply a little leverage to our friends in \nRussia, look, we know it is expensive to dismantle this, but that \ncannot be the only problem you have when you will not even declare all \nof the chemical weapons you have, when you won't even begin the process \nof dismantling them, when you have signaled that you are no longer \ngoing to be complying with the bilateral destruction agreement, you \nconsider it now inoperative, no longer useful. We want some signs from \nyou that you are serious about dealing with chemical weapons before we \nenter into the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  And there is a final reason for this, Madam President. One of the \nleaders of Russia has written to one of the top leaders of the United \nStates and made it clear that if Russia is to join the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, it wants to do so at the same time the United States does. \nAs a result, it would be highly unfortunate if the United States went \nahead and ratified this treaty before the Russian Duma did. The Russian \nDuma is clearly not ready to do so. This first condition, therefore, in \nthe Helms resolution of ratification says, ``Hold on, we will ratify \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, but we will not deposit our instrument \nof ratification at The Hague until Russia has done the same, thus \nenabling us to come in at the same time.'' That is all that condition \nsays.\n  It would require certification by the President that Russia is making \nprogress, that it intends to comply, it is making progress toward \ncomplying. They don't have to demonstrate that they have complied. We \nthink that is a reasonable condition. I guess I will state it the other \nway around as to this first condition, should we be supporting a treaty \nthat we know is being breached by the country that has the largest \nnumber of chemical weapons in the world and is going to continue to be \nbreached by that country, or should we insist on a condition that they \nare making progress toward complying before we buy into it?\n  The second condition has to do with other states, the so-called rogue \nstates. I will spend only a moment on this because I know my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, wants to speak at greater length about \nthis. We know that there are a variety of rogue states that have no \nintention of signing on to this treaty and others that may want to sign \non but know they can violate it with impunity. These chemical weapons \nin these countries' hands constitute a real threat to American troops. \nWe think that if one is going to make the claim that this Chemical \nWeapons Convention is going to reduce the chemical weapons stocks of \nthese rogue nations that pose a threat to the United States, the least \nthat ought to happen is that they submit themselves to the treaty. \nCan't do any good if they are not members. We need to certify that some \nof these nations are going to be states parties before we subject \nourselves to it.\n  The third condition is one that I can't imagine anybody is going to \nobject to, and that is that certain inspectors would be barred from \ninspecting American sites. We have the right to do this under the \ntreaty. The President has the right to say, I don't want any inspectors \nfrom China, I don't want any inspectors from Iran coming in here \nbecause we think they are going to--and I use these as hypotheticals--\nthe President says, we think they may be bent on industrial espionage \nand therefore we are going to ask that they not be inspectors. The \nargument against that is, well, tit for tat. They will say, fine, we \ndon't want any Americans on the inspection team that comes into our \ncountry. We are willing to say, fine. We think for certain countries, \nlike China and Iran, we should put right up front they are not going to \nbe inspectors of United States facilities. And that would be a third \ncondition to ratification.\n\n  A fourth condition to--actually No. 5 on the list has to do with the \nstandard for verification. This has to do with the question of whether \nor not we have an adequate sense that we can actually find cheating \nunder the treaty. And we are not asking for an impossible standard. We \nare not asking for 100-percent verification.\n  We are simply asking that the President certify to the Congress \nbefore we submit the articles of ratification that the CIA has \ncertified to the President to a level of verification that will work. \nAnd what we have basically done is take the definition of previous \nadministrations, the so-called Baker-Nitze definition, along with a \nspecific aspect that General Shalikashvili identified as a way of \nidentifying our standard here for verification under the treaty.\n  It would be effectively verifiable. We could find violations with a \nhigh degree of confidence in a timely fashion, within a year of their \noccurrence. And they would be militarily significant.\n  Now, militarily significant was defined in a hearing before the U.S. \nCongress by General Shalikashvili as 1 ton of chemical weapons. And, \ntherefore, that is what we have built into this definition.\n  So what we have said, Madam President, is that we would join the \ntreaty at such time as we had the certification from the President that \nthe CIA certified that we could achieve this level of verification. I \ndo not think that is asking too much.\n  Finally, the final condition has to do with articles X and XI. This \nis what I had spoken to before.\n  I would ask my distinguished chairman if I could go on for just a few \nminutes here.\n  Mr. HELMS. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. KYL. I will conclude on articles X and XI because we are going to \nhear a lot more about them. I think it is important to read into the \nRecord the provisions we are talking about and discuss in a little bit \nof detail specifically what our concerns are.\n  Here is what article X says. I might preface this comment, Madam \nPresident, with the statement that these were inducements put into the \ntreaty originally to induce countries to join the treaty. They were put \nthere based upon inducements that were included in a previous treaty, \nthe nuclear nonproliferation treaty, under the so-called atoms for \npeace plan.\n  Many people know or will remember that the atoms for peace plan was \nthe idea that if countries would eschew the development of nuclear \nweapons, we would provide them peaceful nuclear technology. And \ncountries like Iraq, and other countries that could be mentioned, took \nadvantage of that program, and said, ``Fine. We won't develop nuclear \nweapons. Now send us the peaceful nuclear technology.'' We eventually \nlearned that what they did with that peaceful technology was to use it \nin their nuclear weapons program.\n  So after it was put in the treaty, and we got these people signed up, \nwe learned that several countries were using this provision of the \ntreaty to actually enhance their nuclear weapons capability. It worked \nto the detriment of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  Well, before that was ever learned this chemical weapons treaty was \nnegotiated. So at the time it seemed like a good idea to put the same \nkind of provision in the chemical weapons treaty. At the time it seemed \nlike it would be a smart thing to provide an inducement for countries \nto join the treaty, saying:\n\n       If you'll join up, then we will not have any restrictions \n     on trade in chemicals with you. You can buy all the chemicals \n     you want. And, in addition to that, you can ask us for, and \n     we will provide to you, all of the defensive gear, chemicals, \n     antidotes, equipment, and so on, that will enable you to \n     defend against chemical weapons.\n\n  That is a pretty good incentive for a country to join up. Look at it \nfrom the standpoint of a country that has in mind conducting chemical \nwarfare capability. The first thing they want to do is be able to \nprotect their own\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\ntroops from the use of the weapons. So they want our latest technology \nin defensive gear, in defensive equipment, in antidotes and the like. \nSo it is a pretty good incentive to sign up for the treaty because they \nhave a right to ask us, and the treaty says we will undertake to \nprovide to them that material. Moreover they want to buy chemicals.\n  Right now the Australia group I talked about before has limitations \non what chemicals can be sold. As a matter of fact, there are 54 \nspecific chemicals under the Australia group that cannot be sold to the \ncountries we believe want to develop the chemical weapons capability. \nThese countries then have an incentive for joining the convention \nbecause under the convention you cannot limit the trade in chemicals.\n  What does the treaty say? Article X:\n\n       Each State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have \n     the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of \n     equipment, material and scientific and technological \n     information concerning means of protection against chemical \n     weapons.\n  It could not be more clear, Madam President. Article X says that the \nparties to the treaty have the right to participate in and each party \nundertakes to facilitate. In other words, we have an obligation to \nfacilitate their acquisition of this defensive equipment.\n  Article XI carries this further and adds another element. And I read \nin part:\n\n       The . . . States Parties . . . .shall . . . undertake to \n     facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest \n     . . . exchange of chemicals, equipment and scientific and \n     technical information relating to the development and \n     application of chemistry for purposes not prohibited under \n     this Convention . . . for peaceful purposes . . .\n\n  In other words. The ``atoms for peace'' equivalent in the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  So here is a big incentive for countries who want to develop a \ndefense against chemical weapons to join the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  The second part of article XI, section (c) says that:\n\n       [The] States Parties. . . shall. . .[n]ot maintain among \n     themselves any restrictions, including those in any \n     international agreements . . .\n       shall. . . [n]ot maintain among themselves any \n     restrictions, including those in any international \n     agreements, incompatible with the obligations undertaken \n     under this Convention, which would restrict or impede trade \n     and the development and promotion of [again] scientific and \n     technological knowledge in the field of chemistry for \n     industrial, agriculture, research, medical, pharmaceutical or \n     other peaceful purposes.\n       shall . . . [n]ot maintain among themselves any \n     restrictions, [either unilateral or international \n     restrictions.]\n\n  So what this says is that States Parties will have the right to say, \nonce they become parties, ``You can't have an embargo on selling \nchemicals to us. You have to lift your restrictions.''\n  For a country like Iran, for example, which has signed the treaty, \nthis would be a pretty good deal because currently none of the \nAustralia Group countries will sell it these chemicals.\n  What is going to happen? Well, today, China may be selling chemicals \nto Iran or maybe another country is selling chemicals to Iran not \ncovered by the treaty. Once the treaty goes into effect, those \ncountries could continue to sell chemicals to Iran. But what is going \nto happen is that the other countries, countries that sign onto the \nconvention are going to say, ``Wait a minute. China, for example, is \nselling chemicals to Iran. Our chemical companies want in on the \naction. It says right here in the treaty we're not supposed to maintain \nany restrictions. So we are out of here. We are going to allow our \ncountries to sell chemicals to a country like Iran.'' We will have a \nvery poor argument against that.\n  What has been the administration's response to this? Belatedly the \nadministration seems to find there is a little problem here. But \noriginally it did not think so. As a matter of fact--and I think this \nis a critical point of this debate, Madam President,--right after the \nchemical weapons treaty was signed into force, the Australia Group \nmembers were all asked to begin the process of lifting their \nrestrictions pursuant to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the plain \nwording of articles X and XI.\n  Let me read to you, according to the administration--this is in \ntestimony before the Congress:\n\n       Australia Group members in August 1992 committed to review \n     their export control measures with a view of removing them \n     for CWC States Parties in full compliance with their own \n     obligations under the convention.\n\n  In other words, after the CWC was signed, the Australia Group \ncountries began to review their export control measures which currently \nprohibit them from selling chemicals to certain countries, so that they \ncould bring themselves into compliance with their obligations under \narticles X and XI of the convention.\n  And the Australia Group itself issued a formal statement--and I am \nquoting now--\n\n       Undertaking to review, in light of the implementation of \n     the Convention, the measures that they take to prevent the \n     spread of chemical substances and equipment for purposes \n     contrary to the objectives of the convention with the aim of \n     removing such measures for the benefit of States Parties to \n     the Convention acting in full compliance with the obligations \n     under the Convention.\n\n  In other words, again, if you have limitations on the sale of \nchemicals to countries, you are going to have to lift them or you will \nbe in violation of articles X and XI of the convention.\n  What has the administration's response to this been?\n  At first it was denial. Then, one comment made to me was, ``Well, we \ntried our best to negotiate our way out of this, but the best we could \ndo is get language like `undertake to facilitate' rather than \n`obligated to.' We just couldn't negotiate anything better.''\n\n  So this was a bone to those countries, an incentive for them to come \nin. And to our argument, this makes the situation worse, not better, \nand will actually proliferate these weapons, the same as Secretary \nCheney just said in the quotation I just read, that articles X and XI \nwill result in the proliferation of chemical weapons because there \ncannot be any restrictions.\n  The administration then began to take a different tack. First they \nsaid, well, we will decide not to lift our restrictions, so the United \nStates will still not sell to countries that we think might develop \nchemical weapons. And we will get you a letter to that effect. I have \nnot seen anything in writing, but that is the administration's latest \nstatement.\n  We said, that does not do any good because it only takes one country \nto break an embargo. Any one of the countries could do it. And the \nhorse would be out of the barn. So they said, well, we will try to get \nthe other Australia Group states to agree to the same thing.\n  Bear in mind what they are saying. First, they were all going to lift \nthese restrictions to be in compliance with the treaty. Now we are \ngoing to try to convince them they should keep them in place in clear \nviolation to the treaty. This is the way to make a moral statement, \nMadam President, by violating the treaty right up front and announcing \nto the world we are violating the treaty, by keeping in place \nrestrictions that are required to be lifted under articles X and XI?\n  It is not a very propitious way to make a moral statement or to begin \nthe operation of an international treaty to announce in effect not only \nare you going to violate it but you are going to try to get all your \nfriends in the Australia Group to violate it because not to do so would \nbe to lift the restrictions we currently believe are helpful in \npreventing the spread of chemical weapons.\n  Even if all these countries do decide to ignore articles X and XI, \ncountries that are not States Parties can continue to sell these \nchemicals. I said, it will not be long until everyone else will want in \nthe action. The same argument that has been made by some of our \nchemical companies, in the event if somebody is selling we should have \nthe right to sell too otherwise we are just losing good business.\n  So I will conclude, Madam President, by trying to make this rather \nsimple, but I think important point. To those who say, granted, it is \nnot going to be a very effective treaty, but at least it does no harm, \nI say, you are wrong. It is going to do a lot of harm--to business, to \nthe taxpayers, to our ability to conduct diplomacy and, importantly, to \nour ability to constrain the spread of chemical weapons.\n  As Secretary Cheney said, unless articles X and XI are removed from \nthis treaty, it is going to make matters worse, not better.\n  So the fourth condition that is a part of the Helms resolution of \nratification\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nsays that we will ratify the treaty, but before we deposit the articles \nof ratification there has to be a certification by the President that \nthose two sections have been removed from the treaty. Yes, of course, \nthat will require a renegotiation. The States Parties will have to \nagree to take those provisions out. That should not be a problem if the \nadministration's most current assurances are to be believed.\n  I suspect, however, there are specific States Parties who do not \nagree with those assurances who fully intend to continue these sales. \nAs a matter of fact, if you will read the language of the Chinese \nratification, it explicitly preserves their understanding of articles X \nand XI which is the obvious understanding of anyone reading them, that \nit would be improper to have trade restrictions or to deny the \ndefensive equipment in the case of other States Parties.\n  So, Madam President, we are stuck with articles X and XI. And it is \nthe belief of many of us that perhaps we could support this treaty if \nthose articles were removed. But until they are removed, it makes \nmatters worse and therefore we cannot in good conscience support the \ntreaty in that form.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for yielding me \nthis time.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, allow me to thank the able Senator from \nArizona. He is a walking encyclopedia on the details of this \ntreaty, and he has been enormously helpful to me and to many other \nSenators in understanding the implications of a great many provisions \nof the treaty. I thank him now publicly for all he has done to be \nhelpful. I am deeply grateful.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I return that thanks. I see the \ndistinguished ranking member of the committee. I compliment both of \nthem for their work to achieve what I have described as ``limited \nsuccess'' in the provisions agreed to, but nonetheless important. I \nappreciate the negotiations that they conducted and the spirit in which \nthis debate has been conducted as well.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Record \nreflect that had there been a recorded vote on the previous two voice \nvotes, that Senators Ashcroft and Grams would have voted ``aye'' on \nboth votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I hope the distinguished ranking member \nwill agree that the other Senator from Arizona should follow. I will \nleave it for him to limit his time or not. Let me do one or two other \nthings and I will let the Senator take care of that. I noticed that two \nor three times in the past week--and I am used to the media criticism; \nas a matter of fact, I enjoy it. I have a lot of cartoons on my office \nwall to prove that I do enjoy it. But I noticed that two or three \npeople said, ``Helms doesn't do anything in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee except hold up treaties.''\n  Well, let's look at the record. In the past 2 years--that is to say \nthe 104th Congress--the Foreign Relations Committee has considered 39 \ntreaties, and the Senate approved 38 of them--the one exception being \nthis chemical weapons treaty, which the administration pulled down just \nbefore it was to become the pending business in the Senate.\n  I will read the list that I am going to put into the Record: \nConsideration of the CWC, in the context of the work of the committee \nin carrying out its responsibility to us and consent to ratification as \nset forth in article II, section 2, of the Constitution. Treaties \nconsidered during the 104th Congress included bilateral tax and \ninvestment treaties, important to protecting and furthering U.S. \nbusiness interests abroad; 14 treaties strengthening U.S. law \nenforcement through extradition of criminals and access to criminal \nevidence in other countries. One notable example of the impact of these \ntreaties was the ratification of the United States extradition treaty \nwith Jordan, which enabled the United States to take into custody a \nsuspect in the World Trade Center bombing. Extensive hearings were held \nby the committee to consider the START II Treaty and the Convention on \nChemical Weapons. The Foreign Relations Committee also considered, and \nthe Senate ratified, three multilateral treaties dealing with landmines \nand the rubber industry and international fisheries laws.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Treaties Ratified by the Senate During the 104th Congress\n\n\n                         Arms Control Treaties\n\n       Convention on Conventional Weapons.\n       Start II.\n       [Convention on Chemical Weapons (approved by Committee/no \n     vote by Senate)].\n\n\n                              Commodities\n\n       1995 International Natural Rubber Agreement.\n\n\n                               Fisheries\n\n       U.N. Convention Relating to the Conservation and Management \n     of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\n\n\n                     bilateral extradition treaties\n\n       Belgium.\n       Supplementary with Belgium.\n       Bolivia.\n       Hungary.\n       Jordan.\n       Malaysia.\n       The Philippines.\n       Switzerland.\n\n\n                     Bilateral investment treaties\n\n       Albania.\n       Belarus.\n       Estonia.\n       Georgia.\n       Jamaica.\n       Latvia.\n       Mongolia.\n       Trinidad Tobago.\n       Ukraine.\n\n\n               Bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties\n\n       Austria.\n       Hungary.\n       Korea.\n       Panama.\n       The Philippines.\n       United Kingdom.\n\n\n                         Bilateral Tax Treaties\n\n       Canada.\n       France.\n       Indonesia.\n       Kazakstan.\n       Kazakstan Exchange of Notes.\n       Mexico.\n       Netherlands-Antilles.\n       Portugal.\n       Sweden.\n       Ukraine.\n       Ukraine Exchange of Notes.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. In addition to my recommendation to the distinguished \nranking member, I hope Senator McCain, although he does not share my \nview on the treaty, will be recognized, because he is a patriot of the \nfirst order, as far as I am concerned. If anybody ever paid his dues to \nthis country, the Senator from Arizona did. Following him, I should \nlike for Senator Hutchinson to represent our side in the pecking order. \nHow much time will the Senator need?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator can use a little longer if he wishes. Let me \nask about the time consumed thus far, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 3 hours 10 \nminutes remaining. The Senator from Delaware has 3 hours 21 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HELMS. Three hours even for me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And 10 minutes. And 3 hours 21 minutes for the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mr. HELMS. We are running pretty near. The distinguished Senator from \nDelaware made his usual eloquent speech this morning. How long did I \nspeak, by the way?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator spoke for 4 minutes, plus 26 \nminutes earlier today.\n  Mr. HELMS. Four months? No, I understand. With the understanding that \nthe Senator from Arkansas will follow the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, I yield the floor to my distinguished friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That ``four month'' comment reminds me of a joke about the \ntwo guys who were cheering at the bar, clapping their hands. A guy \nwalks into the bar and says, ``What are they so happy about?'' Another \nguy says, ``Oh, they just put together a jigsaw puzzle, and they did it \nin 3 hours.'' The guy walks up to them and says, ``Congratulations, but \nwhy is that so special?'' They showed him the box, which said ``2 to 4 \nyears.'' At any rate, it will take a while for that to sink in. A \nlittle bit of levity in the chemical weapons treaty is worth the \neffort.\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\n  The junior Senator from Arizona complimented me on the limited \nsuccess that we have achieved here. I thank him for that. Now I am \ngoing to yield to a man of unlimited capacity to prove to everyone that \nthere is no limit to the success we are about to achieve in this \ntreaty.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, my good \nfriend, John McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nDelaware and the Senator from North Carolina. The distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina deserves great credit, in my view, because he, as \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, allowed this treaty to \ncome to the floor. The distinguished chairman could have bottled up \nthis treaty under his authority as chairman of the committee. He \ndeserves great praise.\n  I also point out that, as various groups have gotten into this \ndebate, there have been a lot of allegations, a lot of impugning of \ncharacter and patriotism and views about whether people are tough \nenough or not tough enough or what is too soft. This is a debate \namongst honorable people who have honorable differences of opinion, as \nI do with the junior Senator from Arizona, my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kyl. I would like to see, especially in the columns \nof various periodicals interested in this view, the debate elevated a \nbit as to the virtues or vices, as the observers of this treaty might \nview them, as opposed to speculations about the motives of those who \neither support or oppose this treaty. I think the American people would \nbe far better off.\n  Madam President, the importance of this issue has been pointed out. \nWe will have political and economic consequences for the United States \nfor many years to come. The most important question is whether this \nagreement is good for U.S. national security.\n  In my view, one central fact dominates consideration of this issue. \nRegardless of whether the United States ratifies this treaty, the \nUnited States will, in the next decade or so, complete the destruction \nof its own aging chemical weapons stockpile. Our reasons for doing so \nhave nothing to do with arms control. The decision was made before the \nCWC became a near-term possibility. I am not aware of any interest of \nCongress or the U.S. military in getting the United States back in the \nchemical weapons business. So when we consider the wisdom of ratifying \nthis treaty, we should bear in mind that this is, first and foremost, a \ntreaty about limiting other countries' chemical weapons, not our own, \nbecause we are doing away with ours. In practical terms, the \nalternative to ratification of the CWC is U.S. unilateral disarmament \nin the field of chemical weapons.\n  The critics point out that a number of countries, such as Iraq, \nLibya, Syria, and North Korea, will not ratify the CWC and will \ntherefore not be bound by its limits. True. But will our efforts to \nkeep weapons of mass destruction out of their hands be enhanced if we \ndon't ratify this treaty? No, they will not. In fact, I am confident \nthat these rogue states are desperately hoping the Senate will reject \nratification because, if we do, we will not only spare them the \nmandatory trade sanctions that the CWC imposes on nonparties, we will \nalso undermine a near global consensus that all chemical weapons, \nincluding those of nonparties, should be banned.\n\n  Madam President, for 10 years I have had the privilege of working \nwith the former Senate majority leader, Bob Dole. Probably the closest \nworking relationship I had with him was on issues of national security. \nIn fact, I was privileged to serve as one of his advisers in the last \ncampaign in his efforts for the Presidency of the United States. Madam \nPresident, I know of no one more credible on these issues, and I know \nof no one, going back to World War II, who understands service and \nsacrifice and our national security interests more than Senator Bob \nDole, a man whose friendship I cherish and whose companionship I enjoy \nbut, more important than that, a person whose views I hold in the \nhighest esteem and regard. There are many other experts on national \nsecurity issues in this town, but I know of no one who has had the \nexperience and hands-on involvement with these issues, that is, the \ntough decisions, than Senator Dole. We all know that Senator Dole \nissued a letter today that I think is of great importance.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dole's \nstatement and the letter from President Clinton to Senator Dole be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Statement of Bob Dole on the Chemical Weapons Convention\n\n       Washington.--Bob Dole today issued the following statement \n     regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention:\n       ``Last September, the Senate Majority Leader, Trent Lott, \n     asked me to express my opinion on the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. In my response, I raised concerns about the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention and expressed hope that the \n     President and the Senate would work together to ensure that \n     the treaty is effectively verifiable and genuinely global. \n     They have, and as a result, 28 conditions to the Senate's \n     Resolution of Ratification have been agreed to. These 28 \n     agreed conditions address major concerns.\n       ``I commend Senator Lott, Senator Helms, Senator Lugar, and \n     many other former colleagues, as well as President Clinton \n     and administration officials for their constructive efforts. \n     Is it perfect--no--but I believe there are now adequate \n     safeguards to protect American interests. We should keep in \n     mind that the United States is already destroying its \n     chemical weapons in accordance with legislation passed more \n     than 10 years ago. The CWC would require all other parties to \n     destroy their stockpiles by April 2007.\n       ``In addition, the Administration has agreed to a number of \n     provisions dealing with rogue states that remain outside the \n     treaty. (See attached letter from President Clinton to me \n     dated April 22, 1997). I also understand there is a \n     possibility of an additional agreement with respect to \n     sharing of information. If so, it would further strengthen \n     the treaty. I understand that even with all the added \n     safeguards, not every Senator, for their own good reasons, \n     will support ratification.\n       ``As a member of the Senate, I supported the START I, START \n     II, INF, and CFE treaties because they met the crucial tests \n     of effective verification, real reductions, and stability. If \n     I were presently in the Senate, I would vote for ratification \n     of the CWC because of the many improvements agreed to.\n       ``Those who may still have concerns can look to Article \n     XVI, which allows withdrawal from the treaty on 90 days \n     notice if it fails to serve America's vital interests. There \n     is little doubt in my mind that if this convention increases \n     proliferation of chemical weapons, it would lead to public \n     outrage which would compel any President to act. The bottom \n     line is that when it comes to America's security, we must \n     maintain a strong national defense that is second to none.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I welcomed the opportunity to discuss the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) with you Saturday and \n     appreciated your taking the time Monday to have Bob Bell \n     brief you on the 28 agreed conditions to the Resolution of \n     Ratification.\n       When you wrote Senator Lott last September, you expressed \n     the hope that I would assist him in amending the Resolution \n     of Ratification in a manner that would address certain \n     concerns you raised and thereby ``achieve a treaty which \n     truly enhances American security.'' I believe the 28 agreed \n     conditions, which are the product of over 60 hours of \n     negotiation between the Administration and the Senate over \n     the last two and a half months, meet both these tests. We \n     have truly gone the extra mile in reaching out, as you \n     recommended, to broaden the base of bipartisan support for \n     this treaty. As I said in my public remarks Friday, ``I \n     consider that the things that we've agreed to in good faith \n     are really a tribute to the work that Senator Lott and \n     Senator Helms and Senator Biden and a number of others did to \n     really clarify what this Convention will mean; I think it's a \n     positive thing.''\n       Let me mention briefly how my Administration has addressed \n     the specific concerns you raised last fall:\n       Constitutionality. You said Constitutional protections \n     should be safeguarded against unwarranted searches. We have \n     agreed to a condition (#29) guaranteeing that there will be \n     no involuntary inspection of a U.S. company or facility \n     without a search warrant. Period. We have also agreed to a \n     condition (#12) underscoring that nothing in the treaty \n     ``authorizes legislation, or other action, by the United \n     States prohibited by the Constitution of the United States, \n     as interpreted by the United States.''\n       Real Reductions. You asked whether the CWC will actually \n     eliminate chemical weapons. We have agreed to a condition \n     (#13) specifying severe measures that the United States will \n     insist upon if a country is in non-compliance of this \n     fundamental obligation under the treaty.\n       Verification. You asked whether we will have high \n     confidence that our intelligence\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\n     community (IC) will detect violations. We have agreed to a \n     condition (#10) which would require the Administration to \n     identify on a yearly basis priorities, specific steps and \n     resources being undertaken to strengthen U.S. monitoring \n     and detection capabilities. These annual reports would \n     also include a determination of the IC's level of \n     confidence with respect to each monitoring task. We also \n     made clear during the negotiations on the conditions our \n     willingness to certify that the CWC is ``effectively \n     verifiable'' and that the IC has high confidence it could \n     detect the kind of violation that matters most in terms of \n     protecting our troops deployed in the field: any effort by \n     an adversary to try to train and equip his army for \n     offensive chemical warfare operations. I regret that the \n     unanimous consent (U/C) agreement governing the floor \n     debate on the CWC will not allow this condition to be \n     offered.\n       Universality. Finally, you asked whether the treaty will be \n     truly global. We have agreed to a condition (#11) which \n     requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that U.S. forces \n     are effectively equipped, trained and organized to fight and \n     win against any rogue state that remains outside the treaty \n     and employs CW in battle. To restrict CW options for such \n     states, we agreed to a condition (#7) requiring the President \n     to certify that we will strengthen our national export \n     controls and that all 30 states participating in the \n     Australia Group are committed to maintaining this export \n     control regime on dangerous chemicals. This certification \n     will have to be made annually. Lastly, during the \n     negotiations on the conditions we underscored our willingness \n     to commit to a mechanism by which we would have to consult \n     each year with the Senate on whether to remain in the CWC if \n     rogue states do not over time succumb to pressure to join the \n     treaty regime. As with the proposed verification condition, I \n     regret the Senate will not have an opportunity to vote on \n     this condition either.\n       In closing, let me again thank you for your interest in and \n     support for achieving a treaty that enhances the security of \n     our Armed Forces and all our citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will not read Senator Dole's whole \nstatement, but I think it is important what he said. I will read parts \nof it:\n\n       I commend Senator Lott, Senator Helms, Senator Lugar, and \n     many other former colleagues, as well as President Clinton \n     and the administration officials for their constructive \n     efforts. Is it perfect--no--but I believe there are now \n     adequate safeguards to protect American interests.\n\n  I repeat.\n\n       * * * I believe there are now adequate safeguards to \n     protect American interests. We should keep in mind that the \n     United States is already destroying its chemical weapons in \n     accordance with legislation passed more than 10 years ago. \n     The CWC would require all other parties to destroy their \n     stockpiles by April 2007.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       As a Member of the Senate, I supported the START I, START \n     II, INF, and CFE treaties because they met the crucial tests \n     of effective verification, real reductions, and stability. If \n     I were presently in the Senate, I would vote for ratification \n     of the CWC because of the many improvements agreed to.\n\n  Madam President, it is well known that, last fall, one of the reasons \nthe treaty was withdrawn by the administration was because of the \nreservations expressed by Senator Dole at that time--then candidate \nDole. It is well known that Senator Dole's reservations were legitimate \nand sincere. There is also now no doubt--at least in my mind, as well \nas in Senator Dole's--that those reservations and concerns have been \nsatisfied by the 28 conditions that are included in this treaty, with \nonly 5 remaining, which we will be voting on tomorrow.\n  Obviously, every U.S. Senator thinks for himself or herself; there is \nno doubt about that. But, in my mind, this is an important event that \nSenator Dole should weigh in on this issue--not because there is any \nbenefit to Senator Dole; clearly, there is a downside for his \ninvolvement, and he could have kept silent. But, once again, Senator \nDole has chosen to speak out for what he believes is important to U.S. \nvital national security interests. I applaud him and, again, hope that \nhe will continue his involvement in the challenges that we face in the \nyears ahead to our Nation's security, as he has so successfully done in \nthe past.\n  The CWC critics also contend that the treaty will weaken our \nnonproliferation policy because article XI of the treaty says the \nparties will have the right to participate in ``the fullest possible \nexchange'' of chemical technology for purposes not prohibited under the \nconvention. As a result, we will have to eliminate our national \ncontrols on chemical technologies and disband the Australia Group, the \nmultilateral framework for restraining transfers of sensitive chemical \ntechnology.\n  This interpretation of the treaty is contradicted not only by the \ntext of the treaty--which subordinates article XI to the basic \nundertakings in article I for parties not to acquire chemical weapons \nor to assist another state in doing so--but also by our experience with \nother nonproliferation treaties and the agreed ``consensus'' conditions \nincluded in the resolution of ratification before us.\n  First of all, article XI is essentially similar to the language of \narticle IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in that it blesses \ntechnology exchanges among treaty parties, but the NPT has not caused \nus to disband the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which was, in fact, founded \nafter the NPT went into force.\n  Nor has it obliged us to curtail our national controls on the \ntransfer of nuclear technology, even to other NPT parties; the United \nStates enacted the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 10 years after \nthe NPT was signed. There will always be some countries that object to \nour technology controls, but these are decisions the United States \nmakes for itself. And successive administrations, Republican and \nDemocratic, have maintained and expanded our export controls on nuclear \ntechnology, while the NPT has contributed to our ability to obtain \nsupport from our allies in this effort by establishing an international \nconsensus that nuclear proliferation is an evil that must be countered.\n  Moreover, beyond the text of the CWC itself, we have before us 28 \nagreed conditions in the resolution of ratification. As a member of the \ngroup that the majority leader put together to address issues regarding \nCWC ratification, I am proud of the work done at the member and staff \nlevel to achieve agreement with the administration on a number of \ndifficult issues. I am also grateful for the work done by the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking minority member, who \ntogether resolved many additional problems. This work has greatly \nstrengthened the resolution of ratification on which we will soon vote.\n  Agreed condition 7 of the resolution requires the President to \ncertify not only that the United States believes that the CWC does not \nrequire us to weaken our export controls, but also that all members of \nthe Australia Group have communicated, at the highest diplomatic \nlevels, their agreement that multilateral and national export controls \non sensitive chemical technology are compatible with the treaty and \nwill be maintained under the CWC.\n  Conversely, if the United States rejects ratification, I doubt that \nwe will be able to play our traditional leadership role in attempting \nto persuade other chemical suppliers to exercise restraint. The world \nwill blame the United States for undermining a chemical weapons ban \nthat the vast majority of other countries were willing to sign. If we \nreject ratification, where will we get the moral and political \nauthority to persuade other Australia Group participants to block \nexports to countries of concern?\n  The same case can be made regarding article X of the treaty, which \ncritics claim will require us to share defensive technologies with \npotential enemy states. Not only does this provision apply only to CWC \nparties, so countries outside the treaty like Libya cannot benefit, but \ncondition 15 in the resolution of ratification obliges the United \nStates to share only medical antidotes and treatment to countries of \nconcern if they are attacked with chemical weapons. And our respected \nformer colleague, Secretary of Defense Cohen, has committed the United \nStates to use every instrument of U.S. diplomacy and leverage to block \ntransfers of chemical technology that would undermine our security, and \nhe has made the obvious point that we will be better able to do this if \nwe are inside the CWC regime rather than outside.\n  It is true that the Chemical Weapons Convention will be more \ndifficult to verify than nuclear arms control agreements such as START \nand INF. But regardless of whether the United States ratifies the CWC, \nwe will have to monitor closely the chemical weapons programs of other \nstates. The intelligence community has repeatedly told the Senate that \nthe CWC's verification\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\nmeasures will be a useful tool in doing this job. General Shalikashvili \nhas told the Armed Services Committee that ``I believe that the system \nof declarations, of routine inspections, challenge inspections, all put \ntogether, give us a leg up to the ability to detect whether (potential \nviolators) are, in fact, embarked upon a program that would be in \nviolation of the CWC. So I think our chances are improved when they are \nmembers of the CWC. Our chances decrease dramatically if they are not \nmembers of the CWC.''\n  While some want to reject the CWC because of verification concerns, \nit seems to me that this would have the practical effect of reducing \nthe United States' ability to monitor the chemical weapons programs of \nother countries. This is an example of the best being the enemy of the \ngood.\n  Discussions among Senators and between the Senate and the \nadministration have produced other agreed conditions to the resolution \nthat have strengthened the case for ratification.\n  Madam President, I also want to commend the work of the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, who has worked long and hard to address the \nlegitimate concerns many Republicans Senators had expressed about the \nConvention and to accommodate the administration's correct assertion \nthat the Senate has a duty to vote, yea or nay, on the treaty. Senator \nLott and his indefatigable foreign policy advisor, Randy Scheunemann, \nlabored tirelessly to facilitate negotiations between members and \nbetween the Senate and the administration. They ensured that these \nnegotiations bore fruit and resulted in a resolution of ratification \nthat resolved most, if not all, of the reservations expressed by some \nSenators. Both the Senate and the administration are in their debt.\n\n  It is also appropriate, Madam President, to commend administration \nofficials for working with the Senate in a genuinely nonpartisan way \nthat was notable for the respect paid to the views of all Members, and \nthe good faith shown in trying to come to terms with so many difficult \nissues. I have on many past occasions been critical of administration \npolicies and the lack of bipartisanship in promoting those policies. In \nthis instance, administration officials took great pains to secure the \nSenate's advice and consent in a manner that was, as I said, genuinely \nrespectful of every Senator's views. Thus, I am happy to give praise \nwhere praise is due.\n  Madam President, I respect the concerns of those Senators who cannot \nvote in favor of ratifying the CWC. But in my opinion, we do not need \nkiller amendments to ensure that this treaty--negotiated under \nPresident Reagan and signed by President Bush--is on balance a good \ndeal for the United States. This view is shared by former Presidents \nFord and Bush, numerous Nobel Prize winners in chemistry, the chemical \nindustry trade associations, gulf war victors Colin Powell and Norman \nSchwarzkopf, retired CNO Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, plus the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Reserve Officers \nAssociation. I am comfortable in their company, and that of every U.S. \nally in Europe and Asia. That is why I intend to vote to ratify this \ntreaty, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Madam President, I yield back my time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise today to voice my serious \nreservations about the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. The most \nimportant standards for an effective treaty are: Verifiability, \nprotection to the signatories, constitutionality, and the applicability \nto nations of most concern. I sincerely believe that the CWC falls \nshort in each of these basic requirements.\n  On April 8, 1997 three former Secretaries of Defense appeared before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee urging Senators to vote against \nthe ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This fact alone \nshould give this body great pause in the consideration of this treaty.\n  I know that there are good, there are loyal, and there are patriotic \nAmericans on both sides of this issue of ratifying the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. I have many constituents who have called me, and said, \n``Senator, how do we know? We hear former Secretaries of Defense saying \nit is a bad treaty. We hear Colin Powell saying it is a good treaty. \nToday we hear former Senator Dole saying we need to ratify this. How do \nwe know?''\n  I believe that it is simply our responsibility as Senators, \nrespecting the differences that exist, to study this, to evaluate it, \nand to make a reasoned judgment. I believe also when our national \nsecurity is at risk that we must always opt on the side of caution in \nconsideration of a treaty such as we have before us.\n  Madam President, the opinions of Secretaries Schlesinger, Rumsfeld, \nWeinberger, and Cheney regarding this treaty should not be taken \nlightly. On April 7, in a letter to Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former Secretary of Defense \nCheney wrote, and I am quoting, Mr. President:\n\n       The technology to manufacture chemical weapons is simply \n     too ubiquitous, covert chemical warfare programs too easily \n     concealed, and the international community's record of \n     responding effectively to violations of arms control treaties \n     too unsatisfactory to permit confidence that such a regime \n     would actually reduce the chemical threat. Indeed, some \n     aspects of the present convention, notably its obligation to \n     share with potential adversaries like Iran, chemical \n     manufacturing technology that can be used for military \n     purposes and chemical defensive equipment, threaten to make \n     this accord worse than having no treaty at all.\n\n  Those words of Dick Cheney have echoed in my mind--``worse than \nhaving no treaty at all''.\n  He said, if I might summarize, that the manufacture of chemical \nweapons is too widespread, concealing it is too easy, and enforcement \nis too uncertain for us to ratify this treaty.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement from \nDick Cheney be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The technology to manufacture chemical weapons is simply \n     too ubiquitous, covert chemical warfare programs too easily \n     concealed, and the international community's record of \n     responding effectively to violations of arms control treaties \n     too unsatisfactory to permit confidence that such a regime \n     would actually reduce the chemical threat. Indeed, some \n     aspects of the present convention, notably its obligation to \n     share with potential adversaries like Iran, chemical \n     manufacturing technology that can be used for military \n     purposes and chemical defensive equipment, threaten to make \n     this accord worse than having no treaty at all.--Richard \n     Cheney, Letter to Chairman Helms, April 7, 1997.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, Secretary Cheney's statement sends a \nclear message to the American people that this treaty does not \neffectively deal with the threat of chemical and biological weapons. As \nwe begin this debate on the CWC, the American people, with \njustification, will ask their leaders how and where they stand on the \nissue of chemical weapons.\n  I stand here today wanting to tell the American people that this \nCongress will do everything in its power to rid our world of chemical \nand biological weapons, however, the CWC is not global, is not \nverifiable, is not constitutional, and quite frankly, it will not work.\n  While the intent of the CWC is to create a global chemical weapons \nban, accomplishing that goal does seem unlikely. Six countries with \nchemical weapons programs--including all of those with aggressive \nprograms--have not yet signed the CWC.\n  So how then can we call this a global treaty?\n  Neither Iraq, Libya, Syria, nor North Korea have signed or ratified \nthe CWC. China, Pakistan, and Iran have signed the CWC, but have not \nratified it. Russia has signed the CWC, but has not ratified it.\n  These rogue nations of Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Syria represent \na clear threat to United States security and the security of key United \nStates allies. All of these countries have active, aggressive programs \nto develop and produce chemical weapons.\n  Let's be clear about one important thing. The administration has \nrefused to ban inspectors from rogue nations such as Iran and China.\n  That will be one of the reservations that we will have the \nopportunity to vote on. And it is one of those reservations that I find \nit incomprehensible\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\nthat the administration has found unacceptable--banning inspectors from \nrogue nations such as Iran and China.\n  In addition, there are intelligence reports that have recently \nindicated that Russia has already begun to cheat, even before the CWC \nhas gone into effect. These facts alone give substance to opposing the \ntreaty.\n  Madam President, inherent in the CWC is a requirement that we share \nour advanced chemical defensive gear with countries like Iran and \nChina. It is important to recognize that rogue nations, through reverse \nengineering, can easily figure out how to infiltrate our technologies. \nThis would not only increase the chances of a chemical attack, but more \nimportantly this would endanger our troops around the world.\n  Let us be crystal clear on the fact that once there is a free-for-all \nof U.S. chemical and defensive technologies between the proposed \nsignatories of this treaty, it will quite frankly be impossible to stop \nthe transfer of this information to the rogue nations, that do not sign \nthe CWC.\n  I believe that the CWC will not increase pressure on rogue regimes. \nThe CWC will not result in an international norm against the use of \nchemical weapons. The Geneva Convention of 1925 already established \nthat norm. How many times has this prohibition been violated by Iraq, \non the Kurds and even in the case of our own troops?\n  Madam President, it took 5 years before the Pentagon came forward \nwith information pertaining to the exposure of our own troops to \ncertain chemical and biological substances that could affect the health \nand well-being of our 700,000 U.S. service people in the gulf.\n  The rogues have demonstrated that they will plan for the use of, \nthreaten the use of, and indeed use chemical weapons despite \ninternational norms.\n  We must, to the best of our ability, avoid the horrible events of the \n1980's, when the international community witnessed the horrors of \nIraq's use of chemical weapons against its own people. Since that time, \nsanctions against Iraq have been strong and effective. The CWC will not \naddress any shortcomings in these sanctions.\n  Madam President, how can the CWC be global if these so-called rogue \nnations have not signed the CWC? The bottom line seems to be that the \nCWC is most applicable to the countries of least concern to the United \nStates. It may help us with Great Britain, but provide no protection \nregarding North Korea or Iraq.\n  It is my understanding, that under article XII of the treaty, members \ncaught violating treaty provisions are simply threatened with a \nrestriction or suspension of convention privileges. At worst, a report \nwill be sent to the U.N. General Assembly and the U.N. Security \nCouncil. Mr. President, how does a report protect the American people?\n  Madam President, with no predetermined sanctions in place to deter \npotential violators, the CWC seems ineffective and unenforceable.\n  I am very sensitive to the needs and wishes of the small business-\nman. And while large multinational chemical corporations can bear the \nestimated astronomical costs regarding reporting requirements of a CWC \nmember nation, these costs constitute a significant burden, in some \ncases an overwhelming burden, to small businesses, not just in Arkansas \nbut all around America. There are roughly 230 small businesses which \ncustom-synthesize made-to-order products and compete with large \nchemical manufacturers. It is my understanding that they generally have \nfewer than 100 employees and have annual sales of less than $40 million \neach. Few, if any, of them can afford to employ legions of lawyers just \nto satisfy the new reporting requirements of the CWC. Let us be \nrealistic. Can these burdensome reporting requirements prevent the \nproliferation of chemical weapons?\n\n  In addition to the cost factor on our small businesses, the \npossibility of U.S. trade secrets being stolen during CWC inspections \nto me at least seems very high. I have been advised that the U.S. \nintelligence community has said that the CWC inspections constitute a \nnew tool to add to our intelligence collection tool kit. Putting one \nand one together, inspections will also constitute a tool in the kit of \nforeign governments as well. I hope that the American people realize \nthat U.S. expenditures as a member nation of the CWC include a \nmandatory 25-percent assessment for operating expenses of the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. As a member nation, we will pick up a 25-percent \nassessment for the operating expenses of the organization. This is the \nnew international organization created to administer the CWC. It is my \nunderstanding that operating costs are likely to be a minimum of $100 \nmillion per year, $25 million of which will come from U.S. taxpayers.\n  Finally, it is my understanding that the CWC requires the United \nStates to begin destruction of our chemical stockpile no later than 2 \nyears after the treaty enters into force. I simply believe that is \nunreasonable and unattainable.\n  The Department of Defense has publicly stated that the U.S. \ndestruction of its chemical weapons stockpile will continue regardless \nof whether we are a signatory to such treaty. We have one such arsenal \nin Pine Bluff, AR. I believe it is unrealistic to expect that the $12.4 \nbillion cost in destroying those chemical weapons will be achievable \nparticularly given the environmental concerns that exist. And I am \nbeing contacted daily by those with environmental concerns about the \nPine Bluff arsenal. So I believe that the recent debate on Yucca \nMountain further illustrates how problematic the fulfillment of our \ntreaty obligations would be.\n  Madam President, I certainly want this body to provide a \ncomprehensive domestic and international plan to reduce the threat of \nchemical and biological weapons. As I have already stated today, \nhowever, the CWC has too many loopholes that will perpetuate chemical \nweapon activity rather than end it. It is a serious obligation that we \nhave. I believe that this body will make the right decision. For me, \nthe words of Dick Cheney keep echoing: ``Worse than no treaty at all.''\n  For this Senator, I will be voting ``no'' on I believe a flawed, \nunfixable treaty. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the distinguished Senator from New Jersey 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Delaware \nfor yielding.\n  Madam President, tomorrow the Senate will exercise its historic \nconstitutional powers of treaty ratification. It is a solemn power that \nwe have exercised for two centuries. That power has often defined the \nsecurity of the Nation and sometimes been determinant of war and peace \nitself. The issue before the Senate now is the ban on chemical weapons, \nprobably the most important foreign policy question remaining before \nthe United States in this century.\n  Perhaps because the consequences are so great the choice is also \nclear. This treaty demands ratification. The treaty itself is a \nculmination of a process that began over 12 years ago under the \nleadership of Ronald Reagan. The United States began a review and then \ndetermined that it would eliminate chemical weapons. We did so because \nof the need to reduce the numbers of those weapons in the world and to \nrestrict the ability of those nations that did not possess them to \nobtain them.\n  Since Ronald Reagan's judgment a decade ago, we have made \nextraordinary progress. In 1985, President Reagan signed into law a \njudgment that would eliminate American stockpiles by the year 2004, \nhaving an important impact on the ratification of this treaty because, \nwhether it is ratified or not, no matter what judgments are made by \nthis institution, the United States is going to eliminate chemical \nweapons. Second, the United States then followed our own judgment by \nleading the international effort with 160 other nations to enact a \nmultilateral ban. It is the result of that process that is now before \nthe Senate.\n\n  The process, it is important to note, did not culminate with the \nReagan administration. In 1992, President George\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nBush announced a strong American support for the treaty and the United \nStates became an original signatory. A year later, under President \nClinton, the United States once again announced its support. Today, we \nhave come full circle. From Ronald Reagan's first pronouncements, the \ntreaty, now endorsed by a Democratic President, seeks ratification \nunder a majority Republican Congress.\n  The Secretary of State said only a week ago:\n\n       This treaty has ``made in America'' written all over it. It \n     was Ronald Reagan's idea, George Bush negotiated it and \n     signed it, and Bill Clinton has embraced it.\n\n  In truth, however, Madam President, the treaty is neither Democratic \nnor Republican. It reflects the bipartisan commitments of the United \nStates toward our security, our values, and a century of learning the \nlessons of collective security because after 80 years of living under \nthe threats of chemical weapons, it is the judgment of this \nadministration and those that preceded it that it is time to eliminate \nthese weapons.\n  The treaty does several direct and important things. It bans the \ndevelopment, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.\n  Second, it requires the destruction of all chemical weapons and their \nproduction facilities.\n  Third, it provides the most extensive verification process in the \nhistory of arms control.\n  Finally, it grants member nations the effective tools for dealing \nwith those who refuse to comply, tools that will be denied the United \nStates if we fail to ratify the treaty. And yet many of my colleagues \nhave questioned the need for the United States to become a member \nstate. They note two principal objections. First, that the burden of \nreporting requirements and verifications would be onerous on American \nindustry; and second, the impact on American defense capabilities.\n  Allow me to deal with each. First, the economic impact. In my State \nof New Jersey, the chemical industry represents fully one-third of the \nentire industrial capability of the State; 150,000 citizens of the \nState of New Jersey are employed in this vital manufacturing industry \nof chemicals. Let us be clear. The entire industry, from small \ncompanies to among the largest industries in the State of New Jersey, \nnot only supports this treaty but has joined in demanding its \nratification.\n  Second, on the question of American defense capabilities, it should \nbe self-evident that if the United States is unilaterally forgoing \nthese weapons and rogue nations continue to embrace them, American \nmilitary personnel will be more vulnerable and, indeed, endangered if \nthe United States is not a signatory, allowing us to help enforce the \nprovisions of the treaty and deny capability to rogue nations than if \nwe are to remain on the outside.\n\n  That is why this treaty has been endorsed by General Powell, 17 other \nfour-star generals and every former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff--in the Carter, Clinton, and Ford administrations.\n  I ask my colleagues who oppose this treaty, would all these members \nof the general staff, would each of these men who have held the \nprincipal responsibility for guiding and leading our Armed Forces have \nendorsed this treaty if there was any chance, if there was any \njudgment, that, indeed, our Armed Forces would be less safe?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 7 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Madam President. I ask the Senator from \nDelaware to yield 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Without objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, this is a moment of judgment that \nthis Senate has faced before. History instructs us that we cannot \nafford to be wrong. Over 75 years ago, this body chose the wrong route \nand the toll was monumental. During consideration of the treaty for the \nLeague of Nations, the United States took the lead in forming the \nprinciples of collective security. It was our leadership which brought \nthe world to understand that there was no separate peace, there was no \nindividual security, and yet in that instance, as in this moment, the \nUnited States, after providing the intellectual and the political \nleadership, was a reluctant participant. The judgment then, we were \ntold, was that there were reservations because of individual provisions \nof the treaty. But, indeed, history instructs us, and I believe would \nguide us now, that those reservations were not because of individual \naspects of the treaty but because of a general ideologic opposition to \narms control and the general notion of collective security.\n  It is time for the United States, after all the painful lessons of \nprevious generations, to simply understand there is no unilateral \nsecurity in a multilateral world. From Pearl Harbor to the Persian \nGulf, history demands us to recognize an essential truth: American \nsecurity, because of a changing world and developing technology, \nrequires and demands that we deal with other nations.\n  The choice before this Senate is clear. From the doughboys who \nendured the horrors of mustard gas in the trenches of Europe, the \nKurdish refugees who suffered in Iraq, to the refugees of Cambodia who \nsuffered yellow rain, to our own veterans of the Persian Gulf, it is \ntime to put an end to chemical weapons. That power is in the hands of \nthe Senate. If we fail to do so, a host of rogue nations will take \nadvantage of the opportunity.\n  Before this Senate on July 10, 1919, Woodrow Wilson closed the debate \nsaying, ``We are the only hope of mankind. Dare we reject it and break \nthe hearts of the world.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho, [Mr. Craig].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, thank you and let me thank my chairman, \nnot only for yielding but for his leadership on this most important \nissue that now is being thoughtfully and responsibly debated here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Madam President, the Chemical Weapons Convention has such far-\nreaching domestic and national security implications that it deserves \nthe most thorough and thoughtful examination the Senate can give it. I \nhave given this matter a careful review and would like to reiterate \nsome of the conclusions I have reached.\n  If I thought supporting this treaty would make chemical weapons \ndisappear, and give us all greater security from these heinous weapons, \nI would not hesitate in giving my support. Unfortunately, the facts do \nnot demonstrate this; indeed, implementing this treaty may actually \nincrease danger to U.S. citizens and troops.\n  The convention has been signed by 160 nations and ratified by only \n74--less than 50 percent. Five countries who are thought to have \nchemical weapons are not even signatories of the convention: Egypt, \nIraq, Libya, North Korea, and Syria. Another six nations have signed, \nbut not ratified the convention: China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Israel, \nand Russia. In short, this convention is not global in scale.\n  Even if it were true that this treaty had been signed and ratified by \n160 nations, serious problems would remain. Compliance with the \nChemical Weapons Convention cannot be assured because it is not \neffectively verifiable.\n  I think it is timely and appropriate to remember, as others have \nmentioned, the principles of Ronald Reagan. Even though he started the \nprocess that we are debating today, he would have insisted in the end, \nwhile we might trust our allies and our friends around the world, that \nin every circumstance we must verify.\n  Unlike nuclear weapons which require a large, specialized industrial \nbase, chemical weapons can be manufactured almost anywhere. \nFurthermore, many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses. \nChemicals help us to manufacture products such as pesticides, \npharmaceuticals, plastics, and paints. With such a broad spectrum of \nuses, it would be difficult to discern the legitimate from the illicit.\n  It is also very disturbing to me that ratification of this treaty \nwould abandon a fundamental arms control principle insisted upon over \nthe last 17 years--that the United States must be able to effectively \nverify compliance with the terms of the treaty. Verification has meant \nthat U.S. intelligence is\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\nable to detect a breach in an arms control agreement in time to respond \nappropriately and assure preservation of our national security \ninterests. I believe the Senate has an obligation to uphold this sound \nstandard. Let me take this opportunity to express my support for \nSenator Helms' condition in this regard. I applaud his effort to make \nreal verification a condition of CWC implementing legislation, if the \ntreaty is ratified.\n  Even if verification of compliance were not a concern, this \nconvention would be difficult to enforce. In a sound arms control \ntreaty, the United States must be able to punish other countries caught \nin violation of the agreement. The Chemical Weapons Convention provides \nonly vague, unspecified sanctions to be imposed on a country found in \nbreach of the Convention. Ultimately, the Chemical Weapons convention \nleaves the U.N. Security Council to impose penalties severe enough to \nchange behavior of an outlaw nation. Since any one of the five members \nof the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged \nagainst them or their friends, China and Russia, for example, could \nsimply veto resolutions imposing sanctions if they disagreed with other \nSecurity Council members. In sum, it does not appear that this \nagreement is verifiable or enforceable.\n  Even if the enforcement mechanism to punish violators of the treaty \nwere perfect, countries that represent the greatest threat to United \nStates security such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and North Korea have \nnot ratified the treaty and would be under no obligation to comply with \nits terms and conditions. Furthermore, our intelligence experts tell us \nthat each one of these countries has active and aggressive programs to \ndevelop and produce chemical weapons.\n\n  Iran has a stockpile of blister, choking, and blood agents possibly \nexceeding 2,000 tons. Their program is the largest in the Third World. \nSyria, which has been increasing production of chemical weapons since \nthe 1980's, is home to several radical terrorist organizations, \nincluding Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Palestine. Many worry that Syria could easily \nsupply these organizations with chemical weapons. North Korea has a \nstockpile of nerve gas, blood agents, and mustard gas. Additionally, \nNorth Korea has the ability to unleash large scale chemical attacks \nthrough mortars, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and Scud \nmissiles. Currently, Libya has one chemical weapons production facility \nin operation, and a larger plant under construction. Iraq has not only \na substantial capability, but has demonstrated a willingness to use \nthese weapons against their own people.\n  It has been observed that under the CWC, members to the convention \nwould face no difficulty looking for prohibited chemicals in free and \nopen countries which will accurately declare the location of chemical \nfacilities. However, this situation will be much different for rogue \nstates that are a party to the convention. As arms control verification \nexperts correctly point out, ``We've never found anything that's been \nsuccessfully hidden.'' Let me repeat that: ``We've never found anything \nthat's been successfully hidden.'' Will the unintended consequence of \nthe CWC be that villainous states will be more secure, and peaceful \nstates less?\n  Furthermore, have all questions raised in regards to the convention's \ncompatibility with our constitution been sufficiently addressed? The \nConvention creates an international monitoring regime called the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW. The OPCW \nwill be granted the most extensive monitoring power of any arms control \ntreaty ever because it extends coverage to governmental and civilian \nfacilities.\n\n  The authority of this international monitoring regime also raises \nconcern about foreign nationals having such broad authority to obtain \naccess to property held by private U.S. citizens. The U.S. chemical \nindustry is known to be one of the top industries targeted for \nespionage by foreign companies and governments. There is legitimate \nworry that international inspections could jeopardize confidential \nbusiness information, trade secrets, and other proprietary data. Since \nthe United States will be expected to pay 25 percent, or approximately \n$50 million, of the OPCW's operating costs, American tax dollars could \nbe subsidizing increased risk for U.S. business interests.\n  There is also an implementation cost that will be borne by private \nindustry. The cost for each inspection has been estimated as high as \n$500,000 for large chemical companies, and a range of $10,000 to \n$20,000 for small companies. Costs could become even higher if a \nshutdown is required for an inspection to safeguard proprietary \ninformation or company security.\n  Another issue which has not been thoroughly discussed is how the \ncosts incurred with the inspections are to be paid. Estimates of the \nnumber of companies to be inspected in America vary from 140 firms to \nover 10,000 firms.\n  And even though we would pay the lion's share of the international \nmonitoring regime's budget, the United States would have no special \nstatus over other signatory nations, no veto power, and no assurance of \nbeing a member of the executive council.\n  In conclusion, making the production and possession of chemical \nweapons illegal according to international law will not make them \ndisappear. Use of such weapons has been prohibited since 1925 yet we \nhave seen the results of their use. We all know about the tens of \nthousands of deaths from poison gas in World War I, and no one could \nforget the tragic photographs of the Iranian children killed during the \n1980's by the Iraqi government. Illegal? Yes, but still in use, \nnonetheless.\n\n  I stand today with all Americans expressing a grave concern over the \nincreasing proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. The real \nquestion here seems to be whether ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention will increase our own national security. Unfortunately, the \nanswer is no. There is little value in implementing international laws \nwhich do little to decrease illegal research, development, and \nproliferation of chemical weapons worldwide.\n  I support the goal of making the world safe from the threat of \nchemical weapons. I applaud the honorable statement the CWC makes \nagainst these heinous weapons. However, I believe the best way to \nprotect ourselves from this threat is by rejecting this treaty. The \nconvention does nothing to better our security, but may even open the \ndoor to increasing risks against our vital security interests and \ninfringing on the rights of innocent citizens. For these reason, I am \ncompelled to vote against the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes and then I will \nyield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, I yield myself 3 minutes and then I will yield to the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I found it fascinating, the statement of my \nfriend from Idaho. He made a very compelling case, from his \nperspective, as why we cannot verify the treaty and therefore why we \nshould be against the treaty--because we cannot verify it. We cannot \nverify it because, he says, we cannot inspect sufficiently well. And \nthat is why he is against the treaty. Then he says one of the other \nreasons he is against the treaty is because the verification regime is \nso intrusive that it will allow the opposition--allow rogue states to \nget access to information in the chemical industry.\n  So, if we correct one problem, which is to make it more verifiable, \nthen he would argue he is against the treaty because it is verifiable. \nIf you do not make it more verifiable, he said, he is against the \ntreaty because it is not verifiable.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Not on my time. I will be delighted to yield on the time \nof the Senator, since I have limited time, on Senator Helms' time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself 1 minute off the time of Senator Helms.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield when I finish.\n  He also said the intelligence community says, ``They have never found \nanything that is successfully hidden.''\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n  I do not know how many of you are golfers. That is like saying you \ncannot sink a putt if it is short. Obviously, a putt will not go in if \nit does not get to the hole. Obviously, you cannot uncover something \nthat is successfully hidden.\n  The last point I would make is the chemical industry, the outfit that \nrepresents the bulk of the chemical industry has strongly endorsed this \ntreaty. I am just responding to the last point that the chemical \nindustry is the target. The chemical industry, coincidentally, is for \nthis treaty.\n  But I would be happy, now, on Senator Helms' time, to yield back to \nmy friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding me time. I think it \nis very important that what I said be what I said. Let me reiterate \nthat it would be impossible to verify with rogue nations. We know in \nthis country we will verify. Our chemical companies will be an open \ndoor. We have always played by the rules of the treaties we have signed \nand we have never intentionally or purposely violated them. That is not \nthe point I was trying to make, and I think the Senator knows that.\n  But, what we do know is that for countries who choose not to play by \ninternational rules--and there are a good many out there--it would be \ndifficult, if not impossible, for the international monitoring team to \nbe able to verify compliance. I think that is the point. I have not \neven discussed, nor did I bring up the point of concern, that we would \nbe releasing information. I am also concerned about espionage. And I \ndid express that. So, it is important that that part of it be \nunderstood. Our chemical companies, by this treaty, would be an open \ndoor.\n  Let me also say I do not believe there is a chemical company in this \ncountry that is an expert in international affairs. Nor do I want the \nexecutives of these chemical companies negotiating a treaty. Nor do I \nwant them establishing the foreign policy of this country. I believe \nthat is the job of the Senator, and it is mine, and the job of this \nbody, and of the President of the United States.\n\n  I'm sorry, no matter what the chemical industry says, frankly, I \ndon't care. What I do care about is the security of this country. What \nI do care about is our national sovereignty. And what I do care about \nis the issue of verification. I think this treaty simply does not get \nus where we need to get for a safer world.\n  I must say, I am tremendously proud and I have supported this \ncountry's disarming itself of chemical and biological weapons. I \nencourage us to do that. We have done it and we ought to continue to do \nit and we ought to make sure that our troops in the field have adequate \nequipment to be able to protect themselves.\n  We must lead by example, but let's not walk into or create the \nillusionary track that I think the CWC simply offers to the world, and \nmost assuredly to this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I might \ntake, and I am only going to take a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, the reason I mention the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation is not that they should determine the foreign policy. My \nfriend from Idaho is saying that the target of this kind of espionage, \nor stealing secrets, whatever, is going to be the chemical industry. \nAll I am pointing out is, just as they should not determine the foreign \npolicy, I respectfully suggest my friend from Idaho does not know \nanything about their secrets. The chemical industry knows about their \nsecrets, and they believe that this treaty fully protects them in \nmaintaining their secrets. That is the point I was making.\n  You know that play and movie that is out, ``Don't Cry for Me \nArgentina,'' well, don't worry about the chemical companies, they think \nthey can take care of themselves in terms of their secrets.\n  One last point. The Senator raised, as others have raised, the 1 ton \nof weapons and 2 tons that could be amassed, et cetera. I want to point \nout what John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nsaid, and he is not quoted by the Senator from Idaho, but others. \nEveryone quotes John Shalikashvili as saying that 1 ton of chemical \nweapons is militarily significant and that we cannot effectively \nguarantee we could uncover 1 ton. Let me read what General \nShalikashvili said:\n\n       A militarily significant quantity of chemical weapons is \n     situationally dependent. Thousands--\n\n  Thousands--\n\n     of tons of chemical agent would be required to significantly \n     impact on a large scale engagement while a mere ton of agent \n     could be effective as a weapon of terror.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       In certain limited circumstances--\n\n  I emphasize ``in certain limited circumstances''--\n\n     even 1 ton of chemical agent may have a military impact, for \n     example, if chemical weapons are used as a weapon of terror \n     against an unprotected population in a regional conflict.\n\n  He went on to say further:\n\n       The United States should be resolute that the 1-ton limit \n     set by the convention will be our guide.\n\n  He did not mean, however, that 1 ton was an appropriate standard for \nwhat constitutes effective verifiability. Rather, General Shali meant \nthat the 1-ton limit in the CWC on agent stocks for peaceful purposes--\nthat is the context in which he talked about it--was appropriate and \nthat any country's stock in excess of 1 ton would likely be for \noffensive military purposes.\n  So what he is saying--the 1 ton that keeps being used--he is saying \nif you detect that there is more than a ton of chemical weapons out \nthere, they are probably doing it not for peaceful purposes, they are \nprobably doing it to gain some military advantage. But it would take a \nlot more than 1 ton to have a major effect on a battle, a major effect \non our security. He said it would take thousands of tons.\n  Other people may think in this body that 1 ton is militarily \nsignificant and if you can't effectively verify 1 ton then there is no \nverification in terms of our strategic interests. They may think that, \nbut that is not what the Joint Chiefs think. The 1-ton reference was \nfor the purpose of determining whether or not a country was trying to \ndo more than use those chemicals for peaceful purposes. He says, if you \nhave more than 1 ton, it is a pretty good sign that these are bad guys \nand they are trying to do something worse, but they are nowhere near \nbeing militarily significant in terms of U.S. security.\n  I see my friend.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think it is fair to let Senator Craig have another whack \nat it, and I do wish the former Democratic Secretary of Defense can be \nquoted on this subject as well. As a matter of fact, the news media \nignored him entirely.\n  I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for yielding, and I \nrecognize and appreciate the patience of the Senator from Ohio. I will \nbe brief.\n  It is very important that it not be suggested that all who are in \nfavor makes it so lopsided that there is nobody in opposition. May I \nquote Donald Rumsfeld or James Schlesinger or, most important, Edward \nO'Malley, who was the Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, chief of counterintelligence under Ronald Reagan. He \nspeaks of many companies' great concerns about both economic and secret \nespionage and expresses his opposition to it.\n  Here are the names of 25 major CEO's of chemical companies who stand \nclearly in opposition to this treaty. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that these ladies and gentlemen and their statements be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   America's Top Foreign Policy, Defense, and Economic Experts Raise \n            Concerns Over the CWC's Impact on U.S. Business\n\n       Steve Forbes, President and CEO of Forbes Inc.: ``....As I \n     have strenuously argued on other occasions, maintaining \n     America's competitive edge requires a lessening of the tax \n     and regulatory burdens on the American people and on our \n     Nation's enterprises. Unfortunately, the CWC will have \n     precisely the opposite effect. It will burden up to 8,000 \n     companies across the United States. Remember,\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\n     these are in the hands of an international bureaucracy, not \n     what we would like them to be, with major new reporting \n     regulatory and inspection requirements entailing large and \n     uncompensated compliance costs. These added costs constitute \n     an unfunded Federal mandate. Like so many mandates, they are \n     bound to retard our economic growth and make our companies \n     less competitive.\n       ...in addition to the costs arising from heavy duty \n     reporting, the CWC subjects our chemical companies to snap \n     inspections that will allow other nations access to our \n     latest chemical equipment and information. No longer will \n     violators of intellectual property rights in China, Iran, and \n     elsewhere, have to go to the trouble of pirating our \n     secrets... Some might even regard such burdens as a barrier \n     to entry that can enhance their market share at the expense \n     of their smaller competitors.''\n       Donald Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense and President \n     and former Chairman and CEO of G.D. Searle and Company: \n     ``...Big companies seem to get along fine with big \n     government. They get along with American government, they get \n     along with foreign governments, they get along with \n     international organizations, and they have the ability, with \n     all their Washington representatives, to deal effectively \n     with bureaucracies... Indeed, that capability on the part of \n     the big companies actually serves as a sort of barrier to \n     entry to small and medium-sized companies that lack that \n     capability. So I do not suggest... for one minute that large \n     American companies are not going to be able to cope with the \n     regulations. They will do it a whale of a lot better than \n     small and medium sized companies...\n       I don't believe that the thousands--whatever the number \n     is--of companies across this country know about this treaty \n     in any detail, believe that the treaty would apply to them, \n     understand that they could be subjected to inspections, \n     appreciate the unfunded mandates that would be imposed on \n     them in the event this were to pass.''\n       James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and former \n     Director of Central Intelligence: ``The convention permits or \n     encourages challenge inspections against any facility deemed \n     capable of producing chemical weapons--indeed, against any \n     facility. This exposes American companies to a degree of \n     industrial espionage never before encountered in this \n     country. This implies the possibility of the capture of \n     proprietary information or national security information from \n     American corporations by present or by prospective commercial \n     rivals.\n       ...we are dealing with the possible industrial espionage in \n     the United States, and that industrial espionage is going to \n     be a godsend--I repeat, a godsend--to foreign intelligence \n     agencies and to the corporations which will feed on those \n     foreign intelligence agencies.''\n       Lieutenant General William Odom, former Director of the \n     National Security Agency: ``Looking at the verification \n     regime as a former official of the Intelligence Community, I \n     am disturbed by it, not just because it is impossible to \n     verify, but also because it can complicate U.S. security \n     problems. Take, for example, the U.N.-like organization to be \n     set up to make inspections. All of the appointed members may \n     have no foreign intelligence links initially. As they find \n     that they can tramp around in all kinds of U.S. production \n     facilities, however, foreign intelligence services are likely \n     to offer to supplement their wages for a little ``technology \n     collection'' activity on the side. And they will provide \n     truly sophisticated covert technical means to facilitate such \n     endeavors.''\n       Lieutenant General James Williams, former Director of the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency: ``. . . the opportunity for \n     unfettered access to virtually every industrial facility in \n     this country, not merely the pharmaceutical and chemical \n     plants, would make most foreign intelligence organizations \n     very happy, even gleeful. It is likely to cause the \n     counterintelligence sections of the FBI and the Defense \n     Investigative Service major problems for the foreseeable \n     future. The inspection procedures which apply to ALL \n     industries constitute unprecedented access to our \n     manufacturing base, not just to those thought likely to be \n     engaged in proscribed activities! My experience in protecting \n     patents and intellectual property over the past ten years \n     leads me to conclude that there is the potential for the loss \n     of untold billions of dollars in trade secrets which can be \n     used to gain competitive advantage, to shorten R cycles, \n     and a steal US market share.''\n       Edward J. O'Malley, former Assistant Director of Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, Chief of Counterintelligence: ``The \n     activities of the former Soviet Union and others are as \n     aggressive as ever, and remain a major threat. What is new, \n     however, is the increased importance given by them to the \n     collection of American corporate proprietary information.\n       . . . One of the greatest concerns of companies . . . is \n     that the CWC will open them up to economic espionage. I think \n     their concerns are well-justified. . . . The acquisition of \n     American trade secrets has become a high stakes business \n     involving billions and billions of dollars, and I would be \n     able to pay an agent handsomely to acquire such information''\n       Deborah Wince-Smith, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce \n     for Technology Policy (in September 9, 1996, letter signed \n     jointly by Secretaries Weinberger, Rumsfeld, and others): \n     ``What the CWC will do, however, is quite troubling: It will \n     create a massive new, UN-style international inspection \n     bureaucracy (which will help the total cost of this treaty to \n     U.S. taxpayers amount to as much as $200 million per year). \n     It will jeopardize U.S. citizens constitutional rights by \n     requiring the government to permit searches without either \n     warrants or probable cause. It will impose a costly and \n     complex regulatory burden on U.S. industry. As many as 8,000 \n     companies across the country may be subjected to new \n     reporting requirements entailing uncompensated annual costs \n     of between thousands to hundreds-of-thousands of dollars per \n     year to comply. Most of these American companies have no idea \n     they will be affected.''\n       Bruce Merrifield, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce \n     for Technology: ``I am quite concerned about the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention which, in its current form, would \n     seriously diminish our U.S. competitive advantage in the \n     currently existing hyper-competitive global marketplace . . . \n     industrial espionage by countries that do not have an \n     equivalent capability to make basic discoveries, now accounts \n     for the theft each year of some $24 billion to perhaps over \n     $100 billion of U.S. proprietary technology. The Chemical \n     Weapons Convention would literally open the floodgates of \n     access to U.S. technology by foreign nations. Virtually \n     unannounced inspections by scientific experts, taking samples \n     and inspecting invoices can quickly uncover the proprietary \n     nature of any industrial operation, bypassing millions of \n     dollars of research and many years of development time that a \n     U.S. company has expended to create its competitive \n     advantage.''\n       Kathleen Bailey, Senior Fellow, Lawrence Livermore \n     Laboratories, former Assistant Director for the Arms Control \n     and Disarmament Agency ``Experts in my laboratory recently \n     conducted experiments to determine whether or not there would \n     be a remainder inside of the equipment that is used for \n     sample analysis on-site.\n       They found out that, indeed, there is residue remaining. \n     And if the equipment were taken off-site, off of the Lawrence \n     Livermore Laboratory site, or off of the site of a \n     biotechnology firm, for example, and further analysis were \n     done on those residues, you would be able to get classified \n     and/or proprietary information.''\n       ``. . . . My bottom line is that the use of treaty \n     inspections for espionage is easy, effective, and all but \n     impossible to detect . . . Hypothetically, an inspector could \n     either be an intelligence official assigned to be an \n     inspector or could later sell information to a company or \n     country abroad that reveals either classified or CBI, \n     confidential business information, that they might have \n     gleaned through the process of gathering samples and \n     analyzing them.''\n       Ralph S. Cunninghan, President and CEO of Citgo Petroleum \n     Corporation: ``CITGO believes that the requisite inspections \n     associated with the Treaty will, no doubt, jeopardize \n     confidential business information as well as disrupt normal \n     business operations.\n       We realize that the petroleum industry is not the specific \n     target of this treaty. Nevertheless, it will be affected \n     because of the extensive list of chemicals covered by the \n     treaty.''\n       William Arbitman, Associate General Counsel for the Dial \n     Corp: ``We are not prepared to receive a foreign inspection \n     team to our facilities, and we would be greatly concerned \n     that such a visit might compromise our confidential business \n     information.''\n       Kevin Kearns, President of the U.S. Business and Industrial \n     Council: ``On behalf of the 1,000 member companies of the \n     United States Business Industrial Council (USBIC), I strongly \n     urge you to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention (CWC).\n       . . . the CWC effectively authorizes industrial espionage. \n     The CWC offers no protections for company formulas and other \n     trade secrets; they must be handed over if inspected. Nothing \n     would prevent other unscrupulous countries such as France and \n     China from placing intelligence officers on the inspection \n     team.''\n       Larry Postelwait, President of the Crosby Group, Inc.: ``I \n     have several concerns regarding the access of our facilities \n     to a foreign inspection team. The treaty, as written, gives \n     them too much authority considering they could interfere with \n     our operations and affect production. It also makes us \n     vulnerable to our global competitors since they could benefit \n     from interfering with our production and from gaining close \n     insight into our operations.''\n       David M. Craig, Manager of Environmental and Safety \n     Compliance for the Detrex Corporation: ``Although reverse \n     engineering of a product (the process of determining the \n     products' composition or molecular structure) may be \n     possible, many companies enjoy a competitive advantage in a \n     market due to the manufacturing process used. Process ``trade \n     secrets'' may include items as simple as: the type of \n     equipment used, manufacturing parameters, or even who \n     supplies a particular raw material. Allowing inspectors full \n     access to a company's manufacturing site and records could \n     have a large impact on a company's ability to compete in \n     domestic and international trade.''\n       Tracy Hesp, Assistant to the Director of Regulatory Affairs \n     for Farnam Industries: ``First, the short-notice challenge \n     inspections that can be initiated by foreign states would be \n     a burden physically and financially. We have confidential \n     information concerning formulations and manufacturing \n     procedures that we need to protect.''\n       Lesa McDonald, Environmental/Safety Manager for the Gemini \n     Company: ``. . .\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\n     hosting such an inspection would be a serious hindrance to \n     our business. It would be very difficult to safeguard \n     confidential business information during such an inspection.\n       We have serious reservations about the ability of more \n     legislation and further regulation of U.S. industry to solve \n     the chemical weapons problem. Further, since the countries of \n     Libya, Iraq, Syria and North Korea refuse to sign this \n     treaty, how will further reporting requirements, and \n     inspection of businesses such as ours prohibit the \n     development of chemical weapons?''\n       John Hobbs, Safety Coordinator for Crafco, Inc.: ``The \n     potential for abuse, specifically the theft of trade secrets \n     both formulations and process oriented is significant. \n     Unannounced inspections are also costly in terms of \n     production disruption. A second concern would be that the \n     apparent goals of this treaty are enforceable in the United \n     States under already existing statutes. Industry sponsored \n     terrorism in the form of chemical weapons manufacture is \n     controllable without external intervention. Finally, without \n     the assent of the states sponsoring terrorism this treaty \n     really amounts to the good guys policing the good guys and \n     picking up whatever they can in the process.''\n       J. Doug Pruitt, President of the Sundt Corporation: ``Based \n     upon the depth of inspection, e.g. interviews with corporate \n     personnel, employees, vendors, subcontractors; review of \n     drawings, purchase orders, subcontracts; inspection and \n     review of internal and external correspondence; we feel that \n     it could be difficult to safeguard confidential business \n     information during this inspection. This has to do not only \n     with our internal corporate information but we would be \n     concerned about information that we have signed a \n     confidentiality agreement with our partners and/or \n     customers.''\n\n\n   u.s. companies are extremely worried about the cwc--a massive new \n                            paperwork burden\n\n       S. Reed Morian, CEO of Dixie Chemical Company, Inc. (a CMA-\n     member company): ``We would incur a significant increase in \n     data reporting under the CWC. . . . I'm certain we could not \n     comply with the CWC under our current budget. The CWC would \n     probably require an increase in headcount at our plant. . . . \n     It would be of little benefit for the U.S. to rigorously \n     participate in the CWC, if ALL the nations of the world don't \n     also participate.\n       Thank you again for allowing us this opportunity to comment \n     on a treaty ratification that could impact us so greatly.''\n       Robert Roten, the President and CEO of Sterling Chemicals \n     (a CMA-member company): ``We are very concerned about control \n     and cooperation of other countries (Mexico, Colombia, North \n     Korea, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Croatia, etc.). Since they \n     probably will not cooperate, how does this treaty assure a \n     ``worldwide ban?'' . . . We are familiar with the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention and we understand our responsibilities \n     (and liabilities) should this treaty become U.S. law. . . . \n     We cannot comply within our current annual budget and \n     personnel constraints. Our best estimates is that this treaty \n     will cost Sterling a minimum of $100,000 per year and should \n     an inspection occur at least another $200,000-$300,000 will \n     possibly be required.''\n       Raymond Keating, Chief Economist for the Small Business \n     Survival Committee: ``Of course, smaller businesses will be \n     hit hardest by these increased regulatory costs. \n     Interestingly, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) \n     supports ratification of the CWC and told the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee that the new regulations would not be a \n     burden. But the CMA is a group of generally large chemical \n     manufacturers, and reportedly more than 60 percent of the \n     facilities likely affected by the CWC are not CMA members.\n       Large companies possess far greater resources and have \n     accrued significant experience in dealing with regulators of \n     all kinds. In fact, new regulatory burdens can perversely \n     give large firms a competitive edge over smaller companies \n     due to these resource and experience factors. As economist \n     Thomas Hopkins has shown, the per-employee cost of federal \n     regulation runs almost 50 percent higher for firms with fewer \n     than 500 employees versus companies with more than 500 \n     employees.''\n       Marvin Gallisdorfer, President of Lomac, Inc.: ``It is not \n     possible to estimate the amount of time that it will take to \n     fill out the various CWC forms, but I can assure you that the \n     total time will far exceed the 2-10 hour estimate found in \n     Section 1.A. [of the Draft Department of Commerce \n     Regulations.]. The instructions alone will require a \n     substantial commitment of time. After the data is gathered, \n     it must be checked thoroughly to assure accuracy, because an \n     honest mistake can (and most assuredly will in some cases) \n     lead to a $50,000 fine. Even if, however, we estimate a 20-\n     hour commitment per form, where can we find the 20 hours? Our \n     staff is already employed full-time filling out a host of \n     forms and applications for the Michigan Department of \n     Environmental Quality, the U.S. EPA, and other government \n     agencies. I have enclosed, for your information, copies of \n     the reports that we are required to file annually. As you can \n     see, this is quite a bit of paperwork--and we are a \n     relatively small (150-200 employees) company.\n       * * * I truly believe that this CWC will cost American jobs \n     without any benefit. The United States can be trusted to \n     refrain from making chemical weapons, but I cannot believe \n     that certain other countries will abide by the treaty. \n     Because of the adverse impact on Michigan's chemical industry \n     (with little or no off-setting benefit) I urge you to vote \n     against ratification of the treaty.''\n       Edward Noble, Senior Corporate Environmental Specialist for \n     ISK Biosciences Corporation: ``In general, we believe that \n     banning chemical weapons is a laudable goal. Since those \n     countries most likely to instigate the use of chemical \n     weapons are not among the signatories of the CWC, it would \n     seem that this convention creates a lot of paper and does \n     very little to gain the goal of eliminating chemical \n     weapons.''\n       Paul Eisman, Vice President of Ultraform-Diamond Shamrock: \n     ``* * * our costs have increased by an estimated $1 million \n     per year over the last couple of years just to meet new \n     regulatory paperwork demands. We are incurring these costs, \n     but should assume that our customers are paying for these in \n     the long run * * *. We cannot comply with the requirements of \n     this treaty with our current staff and resources. We estimate \n     additional costs of $250,000 annually to comply.''\n       Jim Moon, President of Moon Chemical Products, Inc.: ``The \n     reporting requirements in this treaty are a burden for any \n     company not involved in weapons * * * We are manufacturers of \n     industrial, institutional, and agricultural products. Several \n     years ago we had to hire an outside consultant to make sure \n     we meet government regulations for our business, our \n     employees, and our customers. Please do not add another \n     burden to our industry.''\n       Nick Carter, President of South Hampton Refining Company: \n     ``No, we could not comply with this treaty within our current \n     annual budget and personnel. The reason we are in business as \n     a small refiner is that we change the operation quickly and \n     often to meet the market. The reporting alone would require \n     additional personnel, much less the cost of potential \n     inspection, interpreting the regulations, etc. We currently \n     have 10% of our work force assigned to nothing but regulatory \n     functions, mostly environmental. At some point these non-\n     profit producing efforts will outweigh the value of keeping \n     the business operating.\n       * * * There are months where the cost of compliance with \n     this treaty would completely eliminate the profit for the \n     month. You can explain to our employees how this is more \n     important to the nation than them getting a paycheck, or \n     having health coverage, or having a retirement plan, or \n     having a profit sharing check.''\n       John Hohnholt, Vice-President of Valero Refining Company: \n     ``Valero is an independent refinery with limited staff \n     resources which are already overwhelmed with regulatory \n     compliance record keeping and reporting. This additional \n     burden on our staff appears excessive and probably unintended \n     for our industry.''\n       Odus Hennessee, President and COO for Cosmetic Specialty \n     Labs: ``The ultimate result is to simply add unnecessary \n     costs to the production of our products making it difficult \n     if not impossible to sell our products in our own market, \n     much less to compete in the international marketplace.''\n\n\n                       the theft of trade secrets\n\n       Don Fuqua, President of the Aerospace Industries \n     Association: ``We are very concerned, however, that the \n     application of the Convention's reporting and inspection \n     regime to AIA member companies could unnecessarily jeopardize \n     our nation's ability to protect its national security \n     information and proprietary technological data.''\n       Rear Admiral Jim Carey, Chairman of 21st Century Coatings: \n     ``This communication is to urge you in the strongest possible \n     terms to oppose the Chemical Weapons Convention on the \n     grounds that it will cost my company an outrageous amount of \n     money and subject us to intrusive international inspections \n     that we can ill afford. We make paint under trade-secret \n     technology that with one coat can stop all rust and corrosion \n     for 50 years. We have spent the last 6 months researching \n     construction of a new plant in Texas. The CWC will bring that \n     effort to a screeching halt and instead we will look \n     offshore. The CWC will not stop the world chemical weapons \n     threat; it will only put people like us out of business.''\n       Eduardo Beruff, President of SICPA Industries of America, \n     Inc.: ``For the reasons outlined below, we at SICPA \n     Industries of America, Inc. (``SICPA'') respectfully urge you \n     to reject this treaty.\n       . . . SICPA Industries of America, Inc. is the foremost \n     manufacturer of security inks used in printing U.S. currency, \n     and is a leader in developing new security ink technologies \n     to protect the nation's valuable documents and proprietary \n     products. . . . The proposed Chemical Weapons Convention \n     would impose new financial burdens on SICPA and similar \n     companies in order to attain and maintain compliance. More \n     importantly, it could jeopardize the security of SICPA's \n     invaluable trade secret information.''\n       S. Reed Morian, CEO of Dixie Chemical Company, Inc. (a CMA-\n     member company): ``While the intent of the CWC is of the \n     highest merit, the regulations appear to be very onerous \n     requiring increased reporting and record keeping, foreign \n     inspection of our facilities, and a significant challenge to \n     our ability to maintain Confidential Business Information \n     (CBI) . . . We are not prepared to have a foreign inspection \n     team in our plant. I doubt that CBI could be safeguarded \n     during such an inspection.''\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\n       Ralph Johnson, Vice President of Environmental Affairs of \n     Dixie Chemical Company: ``. . . If we use EPA inspections as \n     an example, these foreign Chemical Weapon Convention \n     inspections could cost up to maybe $50,000 per site. . . . \n     These inspections would be very costly and burdensome. The \n     biggest problem with these inspections, however, is . . . our \n     highly probable loss of confidential business information. An \n     inspector observing one of our reactors would know, for the \n     product being observed, our operating pressures, \n     temperatures, catalysts, reaction time, ingredients, \n     purification methods, pollution abatement methods. We would \n     no longer have any confidential technology, methodology, or \n     know-how relative to this product. It would be gone \n     forever.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that an \neditorial from the Wall Street Journal that I think speaks very openly \nto the concerns that many in the chemical industry have as it relates \nto what they would be required to do, which is open their doors wide \nand embrace an international inspection team, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                          Here Come the Spies\n\n       We've already made the case for why the Senate should \n     reject the Chemical Weapons Convention. The last thing the \n     world needs is another unverifiable arms control treaty. The \n     worst danger here is creating the illusion that we are \n     ridding the world of the threat of chemical weapons. But \n     there's another danger: The treaty would be a bonanza to \n     countries that are in the business of spying on American \n     business.\n       Worst hit would be the defense and aerospace industry--and \n     hence national security--but plenty of other industries would \n     be subject to industrial espionage. There has never been an \n     arms control treaty whose reach would extend so far into \n     ordinary business, both through its reporting requirements \n     and its inspection regime.\n       The CWC covers not just companies that manufacture certain \n     chemicals and discrete organic chemicals, but also those that \n     use them to make something else--such as automobiles, \n     pharmaceuticals, electronics or even liquor. The Arms Control \n     and Disarmament Agency has drawn up a list of more than 1,000 \n     American companies that would be subject to the treaty's \n     terms. Others say at least 6,000 companies would be affected.\n       The Chemical Manufacturers Association has been vocal in \n     pooh-poohing the treaty's reporting and inspection \n     requirements, which may in fact not be much for the CMA's \n     already highly regulated membership of fewer than 200 \n     companies. But companies that make such things as soap or \n     tires or paint are going to find the paperwork alone an \n     expensive new irritant.\n       Far more troublesome, however, is the treaty's proposed \n     inspection regime, to be carried out by a new international \n     bureaucracy in the Hague called the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. A better name might be the \n     Organization for the Promotion of Industrial Espionage.\n       OPCW will conduct both routine inspections and \n     ``challenge'' inspections at the request of member \n     governments. Under the terms of the treaty, it would be next \n     to impossible for the U.S. to halt a frivolous or abusive \n     inspection. A challenge inspection would take place with less \n     than a day's notice, and inspectors would have extraordinary \n     access to files, data, equipment, etc. A company might as \n     well post its trade secrets on the Internet.\n       The challenging country would send along an observer, and \n     even though he wouldn't be permitted beyond a specified \n     perimeter, there's a lot he would be able to learn from that \n     distance. In a mock inspection that the U.S. carried out \n     using the CWC's proposed rules, the ``observer'' was able to \n     steal proprietary information simply by gathering soil and \n     water samples from his spot on the edge of the inspection \n     site.\n       Worse, there are no guarantees that the inspectors \n     themselves won't moonlight as spies. Senator Helms raised \n     this issue during Madeleine Albright's confirmation hearing \n     in January. He pointed to evidence that Chinese applicants \n     for OPCW inspector jobs had been ``directed to volunteer'' \n     and that most had ties to the People's Liberation Army's \n     chemical ``defense'' program. It's not hard to imagine the \n     damage an inspector-spy could do. Reverse engineering is one \n     threat, but even something seemingly as simple as the type of \n     equipment used in a manufacturing process could constitute a \n     trade secret.\n       All this poses a danger to national security. Kathleen \n     Bailey of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory testified to \n     that effect before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \n     last year. She said ``classified information can be obtained \n     from sampling and analysis during, and perhaps after, \n     inspections under the Chemical Weapons Convention. \n     Furthermore, clandestine sampling would be virtually \n     impossible to detect or to prevent.'' In the defense area, \n     stealth technology is particularly at risk; a challenge \n     inspection of a U.S. defense contractor could yield much on \n     that score.\n       So far, the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     hasn't moved beyond Washington to the boardroom. Only a few \n     companies--Dial Soap and Citgo Petroleum among them--have \n     spoken out against the treaty. It's perhaps understandable \n     that most CEOs would assume that a treaty on chemical weapons \n     wouldn't affect them. It does and they'd be wise to pay \n     attention.\n\n\n                            cwc is watching\n\n       From a May 14, 1996 list compiled by the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency of companies that would be subject to the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention: Archer Daniels Midland Co., \n     Armco Steel Co., Castrol, Citgo Petroleum Corp., Colgate-\n     Palmolive Co., Dial Corp., General Motors Corp., Gillette \n     Co., Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Jim Beam Brands Co., Kaiser \n     Aluminum, Lever Brothers Co., Maxwell House Coffee Co., \n     Nutrasweet Co., Pfizer, Quaker Oats Co., Raytheon Co, Safeway \n     Stores; Sherwin Williams Co., Simpson Timber Co., Winn-Dixie \n     Stores, and Xerox Corp.\n       Source: Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my point is simply this. There are \nreasonable people on both sides of this issue who differ and are very \nloud about the concerns they have. The chemical industry is not \nmonolithic at all when it comes to support for this. There are a \nsubstantial number within it who are extremely concerned that they may \nexpose their companies to tremendous economic risk and to the liability \nof the loss of their secrets that relate to the formulas for the \nproduction of peaceful goods and services to our country. I think it is \nimportant that that be said at this time and that the names and quotes \nof these ladies and gentlemen become a part of the Record.\n  I yield back any time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to myself. I ask \nunanimous consent that a statement of the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation be printed in the Record, as well as the list of those \ncompanies supporting this treaty.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Chemical Manufacturers\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, April 18, 1997.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: On April 24, the Senate will vote on \n     whether to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). On \n     behalf of nine organizations representing a broad spectrum of \n     chemical producers, consumers, and professionals, I urge your \n     strong support of this important treaty.\n       Opponents of the CWC contend that the treaty will have a \n     catastrophic impact on American business, including a \n     burdensome regulatory system, intrusive on-site inspections, \n     and losses of proprietary information. The facts, however, \n     bear out our belief that the CWC is the right thing to do:\n       Less than 2,000 facilities nationwide will have any \n     responsibilities under the CWC. Of these, ninety percent will \n     have to do no more than fill out a two-page report once a \n     year.\n       The chemical industry helped develop the procedures by \n     which fewer than 200 facilities will be inspected. We then \n     tested those provisions in a series of full-fledged trial \n     inspections at plant sites. We helped confirm that inspected \n     companies have a role in determining how inspections will be \n     conducted, and the extent to which inspection teams access \n     the facilities.\n       Industry representatives helped write the treaty provisions \n     that safeguard confidential business information. Chemical \n     companies worked closely with the Administration in drafting \n     the CWC implementing legislation that complements those \n     safeguards.\n       The chemical industry has continued its efforts to further \n     narrow the potential impact of the Convention on commercial \n     interests. We successfully advocated a complete exemption for \n     polymer and oligomer producers, which means that the plastics \n     and textile industries are not subject to the Convention. We \n     helped push an exemption for petroleum refineries and \n     explosives manufacturers. We have worked to develop \n     reasonable, low concentration limits that are commercially \n     practicable, yet provide the level of verification necessary \n     to assure that the CWC is not being violated.\n       On April 17, the Senate passed Senator Kyl's legislation, \n     S. 495. Although Senator Kyl's legislation would generally \n     expand the legal basis for domestic action against chemical \n     weapons proliferation, it is important that you know that S. \n     495 is not a substitute for the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       For example, S. 495 provides no mechanism for multilateral \n     agreement to prevent or prohibit the production, storage, \n     development or use of chemical weapons. It provides no means \n     for investigating potential diversions to illegal weapons \n     uses. And it does not remedy the trade impacts that will \n     arise when the CWC's trade ban goes into effect three years \n     from now. CMA estimates that some $500 to $600 million in two \n     way trade will be at risk if this ban goes into effect. \n     Moreover, S. 495 does nothing to prevent trade barriers being \n     imposed by CWC Parties, aimed at U.S. trade in chemicals.\n       The chemical industry is America's largest exporter \n     surpassing agriculture, aerospace,\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\n     computers, etc. It is the world leader in technological \n     development, research and innovation. The industry works hard \n     to maintain that leadership. The industry has maintained a \n     trade surplus for 68 consecutive years. You can be assured \n     that the chemical industry would not be silent if the CWC \n     truly jeopardized commercial interests.\n       For your further information, I have enclosed a copy of an \n     advertisement that appeared in the April 14, 1997 issue of \n     Roll Call. I have also enclosed a copy of a letter signed by \n     members of CMA's Board of Directors, reiterating their \n     support for this important agreement.\n       In short, Senator, we need your vote in favor of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       If you have any questions concerning the chemical \n     industry's support for the CWC, please call me or Claude \n     Boudrias, Legislative Representative for Tax and Trade at \n     (703) 741-5915.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Frederick L. Webber,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   April 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We, the undersigned members of the \n     Chemical Manufacturers Association's Board of Directors, are \n     writing to ask you to support the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     (CWC).\n       We believe the Convention is a fair and effective \n     international response to the international threat of \n     chemical weapons proliferation. Ratifying the CWC is in the \n     national interest.\n       The CWC is a natural extension of existing U.S. policy. In \n     1985, Congress voted to end production of chemical weapons by \n     the military and to begin destroying existing stockpiles.\n       For years, the United States has imposed the world's \n     strongest controls on exports of weapons-making ingredients. \n     Our nation is the standard bearer in preventing the spread of \n     chemical weapons.\n       The CWC requires other nations to do what the United States \n     is already doing. That's why President Reagan proposed the \n     treaty to the United Nations in 1984. It's why President Bush \n     signed the treaty in Paris in 1993. And it's why President \n     Clinton is asking the Senate to ratify it.\n       The chemical industry has thoroughly examined the CWC. We \n     have tested the treaty's record-keeping and inspection \n     provisions. And we have concluded that the benefits of the \n     CWC far outweigh the costs.\n       Ratifying the CWC is the right thing to do. We urge you to \n     vote for the Convention.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frederick L. Webber, President & CEO, Chemical \n           Manufacturers Association; J.

Mr. President, just as my friend from Idaho knows a lot \nabout mining and knows a lot about potatoes and knows a lot about \napples, because they are big issues in his State, I assure you, being a \nSenator from Delaware, if there was any genuine opposition from the \nchemical industry for this treaty, since most of those companies are \nincorporated in my State and it makes up 56 percent of my State's \neconomy, I assure you, I would hear about it.\n  Now, there may be some companies that do not like it, but I want to \ntell you, to use the expression, there may be reasons why for this in \nthe minds of my colleagues, but none of the big boys, none of the \noutfits that do this as a big business, none of the outfits with \nmultibillion-dollar operations, none of them, that I am aware of, are \nopposed to this treaty. They strongly support it.\n  I yield 7 minutes to my friend from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair, and I ask the Chair to please notify me \nwhen I have used 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention with its 28 agreed \nconditions.\n  So far in this century, we have witnessed the use of chemical weapons \nin Europe, in China and in the Middle East, and we have seen the \nabsolutely revolting photographs of victims of chemical weapons attacks \nat the Iraqi village of Halabja and the Tokyo subway. Some of us may \nhave seen the famous photograph of the great violinist, Isaac Stern, \nperforming in Israel while wearing a gas mask during the Iraqi \noccupation of Kuwait. Let there be no doubt about it, these weapons do \npresent a clear and present danger to our security and the security of \nour allies around the world. They have not acquired the nickname, \n``poor man's nukes'' for nothing. They are cheap to make, easy to \nconceal, and can have devastating effects.\n  Since 1995, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs has held six hearings titled ``Global \nProliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,'' which documented in \nvivid detail the gravity of the threat our country faces from both \nchemical and biological weapons. The three committee prints covering \nthese hearings contain over 2,000 pages of relevant documentation. \nWhile I was chairman of that committee, I chaired personally four \nhearings on ``Global Spread of Chemical and Biological Weapons.'' In \n1989, that produced another 746 pages of documentation on these threats \nand the various choices facing our country by way of responses.\n  Mr. President, today is not the day for additional hand wringing over \nthese nightmares. Today is the day finally to do something truly \nconstructive to alleviate these threats and stop the hand wringing. In \nthis case, constructive means multilateral, since we are dealing here \nwith a truly global threat, not one susceptible to solution by \nunilateral U.S. legislation. For example, bills like S. 495, which \npassed a badly divided Senate last week after virtually no serious \ndebate and without a single hearing, would, if enacted, impose yet \nanother death penalty, while opening up several new loopholes for \ncontinued U.S. possession of both chemical and biological weapons. \nFortunately, we have an alternative approach to consider.\n  Today, we can vote on a resolution providing our advice and consent \nto ratify a treaty that does not just address the problem of halting \nthe proliferation of these weapons, but a treaty that will also set the \nworld on a course finally to eliminate such weapons everywhere. Though \nwe will not obviously achieve these goals overnight simply by ratifying \nthe CWC, we will be taking a crucial step toward achieving that \nultimate goal.\n\n  My argument, simply put, is that we just cannot solve the global \nproblems of the CWC destruction, proliferation,\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nterrorism and warfare by acting alone. The international framework, \nmachinery, reporting procedures, and enforcement and verification \nmechanisms of this treaty will complement and reinforce--not compete \nwith, substitute for or compromise--our own national military, \nintelligence, and diplomatic efforts against the global CW threat.\n  The time has now come to put into place the international legal \nfoundation necessary to eliminate chemical weapons once and for all. I \nam proud to be here on this historical occasion to speak on behalf of \nand to vote in favor of U.S. ratification of this treaty.\n  Mr. President, let me get into some highlights of the CWC. The CWC \nbans the development, the production, stockpiling, use, and \nproliferation of chemical weapons. It requires the destruction of \nexisting weapons, chemical agents, and CW production facilities. It \nbreaks new ground with a system of verification that is the most \nextensive in the history of weapons of mass destruction.\n  On November 23, 1993--over 3 years ago--President Clinton sent this \ntreaty to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. Though \nthe Senate has proceeded very, very slowly with the consideration of \nthis treaty, the rest of the world seems prepared to go forward with or \nwithout us. Over 160 countries have now signed the treaty and 74 have \nalready ratified it. So with or without U.S. ratification, the treaty \nwill enter into force on April 29 of this year. At that point, world \ncommerce in chemicals and chemical equipment will begin to take place \nwithin a multilaterally coordinated system that imposes real costs on \nnonparties to this convention. It is one reason why I support this \ntreaty.\n  There is a widespread consensus among the military, the intelligence \nand the defense experts inside our Government that this treaty will \nserve our national interest. This consensus is bipartisan. Indeed, the \nconvention was negotiated during the Reagan administration, signed by \nPresident George Bush and sent to the Congress by President Clinton.\n  Except with respect to nonparties, this treaty is completely \nnondiscriminatory: It obligates its parties not to develop or to \npossess chemical weapons, period. It does not divide the world up into \none set of countries that may have these weapons and another set that \nmay not. It works from a different premise, one more closely aligned \nwith its cousin, the Biological Weapons Convention--by outlawing such \nweapons among the parties to the treaty, it will significantly \nstrengthen international diplomatic efforts to make the prohibition \ntruly global.\n  To ensure compliance, the treaty provides a verification system that \noperates on two dimensions. First, it provides for routine monitoring \nof potentially sensitive activities at declared chemical weapons sites, \nstorage areas, and relevant civilian chemical industries. Second, it \nprovides for a system of on-site challenge inspections operating on the \nprinciple of managed access to ensure the protection of proprietary \ninformation, constitutional rights, and national security interests. \nThese inspections will be conducted by the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW]. This system of verification has \nbeen worked out not just in consultation with industry, but with the \nstrong and continuing support of industry.\n\n\n                            nothing perfect\n\n  I believe that this system of verification--coupled with the \nincreased transparency of chemical transfers and activities at chemical \nfacilities around the world--will, when backed by robust national \nintelligence capabilities, build a level of confidence in the world \ncommunity sufficient to ensure that the treaty is being observed by its \nparties.\n\n\n      even if imperfect--better than present with no restrictions\n\n  This view is shared today by our military and intelligence officials. \nOn June 23, 1994, Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, summarized this judgment quite clearly when he \ntestified that--``From a military perspective, the Chemical Weapons \nConvention is clearly in our national interest.'' On August 11, 1994, \nhe specifically testified that--``Because of the regime of \ndeclarations, which then can be verified through routine inspection and \nchallenge inspection, I believe that the CWC can be effectively \nverified.'' The treaty has also been supported by former generals Colin \nPowell and Norman Schwarzkopf, among many other top military and \nintelligence officials. It has the full support of the Joint Chiefs.\n  the verification system, in short, represents an appropriate balance \nbetween the need for intrusiveness and the need to protect commercial \nsecrets and national security information. As a whole, the treaty will \nserve U.S. national interests in a number of ways. It will reduce the \nrisk that chemical weapons will be used against our country. It will \npotentially reduce--but of course not eliminate entirely--the risk of \nterrorism involving chemical weapons. It will enhance the transparency \nof activities at chemical facilities around the world and thereby build \nconfidence in CW disarmament. It will serve U.S. interests in combating \nthe proliferation of chemical weapons. And it will, after the 10-year \nprocess of destroying existing CW stockpiles, remove many serious \nenvironmental hazards that faced citizens who live near plants that \nproduced or stored chemical weapon agents.\n\n\n                           common criticisms\n\n  It is not surprising that any great achievement in the realm of \ndisarmament would encounter criticism. I am not going to claim that \neach and every one of these criticisms is totally unfounded. I am also \nnot going to question the motives of those who make such criticisms. I \nbelieve it is good to hear the views of such critics, to listen \ncarefully to their interpretations of the flaws of this treaty, to \ndebate points on which there is disagreement, and to come to a decision \non what is in the long-term interest of our country. This is what the \nwhole ratification process is all about. Though no treaty is perfect \nand the CWC is no exception to this rule, by my reckoning the flaws in \nthis treaty are not sufficient grounds for the Senate not to proceed \nwith ratification.\n  I would now like to discuss briefly some of the main criticisms of \nthe treaty that I have encountered over the many years this treaty has \nbeen awaiting a vote in the Senate.\n  No. 1. Lack of universality. It is true, not ever country is a party \nto this treaty, nor is universal membership even a likelihood anytime \nsoon. It may never be a universal agreement. There are several Arab \ncountries, for example, that will no doubt refuse to enter into binding \nCW disarmament agreements until an agreement can also be reached \nconcerning Israel's nuclear capability. Is this a sufficient cause to \nvote against the treaty? Absolutely not.\n  I know of no multilateral disarmament agreement that is truly \nuniversal, if that term is defined to mean that all countries on Earth \nare parties. True, the more countries that join the better. But opting \nfor isolation hardly seems to me to be a rational way for a country to \npursue the goal of universality. I cannot imagine anything that would \nset back the goal of universality of this treaty more than a decision \nby the Senate of the United States not to vote for ratification of this \ntreaty, or to approve it with killer amendments. I believe this treaty \nwill stand the test of time and will approach universality of \nmembership as confidence grows in its credibility as a force for \ninternational peace and security. It will be a challenge for diplomats \nand national leaders of the 21st century to induce the hold-out \ncountries into the CWC regime.\n\n  As for the treaty hold-outs specifically in the Middle East--\nincluding Iraq, Libya, and some other Arab states that critics cite as \na reason why the United States should not join this treaty--let us \nremember that no country has a bigger stake in putting a halt to \nchemical weapon proliferation in that turbulent region than does \nIsrael. And I think it is instructive that Israel has considered and \nchosen to ignore this particular criticism--it has signed the treaty.\n  No. 2. Verification problems. Now nobody questions that verifying a \nglobal ban on possessing or manufacturing chemical weapons will be a \ndifficult undertaking, maybe even an impossible one, if the test of \nsuccess is the ability to detect the secret manufacture of a small \nnumber of such weapons. Nobody doubts the widespread availability of \nthe dual-use materials and know-how needed to make and to deliver \nchemical weapons. Nobody doubts that such\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nweapons can be manufactured in very small facilities, some even as \nsmall as some hearing rooms here in the Senate, as our intelligence \nofficials have openly testified.\n  In light of these basic facts of life about chemical weapons, the \nReport of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the ``U.S. \nCapability to Monitor Compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention'' \n(Rpt. 103-390) identified several potential difficulties in verifying \nthis treaty. The committee's report, however, reads not as an \nindictment of the treaty, but as a convincing reminder of the need for \nAmerica to maintain and upgrade its intelligence capabilities to \ngrapple with such problems. I am concerned that some of my colleagues \nand outside commentators have looked at these challenges and simply \nconcluded that it is impossible to verify this, or indeed any, CW \ndisarmament treaty.\n  Though the treaty offers no absolute guarantee against cheating at \nthe level of relatively small-scale violations--it will leave us far \nmore secure than we would be without such a treaty. First, the \nreporting and inspection provisions of the treaty will enhance the \ntransparency of global flows of chemicals and chemical production \nequipment--it will also give us better information about how such \nchemicals are used after they leave international commerce. Second, the \nchallenge inspection system will give the United States a new means to \ncheck up on suspicious activities inside countries, including \nactivities that may not even involve chemicals or chemical equipment \nthat entered international commerce.\n  In short, we stand a much better chance of detecting, assessing, and \nmobilizing collective international action against potential CW-related \nactivities by having a multilateral system of CW disarmament, than we \nwould under the ``go-it-alone'' approach we would be left with as a \nnon-party to this treaty.\n  I think Maj. Gen. John Landry--testifying before the Armed Services \nCommittee as the National Intelligence Officer for General Purpose \nForces--accurately summarized the view of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity when he said on August 11, 1994, that ``we are better off \nwith the treaty than without it.'' Former Defense Secretary Perry \nsimilarly observed on March 28, 1996, that despite the inherent \ndifficulties of detecting illicit production of small quantities of \nchemical weapons, ``we also recognize that that [detection capability] \nwould be even more difficult without a CWC.''\n  Let us keep in mind that when it comes to verifying international \ncompliance with arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation \ntreaties, America does not rely exclusively upon the verification \nmechanisms in those treaties to judge compliance. Verification is \nachieved by these mechanisms operating alongside our own national \nintelligence capabilities. As I stated in my additional views to the \nSSCI's report on the CWC, the difficulties of monitoring this treaty \nunderscore the importance of maintaining a highly capable U.S. \nintelligence community. If we work hard toward the goal of universal \nmembership in the CWC and maintain or increase the capabilities of our \nintelligence community, then the lingering questions about compliance \nand verification would only fade accordingly. I would not be at all \nsurprised if Russia were to ratify this treaty very soon.\n\n  It is useful to recall that the Russian scientist who blew the \nwhistle in 1991 and 1992 on illicit Russian chemical weapons activities \nis now a firm supporter of the CWC as a means to combat just such \nactivities. On November 1, 1995, Dr. Vil Mirzayanov testified as \nfollows before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about the \nrisk of theft of chemical agents in Russia:\n\n       I am sure that the system of international inspections \n     provided for under the Chemical Weapons Convention will help \n     address this problem . . . These are very strong tools and I \n     hope that you will do your part to see that they are applied \n     in Russia by pressing for the Senate's ratification of the \n     Convention.\n\n  The fact that this statement came from someone who is one of Russia's \ntoughest critics on chemical weapons issues will, I hope, inspire other \ntreaty critics to reexamine their own views.\n  No, this is not the time to badger the CWC's verification system \nbecause it is unable to guarantee perfect international compliance. I \nwish we had some domestic criminal laws that would guarantee perfect \ncompliance. Today is a day to rejoice that the CWC's verification \nsystem will soon be generating information that will be useful to our \nnational leaders in detecting, characterizing, and defending against \nchemical weapons threats. When I hear all these criticisms about the \ntreaty's verification system, I can only wonder--if these arguments are \ntrue, then why would Israel, which is located in one of the most \ndangerous neighborhoods on Earth, and which has so much at stake, sign \nsuch a treaty?\n  The answer is that the CWC serves Israel's national security \ninterests for precisely the same reason it serves our own national \nsecurity interests. It deserves the support of all nations, and the \nmore support it has, the better the verification system will become. \nRemaining outside the CWC is no way to improve its verification system.\n  No. 3. Cost. Now with respect to cost, nobody can possibly predict \nexactly what it will cost to implement this treaty. The International \nAtomic Energy Agency's annual budget of about $200 million does not \nserve as a useful indicator of the cost of implementing the CWC given \nthe many different functions of the respective treaty organizations, \nthe IAEA and the OPCW. For fiscal year 1998, the administration has \nrequested $25 million for meeting our CWC assessment and an additional \n$21 million for multilateral verification at U.S. facilities should \nthat be necessary. This annual financial contribution approximates the \ncost of a couple of F-16 aircraft.\n  The Chemical Manufacturers Association [CMA] has estimated that the \ncost to industry of complying with this treaty is about ``. . . one-\nonehundredth of one percent of the cost of environmental reporting in \nthe United States.'' CMA estimates that industry's total CWC reporting \ncosts for 1997 would come to less than $250,000 and will decline in \nsubsequent years. CMA has also estimated, however, that the cost to \nindustry of America not ratifying this treaty would be ``hundreds of \nmillions of dollars'' and thousands of jobs.\n  As for the claim by some critics that the treaty will place a heavy \nregulatory burden on industry, CMA reports that in a recent field test \nit took less than 2 hours for producers of the broadcast category of \nmaterials--discrete organic chemicals--to fill out the appropriate \nreporting form. Some plant managers have estimated that they could \ncomplete this form in as little as 15 minutes. In recent field tests \ninvolving materials that are more tightly controlled, it took companies \nbetween 2-8 hours to complete the relevant paperwork. This does not \nseem to me to be an unduly burdensome procedure.\n  We all know that the costs of destroying CW agent material will of \ncourse be considerable, particularly in countries like the United \nStates and Russia which have tens of thousands of tons of this \nmaterial. But U.S. law already requires us to destroy these materials, \nwhether or not we join the CWC.\n  The costs of having to defend against the use of such weapons--costs \nwe have to pay regardless of whether America is a party to the CWC--\nwill remain considerable, though this expense will decline as the \nworld's stockpiles of CW materials gradually diminish in accordance \nwith the treaty. The treaty, it should be noted, does not outlaw \nnational defenses against chemical weapons nor does it ban military \nretaliation for CW users.\n\n  When it comes to measuring the true costs of this treaty, there is an \nabsolute way and a relative way to measure these costs. The absolute \napproach merely adds up the costs of implementing the treaty and \nconsiders such costs in a vacuum. The relative approach compares these \ncosts against various alternatives, such as costs we would have to pay \nin a world in which chemical war remains a clear and present danger, or \na world with a CWC without the United States as a party.\n  I think that any fair assessment would need to compare the costs of \nimplementing the CWC against the costs of chemical war--preparing for \none, fighting one, defending against one, deterring one, and \nrecuperating from one. Now there is no way that the absolute costs of \nimplementing this treaty would ever outweigh the devastating\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\ncosts of coping in a world armed to the teeth with chemical weapons. I \njust do not accept the argument that the costs of implementing this \ntreaty are greater than the benefits to our national security from \nmembership.\n  No. 4. Sovereignty and secrecy. Under the Constitution, the CWC will \nbe a supreme law of the land. Ironically, some of the same critics of \nthe CWC who argue that the treaty is not verifiable because it is not \nintrusive enough, also argue that the treaty is too intrusive insofar \nas it allegedly jeopardizes the U.S. constitutional rights. These \nquestions have already been examined closely by the Congress, as well \nthey should, and most Members would agree that these arguments have \nbeen overdrawn.\n  The main problem with this criticism is that it ignores the many \nsafeguards that exist in the treaty to protect sovereign rights. First \nand most fundamentally, there is the right of withdrawal from the \ntreaty on 90-days' notice. Second, the treaty's inspection system is \nfar from a ``no-notice'' system--it prescribes a series of timetables \nwhich allow a state party time to prepare a site for inspection. The \ninspection itself is limited in time.\n  As the Department of State put it in its letter transmitting the \ntreaty to the President, ``The inspected State Party has the final say \nin determining the extent and nature of access within the challenged \nsite.'' That is from the letter of November 20, 1993. This gets at the \nwhole notion of ``managed access,'' which lies at the heart of the CWC \ninspections system. Under this approach, the State Department letter \ncontinued, ``the inspected State Party may give only individual \ninspectors access to certain parts of the inspection site, may shroud \nsensitive pieces of equipment, such as computer or electronic systems, \nand it may restrict sampling and sample analysis.'' Indeed, it is \nhighly improbable that the U.S. chemical industry would have been such \nstrong and chronic supporters of the CWC if this industry had concluded \nthat the treaty would harm the competitiveness of U.S. industry or \njeopardize company secrets.\n  Aside from industry, I can imagine that the scientific community \nshould be quite well informed about the merits of this treaty, \nespecially its alleged intrusiveness. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed at the end of my remarks a list of 151 members \nof the National Academy of Scientists who are chemists or biochemists \nand who support this treaty, and another list, compiled by the \nFederation of American Scientists, of 45 Nobel laureates who also \nendorse this treaty. No doubt about it, American support for this \ntreaty is both broad and deep.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, No. 5. Other Criticisms. These are not the \nonly lines of attack that critics have taken against the treaty in \nrecent years.\n  First, would the CWC require a new strategic nuclear doctrine that \nactually encourages the use of tactical nuclear weapons, given the \nunavailability of a CW alternative? Not very likely, given that our \nmilitary has unparalleled conventional military options that are \navailable to respond to and to deter any CW attack. In this respect, \ncritics who urge the retention of a CW arsenal underestimate the power \nof our conventional military capabilities and overestimate both the \nvalue and likelihood of the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Typically, \nsuch critics also tend to ignore the impact of making such nuclear \nthreats upon our global nuclear nonproliferation policy.\n  Second, it is true that the parties to the CWC are nation states, \nnot nonstate entities such as terrorist groups that may seek to acquire \nsuch weapons. Though the treaty offers no guarantee against CW \nterrorism, the treaty's transparency provisions will at least operate \nto make it more difficult for terrorists to acquire equipment or \nmaterials for use in making such weapons and that in itself is a \npositive feature of the treaty. In particular, it will make it much \nmore difficult for terrorists to engage in large-scale production of \nchemical weapons without detection. Since the CWC has never been \nintended to serve as a substitute for national efforts against sub-\nnational terrorism, I find this whole argument that the treaty is weak \non terrorism to be a red herring.\n\n  I find it quite interesting that Japan--which was the victim of a \nrecent chemical weapons attack by terrorists--has already ratified the \nCWC. In fact, Japan's Diet ratified the CWC within a month of the Sarin \ngas attack in the Tokyo subway. Though the treaty may not have been \nable to guarantee that this specific attack would not occur, Japan's \nleaders have obviously concluded that their country would still be \nbetter off with this treaty than without it. So would our country.\n  Third, critics have argued that the treaty lacks teeth. In fact, the \nCWC does not repeal the fundamental principle of national sovereignty \nthat has dominated world affairs for over 300 years. The treaty does \nnot intend for the OPCW to perform as a police force in a world state. \nThough the treaty provides procedures for mobilizing international \naction against treaty violators, sanctions must still be implemented by \nindividual state parties to the treaty.\n  Nonparties to the treaty, however, will feel the teeth of this \ntreaty. They will have a harder time participating in the world market \nfor chemicals and chemical equipment. The few remaining CW states will \nin time feel the inevitable political pressures that come with the \npossession of internationally outlawed weaponry. And as the taboo on \npossession settles in the world community, so will the likelihood of \nstrong international action against countries that would actually use \nsuch weapons. Sanctions against all forms of proliferation could always \nbe strengthened, and I would certainly hope that this would be a high \npriority national security goal of this and future administrations. But \nthe lack of mandatory sanctions in this treaty should not be confused \nwith any lack of teeth--it will fall to the national diplomats, the \nleaders, and ultimately the people of the states that are CWC parties \nto sharpen this treaty's teeth. Though teething pains can be expected \nin the years ahead, sharper teeth will come.\n  Fourth, and most recently, critics have pointed to trade and \ncooperation provisions in the treaty as evidence of an alleged \nobligation to provide chemicals and chemical equipment that will help \ntreaty cheaters to make chemical weapons. Frankly, this argument is \nhogwash. The very first article of this treaty obligates its parties \n``* * * never under any circumstances * * * to assist, encourage or \ninduce, in any way, anyone'' to acquire chemical weapons. Given this \nobligation--and given the treaty's inspection system and national \nintelligence capabilities to back it up--the only appropriate response \nto the accusation that the treaty will encourage peaceful trade and \nscientific exchanges is, so what?\n  The administration has been more than reasonable in accommodating the \nconcerns of the critics. The fact that agreement was reached on 28 \nconditions hardly suggests a posture of stonewalling by anybody. But I \ncannot support any of the five additional conditions that have been \noffered concerning Russian chemical weapons activities, requiring \nterrorist states to join the CWC before we do, asserting a unilateral \nU.S. right to bar certain inspectors from certain countries, \nrequiring the United States to seek the renegotiation of key provisions \nof the treaty on certain trade and CW defense issues, and adopting a \nverification standard based on a concept of military significance that \nis both inappropriate and unworkable. To the limited extent that these \nfinal conditions touch upon legitimate concerns, let us address these \nconcerns inside the tent of the CWC, not by howling in the wilderness \noutside that tent.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on a personal \nnote. I have come a long way when it comes to the issue of CW \ndisarmament. On May 21, 1985, I joined with three of my Senate \ncolleague to argue in an Op-Ed in the Washington Post in favor of \nmodernizing America's chemical weapons arsenal. At the time, there was \nscant prospect of a Chemical Weapons Convention. The Soviet Union was \nsitting on a huge CW arsenal and was threatening United States \ninterests around the world. And our old so-called unitary chemical \nweapons were at best a national embarrassment, at worst an\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nactual danger to American citizens and our own troops. I favored the \nsafer binary weapons--safer for our own troops if they ever had to use \nthem.\n  But times have changed. The Soviet Union has ceased to exist and \nthere is significant support inside the Russian Government to follow \nthrough with Russia's obligations under the CWC, support which America \nhas every reason to encourage in any way it can. Yes, there still are \ncountries in the world today that have chemical weapons. There still is \na terrorist threat involving such weapons. There is still a CW \nproliferation threat. Russia, though it will hardly be alone in this \nrespect, will no doubt still seek to compete with us in many arenas of \nworld affairs. And many of those old unitaries are still sitting around \nlike rusting relics of a by-gone age.\n  Yet the world today is closer than ever to outlawing one of the most \ndangerous weapons that mankind has every devised. As a U.S. Senator for \nover 20 years now, I have at times encountered some of my colleagues \nwho were simply unprepared to reconsider policy positions that they \ntook in considerably different times and circumstances. I am determined \nnot to follow that practice.\n  Mr. GLENN. In partial answer to Senator Kyl's comments on export \ncontrols, I ask unanimous consent that this release by the Australia \nGroup, which deals with export controls, be printed at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the only other thing I would add is that I \nhave examined this treaty and listened to arguments both pro and con. I \nam convinced the time has finally arrived to move the campaign to \neliminate chemical weapons into high gear. The CWC certainly offers no \npanacea to all risks concerning their proliferation or use of chemical \nweapons. It does, however, represent a substantial step along the way \nto alleviating these risks and, therefore, deserves the full support of \nthe Senate and the people of the United States. I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote for ratification.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                February 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     487 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We, the undersigned scientists, urge you \n     to work as a matter of national urgency to bring the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention to a vote in the Senate before April 29 of \n     this year. That is the date when the Convention will \n     automatically enter into force, with or without the United \n     States.\n       Negotiated by the administrations of Presidents Reagan and \n     Bush, and signed by the United States under President Bush in \n     January 1993, the Convention was formally submitted to the \n     Senate for its advice and consent to ratification by \n     President Clinton in November 1993. Since then it has been \n     the subject of thirteen hearings before the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Committee on Armed Services and the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence. The Secretaries of State \n     and Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director \n     of Central Intelligence and the representatives of the \n     Chemical Manufacturers Association have all testified \n     strongly in favor of ratification. More than 65 countries, \n     including all of our major allies, have ratified.\n       If the Senate fails even to vote on the CWC, after three \n     administrations have been its leading architects and \n     proponents, the United States will have surrendered by \n     default its essential leadership in combating the \n     proliferation of chemical weapons.\n           Respectfully,\n       Julius Adler.\n       Robert A.

Support for\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\n     the letter's goal of prompt ratification came from 45 Nobel \n     prize winners who specifically confirmed their desire for CWC \n     ratification.\n       The letter, signed by FAS Chairman, and former Deputy \n     National Security Adviser to the President, Carl Kaysen, \n     reminds Senators of the importance of U.S. ratification. The \n     treaty requires ``total elimination of chemical weapons \n     stocks, prohibits chemical weapons-related activities, bans \n     assistance for such activities, and bars trade with non-\n     parties in certain relevant chemicals.''\n       In ratifying the treaty, the U.S. would join 70 countries--\n     including all major NATO allies and all other G-7 members--\n     who have already ratified it.\n       The Federation of American Scientists is a national \n     organization of scientists and engineers concerned with \n     issues of science and global security.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            Federation of American Scientists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) \n     will enter into force on April 29, 1997, following its \n     ratification by the 65th signatory nation in November, 1996. \n     It has not yet been ratified by the United States.\n       This treaty bans an entire class of weapons of mass \n     destruction. It is a nonproliferation treaty that requires \n     total elimination of chemical weapons stocks, prohibits \n     chemical weapons-related activities, bans assistance for such \n     activities, and bars trade with non-parties in certain \n     relevant chemicals. This treaty denies us no option we would \n     otherwise wish to exercise, for the United States has already \n     renounced chemical weapons and is in the process of \n     destroying them. The CWC is a critical instrument for \n     universalizing this policy and preventing the further spread \n     of chemical weapons.\n       With no military interest in chemical weapons, the United \n     States can only gain by ratifying the treaty, regardless of \n     its level of verification. US accession is necessary to give \n     the CWC the force of an international norm against the \n     possession of chemical weapons. That norm alone would be \n     powerful, providing a basis for joint action to enforce \n     compliance.\n       But, in addition, the CWC provides new tools for deterring \n     and detecting chemical weapons proliferation. The value of \n     its provisions will grow with time, as the treaty's \n     incentives work to increase the number of adherents. The \n     declaration and inspection requirements will improve our \n     knowledge of possible proliferation activities, whether \n     conducted by nations or terrorists. Access to declared and \n     undeclared sites will make clandestine operations more \n     difficult, risky and expensive; participating states will \n     have the right to demand short-notice inspections of sites in \n     other States Parties. The CWC's provisions constitute the \n     most rigorous verification regime ever negotiated. At the \n     same time, the treaty and the proposed US implementing \n     legislation explicitly protect Constitutional rights and \n     confidential and proprietary information.\n       During negotiation of the treaty, senior officials of the \n     U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Association participated at the \n     side of U.S. Government negotiators, and the chemical \n     industry has consistently and publicly advocated ratification \n     of the CWC. Now, if the treaty comes into force without U.S. \n     ratification, its constraints on the chemical exports of non-\n     parties will penalize the U.S. chemical industry. Should the \n     Senate not ratify the Convention, the U.S. Government would \n     also be excluded from a seat on the CWC's governing body, and \n     from participating in the establishment of operating \n     procedures. At the same time, as signatories we will be \n     obligated to abide by the treaty's prohibitions.\n       Since the treaty was opened for signature in 1993, the \n     United States and 166 other countries have signed it. \n     Further, 67 countries, including all the major NATO allies, \n     have deposited their instruments of ratifications, as have \n     all other G-7 members.\n       In order to draw the attention of the Senate to the \n     importance of this issue, the Federation of American \n     Scientists has secured the specific endorsement of 45 Nobel \n     Prize winners to the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, and records their names below.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                      Carl Kaysen,\n                                                    Chairman, FAS.\n       I urge the U.S. Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention without delay.\n       Signed by: Sidney Altman, Philip W.

In this context, the \n     maintenance of effective export controls will remain an \n     essential practical means of fulfilling obligations under the \n     CWC and the BTWC.\n       All participants at the meeting welcomed the expected entry \n     into force of the CWC, noting that this long-awaited step \n     will be an important, historic moment in international \n     efforts to prohibit chemical weapons. Participants agreed to \n     issue a separate statement on this matter, which is attached.\n       Participants also welcomed the progress of efforts to \n     strengthen the BTWC in the negotiations taking place in the \n     Ad Hoc Group of BTWC States Parties in Geneva. All Australia \n     Group participating countries are also States Parties to this \n     Treaty, and strongly support efforts to develop \n     internationally-agreed procedures for strengthening \n     international confidence in the treaty regime by verifying \n     compliance with BTWC obligations.\n       Experts from participating countries discussed national \n     export licensing systems aimed at preventing inadvertent \n     assistance to the production of CBW. They confirmed that \n     participants administered export controls in a streamlined \n     and effective manner which allows trade and the exchange of \n     technology for peaceful purposes to flourish. They agreed to \n     continue working to focus these national measures efficiently \n     and solely on preventing any contribution to chemical and \n     biological weapons programs. Participants noted that the \n     value of these measures in inhibiting CBW proliferation \n     benefited not only the countries participating in the \n     Australia Group, but the whole international community.\n       Participants also agreed to continue a wide range of \n     contacts, including a further program of briefings for \n     countries not participating in the Paris consultations to \n     further awareness and understanding of national policies in \n     this area. Participants endorsed in this context the \n     importance of regional seminars as valuable means of widening \n     contacts with other countries on these issues. In particular, \n     Romania's plans to host a seminar on CBW export controls for \n     Central and Eastern European countries and the Commonwealth \n     of Independent States in Bucharest on Oct. 21-22 and Japan's \n     plans to host a fourth Asian Export Control Seminar in Tokyo \n     in early 1997 were warmly welcomed by participants. Argentina \n     will also host a regional seminar on non-proliferation \n     matters, in Buenos Aires, in the first week of December 1996. \n     France will organize a seminar for French-speaking countries \n     on the implementation of the CWC. This will take place \n     shortly before entry into force of the Convention.\n       The meeting also discussed relevant aspects of terrorist \n     interest in CBW and agreed that this serious issue requires \n     continuing attention.\n       Participants agreed to hold further consultations in \n     October 1997.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Australia Group Countries Welcome Prospective Entry Into Force of the \n                      Chemical Weapons Convention\n\n       The countries participating in the Australia Group warmly \n     welcomed the expected entry into force of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention (CWC) during a meeting of the Group in \n     Paris in October 1996. They noted that the long awaited \n     commencement of the CWC regime, including the establishment \n     of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, \n     will be an historic watershed in global efforts to abolish \n     chemical weapons for all time. They also noted that all \n     states adhering to the CWC are obliged to ensure their \n     national activities support the goal of a world free of \n     chemical weapons.\n       All of the participating countries reiterated their \n     previous statements underlining their intention to be among \n     the original States Parties to the CWC. They noted that 24 of \n     the 30 countries participating in the Australia Group have \n     already ratified the Convention. Representatives also \n     recalled their previous expressions of support for the CWC, \n     and reaffirmed these commitments. They restated their view \n     that the effective operation and implementation of the CWC \n     offers the best means available to the international \n     community to rid the world of these weapons for all time. \n     They called on all signatories to ratify the CWC as soon as \n     possible, and on the small number of countries which have not \n     signed the Treaty to join the regime and thereby contribute \n     to international efforts to ban these weapons.\n       Representatives at the Australia Group meeting recalled \n     that all of the participating\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\n     countries are taking steps at the national level to ensure \n     that relevant national regulations promote the object and \n     purpose of the CWC and are fully consistent with the \n     Convention's provisions when the CWC enters into force for \n     each of these countries. They noted that the practical \n     experience each country had obtained in operating export \n     licensing systems intended to prevent assistance to chemical \n     weapons programs have been especially valuable in each \n     country's preparations for implementation of key obligations \n     under the CWC. They noted in this context, that these \n     national systems are aimed solely at avoiding assistance for \n     activities which are prohibited under the Convention, while \n     ensuring they do not restrict or impede trade and other \n     exchanges facilitated by the CWC.\n\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, I have received a very fine statement by a \ndistinguished former Member of this body, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, a \ngentleman and Senator whom I admire very much. He is now chairman, by \nthe way, of the Frontiers of Freedom. I ask unanimous consent that his \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Bad Treaties do Make Security Problems Worse\n\n                          (By Malcolm Wallop)\n\n       On Thursday, April 24th, the U.S. Senate will debate and \n     vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. As \n     is the case with many pieces of legislation like the \n     Endangered Species Act and The Comprehensive Antiterrorism \n     Act of 1995, the Chemical Weapons Convention sounds great. \n     Who can be against the Convention except those who like \n     chemical weapons? Dig deep, however, and you will find how \n     bankrupt and harmful the Chemical Weapons Convention can be, \n     if ratified. Ken Adelman, noted arms control expert an \n     proponent of this Convention, admits forthrightly, in a \n     Washington Post op-ed that ``no accord banning all chemical \n     weapons can be verifiable in any real sense. The convention's \n     verification provisions may help somewhat, but not all that \n     much.''\n       This reality virtually assures that the treaty will be \n     violated by many who sign up, as well as having no effect \n     whatsoever on several dangerous chemical weapon states--such \n     as Iraq, Syria, North Korea and Libya--that have said they \n     will not become parties.\n       With this devastating admission, virtually the only \n     argument left for the Chemical Weapons Convention is the \n     proposition, as Adelman puts it, that ``standards and values \n     violated are better than no standards or values at all.'' \n     According to this logic, we will be better off being party to \n     a treaty that cannot and will not reduce the chemical weapons \n     threat because of the civilizing effect such ``international \n     norms'' create.\n       The implication is that the ``international norm'' will \n     somehow enhance our security. In fact, quite the contrary is \n     true--as former Secretaries of Defense James Schlesinger, \n     Donald Rumsfeld and Caspar Weinberger observed in a \n     Washington Post op-ed dated March 5th.\n       That this can happen with even relatively practical \n     ``international norms'' can be seen in one cited by Adelman, \n     himself in a follow-up to the March 5th op-ed--the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty. Even its strongest admires \n     recognize that this treaty has a terrible flaw: Its ``Atoms \n     for Peace'' provision which permits the sharing of nuclear \n     weapons-relevant technology with countries that promise not \n     to apply it to that end. One rogue nation after another has \n     violated this promise, giving rise to a large and growing \n     number of undeclared or incipient nuclear weapon states. \n     Unfortunately, a similar flaw has been built into the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, virtually assuring that this new \n     ``norm'' will produce more proliferation of chemical \n     weaponry, not less.\n       If anything, Mr. Adelman, as a spokesperson for proponents \n     for the treaty; exaggerates the value of unverifiable, \n     unenforced ``international norms'' which validates a central \n     concern expressed by the three Secretaries: Such ``norms'' \n     frequently induce a false sense of security in law-abiding \n     societies.\n       This dangerous placebo effect of defective arms control \n     agreements is especially evident with respect to another \n     ``international norm'' lauded by Mr. Adelman, namely, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention. Adelman contends that this \n     treaty--which he acknowledges lacks ``even a pretense of \n     verifiability''--has, nonetheless, ``served us fairly well.''\n       Regrettably, this Convention has not prevented the spread \n     of biological weapons and related technology to virtually \n     every dangerous country on the planet. The ``international \n     norm'' created by the Biological Weapons Convention has, \n     however, encouraged the United States government to remain \n     woefully unprepared to deal with the threat such weapons \n     pose.\n       This point is dramatically made in the cover story of the \n     March 14-20, 1997 edition of Washington City Paper. This \n     article is entitled ``Margin of Terror--The Government has \n     One Clear Strategy for Responding to a Terrorist Attack on \n     Washington: Pray.''\n       It describes in detail how the United States' systematic \n     failure to ready the resources and emergency personnel--to \n     say nothing of the American people--to contend with the \n     nightmare of weapons of mass destruction in the subways or \n     other public spaces of cities like Washington could easily \n     translate into hundreds, if not many thousands, of \n     casualties.\n       The U.S. military has proven no more immune to the \n     seductive effects of ineffectual ``international norms'' \n     created by unverifiable arms control treaties. Operation \n     Desert Storm illuminated serious shortfalls in the armed \n     services' capability to operate and prevail in combat should \n     chemical and/or biological weapons be used. These shortfalls \n     persist today to varying degrees thanks, in part, to illusion \n     that ``international norms'' will make that sort of combat \n     unlikely.\n       Overstating the value of international accords has one \n     other deleterious effect: It tends to make the United States \n     and other law-abiding states reluctant to respond to \n     violators of such accords. As with President Clinton's \n     successive decisions to grant MFN to China--despite its \n     repeated violations of undertakings concerning human rights \n     and the curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and missile \n     technology, the argument is always made that larger national \n     interests must be taken into account. When the Untied States \n     winds up ignoring violations in the interest of preserving an \n     arms control regime, however, the effect is not only to \n     invite further violations but to undermine the value of the \n     ``international norm'' thus created.\n       Those who believe that arms control can make a measurable \n     contribution to U.S. security and civilized intercourse \n     between states have a special responsibility to avoid \n     debasing the currency of international law. Unverifiable, \n     unenforceable accords do not promote valuable ``international \n     norms'' any more than unverifiable, unenforceable domestic \n     statues like Prohibition lead to a sober and law-abiding \n     society. The difference is that the former threaten to make \n     arms control a sham--an outcome that can translate into \n     incalculable harm to our Nation and its people.\n       (Malcolm Wallop represented Wyoming in the United States \n     Senate from 1976-1995 and is currently chairman of the \n     Frontiers of Freedom Institute, a non-partisan, public policy \n     organization located in Arlington, VA.)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the able Senator from \nNew Hampshire, a great patriot, Bob Smith.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you very much, I say to Senator \nHelms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nfor his tremendous leadership on this matter. He has been steadfast. I \nhave been in a number--several hours and days--of meetings with him as \nhe has tried very hard to get this treaty into a position where it \ncould be acceptable to some of us--to all of us. But in this case, Mr. \nPresident, I have to maintain my opposition to this convention.\n  Contrary to the assertions of its proponents, this treaty will not \nadvance our national interests, and as a Member of the U.S. Senate, I \nmust put the national and sovereignty interests above all others when \nit comes to votes here on the Senate floor. This is a flawed accord \nthat will undermine our security and create a massive, unfunded \nregulatory burden on U.S. companies. And the Senate should reject it.\n  Let me make clear, I do not object to the goal of eliminating \nchemical weapons, although those of us who have taken a position in \nopposition to this treaty will be accused of that, and have been. In \nfact, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have consistently \nsupported funding for our Nation's chemical demilitarization program. \nCertainly, we all support the goal of eliminating chemical weapons.\n  But this treaty will not accomplish that goal. Sometimes we forget \nthat fact as we debate these issues that have a great-sounding name. It \ndoes not even come close. For the benefit of my colleagues, I want to \nhighlight some of the most egregious problems with this treaty.\n  First of all, it is not a global treaty. Its advocates would have you \nbelieve that it is. It is not global. In fact, many nations believed to \nhave active chemical weapons programs, such as Iraq, Libya, North \nKorea, and Syria, have not even signed on to the treaty and they are \nnot bound by any provisions.\n  Additionally, other confirmed or suspected chemical weapons nations, \nsuch as India, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia,\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\nhave signed the treaty but do not seem very likely to ratify it or even \ncomply with it.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand how anyone could possibly \nstand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say this is a global \ntreaty if the most heinous anti-American regimes on the face of the \nEarth are not even a party to it. They are going to be making chemical \nweapons, and nobody can do anything about it. That is like saying we \nhave a global treaty outlawing terrorism, but Iran, North Korea, Syria, \nand Lebanon are not a part of it. Why not have another treaty and \noutlaw terrorism? Well intended; great goal. Why not just pass a treaty \nand we will outlaw it? That will be the end of it.\n  It is absurd, not to mention patently false, to allege that this \nChemical Weapons Convention is a global treaty. Iraq used chemical \nweapons on its own citizens in the last decade--on its own people. How \ncan we have a global treaty banning chemical weapons without Iraq? \nCould somebody please answer that question for me? It is not global. \nAnd we are not banning chemical weapons in Iraq. We are inspecting the \ndevil out of Iraq and we still do not know what they are doing and what \nthey can and cannot do.\n  Mr. President, not only is this treaty not global, it is not \nverifiable according to the U.S. intelligence community, not according \nto Senator Smith, but the U.S. intelligence community.\n  In testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee, former Director \nof Central Intelligence, James Woolsey stated:\n\n       The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an \n     intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have \n     high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, \n     especially on a small scale.\n\n  This is not exactly a ringing endorsement for this treaty, \nparticularly when it is coming from a person who is representing an \nadministration that supports it and that is bringing it here to the \nSenate. Let us be honest, there is no way we are going to be able to \nverify compliance, and everybody on this floor knows it. The \nproponents, as well as the opponents, know that.\n  The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was established \nfollowing the gulf war to oversee the dismantling of Iraq's chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons programs. There have been over 1,000 \ninspectors searching every nook and cranny in Iraq for the past 5 \nyears, yet we continue to uncover new evidence and new revelations \nregarding Iraq's programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  I say to my colleagues on the floor, now that you have seen all these \ninspections, you all feel very comfortable, I am sure. Now you have the \nfull knowledge that Iraq does not have any chemical weapons or any \nbiological weapons or any nuclear weapons. Everybody feels real \ncomfortable with that. We have inspected them, so everybody is certain. \nRight.\n  Iraq is the most heavily monitored and inspected country on Earth. We \nhave more access to Iraq than the chemical weapons treaty will ever \nprovide for any country. If we cannot determine after 5 years just how \nlarge and sophisticated Iraq's chemical weapons program is, how on \nEarth are we going to be able to verify compliance for the dozens and \ndozens of countries supposedly bound by this treaty? The answer is \nsimple. We cannot. We are not going to be able to do it.\n\n  We will move into classified session later on, tomorrow, to more \nfully examine the intelligence community's assessment. I urge my \ncolleagues to come to that session and listen to the facts from our \nintelligence community.\n  Noncompliance is not something to take lightly. Without adherence by \nall parties, no treaty is worth the paper it is written on--never has \nbeen, never will be. But we cannot verify this treaty. We know for a \nfact that some of its signatories have routinely and repeatedly \nviolated other treaties in the past. So they have a track record.\n  Russia has the world's largest chemical weapons arsenal. The former \nSoviet Union routinely violated its arms control obligations whenever \nit was convenient, whenever it was in their best interest. Russia \nremains in violation of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention and \nthe CFE treaty. Thus, it is clear that the cold war pattern of \nnoncompliance did not end when the Soviet Union ended.\n  Russia has also made clear that it has no intention of ratifying the \nchemical weapons treaty or complying with its provisions unless the \nUnited States provides a massive aid package to pay for destruction of \nits arsenal. Mr. President, where I come from in New Hampshire, this is \ncalled blackmail. That is what it is. And I object to it. We are \nalready committed to spending $12 billion to eliminate our own chemical \nweapons arsenal. Are we supposed to foot the bill for Russia's as well \nnow?\n  Let us not forget we are already giving Russia billions of dollars in \nransom for the START I and START II treaties, even though they have yet \nto ratify START II. With the hard-line Communists and nationalists \ngaining 33 percent of Parliament seats in the recent Russian elections, \ncan anyone actually believe that this situation is likely to improve? I \ndo not think so.\n  Russia is not implementing the 1990 bilateral destruction agreement \nin which it pledged to substantially reduce its chemical weapons \narsenal. The DIA stated Russia is moving so slowly that no meaningful \nreduction of its arsenal is likely to occur in the next decade. These \nare facts that the proponents do not want you to hear, Mr. President. \nThe DIA has expressed skepticism regarding the veracity of Russia's \ndata declarations. It appears highly likely that Russia has grossly \nunderreported its chemical weapons arsenal.\n  Finally, it has been widely reported in the international \npublications that Russia is developing new binary weapons that are \nhighly lethal, yet contained none of the chemicals--none of the \nchemicals--listed on the treaty's schedules. If this is true, Russia \nwill be capable of circumventing this treaty in a very significant and, \nfrankly, destabilizing way. We will be considering this issue in more \ndetail during the closed session, but I want to say here and now that \nthis is a very, very big problem and it ought to be looked at very \nclosely.\n  It gives me no pleasure to take the floor of the Senate and raise \nthese troubling issues. I would like to be for this treaty. I wish it \nbanned all chemical weapons. But the fact of the matter is, it does \nnot, and I have a constitutional responsibility to look carefully at \nthese issues and act in a manner that I believe advances our national \nsecurity.\n  This treaty is deeply flawed--deeply flawed. No amount of public \nrelations spin, no amount of pressure from the White House or from \nanybody else can change that issue. Certainly it is not going to change \nthis Senator's mind.\n  I know that many of my colleagues think that since the cold war is \nover arms control issues do not matter anymore. I know many Members who \nwould just as soon focus on issues that seem to be drawing more \nattention in the polls. But as the stewards of national security, we do \nnot have that luxury. We cannot afford to sweep these issues under the \nrug for the convenience of political expediency.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these important national security \nconsiderations, I want to highlight for my colleagues the enormous \nburden that this treaty will place on U.S. businesses. Under the \ntreaty, there would be two basic types of inspections: routine and \nchallenge. Routine inspections are to be directed at sites producing \nchemicals that present the greatest risk of diversion to weapons uses. \nA nation could be subject to up to 20 routine inspections per year, and \na specific site up to two routine inspections. Challenge inspections \nwould occur by request by a party to the treaty and can take place with \nvery little advance notice. There is no limit to the number of \nchallenge inspections that can take place.\n  The United States also, Mr. President, will be obligated to pay 25 \npercent of the operating expenses of this organization. Does that sound \nfamiliar? Think of the United Nations and other international \norganizations where we wind up footing most of the bill. Membership on \nthe Executive Council is determined by a rotating regional formula, \nwith the majority of seats allocated to third world countries. The \nUnited States would not necessarily be represented on the council at \nall times and there is no U.S. veto, as there is in the U.N. Security \nCouncil.\n\n  This represents a new open-ended entitlement for another United \nNations-\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\nstyle bureaucracy. I cannot believe that we are going to agree to pay \n25 percent of the cost when we are having so much difficulty injecting \nfiscal discipline into the existing foreign aid bureaucracy which \nSenator Helms has been trying to change for years. Why should we pay \nsuch a grossly disproportionate percentage when Russia, who has the \nworld's largest stockpile, pays 5.6 percent--while we pay the 25 \npercent?\n  It is estimated that somewhere between 3,000 and 8,000 companies, \nperhaps more, will be affected by this treaty--3,000 to 8,000 U.S. \ncompanies. The treaty creates a massive program of reporting \nrequirements for companies, companies that produce or use regulated \nchemicals.\n  I would ask my colleagues, do you really think the rogue nations, the \nNorth Koreas, the Libyas, the Irans, or the Iraqs, and others, are \ngoing to be subject to this? Do you really think they care that we are \nharassing our own companies? They are probably getting a good laugh out \nof it, Mr. President.\n  The individual companies are required to assume all costs associated \nwith this compliance, including filings, escort and administration of \nroutine inspections, challenge inspections, and in some circumstances, \nAmerican businesses may even be required to shut down production during \nthe inspection period. Failure to comply with the regulations could \nresult in a company being fined up to $50,000 per incident--per \nincident.\n  The Defense Department has estimated the cost imposed on a company \nwith a large facility could be as high as $500,000 per inspection, \nwhile small businesses should expect inspections to cost between \n$10,000 and $20,000, all on U.S. businesses on something that does not \nban chemical weapons in other countries.\n  Each international inspection team will be accompanied by \nrepresentatives of the U.S. Government. According to the \nadministration, it is possible the representatives of the Environmental \nProtection Agency and OSHA could also serve as escorts to come into \nyour business and have a good look at what we you are doing--maybe \nsomething very personal, very private, something you would not want \nyour competitors to have. But under the treaty, the EPA can walk right \nin, have access to the whole facility, perhaps even take a few samples, \na few products. Who knows--take some records.\n  It is clear, Mr. President, that this treaty and the accompanying \nimplementing legislation that the administration has requested \nrepresents a massive, unfunded mandate on U.S. businesses. It is \nstaggering. I cannot believe that this Senate is prepared to do this \ninjustice to businesses here in America and, frankly, injustice to \nourselves as a nation. At a time when your constituents are crying out \nfor relief from onerous and burdensome regulations, here we go again. \nThe problem is, other nations who get to inspect our facilities have a \nlot more to gain than we do by inspecting theirs. The limited military-\nrelated intelligence that we may gain is far outweighed by the \nindustrial and commercial intelligence that other nations will derive \nfrom our companies. That is why nations like Iran are signing on to \nthis treaty, because they want that information. They will have access \nto that information, if not directly, certainly indirectly even if they \nare not one of the inspectors.\n  Most chemical manufacturers have not considered the effect of this \ntreaty. Frankly, I am disappointed in some of those manufacturers \nbecause they have not thought it through. But they will be back, Mr. \nPresident. If we pass this, they will be back and they will be back \nwith tears in their eyes because they are going to be very, very sorry \nthat they supported this treaty.\n  In fact, I know of one example where an individual called my office \npurporting to represent the CMA in support of the treaty. When \nquestioned on the details of the treaty and the implications for U.S. \nbusinesses, the individual became frustrated, claimed ignorance, and \nstated that the CMA told him to make the calls. He admitted not knowing \nmuch about the treaty and quickly ended the call. That is pretty sad, \nMr. President.\n\n  If that is the kind of expertise being brought to bear in this \nlobbying campaign we are faced with, I think it raises more serious \nquestions as to the merit and true nature of this endorsement by CMA.\n  Additionally, while CMA's support is an important factor to consider, \nit is important to recognize that CMA does not even represent a \nmajority of the businesses affected by the treaty. According to the \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency, 60 percent of the companies \naffected by the treaty are not CMA members.\n  In fact, most of these non-CMA companies are smaller businesses who \nare most likely to be harmed by the increased regulatory burden. They \nhave the most to lose. Yet, they are the ones that are overlooked by \nthe treaty's proponents.\n  Mr. President, since last fall, when the Clinton administration \nabruptly requested that the Senate defer consideration of the treaty, I \nhave worked very closely with my colleagues in the Senate, including \nSenator Kyl and Senator Helms and others. I have attended numerous \nmeetings with the President's National Security Adviser to explore \npossible conditions to protect U.S. national security, and, to their \ncredit, the administration and others did work hard to address many of \nthose concerns, and many have been addressed. But there are still some \nthat I just cannot, in good faith, allow to go unchallenged.\n  In the end, we are not able to agree on all of these issues. That is \nthe nature of democracy. We discuss issues, debate policy, find common \nground, and compromise where we can. We compromised 28 times.\n  It is important to understand, though, that reasonable people can and \ndo disagree on the merits of this treaty. I want to make it very clear \nthat I have no problem with any of my colleagues in terms of how they \narrived at their votes. That is their vote, and I respect that, I \nrecognize that. In fact, it is healthy. While I strongly oppose this \ntreaty, I don't impugn anyone's motives or character for taking an \nopposing viewpoint. Having said that, it is regrettable that those of \nus deeply troubled by the lack of participation in this treaty by Iran, \nSyria, Libya, and North Korea, and by the inherent unverifiability of \nthe treaty, by the fact that nations such as Iran will gain access to \nsensitive data on our chemical defenses. Now, people have said that is \nnot going to happen. Well, we will see. If this treaty passes, we will \nsee, because they can be part of the inspection team and can have \naccess to that information.\n  Anyway, we are accused of being somehow in favor of chemical weapons \nbecause we take this position. It seems that when those of us who are \nconservatives want to stand by our principles, we are ``crazy people'' \nor something. But when you are liberal and you stand by your \nprinciples, you are thoughtful and considerate and compassionate. Well, \nmaybe I am missing something somewhere.\n  It is very easy for the media and the advocates of the treaty to \ndemagog this issue. Some in the media have demagoged it. Some in the \nmedia in my own State are demagoging me and the treaty. That is their \nprerogative. But they are not here on the Senate floor--I am. Some in \nthe media in my State may not like that fact, but I am here as an \nelected representative for the State of New Hampshire. I am sworn to \nuphold the Constitution and to defend the national security interests \nof the United States. Yes, if there is a treaty violating those, I am \ngoing to be opposed to it.\n  While I wholeheartedly support the objective of banning chemical \nweapons, this doesn't ban chemical weapons. If somebody can stand up \nhere and tell me how we are going to get access to all of Iraq and be \ncertain that we are not going to have chemical weapons there, and all \nof Libya and North Korea, and can prove that to me, I will support the \ntreaty. That is why we have this amendment, this provision on rogue \nnations. I don't believe this requires that the Senate rubber stamp any \ntreaty dealing with chemical weapons. We have some very respected \npeople, including four former Secretaries of Defense--that was \ntestified to here before--who oppose this treaty.\n\n  In the medical world, the wrong medicine can kill a patient even if \nit is prescribed with the best of intentions. The same holds true with \nnational security.\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\n I have no doubt that the advocates of CWC believe that it will cure \nthe plague of chemical weapons. But that is the wrong medicine and it \nwon't work.\n  I want to conclude my remarks by summarizing some of the more \nimportant arguments against this treaty.\n  First, it is not global.\n  Second, it is not effectively verifiable.\n  Third, there are no technical means to detect undeclared stockpiles \nof chemical agents or weapons.\n  Many of those who have signed the treaty are either unlikely to \nratify it or to comply. Does anybody really believe that Iran will be a \nresponsible party to this treaty? When is the last time we had access \nto all of the countryside in Iran and all of the industry and buildings \nin Iran? Why should we believe that this treaty is going to make us do \nthat?\n  Article X of the treaty will require us to share detailed information \non our own chemical weapons defenses with all other signatories to the \ntreaty, good and bad signatories to the treaty, friends and enemies.\n  Thousands of U.S. businesses, many of them vulnerable small \nbusinesses, will be exposed to costly annual reporting requirements \nthat they can't afford. Direct costs to U.S. industry are estimated to \nbe over $200 million a year.\n  It goes on and on and on, Mr. President. It is just incredible.\n  Challenge inspections, which basically you could not do under our \nConstitution, are unlimited in number and may violate the fourth \namendment, which guarantees the rights of individuals and their \nproperty against unreasonable search and seizure.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that this treaty falls short of achieving \nits objectives and its goals. In fact, it doesn't even come close. As \nwe will see later in the classified session, the stakes are high. We \nhave little to gain and a great deal to lose.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this treaty. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jeff Severs \nbe given the privilege of the floor for this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been involved with the chemical \nweapons debate and negotiations for a convention like this since its \nbeginning. During the Reagan administration, at the suggestion of \nAmbassador John Tower, former Senator John Tower, I spent a month in \nGeneva during an August recess auditing the beginnings of the \nnegotiations that led up to this Chemical Weapons Convention. John \nTower even loaned me his home in Geneva to live in during that period. \nHe and I agreed that negotiating a satisfactory chemical weapons treaty \nwas an objective that had to be achieved, because we shared the feeling \nthat the world was becoming a very dangerous place to live in because \nof chemical and biological warfare developments. We felt the United \nStates needed to show leadership in reducing some of the dangers \nwhenever possible.\n  This convention before the Senate could be improved. The START \ntreaties could have been improved. However, under those treaties, the \nUnited States and Russia will significantly reduce their numbers of \nnuclear warheads and reduce the risk of nuclear war. The Conventional \nArmed Forces in Europe Treaty could have been improved. Yet, today we \nno longer have Russian and NATO forces bristling with tanks, cannons, \nand fighter aircraft facing each other across the border in numbers \nthat reminded many of Armageddon.\n\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention does move the world toward a goal of \nbringing order and accountability to the production and transportation \nof weapons of mass destruction. This is a convention that has required \nthe negotiating concurrence of 74 countries. I will never forget \nsitting around those rooms in Geneva while we waited for the \nrepresentatives of the various countries to state their positions.\n  To require this convention to be perfect asks the impossible. To \nexpect it to be an effective tool in controlling chemical weapons is \nreasonable. This convention does provide an inspection regime that will \nallow our inspectors to monitor potential chemical weapons production \nand transportation more effectively than without the convention. And \nprotections are built into the convention so that U.S. companies \nproducing chemicals are not going to have their manufacturing processes \ncompromised, and, obviously, we do not amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States by approving this convention.\n  For me, this convention enhances the security of our forces deployed \nabroad, as well as throughout our whole Nation. The Joint Chiefs of \nStaff support the Chemical Weapons Convention. Generals Colin Powell \nand Norman Schwarzkopf support the convention. Former Secretary of \nState Jim Baker and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft \nsupport this convention. Former CIA Directors, Jim Woolsey, Stansfield \nTurner, and John Deutch, support this convention. I could go on and on \nwith the list, Mr. President.\n  But, to me, it is not the former or present officials that should \nhave an impact on this Senate. It is the men and women in uniform. They \nare in harm's way. They know now that many of their predecessors who \nserved us in the Persian Gulf war, men and women there in uniform, were \nexposed to some type of a chemical weapon in Iraq. It is for them that \nI speak, because I think, universally, they are now worried about what \nthis Congress is going to do, or not do, in trying to find some process \nof protecting them against chemical and biological warfare.\n  In its essence, I believe that the United States has a responsibility \nfor world leadership. This leadership is more graphically demonstrated \nin this legislative body than anywhere I know, because passage of the \nresolution of ratification will show our leadership in the effort to \ncontain chemical weapons, just as Senate support for START I showed the \nUnited States' commitment to nuclear weapons reduction.\n  I encourage the Senate to vote in favor of this resolution of \nratification and support the Chemical Weapons Convention as it was \npresented to us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two articles from today's papers be \nprinted in the record. One article is by Samuel Berger, in the \nWashington Times, entitled ``The CWC Imperative''; the other is by Gen. \nThomas McInerney and Stanley Weiss, in the Hill newspaper.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, April 23, 1997]\n\n                           The CWC Imperative\n\n                         (By Samuel R. Berger)\n\n       Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. After years of international negotiation and \n     domestic debate, the Senate faces a clear choice; we can \n     continue to lead the widening international commitment to \n     begin banishing poison gas from the earth and head the effort \n     to make it work. Or we can walk away from a treaty we helped \n     write, deny our soldiers and citizens its benefits, expose \n     our companies to its penalties, and put America on the same \n     side as pariah nations like Libya and Iraq.\n       This treaty will take effect next week--with or without us. \n     That's why the real test of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     is not whether it's perfect, but whether we will be better \n     off inside or outside it. By that basic measure, this treaty \n     is overwhelmingly in our national interest.\n       First, this treaty will help protect our soldiers by \n     requiring other countries to do what we decided to do years \n     ago--get rid of chemical weapons. The treaty will also make \n     it harder for rogue states and terrorists to get or make \n     chemical weapons. By eliminating existing stockpiles, it will \n     remove the single largest source of weapons that they could \n     steal or buy on the black market. By imposing new controls on \n     the transfer of dangerous chemicals, it will help put the raw \n     ingredients for such weapons further out of reach.\n       Finally, by giving us new tools for verification like \n     short-notice, on-site inspections, creating a global \n     intelligence network, and strengthening the authority of our \n     own law enforcement, this treaty will make it easier for us \n     to prevent and punish those who seek to break its rules.\n       Two and half months ago, President Clinton and Senate \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott established a process to work \n     through the concerns of some senators about the treaty. As a \n     result of this effort, and negotiations led by Sen. Jessie \n     Helms and Sen. Joe Biden, we have reached agreement on 28 \n     conditions that will be included in the treaty's resolution \n     of ratification. Among them are binding commitments to \n     maintain strong defenses against chemical attack; allow the \n     use of riot control agents like tear gas in a wide\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\n     range of military and law enforcement situations; and require \n     search warrants for any involuntary inspections of an \n     American business. These conditions resolve almost all the \n     issues that have been raised about this treaty.\n       Almost, but not all. Opponents insist on a handful of \n     additional conditions, each of which would make it impossible \n     for us to participate in this treaty. One would have us wait \n     to join until Russia does--giving cover to hard-liners in \n     Russia who want to hold on to their weapons. Another would \n     have us wait until rogue states like Iraq become members--\n     delaying our chance to use the treaty's tools against these \n     international outlaws and giving them a veto over our \n     national security. Another would impose an unrealistically \n     high standard of verification--and risk our ability to \n     protect our troops by using the treaty's already tough \n     provisions to detect cheating that is militarily significant.\n       Two other killer conditions would require us to re-open \n     negotiations on the treaty. First, some critics mistakenly \n     believe that the treaty requires the United States to provide \n     advanced chemical weapons defenses to rogue states. In fact, \n     only countries that have joined the CWC, renounced chemical \n     weapons and destroyed their stockpiles can request \n     assistance--and then, only if they are threatened with \n     chemical weapons by a non-party. President Clinton has \n     committed to the Senate that if a country of concern such as \n     Cuba or Iran should meet the strict conditions for aid, the \n     United States will restrict our assistance to emergency \n     medical supplies--and to use our influence as member of the \n     CWC to prevent other states from transferring equipment that \n     could harm our national security.\n       Second, some opponents misread treaty language to conclude \n     that the CWC would somehow facilitate their spread. President \n     Clinton has made it clear we reject this far-fetched \n     interpretation. He has committed to maintain strict U.S. and \n     multilateral export controls on certain dangerous chemicals \n     and obtained the same assurance from our allies.\n       If the Senate approves any of these ``killer conditions,'' \n     it will mean foregoing this treaty's clear costs. We will be \n     denied use of the treaty's tools against rogue states and \n     terrorists. We will lose the ability to enforce the rules we \n     helped make. We will subject our chemical companies to trade \n     restrictions that could cost them hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in sales. And we will send a clear signal of retreat \n     that will undermine our leadership to stop the spread of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       That must not be allowed to happen. While the Convention is \n     not a panacea, it represents a real opportunity to strengthen \n     the global fight against the threat that no one nation can \n     meet on its own. That is why president and legislators from \n     both parties and our military leaders have made U.S. approval \n     of the Convention their common cause. Negotiated under \n     President Reagan and signed under President Bush, the treaty \n     has broad, bipartisan support that includes every chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the past 20 years and the \n     overwhelming majority of our veterans, chemical manufacturers \n     and arms control experts. As Secretary of State Madeleine \n     Albright has said, this treaty was ``made in America.'' It is \n     right for America, and now, at last, it must be ratified in \n     America.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From the Hill, April 23, 1997]\n\n                Chemical Weapons Pact: Let's Make a Deal\n\n             (By Thomas G. McInerney and Stanley A. Weiss)\n\n       On one side is President Clinton. He wants the Senate to \n     ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This model \n     agreement, which bands the production and use of chemical \n     weapons, is supported by an overwhelming majority of \n     Americans, including a ``Who's Who'' of former officials and \n     military leaders, and has been signed by most of the \n     civilized world.\n       On the other side is Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). The Foreign \n     Relations Committee chairman wants to reorganize the State \n     Department, and threatened to keep the CWC bottled up in his \n     committee until this was agreed upon.\n       Mr. President, Sen. Helms. It's time to make a deal!\n       Both of them and, more importantly, the American people \n     would come out winners if the Senate votes to ratify the CWC, \n     and the State Department streamlines its operations. Here are \n     three ways to improve the business of diplomacy:\n       First, cut back on assistant secretaries. The State \n     Department currently houses 19 assistant secretaries focusing \n     on certain regions (East Asia) or functional areas (human \n     rights). Compare this to the Department of Defense where nine \n     assistant secretaries help oversee a budget 10 times larger \n     than the State Department's program budget. The system has \n     evolved into an unwieldy bureaucratic morass. The practical \n     effect of 19 assistant secretaries is overlap and poor \n     coordination.\n       Second, improve coordination and eliminate layers in \n     foreign aid programs. Here again, a hodgepodge of well-\n     intentioned programs operates with little oversight and \n     coordination. The details should be left to careful \n     negotiation between the State Department and Congress. But, \n     the goal should be to reduce bureaucracies, establish clear \n     priorities, and put these aid programs more closely in the \n     service of our overall foreign policy goals.\n       Finally, start running the State Department in a more \n     business-like manner. State Department officials rightly tout \n     their important role in supporting American businesses \n     overseas. But as part of this effort, they ought to get their \n     own house in order.\n       The required management reforms are no secret. The General \n     Accounting Office (GAO), The National Performance Review, and \n     other studies have all reached similar conclusions. Closing \n     unnecessary overseas posts, outsourcing administrative \n     support functions, and rethinking overseas staff structure \n     can save money and improve performance.\n       Maintaining the status quo is impossible. The GAO estimates \n     that simply maintaining current functions and personnel will \n     require a 22 percent increase in State Department budgets by \n     the year 2000--an unlikely prospect in today's budget \n     environment.\n       Despite the clear need for action, the State Department \n     management continues to postpone the inevitable. A well-\n     conceived strategy for reconstructing the department does not \n     exist, and Helms is right to demand action.\n       In return, the Senate should ratify the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. Americans will be safer with the treaty than \n     without it. The CWC combines an arms-control agreement that \n     bans an entire class of weapons of mass destruction and a \n     non-proliferation regime that forbids trade to any nation in \n     non-compliance.\n       It will help prevent terrorists and pariah states from \n     getting their hands on materials to make chemical weapons, \n     while ensuring that American manufacturers can continue to \n     successfully compete in the global trade of legitimate \n     chemical products.\n       Ameria is unilaterally destroying its chemical stockpile. \n     The question now is whether it will become party to a \n     convention which will go into effect on April 29, with or \n     without U.S. approval. As retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf \n     stated in Senate testimony, ``We don't need chemical weapons \n     to fight our future wars. And frankly . . . by not ratifying \n     that treaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and \n     North Korea, and I'd just as soon not be associated with \n     those thugs.''\n       If the price of getting two-thirds of the Senate to ratify \n     the CWC is improving the way the State Department works, that \n     sounds like a deal we can all live with.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is not an easy position for me to be \nopposed to friends with whom I normally stand shoulder to shoulder. But \nI believe we must be motivated by what we believe is in the best \ninterest of the country as a whole. I believe if we took a poll of men \nand women in uniform today, they would say that the No. 1 threat they \nfear is chemical and biological warfare. I say that we must lead the \nworld in addressing the consequences of production and use of these \nweapons of mass destruction, just as we led the world in dealing with \nthe consequences of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Voting for \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention resolution of ratification will make \nthe world a safer place.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is interesting. I have been here on the \nfloor listening to this debate for a period of time, and it is almost \nas if the arguments kind of pass each other in a strange way. I have, \nalso, on the Foreign Relations Committee, been at the hearings. We keep \nhearing the same mantra repeated with respect to a number of \nobjections, notwithstanding the fact that either the language of the \ntreaty is going to be changed by virtue of agreements made between \nSenator Helms and Senator Biden and the administration, or the treaty \nitself addresses those specific arguments. One of the most interesting \nrepetitive arguments is that this is somehow going to be dangerous for \nthe chemical companies. We keep hearing people say that this is going \nto be terrible for American industry. But American industry has signed \noff on it. The Senator from Delaware represents many chemical \ncompanies. Fifty-six percent of the economy in the State of Delaware is \nrepresented by chemical companies. He hasn't heard from them in \nopposition. Nevertheless, we hear people repeat that.\n  Now, obviously, this convention, despite its attributes, is not a \npanacea for the threat of chemical weapons. None of us who are \nproposing this convention, I think, are suggesting that this is the \npanacea. But what it does do, Mr. President, is it contributes, on \nbalance, more to the effort to have deterrence, to expose cheaters and \nto detect chemical weapons production and\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nproliferation of any kind of significant military nature than not \nhaving it.\n  Mr. President, although crude chemical weapons have been around for \ncenturies, poison gas unfortunately came of age as a tool of warfare in \nWorld War I. First chlorine, then phosgene, mustard gas, and lewisite \nwere introduced onto the battlefields of Europe, burning, blistering, \nand choking unprotected soldiers and civilians alike. Both because with \nchemical weapons so closely associated with World War I there is a \nperception they are an anachronistic threat and are therefore of less \nconcern, and because we became accustomed during 40 years of the cold \nwar to living with the threat of a global nuclear Armageddon, some fail \nto recognize the magnitude of the threat now posed by chemical weapons. \nThis is a terribly serious mistake.\n  Modern chemical weapons--nerve agents like sarin, soman, tabun, and \nVX--are so lethal that a dose as small as 15 milligrams can kill a \nperson. Equally as troubling, chemical weapons are the most financially \nand technically attractive option for a country--or a terrorist--that \nsets its sights on developing and producing a weapon of mass \ndestruction. The ingredients for chemical weapons are chemicals that \nare inexpensive and readily available in the marketplace, and the \nformulae to make nerve and blister agents are well known. It is no \ncoincidence that chemical weapons are known as the poor man's atom \nbomb. The U.S. intelligence community estimates that more than 20 \nnations possess chemical weapons or the capability to make them \nreadily. Still other countries are working to acquire a chemical \narsenal. Chemical weapons have proliferated far more widely than the \ntwo other types of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear and biological \nweapons. We ignore this threat at our peril. It is this threat that the \nChemical Weapons Convention confronts. And the Senate today and \ntomorrow has an historical opportunity to address and reduce that \nthreat--to our civilian citizens, to our armed forces, and to the \nentire world--as we perform our constitutional responsibility of advice \nand consent with respect to the convention.\n  Our Nation's highest military and intelligence officials repeatedly \nhave stated that while the Chemical Weapons Convention is no panacea \nfor these threats, America will be safer and we will have greater \nability to reduce chemical weapons proliferation, and to identify and \nremove chemical weapons threats, if the United States and a majority of \nthe world's nations ratify this treaty. The number of signatories is up \nto 161. Seventy-four nations, including the majority of our allies in \nNATO and the European Union, have already ratified the convention.\n\n  The public outcry over the use of chemical weapons in World War I \ncompelled diplomats to begin work to ban these weapons. These post-war \nefforts fell short of a complete prohibition. They resulted, however, \nin the 1925 Geneva Protocol that outlaws the use of chemical weapons. \nNegotiations on a more far-reaching prohibition resumed in 1968, \nfocusing on a treaty that would prohibit the development, production, \nand stockpiling of chemical weapons as well. In 1969, the United States \nrenounced the first use of chemical weapons and initiated a moratorium \non their production that lasted 18 years. Five years later, the Senate \ngave its advice and consent to ratification of both the Geneva Protocol \nand the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. International \nnegotiation toward a Chemical Weapons Convention, however, made little \nprogress until the United States again took the initiative.\n  In the 1980's, Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against Iran \nand against his own Kurdish people horrified the international \ncommunity. Iraq clearly violated its obligations under the Geneva \nProtocol, but the international community did nothing to punish Saddam \nfor his outlaw behavior. This failure to enforce the Geneva Protocol \nwas a failure of international political will, not of the treaty \nitself. America's leaders at that time, including many of us in this \nChamber, must bear part of the responsibility for not having insisted \nthat Saddam pay a price for his outrageous behavior. Just like a \ndomestic law, an international agreement, no matter how good, is of \nlittle use unless it is enforced.\n  Iraq's flagrant violation of the Geneva Protocol did, however, serve \nas a catalyst for the negotiators' attempt to complete the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. Working from a draft treaty text first introduced \nby then-Vice President George Bush in 1984, the 39 nations hammering \nout the treaty in the Conference on Disarmament reached agreements on \nintrusive and far-reaching verification provisions that were included \nin the Bush draft text. For example, Vice President Bush proposed on \nbehalf of President Reagan ``anytime, anywhere'' on-site challenge \ninspections to deter and catch treaty violators. At the time the \nconcept of challenge inspections was first advanced, no nuclear arms \ntreaty yet included even routine on-site inspections of declared \nnuclear facilities.\n\n  Vice President Bush asked for these tough verification measures for \ngood reason. It is much more difficult to monitor a chemical weapons \ntreaty than a nuclear accord. The capabilities of our national \ntechnical means--including intelligence satellites--enable us to track \nthe production and deployment of nuclear weapons in other countries \nwith a considerable degree of confidence. Chemical weapons production, \nhowever, cannot be monitored from afar with anywhere near the same \nlevel of confidence. Aside from using large government facilities to \nchurn out chemical weapons, a government could coopt a commercial \nchemical firm into making chemical weapons, or manufacture chemical \nweapons in a factory purported to be involved in the commercial \nproduction of legitimate products. The legitimate chemical industry \naround the world makes products that are important to modern life. Some \nof the same chemicals and technologies that this industry employs to \nmanufacture fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, herbicides, and \ncountless other products could also be used to make chemical weapons. \nThere are literally thousands of industrial facilities worldwide, and \nwe know all too well from the inspections in Iraq in the aftermath of \nthe 1991 gulf war that a determined rogue proliferator can and will use \nthe industrial sector to mask efforts to develop and produce weapons of \nmass destruction. For these very reasons, the Reagan administration not \nonly pushed for routine data declarations and inspections of government \nand industry facilities; it also insisted on these unprecedented \nchallenge inspections.\n  After George Bush was elected President, the Bush administration took \na variety of steps to give impetus to the international negotiations. \nPerhaps most importantly, in May of 1991, President Bush, without \nwaiting for or depending on completion and ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, unilaterally forswore any use of chemical weapons \nby the United States, even as in-kind retaliation on the battlefield. A \nyear and a half later, as one of the last acts of his Administration, \nBush sent Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to Paris in January, \n1993 to join more than 130 states in signing the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. Pushing these negotiations through to a successful \nconclusion stands as one of the most important foreign policy \nachievements of the Bush administration. We owe the dedicated \nnegotiators from the Reagan and Bush administrations, most notably \nAmbassador Stephen Ledogar and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \nDirector Ronald Lehman, a debt of gratitude for their far-sighted \nproposals and their persistence at the negotiating table. We owe \nPresidents Reagan and Bush a debt as well--for their leadership and \nconsistent support of this historic arms control initiative.\n\n  The convention that President Bill Clinton presented to the Senate on \nNovember 23, 1993, which is before us today, is a feasible and \npragmatic treaty. Given the inherent difficulty of curtailing the \nproliferation of chemical weapons, America's negotiators did not insist \non obtaining a flawless pact--an effort that would have been certain to \nfail. Instead, the U.S. delegation worked closely with our allies in \nEurope, Japan, Australia, and Canada to create a realistic treaty with \nverification provisions that offer a significant likelihood of \nidentifying militarily-significant violations and that will force \ncheaters to incur higher costs and endure greater inconvenience in \norder to accumulate a covert chemical weapons\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nstockpile. It is important to note that the convention's negotiators \nand advocates have never claimed that it provides an ironclad assurance \nthat the world will become and remain free from all chemical weapons. \nThat is an impossible standard to meet, so it should come as no \nsurprise the convention does not meet it. Instead, the convention makes \nidentification of cheaters more likely; it requires all non-cheaters to \ndispose of all chemical weapons--which, of course, the United States \nalready was unilaterally committed to doing by law; and it will make it \nmore difficult and expensive for cheaters to cheat.\n  A very important ally in the negotiations leading to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention was the U.S. chemical industry. It is \ncounterintuitive to think that the chemical industry would participate \nin a negotiation that would ultimately bring additional regulation, \nnotably data declarations and inspections, upon itself. To its credit, \nthat is exactly what the U.S. chemical industry, and many of its \ncounterparts in other nations, did. For well over a decade, the U.S. \nchemical industry provided invaluable assistance to the U.S. delegation \nand all of the negotiators in Geneva, opening their facilities to test \nverification concepts and proposing workable solutions for how the data \ndeclarations and inspections should operate. With the help of the U.S. \nchemical industry, the CWC emerged with sufficient provisions and \nrestrictions to make trade in chemical weapons materials more visible \nand more difficult. The convention's inspectors will watch closely over \nthe global industry, guarding against the diversion of commercial \nchemicals for purposes of weapons proliferation. At the same time, the \ntreaty contains numerous safeguards that enable the industry to protect \nits confidential business information to its satisfaction, despite \nclaims to the contrary that are made by some treaty opponents.\n\n  I want to be clear that despite all of its attributes, the treaty is \nnot a panacea for the threat of chemical weapons. It can't be. But the \nconvention's primary merit is that it will contribute to deterrence, \nexposure, and detection of chemical weapons proliferation of a \nmilitarily significant nature. By requiring the destruction of existing \narsenals and making it much more difficult for future adversaries to \nacquire or increase chemical weapons stocks, the CWC greatly reduces \nthe prospect that U.S. troops will encounter chemical weapons on the \nbattlefield. Following in our footsteps as we move to unilaterally \ndestroy our chemical weapons stockpile, the CWC will begin to level the \ninternational playing field by requiring other countries to eliminate \ntheir chemical weapons as well.\n  That is the balance. That is the judgment we are called on to make in \nthe Senate.\n  Is this, as the Senator from Alaska was just saying, in the interest \nof our country to protect our troops and the long-term interests of our \nNation? I believe this convention makes identification of cheaters more \nlikely. It requires all noncheaters to dispose of all chemical weapons, \nsomething we can't do today. And, of course, we have already \nunilaterally decided that we are going to get rid of all of our \nchemical weapons.\n  So here we are going down the road of getting rid of all of our \nchemical weapons, and here you have finally some form of legal \nstructure that will hold other nations accountable.\n  Clearly the United States must never be complacent about the threat \nof adversary nations or terrorists armed with chemical weapons.\n  I respectfully suggest that nothing in this convention and none of \nthose of us who advocate this convention begs complacency.\n  The convention's critics claim that the treaty will lull us into a \nfalse sense of security, resulting in a weakening of our defenses. To \nthe contrary, the convention stipulates that each of its member nations \nis allowed to maintain defensive programs to develop and test \nantidotes, gas masks, and other protective gear and to train its troops \nin how to use them.\n  So it is really a question of us. I mean that there is nothing in the \ntreaty that lulls us to sleep. The treaty specifically allows us to \nhave defenses. And if we are, indeed, concerned about it, as we ought \nto be, we will have those defenses, precisely as this administration is \noffering us with an additional $225 million of expenditure this year.\n  So how can you continually come to the floor and say, ``Oh, my God, \nthis is going to lull us to sleep'' when the administration is \nproviding an additional $225 million?\n  It is our responsibility as elected officials to ensure that we \nmaintain a robust U.S. chemical weapons defense program. To do less \nwould be an injustice to our troops, a threat to our security, and a \nfailure on our part to exercise fully our rights under this treaty. One \nof the 28 conditions to the treaty negotiated by Senators Helms and \nBiden, and agreed to by the administration, condition 11, explicitly \nstates this determination, and requires the Secretary of Defense to \nensure that U.S. forces are capable of carrying out required military \nmissions regardless of any foreign threat or use of chemical weapons.\n  The Pentagon's view of the convention is unambiguous. In his \ntestimony, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John \nShalikashvili stated:\n\n       From a military perspective, the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention is clearly in our national interest. The \n     convention's advantages outweigh its shortcomings. The United \n     States and all other CW-capable state parties incur the same \n     obligation to destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles . . . \n     if we do not join and walk away from the CWC an awful lot of \n     people will probably walk away from it as well, and our \n     influence on the rogue states will only decrease.''\n\n  So here you have the general of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nChairman, coming before us and saying, indeed, the problem of the rogue \nstates is not passing the convention. The problem is not having a \nconvention because, if you do not have a convention, you don't have the \nkind of legal structure and inspection and tracking and accountability \nthat help put pressure on those rogue states and limit the access of \nthe rogue states to the materials with which they make chemical \nweapons.\n  The truth is that until the convention enters into force, the actions \nof any nation, signatory or not, to manufacture or to stockpile \nchemical weapons will be objectionable but it won't be illegal. Mr. \nPresident, it won't be illegal. And it is very hard for this Senator to \nunderstand how, against the regimen that we have for inspection--\nagainst the intrusiveness that we are acquiring that we don't have \ntoday, and measured by the level of destruction of existing stockpiles \nthat is required, the people who today are under no obligation \nwhatsoever to destroy those stockpiles--you could be better off without \nit against those who have it is really very, very difficult to \nunderstand.\n  General Shalikashvili's last point alludes to an argument often made \nby the treaty's opponents, who are quick to point out that not all of \nthe countries believed to have chemical weapons will join. Indeed, that \nis true. Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea have not signed the \nconvention, but three-quarters of the nations on the intelligence \ncommunity's list of probable proliferators have signed.\n  The truth is that until the convention enters into force, the actions \nof any nation--signatory or not--to manufacture or stockpile chemical \nweapons will be objectionable, but not illegal under any international \nlaw or agreement. Some colleagues in this Chamber suggest we defer \nUnited States ratification until after Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North \nKorea have joined. To them I would respond that failure to ratify gains \nus absolutely nothing with respect to those rogue states. We are in no \nway aided in meeting our intelligence and military obligations \nregarding those nations and their chemical weapons activities by \nfailing to ratify the CWC; conversely, we are in no way impeded, and in \nfact are assisted, in meeting those obligations by ratification. \nRather, I agree with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this \nmatter: We increase our leverage against these hold-out states by \nratifying the Convention. We also make it more difficult for those \nhold-outs to obtain materials they can use in their chemical weapons \nprograms.\n  Some opponents of the CWC, suggest that it is fatally flawed because \nadherence to or violation of its requirements cannot be verified.\n  We keep hearing this. It is interesting. At the hearings I kept \nhearing two arguments coming out from the people\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nwho said you can't verify it. They say it is too intrusive, that we \nwill give away all of the trade secrets of the businesses, so we can't \nallow obtrusive verification. They object to it because they think it \nis going to prevent business from conducting its business. And they go \nto the other side of the coin, and say, ``If we get more intrusive, we \nare going to be verifying sufficiently but then you lose on the other \nside.'' You can't have it both ways. Either it is a balanced effort at \nverification and at the level of intrusiveness, which is why the \nchemical companies support this treaty.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that the very people who have argued for \nthat intrusiveness--the Reagan administration, and most of the \nprincipal critics who are making that argument today --are the very \npeople who insisted that the challenge inspections would be essential \nto the integrity of this convention.\n  Ironically, the handful of principal critics making this argument \nserved in the Reagan administration and, fortunately, insisted that \nchallenge inspections would be essential to the CWC's integrity. \nVirtually every inspection provision that the Reagan administration \nproposed was included in the treaty text when the negotiations \nconcluded in 1992. Their proposals having been accepted, these critics \nnow want to raise the bar even higher.\n\n  The CWC's verification provisions will put inspectors on the ground \nwith sensitive equipment and the right to review records, ask \nquestions, go to any part of a facility, and take and analyze samples. \nThese powerful inspection tools are needed to get the job done, and it \nwould be sheer folly for the Senate to deprive the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity of the information that these inspections will provide. \nAccording to former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey:\n\n       What the Chemical Weapons Convention provides the \n     intelligence community is a new tool to add to our collection \n     tool kit. It is an instrument with broad applicability, which \n     can help resolve a wide variety of problems. Moreover, it is \n     a universal tool which can be used by diplomats and \n     politicians, as well as intelligence specialists, to further \n     a common goal: elimination of the threat of chemical weapons.\n\n  Another argument used by critics of the treaty is that Russia does \nnot comply with other arms control treaties and that more of the same \ncan be expected with the CWC. Reports from whistleblowers who worked in \nthe Soviet chemical weapons production complex indicate that in the \nlate 1980's and on into the 1990's, the Soviet Union was developing and \ntesting a new generation of nerve agents. More recent reports suggest \nchemical weapons research, if not limited production, continues. Russia \nhas declared a stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons--the \nworld's largest--but reports indicate that even these numbers may be \nincorrectly low.\n  Mr. President, to the extent these reports of continuing Russian \nchemical weapons activity are true, I join treaty critics --and, I \nconfidently expect--all Senators in abhoring this Russian activity. I \ntake second place to no Senator in wanting to use all capability at the \ndisposal of the United States to obtain cessation of those activities, \nand destruction of all Russian chemical weapons. But treaty opponents \nseem to have stepped through the lookingglass in Alice in Wonderland. \nSimply insisting that Russia tell us the truth is no way to get the \nbottom of this situation. Refusing to ratify the CWC because we are \npiqued at their behavior is a classic example of what the old cliche \nrefers to as ``cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.''\n  The United States greatly increases its leverage by ratifying the \nCWC, which will put pressure on Russia to follow suit. When Senate \ndebate of the CWC was scheduled in the fall of 1996, it became evident \nthat Moscow was feeling the heat of a pending Senate vote on the CWC. \nSuddenly, Russian officials backpedaled from a 1990 bilateral \ndestruction agreement, which had not yet entered into force, and stated \nthe CWC's activation should be delayed until the bilateral agreement \nwas underway. This strategy belies Moscow's eagerness to postpone U.S. \nratification. I, for one, am not buying it. The longer we wait to \nratify the CWC, the more breathing room Moscow has. The time has long \nsince passed to put some real pressure on Russia. Senate ratification \nof the CWC will do just that.\n\n  Another of the treaty opponents' claims is that the treaty requires \nthe United States to share chemical and chemical weapons defense \ntechnologies and capabilities with even those party States that are \nrogue nations or adversaries of our Nation. Some claim that we would be \nforced to remove our current export controls applicable to chemicals \nwith respect to all other parties to the CWC. Articles X and XI of the \nConvention are frequently referenced in this context. What is going on \nhere, Mr. President, is very regrettable. The black and white language \nof the convention itself contradicts that view. And if the convention \nitself were not sufficiently clear in enabling the United States to \nrefuse to provide any technology or other information or data that \ncould be misused by rogue nations or adversaries, several of the 28 \nconditions to which bipartisan agreement has been reached directly \naddress these concerns and should lay them to rest in all minds.\n  Condition 7 requires the President to certify before the ratification \ndocuments are deposited that the CWC will in no way weaken the \nAustralia Group of nations, of which the United States is a \nparticipant, that has established a cooperative export control regime, \nand that every single nation that participates in the Australia Group \nmust concur that there is no CWC requirement that would weaken the \nGroup's export controls. Then, annually, certification is required to \nthe Congress that the Group's controls have not been weakened. Further, \nthe condition requires the President to block any attempt within the \nAustralia Group to change the Group's view of its obligations under the \nCWC.\n  Condition 16 requires the President to notify Congress if he ever \ndetermines the Convention's secretariat, the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, has willfully divulged confidential \nbusiness information that results in a financial loss or damage to U.S. \ncompany, and to withhold half the United States' annual assessment \ntoward the OPCW's expenses if such a breach occurs and the OPCW does \nnot waive immunity for prosecution of any OPCW official involved in the \nbreach, or if the OPCW refuses to establish an investigatory commission \nto investigate the breach.\n  Condition 15 requires the United States not to contribute to the \nvoluntary fund the CWC establishes for providing chemical weapons \ndefense assistance to other parties to the treaty, and, with regard to \nthe CWC requirement for all treaty parties to assist other party \nnations who have been attacked with chemicals or are threatened with \nsuch an attack, the same condition limits U.S. assistance to those \nnations determined to be adversaries to medical antidotes and \ntreatments.\n\n  Perhaps the least credible argument raised by the CWC's opponents is \nthat this treaty would place unreasonable burdens on America's chemical \nindustry. It would seem that those making this argument have not been \nlistening to what the chemical industry itself has been saying for the \nlast two decades. The chemical industry's reasons for supporting the \nconvention are not altogether altruistic, but they are imminently \nlogical. First and foremost, the chemical industry seeks to \ndisassociate itself from the odious practice of making chemical \nweapons. Equally important, the U.S. industry long ago decided that the \nChemical Weapons Convention would be good for business. The convention \ncontains automatic economic sanctions that preclude treaty members from \ntrading in controlled chemicals with states that do not join. The U.S. \nchemical industry, which is America's largest exporter, views the \nconvention as a way to a more open marketplace. Industry \nrepresentatives describe their obligations under the treaty as \nmanageable and acceptable; to wit, the CWC will not impose inspections, \nregulations, intrusions, or costs greater than those already required \nby other Federal laws and standards.\n  But it is very important to go beyond the fact that the chemical \nindustry believes the CWC will not impose significantly difficult \nburdens on its companies--and look closely at the critical fact that \nU.S. failure to ratify will result in tremendous financial and market \nshare losses--grave in the near term and likely even worse in the \nlonger term--for the U.S. chemical industry. In a letter dated August \n29,\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\n1996, the CEO's of 53 of America's most prominent chemical companies \nbluntly stated: ``Our industry's status as the world's preferred \nsupplier of chemical products may be jeopardized if the United States \ndoes not ratify the convention.'' The American chemical industry would \nbe marked as unreliable and unjustly associated with chemical weapons \nproliferation. If the resolution of ratification of the CWC were to be \ndefeated, it would cost the U.S. chemical industry significant portion \nof its $60 billion export business--many in the industry have agreed on \nan estimate of $600 million a year--and result in the loss of thousands \nof good-paying American jobs.\n  Under the terms of the CWC, some 2,000 U.S. industry facilities--not \ncompanies--will be affected by the treaty. Of that group, some 1,800 \nwill be asked to fill out brief data declaration forms and the \nremaining 200 are likely to undergo inspections. Assertions that the \nneighborhood ``Mom and Pop'' dry cleaners, cosmetics firms, and \nbreweries will be involved in this are wildly inaccurate.\n  In addition, although the industry's representatives explained \npatiently to Senators that the CWC's onsite verification and inspection \nprocedures will not violate a U.S. company's constitutional protection \nagainst undue search or seizure, there is included in the 28 agreed \nconditions condition 28 that requires the United States to obtain a \ncriminal search warrant in the case of any challenge inspection of a \nU.S. facility to which the facility does not give its consent, and to \nobtain an administrative search warrant from a U.S. magistrate judge in \nthe case of any routine inspection of a U.S. facility to which the \nfacility does not give its consent.\n  The U.S. chemical industry led by the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation, the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, \nand the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have \nrepeatedly and unequivocally requested that the Senate approve the \nresolution of ratification and pass its associated implementing \nlegislation. Industry's support of this treaty should not be \nquestioned, it should be applauded.\n\n  It's suprising to see nonindustry people shouting industry concern \nwhen the industry itself was intimately involved in developing the \nconvention and the proposed implementation legislation and is urging \nthe Senate to approve the resolution of ratification. The CEO's or \nother senior executives of seven major chemical firms with significant \noperations in my home State of Massachusetts are among those who have \nrepeatedly urged the Senate to approve the resolution of ratification. \nFrankly, in my judgment, the statements of these executives concerning \nthe effects this convention will have on their businesses are more \ncredible than the contradictory statements of the opponents of the CWC.\n  Also among the arguments against the convention used by its critics \nis the assertion that the CWC will cost the American taxpayers too much \nmoney. On the contrary, the U.S. share of the CWC's monitoring and \ninspection regime, approximately $20 million annually, is far less than \nthe $75 million annual cost to store America's chemical weapons. This \n$20 million of support for the international inspection agency is \nminuscule in comparison to the amounts we spend for U.S. defenses. This \nis a small price to pay to institute and maintain an international \nmechanism that will dramatically reduce the chemical weapons threat \nthat faces U.S. service men and women and establish an international \nnorm for national behavior which is so apparently in the interests of \nthis Nation and, indeed, all the world's people. And, lest the \nestimates of the costs of U.S. participation prove to be low, included \nin the 28 agreed conditions is a condition that limits the U.S. annual \ncontribution to no more than $25 million a year, to be adjusted every \nthird year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.\n  The United States led the international community throughout the \nnegotiation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Three administrations--\ntwo Republican and one Democratic--have labored to develop and place \nbefore the Senate a carefully crafted instrument that will increase the \nsafety and security of U.S. citizens and armed forces and will do so at \nvery reasonable costs to taxpayers, companies that make and use \nlegitimate chemicals, and American consumers. Former Presidents Ford, \nCarter, and Bush have spoken out strongly in favor of ratification. \nToday 1996 Republican Presidential nominee and former Senate Majority \nLeader Robert Dole announced his support for the CWC coupled with the \n28 conditions to which bipartisan agreement has been secured.\n\n  Rarely does one see a situation in which it is more important to \napply the admonition that we would be wise not to let the perfect \nbecome the enemy of the good. Perfect security against chemical weapons \nis unattainable. I have great hopes that wise Senators will not permit \na group of Senators who will not be satisfied by the greatest \nachievable increase in our security, and many of whom have a basic \nobjection to any international arms control treaty to scuttle a \ncarefully engineered agreement that our military leaders, our \nintelligence community senior executives, former Presidents of both \nparties, President Clinton, and 1996 Presidential nominee Dole agree \nwill make all Americans and, indeed, the entire world safer and more \nsecure from chemical weapons.\n  In closing, I want to commend those who have labored diligently to \nbring the Senate to this point. Former Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee Chairman Richard Lugar, with the assistance of his able \nstaff, has done yeoman service and again demonstrated his capacity as a \nleader and statesman. Senator Joe Biden, the ranking Democratic member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, has labored, also with the help of \nhis staff, to bring this treaty before the Senate. Senator Carl Levin, \nranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, and Senate Democratic \nLeader Tom Daschle, each knowledgeable and dedicated, have made \nconsiderable contributions to this effort and to the debate. Majority \nLeader Trent Lott's leadership has permitted negotiation of 28 \nconditions designed to reassure those who in good faith had questions \nand concerns about various aspects of the treaty. I compliment and \nthank all of them.\n  Mr. President the compelling logic of this convention and the breadth \nand depth of support for it should produce an overwhelming vote to \napprove the resolution of ratification. I have great hope that the \nSenate will demonstrate its ability by taking this important step of \nratifying this treaty. I urge my colleagues to vote for the resolution.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, under the new rules governing \naccess to the floor, that Scott Bunton of my staff, be permitted access \nto the Senate floor as long as the Chemical Weapons Convention is being \ndebated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I now invite the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] to take the floor to make whatever comments he \nmay require.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, let me say that there have been a lot of charges made \nback and forth. And certainly I don't question the sincerity of any \nSenators who have spoken on the floor, nor any positions they have \ntaken, nor do I question their motives. They clearly think that they \nare right and that I am wrong. I think I am right. And the right \nposition is not to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts talked about ``lulling'' \npeople into a false sense of security. There is a very interesting \neditorial in the Wall Street Journal on that subject--that people are \ngoing to believe that something is going to be done with this, that it \nis going to eliminate or dramatically reduce chemical weapons. We have \ntestimony from very distinguished, well-known, former Secretaries of \nDefense--four of them--who say that this, in fact, could increase the \nproliferation of chemical weapons around the world, and particularly in \nthe area of rogue nations.\n  Let me just address one other thing because my beloved friend, Bob \nDole,\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\ncame out and changed the position that he had previously had. I \ncertainly don't question his sincerity. But in his letter he said that \nthe conditions or the concerns that he had previously had been met.\n  I happened to stumble onto the letter that was dated September 11, \n1996, from Bob Dole to Trent Lott. I will read the last of one \nparagraph. He says, ``I have three concerns. First, effective \nverification. Do we have confidence that our intelligence will detect \nviolations? Second, real reductions. In this case down to zero.''\n  He is putting an expectation of reducing the use of chemical weapons \n``down to zero.''\n  ``Third, that it will truly be a global treaty.''\n  Mr. President, none of these three have been met--not one of these \nthree conditions; certainly on verification. There is not one person \nwho has stepped onto the floor of this Senate and said that this is a \nverifiable treaty. Nobody claims that it is. It is not verifiable. \nPeople who give us their word that they are not going to do it. That is \nfine. We can believe their word. Are we going to believe countries who \nhave not lived up to their other treaties? Certainly not.\n  In the case of real reductions, ``down to zero''--getting one to say \nthere are going to be any real reductions. Certainly not down to zero. \nNobody has made that statement.\n  And will it be truly global? We have talked about the countries that \nare not a part of this treaty. And there are countries that are not \nlike we are. We are talking about people who murder their own \ngrandchildren, we are talking about Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea. So \nobviously, it is not a global treaty in any sense of the term.\n  In verifiability, it is kind of interesting. After the Persian Gulf \nwar we set up a very meticulous system of verification within the \nUnited Nations that gave the inspectors from the United Nations far \ngreater authority than the inspectors would have under this treaty. Yet \nwe find out that in the midst of all of this that Iraq is making \nchemical weapons as we speak. If you can't do it with the information \nthat they have, and the ability that they have from the United Nations, \ncertainly it is not something that can happen under this treaty.\n  I have another concern. Mr. President, it is not just those who have \nnot signed or who have not ratified the treaty. I look at some of the \ncountries that have signed and they may or may not ratify. The \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, earlier said that 99 \npercent of the known chemical weapons are in three countries: United \nStates, China, and Russia. And not one of those countries has ratified \nthis treaty. I doubt very seriously that they are going to ratify this \ntreaty.\n  So we have all of these conditions that we are talking about that \nassume that, No. 1, those who are signatories to this treaty are going \nto ratify it; and, No. 2, the ones that ratify it will do what they \nhave said they will do.\n  I think it is kind of interesting when you look at Russia, for \nexample. I am not singling them out other than the fact that we have \nhad more treaties with Russia. We have the 1990 Biological Weapons \nDestruction Treaty; the ABM Treaty that goes all the way back to the \n1970's; we have the Strategic Armaments Reduction Treaty, START I; the \nConventional Forces in Europe Treaty, the CFE treaty; and the \nIntermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. In each one of these cases, the \ncountry involved--this country being Russia--has not lived up to the \nprovisions of the treaty. In other words, they ratify a treaty. They \nare a signatory. Then they ratify, go through that elaborate process, \nand then they turn around and don't live up to it. They have been found \nin noncompliance by our State Department--this country--in each one of \nthese five.\n  You have to ask the question: If Russia ratified five treaties and \ndid not comply with any of the five, why would we expect that they \nwould ratify this and not live up to it? One of the conditions that we \nhave is that the Russians will ratify the treaty prior to the time that \nwe would do it. People are saying oh, no, Russia will ratify but only \nif we do. I would like to remind my friends in this body that I was one \nof, I think, three Senators who voted against the START II Treaty and \nthey used the same argument at that time. They said you have to ratify \nthis thing, you have to ratify it before Russia because Russia is not \ngoing to ratify it if we do not ratify it. This is 2 years later, and \nthey still have not ratified it. So we are still waiting.\n\n  So why will you expect if 2 years ago we passed the START II Treaty--\nand I think the Senator from North Carolina and I were two of the four \nvotes that were against it--they said they were going to ratify after \nwe did, and they didn't do it--why would they necessarily do it?\n  This global thing is very significant because here we talk about \nthose who have signed the treaty and those who have ratified the treaty \nand, quite frankly, I do not care if a lot of those who have to ratify \nthis treaty ratify it. I am not at all concerned about Canada, Costa \nRica, the Fiji Islands, Switzerland, Togo, Singapore, Iceland. They are \nnot threats to this country, but there are threats out there.\n  And a minute ago, someone, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, quoted James Woolsey, former CIA Director. It is also \nJames Woolsey who said we know there are somewhere in excess of 25 \nnations that currently have weapons of mass destruction, either \nbiological, chemical, or nuclear and are working on the vehicle means \nto deliver those weapons. And so if these countries have them, these \nare not countries that we are friendly with or think like we do.\n  I have said on the Senate floor several times in the past that I look \nback sometimes wistfully to the days of the cold war, Mr. President, \nwhen they had two superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States of \nAmerica. We had an intelligence system that was pretty well informed. \nWe pretty much knew what they had, and they pretty much knew what we \nhad. Even though they were a threat to this Nation, certainly they were \na threat and a quantity that could be measured and we could anticipate. \nNow we have countries like Iraq, and we have people, as I said before, \nwho murder their own grandchildren and we are talking about the \nQadhafis, Hafez Assads and those individuals who, I think, are a far \ngreater threat in terms of what is available in technology out there \nwith weapons of mass destruction including what we are addressing \ntoday, and that is chemical weapons. So the threat is a very real \nthreat that is out there.\n  I understand from some of my close friends, Republican friends, that \nthere are some of these conditions that they could either take or leave \nand are not as concerned about whether Russia ratifies the treaty in \nadvance; they are not really concerned about whether there are no \ninspectors from terrorist countries. I can't really understand that, \nbut they are concerned understandably about article X. And while \neveryone has put their own interpretation on article X, and instead of \nputting an interpretation on it let me just read. I hope that all of \nAmerica could hear the exact wording of this treaty that we are being \nasked to endorse and to ratify. Section 3 of article X says:\n\n       Each State party undertakes to facilitate and shall have \n     the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of \n     equipment, material and scientific and technological \n     information concerning means of protection against chemical \n     weapons.\n\n  Wait a minute now. We are talking about they would be able to look at \nwhat our defenses against chemical weapons are, not just what we have, \nwhat our technology is, how they might be able to copy our technology.\n  Moving on to section 5, it says:\n\n       The technical secretariat shall establish--\n       Incidentally, Mr. President, does it bother you, that \n     technical secretariat? I always wondered what happened to \n     sovereignty in this country. We have a group sitting over \n     there someplace; we are not sure who they are going to be, \n     but they are called the technical secretariat--\n       Not later than 180 days after entry into force of this \n     convention and maintain for the use of any requesting State \n     party a data bank containing freely available information \n     concerning various means of protection against chemical \n     weapons as well as such information as may be provided by \n     State parties.\n\n  Now, I look at this as a sovereignty issue again, because I do not \nknow who these people are, but I do know this, that we have a lot of \nchemical companies in this country that have not been talked about very \nmuch. You talk about the CMA. That is, as I understand it, 192 chemical \ncompanies. They\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\nare the large ones, but there are somewhere between, it is estimated, 3 \nand 8,000 companies that would be affected by this treaty. Not all of \nthem are chemical companies but about half of them, so you may be \nlooking at 192 large chemical companies and maybe 4,000 small chemical \ncompanies and maybe it would be to their advantage to have very \nstringent requirements like this that would be a lot easier for large \ncompanies to stand behind than small companies.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have so much respect for the three former \nSecretaries of Defense who testified before Senator Helms' committee, \nJames Schlesinger, Don Rumsfeld, and Cap Weinberger. In fact, I have \ntalked to each one of them, along with Dick Cheney, who would have been \nthere to testify, but he was unable to make that schedule. But he has \nsent a letter that has been quoted from several times. These \nindividuals all say essentially the same thing. They say that we are \nbeing asked to ratify a treaty that is not verifiable, that is not \nglobal, that does not have any effect on those countries that are \nconsidered to be our enemies, our adversaries out there. And they are \nout there, Mr. President, and also even those who say they will ratify \nand comply have demonstrated over and over again, such as Russia, that \nthey have not complied with previous treaties.\n  By the way, speaking of Russia, it was interesting; last week in \nJanes Defense News, I read that the Russians had developed a type of \nchemical weapon, and they have developed it out of precursors that are \nnot under this treaty. In other words, there are three precursors that \nthey are using that they can develop these weapons with. So they would \nnot be covered by this. I think maybe that is just a coincidence. Maybe \nthere are other countries out there also that are saying all right, if \nthis Chemical Weapons Convention goes in and we intend to comply with \nthe provisions of it, which they probably are not, what can we do to \nbuild chemical weapons without using those precursor chemicals? And \nthey are already doing it.\n  I would like to share lastly something that all four of these former \nSecretaries of Defense have said. They have said that there is a very \ngood chance being a party to this treaty and ratifying this treaty \ncould increase the proliferation of chemical weapons as opposed to \nreducing them. I would read one paragraph out of Dick Cheney's letter, \nand I do not think anyone is more respected than Dick Cheney in these \nareas.\n\n       Indeed, some aspects of the present convention, notably its \n     obligation to share with potential adversaries like Iran \n     chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for \n     military purposes and chemical defensive equipment, threaten \n     to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all. In my \n     judgment, the treaty's article X and XI amount to a formula \n     for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical \n     warfare capabilities around the globe.\n\n  So I would just say, Mr. President, that there has been a lot of \nlobbying going on, and I know the President's been very busy. I do not \nknow what kind of deals have been made, but I do know that this is not \nsomething that is in the best security interests of the United States. \nI do sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am the chairman of \nthe readiness subcommittee. We are very much concerned about our State \nof readiness in terms of how to defend against chemical warfare. We \ndeal with this subject every day. I am on the Intelligence Committee. \nWe talk about this. But none of us on those two committees know about \nthis as people such as Dick Cheney. I agree with them. We cannot afford \nto take a chance on a flawed treaty that could have the effect of \nincreasing the proliferation of chemical weapons.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require \nto thank the Senator for his comment. He is right on target.\n  I have been around this place quite a while, and I have seen Senators \ncome and go but there is one situation that is endemic to the trade. A \nlot of Senators can be frightened about threats of 30-second television \ncommercials 2 years hence or 4 years hence. But let me tell you \nsomething, every kind of television known to man has been used against \nme about practically every vote I have cast and I am still here. So I \nhave a little policy. I started it the first time I was sworn in. I \nstood over there five times now taking an oath to uphold the \nConstitution and to do my best to defend the best interests of this \ncountry just as the Senator has and just as the Senator has talked \nabout.\n  Now, the media have with one or two rare exceptions totally ignored \nthe appearance of the three former Secretaries of Defense who came \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee. And one of them read the letter \nthat the Senator has just alluded to written by Dick Cheney. I wish all \nAmericans could have heard these three gentlemen and read the letter by \nCheney because they would understand that no matter about the 30-second \ncommercials, no matter about the news media--I have had it all thrown \nat me. You can come to my office and look at the wall and see all the \ncartoons. Every cartoon that they run I put it up on the wall to remind \nme that the media do not count if you stand on principles and do what \nyou think is right.\n  Now, I have an idea satisfactory to myself that a lot of Senators \nwish they could vote against this treaty but they are wondering about \nthe next election. I think they better stop and wonder about the next \ngeneration.\n  I thank the Senator for the fine remarks that he made. I admire the \nSenator very much.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the people of Oregon have firsthand \nknowledge of the dangers of chemical weapons. Stored at the chemical \nweapons depot at Umatilla in the eastern part of my State are millions \nof pounds of chemical weapons. Mustard gas and nerve gas sit in \nconcrete bunkers, a constant reminder of the need for action.\n  We see and hear constant news reports about the dangers facing \nchildren in eastern Oregon every day those weapons sit in those \nstockpiles.\n  There is no place in a civilized society for terror weapons like \nthese, and it is not right to have stockpiles of these weapons that put \nour children at risk. Passing the Chemical Weapons Convention is the \nmost important vote in this Congress for a safer future for our \nchildren. This is a time in my view for the United States to lead \nrather than to retreat. When Presidents Reagan and Bush negotiated this \ntreaty, they fully understood that U.S. leadership was needed to \ncomplete it. They knew that full U.S. participation was essential for \nits work.\n  Not only will failure to ratify this convention put us in the \nposition of being followers on the world's stage but the provisions \nbuilt into this treaty to isolate and in fact economically punish those \nnations which refuse to ratify the treaty are going to apply to the \nUnited States if the Senate does not ratify this treaty.\n  In my State, we believe that we prosper from trade, cultural and \nother exchanges with the rest of the world and that there would be a \nthreat if we failed to ratify this treaty.\n  If the Senate allows America to become an outlaw nation, the effects \nwould be felt by every farmer, software engineer, timber worker and \nfisherman who sell the fruits of their labor overseas.\n  I would like to for just a brief few minutes review the arguments \nagainst this treaty. Some say that it represents a loss of sovereignty, \nbut there is no greater threat to our sovereignty than to run away from \nour role as a world leader. Some say that this treaty would open our \nessential industries to espionage, but there is no question that the \nAmerican chemical companies were consulted on this treaty. They worked \nclosely on the key verification issues and there is enormous support, \nenormous support among those in the chemical industry to approve this \ntreaty.\n  Finally, there are those who say verification is unworkable because \nrogue nations will refuse to ratify it. But the fact is that \nratification of the treaty gives our country new access to information \nabout the chemical weapons programs of other nations. If we are denied \naccess to this vital intelligence, then we will be forced to spend even \nmore on our own intelligence to track the chemical weapons threat.\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\n  The world is watching the Senate now, watching the greatest nation on \nEarth and hoping that we will lead the way to ridding our planet of \nthese poisons. I urge my colleagues to join across party lines and \napprove this treaty, because when it is approved, our world will be a \nsafer place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico \nis recognized.\n  MR. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 633 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that Peter Lyons, a legislative \nfellow working in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor for \ntoday and the remainder of the debate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe it is crucial to American \nleadership and to the security of our men and women in the Armed Forces \nand, indeed, to all of us in America, that the Senate provide its \nadvice and consent to the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention so that the United States can join it as an original party.\n  The security of our men and women in the Armed Forces who someday may \nface the threat of chemicals, the security of our people who constantly \nface the threat of terrorists and terrorist states that try to get \ntheir hands on chemical weapons, all demand that the Senate join as an \noriginal party to this convention and ratify this treaty. To ratify it \nand to make it real, we have to do so without accepting any of the \nkiller amendments that would render this ratification vote useless.\n  I say this, and I reached this conclusion as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee who has listened to our military leaders testify \nbefore us, who has read the testimony of these leaders who have said \nthat the ratification of this convention is unequivocally in our \nnational security interest because it will reduce the risk of our \nmilitary forces encountering chemical weapons on a future battlefield.\n  In 1985, President Reagan signed a law which has resulted in our \nunilaterally destroying our stockpile of chemical weapons. This process \nwill be completed in 2004. The destruction of our chemical weapons will \ntake place, whether or not the United States ratifies the convention. \nWe are destroying our chemical weapons. We are doing so because we \ndecided they are no longer militarily useful and they are too expensive \nto maintain and we have all the capability we need to deter attack and \nto respond to attack. So that President Reagan, in 1985, proposed and \nthe Congress accepted his proposal that we destroy our chemical \nweapons. What this convention will do will be to require other nations \nto do what we are already doing, and that is going to reduce the risk \nof chemical attacks against our troops and our Nation.\n  General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, has had a \ngreat deal to say about this treaty. This is what he wrote on April 8. \nHe said that:\n\n       The ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention by as \n     many nations as possible is in the best interests of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States. The combination [he wrote] \n     of the nonproliferation and disarmament aspects of the \n     convention greatly reduces the likelihood that U.S. forces \n     may encounter chemical weapons in a regional conflict. The \n     protection of the young men and women in our forces, should \n     they have to go in harm's way in the future, is strengthened, \n     not diminished, by the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       We do not need chemical weapons to provide an effective \n     deterrent or to deliver an effective response.\n\n  When the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, every member--every \nsingle member of the Joint Chiefs, and every combatant commander have \nreached the same conclusion, that the ratification of this treaty is in \nour national security interests and will reduce the likelihood of our \nmen and women ever facing chemicals in combat, it seems to me we should \nlisten. When they tell us that we are already unilaterally destroying \nour stockpile of chemical weapons and that what we are doing by joining \nthis convention is being in a position where we will be able to help \nreduce the risk that others will obtain chemical weapons, we should \nlisten. And when they tell us that they know that this is not perfectly \nverifiable but that this will reduce the chances that chemical weapons \nwill fall in hands of terrorist states or terrorist organizations or \nindividuals--when our top military leaders tell us that, we should \nlisten.\n\n  They have acknowledged what everyone has acknowledged. There is no \nway to perfectly verify a chemical weapons convention. But what they \nhave also told us is that following their analysis of this treaty, that \nbecause of the intense inspection regime which is provided for here, \nthat we will be able to reduce the risk that any militarily significant \namount of chemicals will fall into the hands of an opponent or a future \nopponent. It is not a matter of perfection, they tell us. It is a \nmatter of improving our current position. That sounds like a security \nbargain to them and it ought to sound like a security bargain to us. \nOur senior military leaders have a unique perspective on what makes our \nmilitary stronger or more secure. And they have agreed. They have \nagreed that this treaty is good for our security. All the Chiefs of \nStaff, as I have said, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the \ncombatant commanders have urged that we ratify this treaty.\n  This is the way General Shalikashvili made that point. He said, ``I \nfully support early ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and \nI reflect the views of the Joint Chiefs and the combatant commanders.''\n  The previous Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Powell, spoke very \nforcefully on this issue just last week. He was addressing the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee on April 17 during a hearing on gulf war \nillness, but he said this relative to the convention on chemical \nweapons:\n\n       I think one of the greatest things we can do over the next \n     2 weeks is to pass the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. \n     This is a good treaty. It serves our national interest. That \n     is why it was negotiated beginning in Ronald Reagan's term, \n     and I helped participate [The ``I,'' here, being Colin \n     Powell]--I helped participate in those negotiations as \n     National Security Adviser, and that is why we signed it in \n     the administration of President Bush. And I participated in \n     the development of the treaty during those days as Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I supported the treaty then \n     and I support it now.\n\n  Then General Powell went on to say the following:\n\n       There are some uncertainties associated with the treaty and \n     there are some criticisms of the treaty. I think those \n     criticisms can be answered and dealt with. But we should not \n     overlook the simple fact that, with the treaty, the United \n     States joins over 160 nations in saying to the world that \n     chemical weapons will not be used, will not be made, will not \n     be developed, will not be produced, and we will not share the \n     technology associated with chemical weapons with other \n     nations who are inclined to use them inside or outside the \n     confines of this treaty.\n\n  Then he went on to say the following:\n\n       Not to participate in this treaty, for us to reject the \n     treaty that we designed, we signed, for us to reject that \n     treaty now because there are rogue states outside that treaty \n     is the equivalent of saying we should not have joined NATO \n     because Russia was not a part of NATO. It's exactly because \n     there are these rogue states that we should join with an \n     alliance of over 160 nations to make a clear international \n     statement that these are rogue nations.\n\n  And he concludes:\n\n       Not signing the treaty does not make them no longer rogue \n     nations. So I think this is a fine treaty and it is one of \n     the things the Senate can do to start to get a better handle \n     on the use of these weapons of mass destruction and \n     especially chemical weapons.\n\n  Mr. President, Secretary Cohen addressed the Chemical Weapons \nConvention at great length before the Armed Services Committee.\n  I ask the Chair whether or not I have used up the 10 minutes that I \nallotted myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my Chair. I will just yield myself 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, Secretary Cohen, our former colleague Bill Cohen, has \ntestified before the Armed Services Committee on this subject. He has \nfiled\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nsome lengthy testimony supporting the Chemical Weapons Convention. To \nsummarize what he said, and here again I am quoting:\n\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention is both a disarmament and \n     nonproliferation treaty. It is very much in our national \n     security interest because it establishes an international \n     mandate for the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, \n     because it prohibits the development, retention, storage, \n     preparations for use, and use of chemical weapons, because it \n     increases the probability of detecting militarily significant \n     violations of the CWC.\n\n  And, here he said that:\n\n       While no treaty is 100 percent verifiable, the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention contains complementary and overlapping \n     declaration and inspection requirements which increase the \n     probability of detecting militarily significant violations of \n     the convention. While detecting illicit production of small \n     quantities of chemical weapons will be extremely difficult, \n     it is easier to detect large-scale production, filling and \n     stockpiling of chemical weapons over time through \n     declaration, routine inspections, factfinding, consultation \n     and challenge inspection mechanisms. The verification regime \n     should prove effective in providing information on \n     significant chemical weapons programs that would not \n     otherwise be available.\n\n  In conclusion, there has been reference to a classified session \ntomorrow, which will be held relative to advice from the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Relative to this point, I will only say that the Acting Director of \nCentral Intelligence, George Tenet, has said, ``The more tools we have \nat our disposal, the better off we feel we are in our business.'' And \nhe said that as part of an acknowledgment that we can never guarantee \nthat a power that signs up to this agreement will not cheat. ``No \nregime is foolproof, particularly with regard to these dual-use \ncapabilities. Nothing is going to guarantee success but,'' George Tenet \nconcluded, ``the more tools we have at our disposal, the better off we \nare in our business.''\n  I also hope that our colleagues will come to that classified session \ntomorrow. I am very confident that they will conclude, as I have \nconcluded after listening to the intelligence community, that it is \nvery much in our interest, from an intelligence perspective, that we \nhave these tools in our tool kit, and that these additional \nverification and inspection capabilities are very, very much in our \nNation's interest.\n  This treaty will enter into force on April 29 whether or not we \nratify, but our ratification will make a big difference in the effect \nthe treaty has on us and on our leadership in the world. Is it perfect? \nNo, nothing in life is. Is it an improvement to our present position in \nterms of inspection of other countries? Surely it is, and we should \nlisten to that top uniformed military official, General Shalikashvili, \nwhen he tells us our troops are safer, because if we ratify this \nconvention, it is less likely--not certain--but less likely that they \nwill ever face chemical weapons in combat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and if my good friend from Rhode \nIsland is ready, I will be happy to yield him 7 minutes. If there is \nnobody on the other side, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the chorus of \nsupport for the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. As a \nformer company commander in the 82d Airborne Division, I have a keen \ninterest in an international diplomatic agreement that will protect \nsoldiers from one of the most terrible perils of war. As a Senator, I \nbelieve that the United States has a duty to assume a leadership role \nin this ambitious, global effort to not only reduce, but eliminate, an \nentire class of weapons of mass destruction.\n  U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is a paramount \nfirst step in removing the threat of chemical warfare on the \nbattlefield. Soldiers in World War I were the first to know the terror \nof the release of poison gas. Over 1.3 million soldiers were injured or \nkilled by chlorine and mustard gas during the Great War. This enormous \nnumber of casualties led to the negotiation of the Geneva Protocol in \n1925 which banned the use of chemical weapons in wartime. Eighty years \nlater, however, young soldiers are still plagued by the dangers of \nchemical warfare. Many veterans of the Persian Gulf war fight illness \nand lie awake at night, worrying and wondering, ``Was there something \nin the air?''\n  But this is not a treaty which will just protect soldiers in a time \nof armed conflict, it is a treaty which will protect innocent civilians \nfrom terrorist attacks. The 1995 Sarin gas attack in a crowded Tokyo \nsubway that killed and injured dozens made this scenario a reality for \neveryone. It is imperative that we do what is necessary to ensure that \nsuch an incident becomes a distant memory rather than a daily fear.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, \nacquisition, stockpiling, transfer or use of chemical weapons by \nsignatories. It requires the destruction of all chemical weapon \nstockpiles and production facilities. Parties to the convention must \nbegin to destroy weapons within 1 year and complete the process within \n10 years. If we ratify this treaty, we will take an important step \ntoward eliminating the production, storage and use of blister agents, \nlike mustard gas, which destroy exposed skin tissue; of choking agents \nthat inflame the bronchial tubes and lungs and cause asphyxiation; of \nblood agents that block the circulation of oxygen when inhaled; and of \nnerve agents that cause the nervous system to overload, resulting in \nrespiratory failure and death. The goal of this treaty is to ensure \nthat these deadly chemicals will never again be dispersed over troops \nor civilian populations by bombs, rockets, missiles, artillery, mines, \ngrenades or spray.\n  Chemical weapons are terrifying because they kill quickly, silently, \nand indiscriminately. Even more disturbing is the fact that their \nproduction is easy, cheap and simple to conceal. With a little know-\nhow, a solvent used in pen ink can be converted into mustard gas and a \nchemical common in pesticides becomes an ingredient in a deadly nerve \nagent. It must be acknowledged that eliminating chemical weapons is a \nherculean task. But the Chemical Weapons Convention, which we are \nfinally considering today, addresses this challenge. This treaty is the \nmost comprehensive arms control agreement ever negotiated. It \ninstitutes an extensive and intrusive verification regime which will \ninclude both government and civilian facilities. International teams of \ninspectors will conduct instrument-monitoring as well as routine and \nrandom onsite inspections of facilities known to work with chemical \nagents. Furthermore, it allows challenge inspections, without right of \nrefusal, of sites suspected of producing or storing chemical weapons. \nThe convention also requires export controls and reporting requirements \non chemicals that can be used as chemical warfare agents and their \nprecursors. In addition, the treaty establishes the Organization for \nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], a permanent body which will \noversee the convention's implementation and ensure compliance. The \nenemy is elusive but 162 signatory countries decided this treaty was \nthe best means of waging war against chemical weapons.\n\n  In January 1993, President Bush joined dozens of other nations in \nParis and agreed to meet the challenge of eliminating chemical weapons \nby signing the Chemical Weapons Convention. Now some members of this \nchamber, members of President Bush's own party, are second-guessing \nthat decision. The problem is that if we drag our feet any longer, the \nUnited States will be left behind. April 29, 1997 is not an artificial \ndeadline imposed by a political party. One of the provisions of the \ntreaty is that it enters into force 180 days after the ratification by \nthe 65th country, and in 6 days, on April 29, the 74 nations who have \nratified the treaty will begin its implementation. If we do not vote to \nratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, we will not stop it. In fact, \nwe will not even become a passive bystander. Instead, we will become \nthe target of the trade restrictions that make this treaty so powerful.\n  Now, no one can say the Senate has not had ample opportunity to \nconsider this agreement. Thirteen years and two administrations ago, \nPresident Reagan proposed this treaty to the United Nations. It was \napproved by the United Nations in 1992 and President Bush signed the \nconvention weeks before he left office. Several months later, President \nClinton presented the CWC to the\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nSenate for consideration. The Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed \nServices, Intelligence, and Judiciary held 17 hearings over three \nCongresses. The administration has provided the Senate with over 1,500 \npages of information. In the past 2 months, the administration and a \ntask force formed by the majority leader have held almost 60 hours of \ndiscussion. Twenty-eight additional conditions, statements, \nunderstandings, and declarations to the resolution of ratification have \nbeen reached. The overwhelming evidence persuasively argues that now is \nthe time to ratify this treaty.\n  Ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention complements the existing \nmilitary strategy of the United States. We are already committed to \nunilateral destruction of our chemical weapons. In the early 1980's, \nthe Department of Defense declared about 90 percent of our Nation's \nchemical weapons obsolete. In 1985, Congress directed destruction of \nthese weapons. President Reagan signed the law that would eliminate \napproximately 30,000 metric tons of blister and nerve agents by the \nyear 2004. Even President Reagan, one of the greatest advocates of a \nstrong military, decided that chemical weapons were not needed to \nremain the most powerful fighting force in the world.\n  We have much to gain by ratification. This treaty will force other \nnations to adopt the same standard as the United States. The monitoring \nregime and trade restrictions imposed by the convention will make the \nproduction and storage of chemical weapons by rogue states infinitely \nmore difficult and costly. The CWC improves our ability to keep our \ntroops safe and makes the enemy more vulnerable by reducing its options \nof weaponry.\n  If we do not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, we will abdicate \nour leadership role in the world. As I have said before, the United \nStates initiated this treaty. It was American leadership that led the \nnegotiations through to completion. It would be irresponsible, both to \nAmericans and the world, to abandon the convention on the eve of \nimplementation. If we do not ratify this treaty tomorrow, the United \nStates will not be able to participate in the executive council which \nwill oversee the implementation of the treaty. Furthermore, U.S. \ncitizens will not be eligible to become international inspectors and \nserve in other key positions. The ratifying countries will be forced to \ncarry on our idea without us, and the United States will have no choice \nbut to stand aside and watch.\n  Without our expertise and support, the entire convention may be \njeopardized. One of the key elements of the treaty is intelligence \ngathering. The United States has the most sophisticated intelligence \nnetwork in the world. If our country refuses to participate, we deny \nour intelligence community the opportunity to tap into new sources of \ninformation and we may cripple the verification regime by denying the \ninternational community the benefits of our knowledge.\n\n  In addition, the United States is the only nation with extensive \nexperience in destroying chemical weapons. We are also the only country \ninvesting heavily in research and development to find methods other \nthan incineration to destroy these weapons. Without our advice, \nparticipants in the convention risk inadvertent but dangerous accidents \nand may squander scarce financial resources attempting to reinvent the \nwheel in learning how to destroy weapons. Furthermore, if the entire \ninternational community pools its resources, both intellectual and \nfinancial, to discover safe, environmentally sound methods of \ndestruction, the development time would certainly be reduced. If we \nshow reluctance to ratify the treaty, we will undermine the confidence \nand commitment of the entire international community. It is counting on \nus to continue to lead the way.\n  There are critics of this treaty, but their criticism, I think, \nmisses the mark. This will not inhibit our business, it will help our \nchemical business. This treaty is not perfect, but it is a better tool \nfor controlling weapons than having no treaty whatsoever. We are, I \nhope, committed to the path of destruction of our own weapons and to \nensure that the rest of the world follows this very prudent, indeed, \nnoble course.\n  Vocal critics of the Chemical Weapons Convention claim that it is \nfatally flawed. They state that we should not ratify this treaty \nbecause we will not be able to verify that chemical weapons are \ncompletely eliminated. Of course this treaty is not perfect. But we \nwill have increased our capability to find and eliminate large scale \nproduction of chemical weapons which can cause the most damage. The \nverification regime will also enable us to discover production and \nstorage of small quantities of chemical weapons that we have little or \nno chance of discovering now. The CWC is not a panacea, but no law or \ntreaty is. It is a tool that can help us solve a problem. Isn't it \nbetter to use the tool to try and fix the problem rather than simply \nadmit defeat?\n  Critics also contend that the treaty cannot be effective until all \nnations, particularly those who are known to possess chemical weapons, \nratify the convention. It will be impossible to convince every rogue \nstate to sign the treaty. It is also safe to say that some who sign the \ntreaty will cheat. But the CWC is designed to isolate and cajole those \nwho do not join. The treaty uses a most effective weapon against rogue \nstates--economics. Trade restrictions will be implemented against these \nnations and they will soon be unable to acquire ``dual use'' chemicals \nwhich they need for the production of common items. As these nations \nbegin to feel the pressures from shortages, they may find it \nadvantageous to sign the treaty. Trade restrictions are one of the most \neffective weapons that the international community has.\n  In an era when balancing the budget is of primary importance, it is \nnot sunrising that opponents cite the cost of joining the treaty as a \nreason for not ratifying it. I cannot dispute that there is a financial \nprice for joining the convention. Most of the costs will be incurred \nfor maintaining the activities of the Organization for the Prohibition \nof Chemical Weapons [OPCW]. These costs will be apportioned according \nto a system similar to the one used by other international \norganizations. In addition, each signatory which destroys its stockpile \nmust repay the OPCW for costs associated with verification. In his \nbudget, the President requested about 20 cents per American to pay for \nCWC costs, a small price for the elimination of chemical weapons. \nFurthermore, members of this body can ensure that this cost does not \nescalate in the future, because the conditions agreed to in the Senate \nExecutive Resolution allow Congress to control future payments by \ngranting it the authority to authorize and appropriate any funds above \nthis level. The cost of the CWC is reasonable, and certainly less than \nthe cost of ``going it alone'' or entering a battlefield where chemical \nweapons are being used.\n\n  Critics of the CWC claim that American private businesses will bear \nthe brunt of the treaty provisions. However, the U.S. chemical \nindustry, the private business which will be most affected by this \ntreaty, heartily endorses its ratification. Contrary to what some have \nclaimed, the burden on industry has not been discounted or ignored. The \nmajor trade associations which represent the chemical industry, like \nthe US Chemical Manufacturers Association, have actively worked with \nthose writing the treaty for the past 15 years. The chemical industry \nhelped develop the confidentiality provisions, the data declarations \nand the inspection regime. Certain companies even participated in the \nNational Trial Inspections to test the verification procedures outlined \nin the Chemical Weapons Convention. In addition, the conditions agreed \nto in the Senate Executive Resolution further protect businesses from \nunreasonable searches and seizures and the dissemination of \nconfidential information. Less than 2,000 facilities will be affected \nby the treaty, and the vast majority of these must do no more than \ncomplete an annual two page form.\n  Opponents of the Convention claim they are protecting American \nbusiness interests. But American businesses seem to disagree. They \nfear, in fact, that the Senate will not ratify the treaty. Ironically, \nif we do not make the right decision tomorrow, our chemical companies \nwill become subject to the same trade restrictions that will be imposed \non non-signatories such as Libya, Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria. \nMore than $600 million a year in sales could be lost. Treaty critics \nare\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nprotesting so loudly, they seem unable to hear the voices of the \nconstituencies they claim to protect.\n  We have overcome many hurdles to reach this point: Years of \nnegotiations among the nations of the world, months of negotiations \namong the leaders of this Nation. We are finally debating this treaty \non the floor of the Senate today because we have agreed to an \nunprecedented 28 conditions--28 duties, declarations and understandings \nadded to a treaty which was proposed, negotiated and agreed to by \nRepublican administrations. But, unfortunately, five hurdles remain. \nFive conditions demanded by opponents of this treaty may prevent the \nUnited States from assuming its proper role of leadership in an \nambitious arms control treaty. These conditions unacceptably compromise \nthe treaty and the ability of the United States to participate in its \nimplementation. These conditions are simply not fair play. Every member \nof this body has a right to oppose this treaty. They can voice their \nopposition by voting against it and their opinion will be respected. \nBut hobbling the ability of the United States to ratify the Chemical \nWeapons Convention strikes an unwarranted blow to international arms \ncontrol and our political process. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthese five killer conditions.\n  Mr. President, 34 years ago, President John F. Kennedy undertook the \nchallenge to convince the Senate and the people of the United States of \nAmerica should ratify the Limited Test Ban Treaty. The same questions \nwere raised about verification, about the reliability of those who \nmight sign the treaty or who might not sign the treaty. In a nationwide \ntelevision address, President Kennedy reminded us:\n\n       We have a great obligation . . . to use whatever time \n     remains to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to persuade \n     other countries not to test, transfer, acquire, possess or \n     produce such weapons.\n       According to the ancient Chinese proverb, ``A journey of a \n     thousand miles must begin with a single step.'' My fellow \n     Americans, let us take that first step. Let us, if we can, \n     step back from the shadows of war and seek out the way of \n     peace. And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, \n     let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took \n     the first step.\n\n  Complementing the President's words, though, were the words of a very \nwise, distinguished statesman of the Chamber, Senator Everett Dirksen \nof Illinois. In September of that year, 1963, he came to this Chamber \nand began a speech, but threw the pages away and spoke spontaneously \nfrom his heart and said:\n\n       A young President calls this treaty the first step. I want \n     to take a first step, Mr. President. One my age thinks about \n     his destiny a little. I should not like to have written on my \n     tombstone, ``He knew what happened at Hiroshima, but he did \n     not take a first step . . .''\n\n  We know what happened in World War I with poison gas. We know what \nhappened in the Tokyo subway with sarin gas. Let us not have it said on \nour tombstone that we knew but were unwilling to take a first step. Let \nus, like the statesmen before us, take a first step to control weapons, \nto reduce weapons, to provide a more peaceful, a more dignified world.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will take that first step and discharge our \nobligation to the world and to the citizens of this great country.\n\n       On the eve of the vote to ratify another historic \n     agreement, one that seeks not just to limit weapons of mass \n     destruction, but eliminate them, the words of President \n     Kennedy and Senator Dirksen still ring true. We have an \n     obligation to take the first step. Let us do so.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I listened in amazement to some of the \nstatements being made today about a nonexistent treaty. The treaty \nbefore us I understand, but I do not understand the descriptions that \nsome are indicating that they believe are accurate.\n  Furthermore, I was astonished at the number of companies that will be \nrequired to provide annual business information and undergo routine \nannual inspections under this arms control treaty, and that is what it \nis, an arms control treaty.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention, so-called, will affect companies \nengaged in coke, coal, steel production, mining, crop protection, \nfertilizers, paper production, wood preservation, chlorine \nmanufacturing, color pigments, paint, ink, die stuff production, \nspeciality coatings, powder and roof coatings, plating and packaging, \ncompressed gas, cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances, drug chemicals \nmanufacturing, pharmaceuticals, plastics, textiles, custom chemicals, \nfood, wine, beer, processing and electronics, among others.\n  The list I just read, as long as it is, is not all of them. So \nanybody sitting in television land listening to this conversation in \nthe Senate today, I suggest, as the saying goes, wake up and smell the \ncoffee and give some thought about what is going to happen to the \nbusiness community if, as and when this treaty is ratified.\n  It is not an ethereal thing that is floating through the air, \ndropping little rose petals, it is something that can bollix this \ncountry up. And yet what you hear from so much of the media and so much \nof the White House and other proponents of this treaty is simply not \nso.\n  I note, however, that even this long list does not cover companies \nlikely to be affected by the CWC, and I simply do not believe it \nadvisable for the Senate to learn belatedly the far-reaching \nimplications of this treaty for businesses of all kinds across the \nUnited States of America. As the April 15, 1997, hearing, recently, \nbefore the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations demonstrated, \ncompliance costs--compliance costs, the cost of complying with this \ntreaty--will place a massive new regulatory burden upon so many \ncompanies who don't even know it is going to hit them, along with an \nunprecedented onsite inspections and data declarations that may very \nwell compromise trade secrets vital to the competitive edge of many, \nmany businesses.\n  So you see, we are dealing with a lot of untrue, inaccurate \nstatements. I am not saying everybody is deliberately distorting the \nfacts. In the media, they do not know what it is all about. I did see \nHelen Dewar the other day sitting down and having lunch reading the \ntreaty. Bless her heart, she was trying. She looked up and said, ``I'm \ntrying to understand this.'' Well, Helen Dewar is a great reporter with \na not so great newspaper, but she was sitting there eating her lunch \nwith the treaty before her.\n  I would like to take a poll of all the people who have commented on \nthis treaty and see how many of them have even looked at it. That is \nthe problem. That is the problem. But at our hearing the other day, a \nnumber of companies, including two members of the Chemical \nManufacturers Association, provided testimony relating to rising \nconcerns about the chemical weapons treaty.\n\n  Now, then, here is a fact, indisputable: Companies will have to bear \nan entirely new reporting burden beyond anything required by, say, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency or the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration or the International Trade Commission or the Census \nBureau--and just name the various State and local agencies that require \nreports.\n  Nobody says that on Pennsylvania Avenue about those reports, about \nthe paperwork. Oh, no, we are not going to mention that because they \nmight ask us too many questions. That is precisely the problem. \nEverybody has been dancing around the truth on this treaty. As a \nconsequence, too few Americans understand the scope of it.\n  For those businesses that are covered, current reporting thresholds \nare much higher than those required under the CWC. Some regulations \nrequire only prospective rather than retroactive reporting. Moreover, \nseveral environmental regulations--how do you like them apples?--will \napply to the chemical producers but not to processors or consumers. And \nreporting deadlines for the chemical weapons treaty are shorter and \nwill require more frequent updates than estimates currently required by \nthe EPA.\n  So, if you would like to file reports with the EPA, you will file \nmore reports with this chemical weapons treaty. The regulations imposed \nby EPA and OSHA and all the others, in 1992 alone, 1 year, cost the \nchemical industry approximately $4 billion--$4 billion with a ``B''--\n$4.9 billion.\n  Now, isn't it a bit incredible that one major chemical manufacturer \nemploys 1,700 of its 50,000 personnel for the sole\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\npurpose of satisfying Federal and State requirements for environmental \nand regulatory data? That is why, Mr. President, I am concerned that \nwhile large, international chemical industries such as those \nrepresented by the Chemical Manufacturers Association may be able to \nafford the cost of the new regulations as a result of the ratification \nof this chemical weapons treaty, these same requirements will be \nproportionately far more burdensome for small businesses. That was the \npoint that Don Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense, made when he \nappeared before the Foreign Relations Committee. But that was kept a \nsecret by the news media. They hardly touched on anything that the four \nformer Secretaries of Defense came and testified to. Well, let me \ncorrect that. One of them, it was delayed at the last moment, sent a \nletter.\n  Now then, there are roughly 230 small businesses which custom \nsynthesize made-to-order products and compete with the large chemical \nmanufacturers. They generally have fewer than 100 employees. They are \nsmall businesses, and they have annual sales of less than $40 million \neach.\n  Few, if any, of them can afford to employ the legions of lawyers just \nto satisfy the new reporting requirements of this chemical weapons \ntreaty. Nobody talks about that. Sandy Berger down at the White House \nhas not even mentioned it. He is telling Trent Lott and all the rest \nwhat to do. Yet, Bob Dole writes letters, but they did not talk about \nthe details of the impact and the burden to be piled on the small \nbusinesses of America.\n  It will not be reported in tomorrow's paper. You will not hear a \nthing about it unless you are looking at C-SPAN. That is one thing \nwrong with this country today--no warning is given the American people \nabout some of the actions and some of the proposals that come up in the \nCongress of the United States.\n  Mr. President, equally as important, Senators should be careful to \nnote that the onsite inspection provisions of the CWC increase the \npotential for compromising proprietary information which is offered as \nthe very basis for a company's competitive edge. Many companies will \nnot survive if they had to do without their competitive edge.\n  While it may be difficult to assess the potential dollar losses \nassociated with the inspections under the chemical weapons treaty, it \nis clear, Mr. President, it is absolutely clear, that information \ngleaned from inspections and data declarations could be worth literally \nmillions and millions of dollars to foreign competitors. You better \nbelieve that they will be digging for it every time they get a chance. \nSo that is what some of us have been talking about and some of us have \nbeen pleading, let us get this thing straightened out before we make \nthe mistake of ratifying this treaty.\n  Let me tell you something. I do not enjoy having my shirttail on fire \nin the newspapers and on television about opposing a treaty that the \nnewspapers and the television programs say is a wonderful treaty. But I \nstood there, as I said earlier this afternoon, five times, and I have \ntaken the oath of office as a Senator. A part of that oath, I say to \nyou, Mr. President, is to support the Constitution of the United \nStates, defend it, and defend the American people. I have done my best \nto do that for every year that I have been here.\n  So as Don Rumsfeld, the former Secretary of Defense, emphasized in \nhis testimony during his appearance, which was unnoticed by the news \nmedia, his appearance before the Foreign Relations Committee, Don \nRumsfeld emphasized that the greatest threat is not--is not--to the \nlarge, diversified chemical manufacturers who have the lobbyists \nlobbying for this treaty--you fall all over the lobbyists--but it is \ngoing to be the threat to other companies that are trying to \nconcentrate on a single market or a particular technological nature.\n  A company whose profitability and economic survival derives from the \ncost or quality advantage in one type of process will be particularly \nvulnerable to industrial espionage.\n  One other thing. For some companies even visual inspection might \nreveal a unique process configuration of great value to a would-be \ncompetitor.\n  While big chemical businesses routinely undergo Federal inspections, \nthe chemical weapons treaty will allow a whole cadre of international \ninspectors from countries routinely engaging in economic espionage to \ninspect hundreds of facilities around the United States on a recurring \nbasis.\n  Among the companies potentially hardest hit by treaty inspections \nwill be those companies that engage in technologically intensive \napplications, such as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors as \nwell as the manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft, \nmissiles, space-launch vehicles, and other equipment of a highly \nsensitive nature. The economic integrity of these companies is \nessential not only to the economic stability of the United States, \ndon't you see, but in many cases to our future national security.\n  I, for one, was not surprised to have discovered that the Aerospace \nIndustries Association stated in a March 13, 1997, letter to the \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate:\n\n       We are very concerned, however, that the application of the \n     Convention's reporting and inspection regime to AIA member \n     company facilities could unnecessary jeopardize our nation's \n     ability to protect its national security information and \n     proprietary technological data.\n\n  At this point I am going to pause so that Senator Brownback can be \nrecognized.\n  We had several of those favoring the treaty in a row, and I think it \nis fair for Senator Brownback to be recognized--for how long?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Seven minutes, if I could.\n  Mr. HELMS. Seven, eight minutes. I yield to the Senator for that \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding \nto me for a few minutes to discuss this critical issue in front of the \nU.S. Senate, the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I would like to state at the very outset of my statement that I would \nlike to be on record that as to the earlier vote we had today of \nsupporting the CWC treaty that came to the floor earlier, that we had \nan oral vote on, that I support that treaty. I support it. And I will \ngo into the reasons why I supported that and why I will have problems \nultimately voting for it if we do not hold tightly to what hit the \nfloor earlier.\n  Mr. President, I just want to talk about this as a couple people \nwould perhaps talk about it if they were sitting somewhere across this \ncountry, somewhere in my State of Kansas, and how they look at the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  I think they would sit down and ask themselves: If we enter into this \nChemical Weapons Convention Treaty, will it be less likely for chemical \nweapons to be used in the world or will it be more likely for chemical \nweapons to be used in the world? It seems to me that that is the real \ncrucible that we have to decide this under: Is it more likely or less \nlikely if we enter into this treaty?\n  I take this treaty obligation very seriously. I chair the Middle East \nSubcommittee for Foreign Affairs, the region of the world where perhaps \nyou have the most concentration and the most potentially recent use of \nchemical weapons happening in a battle situation. This is a very \nimportant issue in that region of the world. It is a very important \nissue in the United States as far as, are we going to be able to rid \nthe world of these terrible, horrible weapons of mass destruction? I \ntake that very seriously. So I have sat and I have visited with a \nnumber of people, experts on both sides.\n  On Monday I did maybe an unusual thing for a Senator. I read the \ntreaty. The parts of it I had not read, I have now read the treaty. I \nneed to get on through the attachments, but I have gone through this. I \nhave looked at the arguments. I have looked particularly at the \nproblems. I have looked at the overall good aspects of it, and I want \nto say that I do strongly support the objectives of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. We must oppose the use and existence of chemical \nweapons. There is just no doubt about it. They are an abomination that \nneeds to be removed from the face of the Earth. We all agree on that.\n  But it is actually for that reason, however, that I have some great \ndifficulties with one particular provision--a number of them within the\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\ntreaty actually, but one in particular. That is article X of this \ntreaty. It is for that reason, if that is left in this treaty, I do not \nthink that I can support the overall vote, if article X is left in.\n\n  Let me say why. The Chemical Weapons Convention, if that is left in, \nI believe will have the exact opposite of the intended effect. And that \nis, as I said at the outset, are we going to have more chemical weapons \nused or less? If article X is left in, I fear greatly we are going to \nhave more use of chemical weapons taking place even though the purpose \nis exactly the opposite.\n  Let me say why. Article X requires nations to share defensive \ntechnology regarding chemical weapons. It is something that has been \ndiscussed at some length. The particular paragraph reads this way:\n\n       Each State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have \n     the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of \n     equipment, material and scientific and technological \n     information concerning means of protection against chemical \n     weapons.\n\n  In other words, we are going to be sharing technology, particularly \ndefensive technology, which is very high technology in many of these \nareas. I fear that that technology is going to more easily get into the \nhands of rogue nations, like Iran. I am very concerned about their \ngetting weapons of mass destruction.\n  We had a hearing last week in the Middle East Subcommittee regarding \nthe threat and the expansion of Iran's capacity for mass destruction. \nThe Chinese--and this is unclassified information--have sold precursor \nchemical weapons to the Iranians. This has in fact occurred. They do \nnot use that without defensive technology to support their own troops, \nyet this treaty will make the possibility of their getting that \ndefensive technology more likely, if not even ordered within the \ntreaty.\n  You can say, wait a minute. That is just your interpretation. Well, \nlet us look at what Secretary Cheney has said on this, former Defense \nSecretary Dick Cheney, an admirable man, who served in the House of \nRepresentatives, also in the administration under President Bush. He \nsays this about this treaty:\n\n       [the] obligation to share with potential adversaries like \n     Iran, chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for \n     military purposes and chemical defensive equipment, threaten \n     to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all.\n\n  Then he is joined, of course, as you know, by former Defense \nSecretaries Schlesinger, Weinberger, Rumsfeld, and others.\n  Now you say, well, this is not going to happen. That is just not \ngoing to occur. We are not going to have people selling them this sort \nof technology, either us or other nations. And maybe we will not do it. \nBut will other nations then step forward and sell this defensive \ntechnology? You say no, that will not happen. There have been people \nalready pointing out the fact that actually that has already occurred \nunder some previous treaties--the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \nbeing one where the Russians now cite to us that treaty as a reason for \nthem to sell nuclear production capacity to the Iranians, citing the \nvery treaty we entered into to stop this from taking place and that is \nused back against this to try to expand. And now the Iranians having \nthis capacity, we are trying to stop this nuclear generator from \ngetting fully online for the Iranians. And the Russians cite a \nnonproliferation treaty that they have to share this technology with \nthe Iranians.\n\n  That certainly is not the intent. I am very fearful we will repeat \nthe same mistakes of history here. We have to stop the abomination of \nchemical weapons. We have to stop it in the United States. We have to \nstop it in the world. We have to stop the abomination of these weapons \nof mass destruction, these terrible weapons of mass destruction being \nused. The way to do that is to have a CWC treaty that actually does it \nand doesn't spread their use. And striking article X is the way to do \nthat. With that, even though the treaty has a number of other problems, \nit is supportable. Without that, I actually fear the opposite will \noccur.\n  And with that I would like to yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In 30 seconds, I will yield 12 minutes to my friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, I am holding up in my hand here a declaration form for \nthose firms that face reporting requirements for production of discrete \norganic chemicals, which applies to about 1,800 firms. It is three \npages long. I will at a later time read into the Record what it asks \nfor to show you how non-onerous it is.\n  On one of the pages of instructions, on the bottom of the page, it \nsays,\n\n       You do not have to declare unscheduled discrete organic \n     chemical plant sites that produce explosives exclusively, \n     produce hydrocarbons exclusively, refine sulfur-containing \n     crude oil, produce oligomers and polymers, whether or not \n     containing PSF, and produce unscheduled discrete organic \n     chemicals via a biological or bio-mediated process.\n\n  This eliminates thousands of firms, hundreds of firms at least. And \nso this is not nearly as onerous as it was made out to be in my humble \nopinion.\n  I now yield with the permission of my colleagues 12 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for \nyielding me this time. I have sought recognition to voice my support \nfor the pending treaty and to give my reasons.\n  Long before the current debate on chemical weapons, in my college \nthesis, which I wrote back at the University of Pennsylvania in 1951, \non United States-Soviet relations, I was convinced by Prof. Hans \nMorganthau's dictum that ``the objectives of foreign policy must be \ndefined in terms of the national interest and must be supported with \nadequate power.''\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have long advocated a strong national defense \nand have worked to shape a comprehensive arms control agenda for the \nUnited States as one arrow in our overall defense quiver.\n  Ten years ago, in 1987, in Geneva, Switzerland, I was an observer to \nthe U.S.-USSR nuclear disarmament talks. That year I debated \nextensively with many of my colleagues in the Chamber the need for a \nbroad interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, ABM. Many of \nthose whom I opposed at that time I now side with on the current issue. \nI still believe that the approach for a broad interpretation to give \nthe United States additional power, an approach advocated by President \nReagan, was necessary and still remains necessary to provide security \nfor our Nation.\n\n  From my experience on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nI have observed that strength is the best guarantor of peace and that \nprudent arms control can provide an important basis for such strength. \nFrom my work as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have \nseen the wisdom of President Reagan's view that verification not trust \nis the realistic basis for arms control.\n  Verification is an important issue in this treaty. It is true that \nthis treaty does not guarantee verification and no treaty has or can \nguarantee absolute certainty on verification. However, ratifying this \ntreaty gives us far greater opportunity to verify through inspections, \ndata collection, and establishing a norm for chemical arms reduction.\n  Mr. President, I adhere to my position on the need to secure a strong \ndefense for America. It is my belief that the Chemical Weapons \nConvention will complement the existing components of our foreign \npolicy which includes our arms control treaties. As we continue to work \nto protect our troops abroad and our citizens at home from the threat \nof weapons of mass destruction, arms control is an important ingredient \nof a sound foreign policy.\n  Critics of the Chemical Weapons Convention say the treaty provides a \nfalse sense of security. On the contrary, no Senator has ever suggested \nthat a single treaty standing alone would adequately deter aggressor \nnations. The Chemical Weapons Convention is not perfect but we can \nbuild on it as a parameter for dialog. Ratification certainly does not \nmean that we are going to rest on our laurels. The United States did \nnot stop moving forward with strengthening our national defense while \nwe negotiated arms control\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nagreements with the Russians such as the ABM Treaty, SALT I, and SALT \nII. In this combined approach we were successful. The nuclear threat \ntoday is dramatically lower than it was a decade or two decades ago, \nand arms control agreements are a critical part of that strategy.\n  Similarly, we must not stop at mere ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention in our quest to destroy existing and prevent the \nproduction of new chemical and biological weapons. One area of the \ntreaty critics often point to as being particularly detrimental to the \nUnited States is the search and seizure provisions of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention which they claim is unconstitutional.\n  This is a subject that I have worked on extensively since Mapp versus \nOhio came down in 1961 imposing the burden on States not to admit \nevidence seized as a result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. \nAt a time when I was an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and \nlater as district attorney of Philadelphia, I worked on these issues \nvery, very extensively. Under this treaty, an international inspection \nteam would be allowed to search a U.S. facility to determine whether or \nnot a chemical agent is being diverted to use in noncompliance with the \ntreaty. Similarly, that obligation, that inspection would be available \nfor other nations.\n  After careful review of the provisions of the treaty, I am personally \nconfident that the language does not conflict with the fourth amendment \nof the U.S. Constitution but, rather, is in accord with that amendment. \nThe language on search and seizure as negotiated by the administration \nand Members of the Senate states that in cases where the search is \nchallenged, the U.S. Government will first obtain a criminal search \nwarrant based upon probable cause. So that in any situation of \nchallenge, the search will have to measure up to the tough criminal \nstandard. In cases of routine inspection, the U.S. Government will \nobtain an administrative search warrant from a U.S. magistrate judge.\n  Through the months preceding this debate, opponents have raised a \nnumber of issues. These include suggestions that the treaty plays into \nthe hands of rogue nations like Libya and North Korea, that it \nfacilitates the transfer of military chemical technology to aggressive \ncountries and prohibits our troops from the use of riot control agents.\n\n  There is now agreement on these issues among all the parties involved \nin negotiating the set of conditions now contained in the proposed \nresolution of ratification. The Chemical Weapons Convention will \nactually make it more difficult for rogue states to make chemical \nweapons. The treaty has prohibitions in place to prevent industrial \nespionage. Concerning riot control agents, the treaty sets sound \nguidelines on what agents may be used and when such agents may be used.\n  As we debate the merits of the treaty and consider the outstanding \namendments, I remind my colleagues of the importance of bipartisanship \nin foreign affairs. We have traditionally said that politics stop at \nthe water's edge and bipartisanship in foreign affairs is of critical \ncontinuing importance. It is the role of Senators to shape a climate of \nbipartisan support for treaties of this magnitude. To work with the \nadministration and our colleagues to craft an agreement that will serve \nthe needs of the United States in both the long and short terms. Two of \nour noteworthy predecessors, giants in the Senate, one Republican and \none Democrat, Senator Arthur Vandenberg and Senator Scoop Jackson \nexemplify how bipartisanship can work to the betterment of our country. \nTheir willingness to look beyond the confines of partisan politics \nprovides the model for us today as Republicans to support the \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  And I note, Mr. President, the statement today made by our former \nmajority leader, Senator Robert Dole, in support of the treaty.\n  There is another much more recent example of why ratification of the \ntreaty falls outside traditional partisan politics and that is the \npotential use of chemical agents against U.S. troops. This is an issue \nabout which I am all too familiar. As former chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee and as the current chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have chaired several hearings on gulf war \nsyndrome. I have traveled extensively throughout Pennsylvania and have \nheard from gulf war veterans who have been unable to explain the cause \nof their illnesses. And many gulf war veterans across the Nation echo \nsimilar complaints. Believe me when I say that their suffering is very \nreal.\n  Last year, this issue was addressed in great detail at a joint \nhearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. This year a number of hearings have been held both in \nWashington and across Pennsylvania. And more recently, a few days ago, \non April 17, Gen. Colin Powell testified before the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee on this important matter. While we can still not verify the \ncause of these illnesses, there are indicators that American troops may \nhave been exposed to chemical agents. During the course of the hearing \nwith General Powell, I asked him what effect if any the Chemical \nWeapons Convention would have had on Iraq if the United States had \nratified the treaty before the gulf war and the treaty would have been \nin effect.\n  We will never know with certainty the answer to that question. Iraq \nis a rogue nation, and it is difficult to imagine them as signatories. \nBut General Powell was quick to point out that the Chemical Weapons \nConvention works to strengthen America's hand.\n  He noted, ``In the future, when we deal with rogue states or with \nsignatory states, we will be speaking from the position not of \nunilateral American action, but with the support of most of the nations \nof the world.''\n  I suggest to my colleagues that it is a matter of considerable \nimportance in protecting American troops from the ravages of chemical \nwarfare, which the gulf war troops may have been exposed to.\n  Now, we must ask ourselves, if we had this treaty in place \nbeforehand, would we have at least averted or minimized the effects of \nchemical agents on our troops? We will never know the answer to this \nquestion with certainty, but we owe it to our Nation to reach out for \nevery possible means of reducing the threat of chemical and biological \nweapons. United States ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nhowever, may certainly constrain the further development of chemical \nweapons by countries like Iraq.\n  Mr. President, it is obviously impossible to craft a comprehensive \ntreaty that meets the satisfaction of all people. I respect those who \nhave spoken against the treaty. I disagree with them, but I respect the \nsincerity of their views. Yet, with the appropriate assurances given \nabout some of the finer points of the treaty on objections which have \nbeen raised by opponents, most of which have been satisfied, on issues \nsuch as constitutional rights, we as a Nation, I submit, should take \nthe moral high ground. We should ratify the treaty, or we will be \ncategorized with the likes of Iraq and Libya. I am not advocating that \nwe ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention instead of pursuing other \nforms of protection. But it is one important point of protection. The \nChemical Weapons Convention is just one more tool for the United States \nas we work toward a more vigilant defense for our Nation. We have come \na long way in making this treaty work for the best interests of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote to ratify this convention.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of the \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the spirit that these negotiations began \nwith me and the chairman of the committee and Senator Kyl, we have \ncontinued that spirit. The next speaker we have is undeclared. So we \nhave agreed for a total of 7 minutes he will get. We ask unanimous \nconsent that 3\\1/2\\ minutes be taken out of the time of the Senator \nfrom Delaware and 3\\1/2\\ minutes out of the time of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Further, Mr. President, before I yield the floor to my \nfriend from Washington State, we are trying to work out a unanimous-\nconsent agreement on the total 10 hours. I am not propounding such an \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\n But we are hoping we can work out an agreement, whereby in the closed \nsession tomorrow, the so-called secret session that will take place \ntomorrow, which will be a 2-hour session, that that time not be counted \nagainst the 10 hours in the UC for debate on chemical weapons.\n  Again, I will leave it in the able hands of my friend from Arizona to \ndetermine whether the Republican leader is amenable to that, but \ncolleagues who may be listening hopefully were able to do that. The \nreason I stand up to say that, if they are not, each of us only have \nabout 55 minutes left tomorrow in this process. So for the colleagues \nwho wish to speak, I want them to understand that I am not going to \nhave the time to give them if in fact this doesn't happen. This is by \nway of disclaimer this evening, so tomorrow morning my colleagues won't \ncome in and say: Joe, you promised me time.\n  I think we can work it out.\n  Mr. President, we now yield a total of 7 minutes, 3\\1/2\\ from each \nside, to the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I want to introduce \nmy remarks by expressing my view that this has been a remarkably \nthoughtful and important debate in the finest traditions of the Senate, \nnot only here on the Senate floor but during the months leading up to \nit. Perhaps one of the reasons for that is that all Members are united \nin detesting the use of chemical weapons, divided only by their views \non how best to succeed in reaching that goal, and working toward \nreaching that goal with a high degree of good will and accommodation to \none another. So, essentially, from the beginning, the only real \nquestion has been: Does this convention advance or inhibit the cause of \nlimiting or eliminating the use of chemical weapons all around the \nworld?\n  Mr. President, at the very beginning of the debate when the \nconvention was first submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee, I \nwas inclined to fall on the side of that debate that said that the \nconvention probably was worse than nothing because of the overwhelming \nfalse sense of security it created, a sense of security that it could \nnot match in its provisions on a wide range of activities attempted to \nbe covered by it.\n  But as we vote tomorrow, Mr. President, I don't believe we are going \nto be voting on the original bare bones understanding of the \nconvention. The administration and the proponents on this floor have \nagreed to some 28 conditions, or explanations, or interpretations of \nthe convention, each of which has contributed to a greater degree of \ncomfort with the balance of the convention and its ratification. Three \nare particularly important to me. One measure ensures that the Chemical \nWeapons Convention does not lead to a false sense of security--a false \nsense that is going to be there no matter what we do, but is at least \nlimited by some specific promises on the part of the administration.\n  Second, the clarification of the affect of the convention on the use \nof riot control agents.\n  Third, and vitally important to us and to our constitutional rights, \nare the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches and \nseizures.\n  That is not to say that the other 25 conditions aren't important, Mr. \nPresident, but these 3, at least, have been particularly significant, \nin my view, as I have listened to both sides during the course of this \ndebate.\n  Nevertheless, I am not yet willing at this point to commit to voting \nin favor of ratification because of my deep concerns with articles X \nand XI of the convention, and the proposition that they might well \nforce the United States to share technologies and allow the world, by \nits sale of chemicals, to a far greater extent, and those technologies \nand chemicals may be sold at least by responsible and free nations in \nthe world today under the aegis of the Australia Group.\n  It would be ironic indeed if, in the guise of passing a treaty or a \nconvention to lessen the opportunity for the use of chemical weapons in \nthe future we actually enhanced it by assisting those nations that are \nwilling to sign the convention but which, like Iran, have shown, \nwithout the slightest ability to contradict the proposition, that they \ndo not regard any treaty, any convention, as binding on them, and who \nare more likely than not to use the convention to advance their own \nability to violate it.\n  And so, Mr. President, as I make up my own mind during the course of \nthe next 24 hours, it is the impact of articles X and XI that cause me \nthe greatest degree of concern. I don't believe that we can simply \nstrike them from the treaty. That vote tomorrow seems to me to be the \nequivalent of saying, no, of killing the convention in its entirety. I \ndo believe, however, that we should continue to work toward \nclarification and understandings on the part of the administration, as \nI know the majority leader is doing in this, as he has in many of the \nother questionable elements of this convention, so that we can be \nassured that the United States at least will not be required to do \nsomething that will undercut its own security and that of its friends \nand neighbors by the convention, that it is not required to do in the \nabsence of that convention.\n  So if my concerns with respect to the actual impact in the real world \nof articles X and XI are met, I will vote to ratify the convention. If \nthey are not, it will remain, in my mind, a situation in which the \nconvention increases our danger rather than obviates them.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes in accordance \nwith the understanding on the floor now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, while the Senate debates one of the \nmost important arms control treaties in our history, various issues \ncome into play. It is obvious that the Chemical Weapons Convention will \nban an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. It prohibits the \nfull spectrum of activities associated with the offensive use of \nchemical weapons, including development, production, acquisition, \nstockpiling, and assistance to anyone engaging in these activities. It \nrequires that the destruction of chemical weapons begin within 1 year \nand it be completed within 10 years.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt in my mind that the United States \nshould join a treaty we helped to shape and which enhances our \nsecurity. I am going to vote for it. Now, with the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and our leadership, other nations will follow the lead that \nwe set years ago by giving up chemical weapons.\n  Rogue nations and terrorist countries will have a harder time \nacquiring or making chemical weapons, and new tools will be available \nto prevent and punish them if they try. That is a noble goal.\n  One of the arguments that we have heard against ratifying the \nChemical Weapons Convention is that it will force some industries --one \nin particular--to bear an unusual burden. I want to address this for a \nfew minutes because I don't believe it is true. To the contrary, the \nchemical industry will bear an undue burden if the United States fails \nto ratify the CWC. I want to explain why.\n\n  If the Chemical Weapons Convention goes into effect without the \nUnited States a party, strict trade restrictions designed to pressure \nrogue states to join the convention would spell disaster for the U.S. \nchemical industry. Reasonably enough, neither Presidents Reagan nor \nBush ever foresaw that the U.S. Senate might decide to place the United \nStates outside of the treaty, along with countries like Iraq, Libya, \nand other rogue nations.\n  But the fact is that treaty provisions prohibiting members from \ntrading with nonmembers in certain chemicals that have both commercial \nas well as military uses would put at risk as much as $600 million a \nyear in two-way trade by American chemical companies, and many jobs.\n  I will repeat that. Should the U.S. Senate fail to ratify the treaty, \nas much as $600 million a year in American export and import sales \nwould be\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\nplaced at risk as a result of sanctions against American companies.\n  On April 15, Fred Webber, who is the president and CEO of the \nChemical Manufacturers Association, testified in support of this \ntreaty. He said:\n\n       The industry I represent is America's largest export \n     industry, with over 1 million American jobs * * * we know how \n     this treaty affects our commercial interests. * * * We began \n     with many of the same concerns about the treaty that have \n     been voiced here. We worked hard to protect U.S. industrial \n     interests, especially proprietary information.\n       We helped develop the protocols guiding the treaty's \n     inspection and recordkeeping requirements, and we put those \n     protocols to live-fire tests over and over again. * * * In \n     summary, we believe the treaty is not a threat to U.S. \n     business.\n\n  Not only does the CWC have the support of the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation, which represents 193 chemical manufacturing companies, \naccounting for more than 90 percent of the Nation's productive capacity \nfor basic chemicals, it has the support of the Chemical Industry \nCouncil of New Jersey and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation, with over 260 member companies.\n  It also has the support of the Pharmaceutical Research and \nManufacturers of America and its 100 plus member companies, and the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization and its 650-plus member companies \nand affiliated organizations. It has the support of the Council for \nChemical Research, the American Crop Protection Association, the \nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers, and the American Chemical \nSociety.\n  Mr. President, the point I am trying to make is simple--the Senate \ncannot refuse to ratify the CWC in the name of industry. American \nindustry supports this treaty. It does not believe it places an unfair \nburden on companies in this country.\n  In fact, U.S. companies view the convention as an asset because it \noffers a way to dissociate themselves from chemical weapons production \nand to be good corporate citizens by helping to eliminate these \nabhorrent weapons.\n  American industry even participated in the treaty negotiations and \nhelped write the rules covering inspections and confidential business \ninformation. Its top priority during the negotiations conducted by the \nReagan and Bush administrations was ensuring that any burdens on \nbusiness would be reasonable and that trade secrets would be protected. \nTo ensure that the protections against unreasonable searches and \nseizures and industrial espionage would be strong, the chemical \nindustry tested the treaty during seven full-fledged trial inspections \nat chemical facilities. It ensured that warrants would be required when \na company would not consent to a search and that the treaty would \nprotect sensitive equipment, information, or areas not related to \nchemical weapons during a challenge inspection. For most companies in \nthis country--more than 90 percent of the 2,000 American companies that \nwill be covered by the treaty--the treaty will require them to do \nlittle more than fill out a two-page form once a year. Only about 140 \ncompanies are likely to be subject to routine inspections.\n\n  In addition to the protections negotiated by industry and already in \nthe treaty, the Senate will be adding five additional protections.\n  Under additional conditions that will be added by the Senate, if an \nemployee of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \nwillfully discloses U.S. confidential business information that causes \nfinancial harm to a U.S. business, the President is required to \nwithhold half of the U.S. contribution to the organization until that \nemployee's immunity from prosecution is waived. This will serve as a \ndeterrent to breaches of confidential information.\n  To reduce the risk of industrial espionage, samples collected during \ninspections in the United States cannot be analyzed in a foreign \nlaboratory. The President would be required to certify annually that \nthe CWC is not significantly harming the legitimate commercial \nactivities and interests of chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical \nfirms.\n  The Senate would support the provision of assistance to U.S. business \nby the On-Site Inspection Agency. And, the Senate would be informed \npromptly of the proposed addition of a chemical to any of the CWC's \nschedules and the anticipated effect of such a proposal on U.S. \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, this treaty enhances America's security. It is the \nright thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to ratify it without delay.\n  I hope that my colleagues will stand up and say this is good for \nAmerica, that it is good for humanity, and that they will ratify this \ntreaty without delay.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. While some of my colleagues may have other means of \nmeasuring this convention, I believe when we consider any arms control \ntreaty, the main concern must be how it will affect our national \nsecurity. I support this treaty because, on balance, our Nation's \nsecurity will be vastly improved in a world where chemical weapons are \noutlawed than in a world where the possession of these horrible weapons \nremains an acceptable practice.\n  I believe it is important for all in this Chamber and for the public \nat large to realize that today the United States is committed to \ndestroying all of our chemical weapons. Under a law passed by Congress \nand signed by President Reagan in 1985, we will destroy all of our \nchemical weapons stockpile by the year 2004. Further, in 1991 President \nBush committed the United States to banning chemical weapons and \nforeswore their use even in retaliation upon the Chemical Weapons \nTreaty entering into force.\n  Many of those who have spoken out against this treaty imply that \npossession of chemical weapons is the only deterrent against a chemical \nweapons attack by an adversary. However, in the judgment of our \npolitical and military leaders, our Nation does not require chemical \nweapons to defend our Nation. In fact, the United States has already \nbegun the process of destroying all our chemical weapons. Our Nation \nreserves the right to retaliate against a chemical weapons attack with \noverwhelming conventional force or any other means at our disposal. The \nUnited States can and will defend itself against any foe armed with a \nweapon of mass destruction. We do not need these ghastly weapons to \nensure the safety of our military personnel and our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I also believe it is important to note this treaty was \nnegotiated and signed under two Republican Presidents and transmitted \nfor ratification under a Democratic President. The Chemical Weapons \nConvention is an example of how U.S. foreign policy can be bipartisan \nand how both parties can act outside the shadow of political \nmaneuvering when it is in the best interests of our Nation. Presidents \nReagan, Bush, and Clinton realized the benefits we receive under a \ntreaty banning the possession of chemical weapons could far outweigh \nany costs incurred by our industries and Nation.\n  No treaty is perfect. As with other treaties, the Senate has included \nconditions to the resolution of ratification which I believe strengthen \nthis accord. But opponents of the convention have added five conditions \nmeant not to improve but to kill the treaty. These five provisions must \nbe struck from the treaty if we are to receive the national security \nbenefits the CWC offers our Nation.\n  The opposition to this treaty centers on three questionable and \ncontradictory points. First, opponents state that since this treaty is \nnot absolutely verifiable, the U.S. Senate should not ratify it. \nSecond, contradicting the first point, opponents state this treaty's \nverification regime, while not strict enough, nevertheless places too \nmuch of a burden on our chemical industry. And, third, opponents state \nthat since rogue nations may either not join the Chemical Weapons \nConvention or will not comply with the treaty once they become \nsignatories, this treaty does not further our national security \ninterests. I believe they are wrong on all points.\n\n  No treaty--be it an arms control treaty, a trade treaty, or a \nhumanitarian treaty--is completely verifiable. If absolute \nverifiability is the marker, no treaty could attain that ideal and our \nNation would never experience the varied benefits we now gain from \ntreaties such as the SALT Treaties, the START Treaties, GATT, NAFTA, \nthe\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\nConvention on Fishing, or the Convention on Literary and Artistic \nCopyrights. Absolute verification should not be the measure of the CWC \nor any other treaty. Instead of insisting on absolute verification, our \nNation has realized the strength of a treaty lies in the enforcement of \nthe treaty and the measure to be taken if a party violates a treaty. \nAmerica's treaties work because our treaty partners know the full power \nof the United States lies behind the conventions and we do not hesitate \nto protect our national interests by enforcing their provisions.\n  When considering ratification of an arms control treaty, the question \nmust be whether on balance the verification system is strong enough to \nsignificantly increase our national security. It is a simple fact that \nthe verification measures included in this treaty are the most \nstringent and most intrusive of any multilateral arms control agreement \ncurrently in place. While still not powerful enough to allow searches \nof every warehouse, laboratory, or garage in the world, the means to be \nemployed under the CWC are the most thorough and most rational ever to \nbe included in a multilateral international agreement.\n  The Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations all realized the nature \nof chemical weapons and their production created the need for a \nstringent system to verify compliance with the CWC provisions. And yet, \nsome safeguards and limitations on the verification system would have \nto be put in place in order to protect companies engaged in legitimate \nchemicals from unwarranted hardships. Under President Bush's direction, \nthe proper balance was struck between the strength and rigors of a \nverification regime on one hand and the intrusiveness of that same \nsystem on our industry and Nation on the other. Under the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, measures are in place which will severely increase \nthe likelihood an illicit producer of chemical weapons will be caught \nwhile ensuring that any company that produces or uses potentially \ndangerous chemicals will not be unnecessarily burdened.\n  Mr. President, some opponents argue that the treaty has it wrong both \nways--they claim it is not intrusive enough to be completely verifiable \nand also claim the costs incurred by industry are too great under the \nverification regime. While the nature of all treaties makes them \ncorrect on the former point, since no treaty can reasonably be \nconsidered absolutely verifiable, the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation, which represents hundreds of chemical companies, and \nhundreds of individual chemical companies on their own have expressed \ntheir support for this treaty.\n  If the vast majority of companies that produce or use chemicals \npronounce their support for this agreement, I do not believe we should \nclaim the treaty is unduly burdensome on these companies. They know \nwhat is in their own interest and they have stated their support for \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Opponents also argue that since rogue nations can be expected not to \njoin in the CWC or will not comply with its provisions the United \nStates should not endorse this treaty. This argument overlooks the fact \nthat even if the Chemical Weapons Convention does not enter into force \nthese same rogue nations can develop and produce chemical weapons. \nWithout the CWC we will still face this same threat.\n  Yet, if we ratify the CWC and are vigorous in its enforcement, the \nUnited States will have a much improved ability to identify clandestine \nchemical weapons programs. The nature of chemical weapons make it \npossible to produce them in facilities as small as a high school \nlaboratory or even a garage. Because these weapons of mass destruction \ncan be produced in small areas, the intelligence community today faces \nextreme difficulties in locating programs already underway in rogue \nnations. However, as the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence noted \nin its September 1994 report on this issue, under the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, the United States Government will gain important new access \nto useful information, relevant to potential CWC threats to the United \nStates, that would not otherwise be obtainable. As Acting Director of \nCentral Intelligence George Tenet told the Intelligence Committee on \nFebruary 5 of this year, the CWC will give our intelligence community \nmore information and more tools to use in our efforts to combat those \nwho would use these horrible weapons.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention's regular inspection process and its \nability to perform challenge inspections on short notice are very \npowerful means of catching parties breaking the treaty. The convention \nalso includes varied reporting requirements on the production and use \nof toxic agents and precursor chemicals which may help the intelligence \nagencies to locate clandestine production of chemical weapons. If the \nChemical Weapons Convention is ratified and we use it to our advantage, \nthe intelligence community will have another important tool with which \nto fight the battle against these weapons. If we do not ratify the \nconvention, we will forgo a better chance to win a battle we must fight \nwhether or not this treaty is in effect.\n  The CWC will help protect our citizens by increasing the likelihood \nthat a potential cheater would be caught under its inspection \nprocesses. But the CWC helps our national security in other ways as \nwell. Three years after entry into force, the Chemical Weapons \nConvention prohibits parties from exporting high risk precursor and \ntoxic chemicals to countries not belonging to the CWC. This will \nfurther limit the ability of nonsignatory countries to acquire \nchemicals which could be turned into a lethal gas. Finally, the power \nof international law created by the CWC against the possession of \nchemical weapons will assist our own Nation's continuing efforts \nagainst this abominable class of weapons.\n  Taken together, the benefits we gain from ratifying the Chemical \nWeapons Convention far outweigh the minimal costs of implementing this \ntreaty. The strict verification regime, increased opportunities for our \nintelligence agencies, the prohibition of exports to nonmember nations, \nand the force of international law complementing the United States' \nindividual efforts will help protect our citizens and our national \ninterests.\n  We have already made the decision that possession and use of chemical \nweapons is not in the security interests of our Nation. We have \ndetermined the United States has the means and the will to protect our \nforces and our Nation without this type of weapon. It is time now to \ncompel the other nations of the world to abide by these same rules.\n  Mr. President, I have weighed the effects of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention on our national security and I believe our Nation is safer \nwith this treaty than without it. It is my hope my colleagues will also \nrealize that our national security interests lie in ratification, not \nin maintaining the status quo of a world where possession of chemical \nweapons remains acceptable under international law. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a day many of us have been \nwaiting for for a long time. After having been thoroughly reviewed by \nthe relevant Senate committees, both in the last Congress and this one, \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention has finally come to the Senate floor \nfor debate and a vote.\n  This is a complex and controversial treaty and I thank Senator Helms, \nSenator Biden, and others for their hard work on the resolution of \nratification. The 28 conditions and provisions on which they have \nagreed go a long way toward protecting American interests and making \nthis an even better treaty. While I have reservations about the \nremaining five provisions, I am pleased that the Senate will have the \nopportunity to openly discuss and debate these before moving to a final \nvote. I believe that when the facts come to light, those who are \nundecided will vote to ratify the treaty.\n  I think I can safely say that no one in this body supports the \nproduction or use of chemical weapons, even as a deterrent. That is not \nwhat this debate is about. What it is about is what we get for what we \ngive up. In other words, is the extra protection from chemical weapons \nthat this treaty affords us worth the financial cost and the regulatory \nburden required to implement the treaty?\n  Well, let's take a look. First, what do we get?\n  Above all, we get enhanced national security. The treaty requires all \nsignatories to do away with chemical\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\nweapons and to refrain from any future production. We have already \ncommitted to destroy our own chemical weapons stocks, so why shouldn't \nwe grasp an opportunity to require others to do so as well? I think \nthis is a compelling argument. So do a few other people who know \nsomething about national security matters: General Powell, General \nSchwarzkopf, and every living former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. Believe me, if this treaty weakened the United States in some \nway these distinguished Americans would not support it.\n  With a reduction in the number of chemical weapons we also get \nincreased protection for U.S. troops. We have a responsibility to our \nbrave men and women in uniform to do all we can to protect them as they \nput their lives on the line for our freedoms. We spare no expense to \nprovide them with the best chemical weapons defenses possible. By the \nsame token, we should do all we can to reduce the actual threat of a \nchemical weapons attack on them. Recognizing this, a number of the \ncountry's most prominent veterans' groups and military associations \nhave spoken out in favor of the CWC, including the VFW and the Reserve \nOfficer Association. They recognize the extra protection this treaty \nprovides our troops in the field.\n\n  The CWC also improves our ability to detect chemical weapons \nproduction by others. This treaty boasts the most intrusive \nverification regime of any arms control agreement ever. Will it enable \nus to sniff out every violation, every criminal effort to produce these \nhorrible weapons? Of course not. But it will give us a powerful new \ntool to check up on those who seek to employ chemical weapons, \nsomething that is important to the intelligence community. Opponents \npoint out that U.S. intelligence agencies cannot absolutely guarantee \nthey will be able to detect treaty cheaters. This is true. But it is \nalso true that the treaty will significantly improve our ability to \nuncover violations. Let's not make the perfect an enemy of the good.\n  Finally, the CWC also stiffens international resolve to deal with the \nchemical weapons threat. Every signatory will be required to enact \nlegislation cracking down on terrorists and criminals who use or \nthreaten to use poison gas, as well as the unsavory businessmen who \ntraffic in these dangerous chemicals. Last week the Senate passed a \nbill which would tighten U.S. laws in this area. Isn't it in our \ninterest, in this ever-shrinking world, to make sure that others also \ntoughen their laws against chemical weapons production? Moreover, a \nbroadly accepted international regime outlawing this class of weapons \naltogether will put us on a much stronger footing to respond to serious \nviolations, including by force if necessary.\n  So with the CWC we get enhanced national security, better protection \nfor U.S. troops, improved ability to detect violations, and stiffened \ninternational resolve in addressing this global problem.\n  That's a pretty valuable package. What do we give up to get it? Well, \nwe must pay our share of the costs for administering the treaty and \ncarrying out required inspections. We must also underwrite costs \nassociated with preparing U.S. military facilities for inspection. I \nunderstand that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nimplementation of the CWC would cost the U.S. taxpayer about $33 \nmillion a year. That's about one-twentieth of the amount that we spend \nevery year on chemical and biological weapons defenses. I think that's \na reasonable investment to reduce the core threat against which these \ndefenses are needed.\n  The treaty does impose additional reporting and inspection \nrequirements on American businesses in the chemical field. This is \nregrettable but necessary if we wish to have a serious verification \nregime. It's worth noting, though, that the U.S. chemical industry was \nclosely involved in the negotiation of the treaty and strongly supports \nit. I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by smaller businesses \naffected by the treaty but believe that some treaty opponents have \nvastly exaggerated the additional regulatory burden involved. As I \nunderstand it, the vast majority of these businesses will need do no \nmore than submit a short, basic informational form annually. And only a \nhandful are likely to be inspected in any given year. This is a small \nprice to pay for the many benefits of the treaty.\n  Finally, I would like to address the argument that the United States \nshould withhold ratification until Russia and all the so-called rogue \nstates sign and ratify the treaty. The issue is not whether we should \npress these countries to join the treaty--of course, we should--but how \nto most effectively achieve this goal. Does anyone really think that \nwithholding U.S. ratification will convince these countries to sign up? \nStanding on the sidelines with arms folded will only give encouragement \nto those who want to ignore this treaty and continue making chemical \nweapons. The United States is a world leader and should act like one. \nWe should not allow thugs like Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein to dictate \nour approach to national security matters.\n  Mr. President, this treaty is good for America and good for the \nworld. It's not perfect. What international treaty is? But it serves \nour interests and improves our security. For these reasons, I will vote \nto ratify and encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the 29-year-old pursuit for a chemical \nweapons treaty has finally reached its moment of truth in the United \nStates Senate. Few votes cast in this Congress or any Congress are \nlikely to be more important.\n  The effort to achieve this treaty was launched in 1968, and its \nhistory is genuinely bipartisan. In that year, the final year of the \nJohnson administration, international negotiations began in Geneva to \nbuild on the 1925 Geneva Protocol and try to reduce the production of \nchemical weapons. In the 1970's, President Gerald Ford had the vision \nto take that initiative a major step forward during intense \ninternational negotiations.\n  President Ronald Reagan advanced it to the next stage with his \nefforts on arms control in the 1980's. And President Bush deserves high \npraise for embracing the ideal of eliminating chemical weapons, for \nmaking it a serious worldwide effort, and at long last bringing it to \nthe stage where it was ready to be signed. In one of his last acts in \noffice, George Bush signed the treaty, on January 13, 1993.\n  President Clinton formally submitted the Chemical Weapons Convention \nto the Senate for its advice and consent later that year. Now, it's our \nturn. Today and tomorrow, in a series of votes, the Senate can and \nshould join in this historic endeavor to rid the world of chemical \nweapons. We can bestow a precious gift on generations to come by \nfreeing the world of an entire class of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The chemical weapons treaty bans the development, production, \nstockpiling, and use of toxic chemicals as weapons. Previous agreements \nhave merely limited weapons of mass destruction. But the Chemical \nWeapons Convention sets out to eliminate them from the face of the \nearth.\n  The United States has already taken many steps unilaterally to \nimplement a ban of our own. As long ago as 1968, this country ordered a \nmoratorium on chemical weapons production.\n  When President Bush signed the treaty on behalf of the United States, \nhe also ordered the unilateral destruction of the U.S. stockpile of \nthese weapons. Regardless of the treaty, the United States is \ndestroying its chemical weapon stockpile.\n  Today and tomorrow culminate many years of work and compromise. The \nSenate has held 17 hearings on the convention. Every issue has been \nexhaustively analyzed. The result is the shootout that the leadership \nhas arranged for the next 24 hours.\n  Bipartisan negotiations have achieved agreement on 28 amendments to \nthe treaty, none of which go to the heart of the treaty and many of \nwhich help to clarify it.\n  But five major issues have not yet been settled. The five amendments, \non which we will vote tomorrow, seek to settle differences of opinion \nthe wrong way. They are killer amendments. I hope the Senate will vote \n``no'' on each of them. If any one of them passes, it will doom our \nparticipation in the treaty, and relegate us to the company of outlaw \nregimes like North Korea and Libya, who also reject the treaty.\n  Two of the killer amendments condition our participation on whether \nother nations--Russia, Iran, Iraq,\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nSyria, and China--have already become participants. Essentially, they \nwould hand over U.S. security decisions to those nations.\n  A third killer amendment arbitrarily excludes all representatives \nfrom certain other countries from participating in verification \ninspections. This amendment ignores the ability that the treaty already \ngives us to reject any inspectors we believe are not trustworthy.\n  A fourth killer amendment omits and alters other key parts of the \ntreaty that deal with the export of certain materials. Its proponents \nfear that rogue nations may gain valuable technology from us. Nothing \nin the convention requires the United States to weaken its export \ncontrols. Experts in the chemical industry, trade organizations, and \nGovernment officials have worked to ensure that nothing in the treaty \nthreatens our technology and industrial power.\n  The fifth killer amendment places an unrealistically high standard of \nverification on the treaty. It requires the treaty verification \nprocedures to accomplish the impossible, by being able to detect small, \nnot militarily significant, amounts of dangerous chemical materials.\n  No international agreement can effectively police small amounts of \nraw materials that might possibly be used in chemical weapon \nproduction. Every effort is being made and will be made to make the \ndetection procedures as effective as possible. It is hypocritical for \nopponents to attempt to scuttle this treaty because they feel it does \nnot go far enough.\n  The overwhelming majority of past and present foreign policy \nofficials, military leaders, large and small businesses, Fortune 500 \ncompanies, Nobel laureates, veterans organizations, religious groups, \nenvironmentalists, and public interest groups are united in their \nstrong support of the convention. It is a practical international \nagreement with practical benefits for the United States, and the United \nStates should be a part of it.\n  Nevertheless, the treaty is being opposed by an entrenched band of \nforeign policy ideologues and isolationists who think the United \nNations is the enemy and who say the arms race should be escalated, not \nrestricted. History proved their ilk wrong once before, when they sank \nthe League of Nations in the 1920's. And it will prove them wrong, \nagain, with far more drastic consequences than World War II, if they \nprevail today.\n  We cannot let that happen. The Senate should reject the five killer \namendments, and give this treaty the two-thirds vote it needs and \ndeserves.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  First, I wish to thank Senators Biden and Lugar for their untiring \nefforts in seeking ratification of this historic treaty. I also want to \ncommend the majority leader for working diligently with both sides to \nbring this treaty to the Senate floor for consideration. No matter \nwhere one stands on this issue, we all agree that it is proper for this \ndebate to take place while our Nation can still become a full \nparticipant in the convention.\n  I think that it is only appropriate that we are having this debate 1 \nweek after we commemorated the second anniversary of the bombing of the \nMurrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. That singular event made us \nall aware that we are vulnerable to terrorism on our own soil. We also \nremember when terrorists launched a chemical attack in Tokyo's subways, \ntaking 12 lives and injuring thousands more. We must take action to \nprotect Americans from a similar terrorist outrage, and therefore it is \nincumbent upon this body to approve the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is also relevant today in light of \nrecent findings that thousands of our troops may have been exposed to \nchemical weapons during the Persian Gulf war. Veterans groups across \nthe country have called on the Senate to approve the CWC, and I believe \nthat it is inexcusable for us to forgo this opportunity to take a stand \nagainst chemical warfare. If we fail to do so, we will be unnecessarily \nplacing those who volunteer their services in our military at risk.\n  It is impossible to overstate the importance of the votes that will \nbe cast in this Chamber tomorrow. We have an opportunity to consider a \nproposal that would eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and we may never have this opportunity again. Our \ndecisions will have a tremendous impact on the safety of the American \npeople and our Nation's role as an international leader.\n  We are all familiar with the horrifying effects associated with \nchemical weapons. We remember the use of mustard gas in World War I and \nthe use of chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war. It was the \ninhumane nature of chemical warfare that prompted President Reagan to \ninitiate the negotiations for an international treaty to eliminate the \nuse of chemical weapons. President Bush was also committed to phasing \nout chemical weapons, and the United States joined 160 other nations in \nsigning the Chemical Weapons Convention during the final days of his \nadministration.\n  President Clinton has been a strong supporter of the convention, and \nhe has made ratification of this treaty his top foreign policy \npriority.\n  For nearly a decade, the United States led efforts to develop the \nChemical Weapons Convention, and the result was an effective agreement \nto eliminate chemical weapons that was unprecedented in its scope. \nConsidering its history of bipartisan support, one would have expected \nthis treaty to be easily approved by the Senate. Unfortunately, \nopponents of the convention have distorted the facts surrounding this \ntreaty, and it is possible that the United States will fail to ratify \nthe treaty that it initiated.\n  I strongly believe that the Chemical Weapons Convention is an \neffective tool for combating chemical warfare, and I hope that my \nfellow Senators will look beyond the rhetoric of the treaty's \ndetractors and look at the positive things that this measure would \naccomplish.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development or transfer of \nchemical weapons by member nations. It also requires participating \nstates to destroy their chemical weapon stockpiles and chemical weapons \nproduction facilities under the observation of international \ninspectors.\n  The convention would also establish the most extensive verification \nregime of any arms control treaty, that would require inspections of \nnot only governmental facilities but also civilian facilities. This \nsystem of monitoring will provide us with a mechanism for knowing who \nproduces what chemicals throughout the world, and where these chemicals \nare being sent.\n  The convention also prohibits signatory nations from exporting \nchemicals most frequently used in chemical weapons to non-member \ncountries. The import of some chemicals from non-member nations would \nalso be prohibited. These measures should isolate nonmember nations and \nprovide them with incentive to ratify the convention.\n  In order to oversee the convention's implementation, the CWC \nestablishes the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, \nor the OPCW. This organization will monitor the chemical production \nthroughout the world and will enforce compliance with the convention.\n  On April 29, the Chemical Weapons Convention will go into effect with \nor without the United States' ratification. The Senate must provide its \nadvice and consent on the treaty and send a resolution of ratification \nto the President before next Tuesday, so that he may formally ratify \nthe treaty.\n  Many hours of intense negotiations have yielded the resolution of \nratification to the Chemical Weapons Convention that we are now \nconsidering on the Senate floor. This resolution contains 33 conditions \nwhich cover nearly every objection raised by opponents of ratification. \nI am pleased that negotiators have reached an agreement on 28 of those \n33 conditions. However, the Senate will have a separate vote on each of \nthe five remaining conditions tomorrow. I would like to stress that \napproval of any of these conditions would be tantamount to prohibiting \nU.S. participation in the Chemical Weapons Convention and could fatally \ndamage the effectiveness of this treaty.\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\n  I would like to quickly address these five conditions that threaten \nratification of this treaty. Two of these conditions tie our \nratification to the actions of other nations. One demands that Russia \nratify the treaty first, and the other precludes ratification until the \nworld's rogue nations like Libya and Iraq ratify the treaty.\n  The logic behind these two amendments is that the convention is \nmeaningless if it does not include all nations with the capability to \ndevelop and use chemical weapons. This logic is seriously flawed.\n  The CWC would impose trade restrictions on nonmember nations that \nwill curb their ability to obtain the materials used in making chemical \nagents. In addition, by establishing an international legal standard \nopposing the manufacture and use of chemical weapons, the United States \nwill be able to isolate these pariah states making it more difficult \nfor these nations to acquire chemical weapons.\n  Also, since when does the United States allow other nations to \ndictate American policy? It is ridiculous to suggest that we should \ncompromise our position as a world leader by following the lead of \nfringe countries.\n  President Reagan did not wait for other nations when he declared that \nthis Nation would unilaterally destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. \nHe did not wait for other nations when he initiated negotiations to ban \nchemical weapons from the Earth. We did not follow others in making \nthose critical decisions. We led and others fell in behind us. This \nNation set the example. And now it is time for us once again to lead \nand set the example.\n  In fact, perhaps the greatest way to ensure that Russia and other \ncountries with offensive chemical weapons programs will not endorse \nthis treaty, would be for the United States to reject this treaty. \nSeventy-three other nations, including all of our major allies, and \ntwo-thirds of all countries with chemical weapon capabilities, have \nalready endorsed this treaty. I hope that we will align ourselves with \nthose who have ratified the convention and not with those outlaw \nnations.\n  Another condition that will be considered as an amendment would bar \nindividual inspectors because they come from a country that supported \nterrorism or violated U.S. nonproliferation law. If a particular \ninspector has a past history of spying or assisting terrorists, we must \nprevent him or her from inspecting our facilities. But if we bar \ncertain inspectors based solely on their nationality, other countries \nwill certainly bar U.S. inspectors. In addition, these will likely be \nthe countries that we would most like to monitor.\n  Another condition that would surely kill the ratification agreement \ndemands a level of verification that simply cannot be guaranteed. Like \nevery other arms control agreement, this one is not 100 percent \nverifiable. Certainly, that is not a reason to avoid ratifying this \ntreaty. The question ought to be: Are verification measures under this \ntreaty better or worse than those we have now?\n  The answer to that question must be ``yes.'' This treaty includes \ntougher verification measures than any existing arms control agreement \nto the extent that it allows for frequent inspections of both \ngovernmental and commercial chemical manufacturing plants throughout \nthe world. And while chemical weapons are generally more difficult to \ndetect than conventional weapons, the U.S. intelligence community has \nconfidence that it will be able to detect a large scale effort to \ndevelop chemical weapons.\n  The remaining condition of the ratification resolution is perhaps the \nmost contentious, and it would certainly kill all hopes of ratifying \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention if it were to pass as an amendment \ntomorrow.\n  In today's Washington Post, my colleague from North Carolina, Senator \nHelms writes: ``* * * the one issue that has raised the greatest \nconcern among Senators--the issue on which the ratification vote will \nalmost certainly hinge--is the Clinton Administration's refusal to \nmodify the treaty's Articles 10 and 11.'' His next sentence is \nparticularly important, ``These controversial provisions require the \ntransfer of dangerous chemical agents, defensive gear and know-how to \nany nation that joins the CWC.'' With all due respect to my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, the simple fact of the matter is that this \nstatement is not true. Article 10 does not require the United States or \nany other signatory to share advanced chemical weapons defense \ntechnologies and equipment with other countries or to assist them in \nthe development of such capabilities.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues, who are considering opposing the \nCWC for this reason, will simply refer to the actual text of the \nconvention to understand the true implications of the treaty.\n  Paragraph 7 of article 10 states: ``Each State Party undertakes to \nprovide assistance through the Organization and to this end to elect to \ntake one or more of the following measures.'' One of the choices is, \n``to declare, not later than 180 days after the Convention enters into \nforce for it, the kind of assistance it might provide in response to an \nappeal by the Organization.'' In no way does this language require any \ncountry to share advanced chemical defense technology and equipment. In \nfact, 1 of the 28 conditions agreed to in the resolution of \nratification will ensure that no assistance other than medical \nantidotes and treatments is provided by the United States under article \n10.\n  Opponents of the convention have also raised concerns regarding \nparagraph 3 of article 10. It reads as follows: ``Each State Party \nundertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, \nthe fullest possible exchange of equipment, material, and scientific \nand technological information concerning means of protection against \nchemical weapons.'' The inclusion of the word ``right'' underscores \nthat each signatory state has a right, not an obligation, to exchange \nmaterials and information.\n  In fact, President Clinton confirmed this interpretation when he \nrecently stated: ``We have made it clear that, as regards to other \ncountries, we will not do anything to give them our technology * * * \nand that our response will be * * * limited to helping them deal with \nthe health effects of an attack. We will help people in medical ways \nand with other things having to do with the health consequences.''\n  The national security concerns raised by Senator Helms were shared by \nthe representatives of the Reagan and Bush administrations who \nnegotiated this treaty. That is why treaty negotiators took great \nlengths to ensure that the treaty's language would be carefully crafted \nto protect America's interests. In responding to the criticisms of \narticle 10 of the convention, I'll simply use the words of former \nSecretary of State James Baker: ``The suggestion that Presidents Bush \nand Reagan would negotiate a treaty detrimental to the nation's \nnational security is outrageous.''\n  I hope that my colleagues will not take the criticisms of this \ncritically important treaty at face value and will closely examine the \nactual text.\n  The final condition which opponents of the treaty seek to raise \nrelates to cooperation in the field of chemical activities for \nbusinesses. Critics argue that the CWC might force industry to share \nmanufacturing and trade secrets with other nations. These criticisms \nare completely unfounded. Fred Webber, president and CEO of the \nChemical Manufacturers Association, criticized these allegations \nstating that, ``the Chemical Weapons Convention does not obligate us to \nturn over trade secrets, and it most certainly does not require the \nU.S. to abolish its system of export controls on dual-use chemistry. \nThe CWC raises the export control bar for other nations to the high \nstandard already set by the United States. That's why this treaty is in \nthe national interest.'' In fact, it is ironic that critics of the \ntreaty argue that they support the interests of America's chemical and \npharmaceutical companies. Yet, if we fail to ratify this treaty, these \nvery same companies will be subject to trade restrictions that were \ndevised by the United States.\n  Members of this body must examine the elements that set this \nagreement apart from others. The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed \nby nearly every nation in the world; it penalizes nations that refuse \nto sign on; it provides for routine and challenge inspections; and it \ncreates an international norm that would prohibit the very existence of \nchemical weapons. We must recognize that there has never been an\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\narms control treaty that better accounted for the skeptic's concerns \nthan this one.\n  Today we live in a world of nations that increasingly act together. \nIn this time of economic unions, coalition forces, and multinational \nbusinesses, we can ill-afford to disengage from the international \ncommunity. If we do not ratify this treaty or if we accept conditions \nthat prevent our ratification, we will careen off the course that we \nset for ourselves and the other peace-loving nations of the world.\n  Worse, we will force the nations who have ratified the treaty to \ndecide between ridding the world of chemical weapons on the one hand \nand maintaining good trade relations with the richest nation in the \nworld on the other. If we force our allies to make decisions like that, \nthey'll be justified in looking elsewhere for leadership.\n  I strongly believe that ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention is in the best interests of the United States, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this historic treaty.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we close the first day of debate on the \nChemical Weapons Convention, I wanted to insert into the Record an \nexplanation of the 28 conditions to the resolution of ratification that \nwe adopted this afternoon, so we can create a legislative history.\n  Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention is a fine arms control \nagreement. It can stand on its own.\n  But the U.S. Senate has a constitutional duty to consider carefully \nall the implications of treaties submitted for its advice and consent \nto ratification. Such careful consideration often enables us to spot \naspects of an agreement that merit clarification, or implementation \nmatters on which we would be well advised to require particular \nexecutive branch policies.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is no exception to this rule. Over \nthe years since its signing over 4 years ago, near the end of the Bush \nadministration, we have identified several areas in which clarifying \nthe convention's intent or establishing requirements regarding \nexecutive branch implementation would be useful.\n  In addition, there were several areas in which some of my colleagues \nwanted assurances that went beyond those that the executive branch or I \ncould give them, even though we thought that such reassurances ought to \nsuffice. In many such cases, the easiest way of providing the needed \nassurances was to codify them in a condition to the resolution of \nratification.\n  The convention enters into force on April 29, with or without the \nUnited States. To be an original state party, therefore, the President \nmust deposit the instrument of ratification by midnight on April 28. As \na technical matter, the Senate's vote is not the final word, because \nthe Senate does not ``ratify'' a treaty; it provides advice and consent \nto it. Once that occurs, the President then must formally ratify--an \nindication to our treaty partners that the United States is consenting \nto be legally bound to its terms--by signing an ``instrument of \nratification.'' The President then directs the Secretary of State to \ndeposit that instrument at a central location designated by the \nconvention; then, once the convention enters into force, the United \nStates is bound under international law to abide by its terms.\n  The Senate's role in providing consent to a treaty is not that of a \nrubber stamp. The Senate may attach amendments or reservations to the \ntreaty--essentially changing the terms of the original bargain between \nthe United States and its treaty partners, or it may adopt conditions, \nwhich are, in effect, a binding contract between the Senate and the \nPresident which will govern how the treaty will be implemented or \ninterpreted under U.S. law and practice.\n  In the case of the Chemical Weapons Convention, no amendments to the \nconvention's text have been, or will be, offered; the Senate has \nalready moved beyond the stage in its consideration of treaties in \nwhich such amendments would be in order. Neither have any reservations \nbeen put forth--although article XXII of the convention purports to \nprevent a party from doing so. The Senate has gone on record several \ntimes, and does so again in condition 17, that the President's \nagreement to such a prohibition cannot constrain the Senate's \nconstitutional right and obligation to give its advice and consent to a \ntreaty subject to any reservation it might determine is required by the \nnational interest.\n  Instead, we have a set of 28 conditions which were agreed to by those \ninvolved in the negotiations to date, and which the Senate approved by \nvoice vote earlier this afternoon. These conditions, as stated before, \nare binding upon the President.\n  Several conditions will be debated tomorrow which are tantamount to \nkilling the treaty. For example, any condition which requires a \nrenegotiation of the treaty--as condition 32 does--is a killer, plain \nand simple, because there is no way that this treaty can be \nrenegotiated. Additionally, any condition which requires the President \nto make impossible certifications before depositing the instrument of \nratification will prevent the United States from formally entering the \nconvention.\n  As I described earlier, there have been several stages of negotiation \nto work out agreed conditions to the resolution and to narrow our areas \nof disagreement. The Senator from North Carolina and I engaged in many \nhours of negotiation as part of this process.\n  The end result of our negotiations, of the negotiations between the \nWhite House and the task force established by the majority leader, and \nof discussions directly between the White House and the majority leader \nis a set of 28 agreed conditions to the resolution of ratification. I \nwould like to summarize and comment upon those agreed conditions, so \nthat my colleagues may understand what we have achieved.\n  For I think that we have achieved quite a lot. I also think that \nMembers should study the many agreed conditions that the Senator from \nNorth Carolina was able to propound. Frankly, virtually all of the \nconcerns that have been raised regarding the CWC have been addressed in \nthese agreed conditions, in a manner that should substantially ease \nthose concerns.\n  So I would like to summarize, Mr. President, what the Senator from \nNorth Carolina and I, along with other Members and the executive \nbranch, have been able to achieve.\n\n\n                   providing protection for industry\n\n  The CWC contains a number of built-in protections for U.S. \nbusinesses, largely because industry helped write many of the \nconvention's provisions. A number of conditions have been added, \nhowever, to provide even greater protection for business.\n  Condition 16 provides that if an employee of the organization for the \nprohibition of chemical weapons, or OPCW, willfully discloses U.S. \nconfidential business information that causes financial harm to a U.S. \nbusiness, the President must inform Congress. If the director-general \ndoes not waive the employee's diplomatic immunity from prosecution, \nwhich may be done pursuant to paragraph 20 of the CWC's confidentiality \nannex, within 9 months of the President's reporting the matter to \nCongress, the President is required to withhold half of the U.S. \ncontribution to the OPCW until that employee's immunity from \nprosecution is waived. This will serve as a strong deterrent to \nbreaches of confidential information. You might call it a ``don't mess \nwith our trade secrets'' condition.\n  Condition 18 is a further protection for proprietary information. \nThis condition prohibits any samples collected during inspections in \nthe United States from being analyzed in a foreign laboratory. This \nwill greatly reduce the risk of industrial espionage. I frankly have \nconcerns about this condition. I hope it does not lead to every country \nkeeping all its samples in-country, so that all of Iran's samples are \nanalyzed in Iran and all of Russia's samples are analyzed in Russia. \nBut there is no question that this is a major concession to some of my \ncolleagues' concerns regarding the need to protect confidential \nbusiness information.\n  Condition 9 requires the President to certify, both now and annually, \nthat the CWC's limits on the production and use of the most toxic \nchemical weapons and their precursors are not significantly harming the \nlegitimate commercial activities and interests of chemical, \nbiotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms. The administration is fully \nprepared to make that certification.\n  The Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations have all taken \nextraordinary measures to limit the impact of\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nthe CWC upon U.S. businesses. For example, the Bush administration made \nsure that challenge inspections would be subject to ``managed access,'' \nin which a firm will be able to limit the access of inspectors to the \nminimum necessary to disprove any allegations of CWC violations by that \nfirm. And the Clinton administration worked with other countries in the \nCWC Preparatory Commission to make sure that most of the businesses \ncovered by the convention will only have to fill out a short form to \ncomply with the requirement for data declarations.\n  Condition 21 puts the Senate on record supporting the provision of \nassistance to U.S. businesses by the On-Site Inspection Agency--or \nOSIA--an arm of the Department of Defense. OSIA has years of experience \nin helping protect sensitive information during inspections of \nGovernment-run facilities and defense contractors. This Agency lacks \nauthority to aid other U.S. businesses, however. Following through on \nthis provision with authorizing legislation--which I would hope we \ncould do in the CWC implementing legislation--would ensure that \nAmerican businesses have the full benefit of OSIA's expertise available \nto them.\n\n  Under condition 23, the Senate will be informed promptly of the \nproposed addition of a chemical to any of the CWC's schedules of \nchemicals. A report from the President will indicate the anticipated \neffect of such proposal on U.S. industry. If a proposed addition should \nappear to promise too great a burden on U.S. industry for too little \ngain in protection against chemical weapons, Congress will then have \ntime to convince the executive branch to force that proposed addition \ninto a CWC process that requires two-thirds vote of the states parties \nto adopt the change.\n\n\n                        holding down u.s. costs\n\n  Allegations have been made that the CWC will create a massive U.S.-\nstyle bureaucracy that will cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of \ndollars. Several conditions have been agreed upon to keep U.S. costs to \na minimum and ensure a well-managed organization.\n  Under condition 22, regular U.S. contributions to the Organization \nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, have been capped at \n$25 million annually. Any increase to this cap must cross two high \nhurdles. First, the President must make a ``national security \ninterest'' waiver. Second, the Congress must enact a joint resolution \napproving the President's waiver.\n  Fortunately, condition 22 allows a periodic inflation adjustment to \nthe regular U.S. contribution. In addition, the United States will be \npermitted to contribute funds to help the OPCW handle the costs of \nmonitoring U.S. destruction of chemical weapons. Those are costs that \nwe originally intended to fund for implementation of the 1990 bilateral \ndestruction agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, \nand they have not been included in the regular OPCW budget.\n  Condition 2 provides that any U.S. contributions to the OPCW will be \nsubject to congressional authorization and appropriation. This means \nthat not one dollar can be transferred to the organization by the U.S. \nGovernment without congressional approval.\n  Pursuant to condition 3, the OPCW must create an independent \ninspector general within its first 9 months of operation. Otherwise, \nhalf of the regular U.S. contribution to the OPCW budget will be \nwithheld. An inspector general will ensure rigorous oversight of OPCW \nactivities and expenditures.\n  While it is in the U.S. interest for the CWC to have a strong \nverification regime, we should not have to foot the bill for all of the \nresearch and development that goes to improving verification. That is \nwhy condition 4 was included, to require that any research and \ndevelopment by the United States that is designed primarily to improve \nthe verification provisions of the CWC--including the training of OPCW \ninspectors--must be pursuant to an agreed cost-sharing arrangement that \nspreads the costs of such R equitably between the United States and \nthe organization.\n  A cost-sharing arrangement will also be required in order to share \nitems or services that were developed through U.S. research and \ndevelopment. It will still be possible, however, for U.S. agencies to \npursue R programs so as to improve U.S. monitoring of chemical \nweapons, and cost-sharing arrangements need not be in place unless and \nuntil the United States wants to share the results with the OPCW.\n  We would also not want to be stuck with the bill for Russian \ndestruction of their vast chemical weapons stockpile. So there is \nagreement on condition 14, under which the United States shall not \naccept any Russian effort to condition its ratification of CWC upon \nUnited States guarantees to pay for Russian implementation of chemical \nweapons destruction under the CWC or the 1990 bilateral destruction \nagreement.\n\n\n       ensuring improved monitoring, verification and enforcement\n\n  Some opponents of CWC have alleged that the convention will lead to a \n``dumbing down'' of U.S. intelligence and that the United States will \nshy away from taking tough actions when faced with instances of \nnoncompliance. Three conditions address these concerns head-on.\n  We all know that monitoring and verification of some aspects of CWC \ncompliance will be difficult. This fact of life has prompted \nunderstandable concern on the part of some Members, and the \nadministration has accepted a condition-- No. 10--that requires both \nperiodic reports and prompt notice regarding world chemical weapons \nprograms and the status of CWC compliance. The executive branch would \nalso offer briefings on current compliance issues, including issues to \nbe raised in OPCW meetings and the results of those meetings.\n  The careful reader of condition 10 may note some hyperbole in it. \nThus, the first subparagraph states that ``the convention is in the \ninterests of the United States only if all parties * * * are in strict \ncompliance * * *, such compliance being measured by performance and not \nby efforts * * *''\n  In truth, of course, there may be major violations or minor \nshortfalls. If a party is delayed in its sincere efforts to clean up \nthe vestiges of a long-inactive chemical weapons program, that will \nhardly constitute a threat to U.S. national interests. But the drafters \nof this condition are on to something; even minor violations by a few \nparties could erode the commitment of other parties to strict \ncompliance with the convention.\n  The important thing is that the administration is not afraid to keep \nCongress in the loop on CWC compliance issues. Condition 10 requires \nbriefings at least four times a year for the Congress on U.S. actions \ntaken to address compliance issues. This regular flow of information \nwill allow the Congress to keep abreast of chemical weapons programs \nand to judge for itself whether the United States is doing enough to \ndetect and respond to noncompliance.\n  It may be in our interest at times to share intelligence with the \nOPCW, especially so as to maximize the effectiveness of the CWC's on-\nsite inspection regime. All agree that we should take steps to protect \nU.S. sources and methods when sharing intelligence information.\n  Thanks to the work of the senior Senator from Alabama, which I am \nhappy to commend, condition 5 has been added to do just that. It \nrequires the intelligence community, at the interagency level, to fully \nsanitize and to approve all intelligence information before it is \nreleased to the OPCW.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence can waive this requirement for \nparticular documents on a case-by-case basis, but that must be promptly \nreported to the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees of the \nCongress. The Director must also report on the procedures set up to \nprotect classified information and on any unauthorized disclosures of \ninformation provided to the OPCW.\n\n  The Senator from Alabama's condition makes a real contribution to the \nverification of compliance with the CWC. The ability of the United \nStates to share information with the OPCW is vital to catching would-be \nviolators of the convention. I hope that this condition will not only \nease the Senator's concerns over the protection of intelligence sources \nand methods, but also reassure him that the overall convention is in \nthe national interest.\n  All of us want the executive branch to act effectively in the event \nthat a State party should violate the CWC in any manner that threatened \nU.S. national security interests. Condition 13\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nwill require the executive branch to report to and consult with the \nSenate regarding such violations and to make effective use of CWC \nprovisions for challenge inspections, high-level diplomacy and U.N. \nsanctions. The executive branch also agrees that any sanctions required \nby U.S. law should be implemented in such a case.\n  Pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi), if the noncompliance should persist \nfor a year, the executive branch will be bound to consult with the \nSenate for the purposes of obtaining a resolution of support of \ncontinued adherence to the convention. This seems unduly rigid; a \ncountry may well need more than a year to come into compliance if it \nmust destroy chemical weapons stocks or facilities. Frankly, I do not \nknow what is to be gained by requiring the executive branch to consult \neach time on a possible resolution of support for continued adherence \nto the CWC. But condition 13 does not require that such a nonbinding \nresolution be introduced or voted upon in every case, so there is \nlittle potential for harm in this.\n  Some other aspects of condition 13 merit additional explanation. For \nexample, several of the mandated executive branch responses to CWC \nviolations must be undertaken on an urgent basis. This does not mean \nthat they must all proceed concurrently. Thus, in some cases high-level \ndiplomacy will suffice and there will be no need to seek a challenge \ninspection or U.N. sanctions.\n  In some cases, it might be necessary to prepare the groundwork \ncarefully for a challenge inspection or a diplomatic approach. The \nSenator from North Carolina and I are agreed that the executive branch \ncould proceed with such preparations on an urgent basis, even though \nthey may take many months to come to fruition.\n  Finally, the requirement in subparagraph (A)(ii) that the executive \nbranch seek a challenge inspection should not be read as requiring that \nthe United States must always be the party that initiates such a \nrequest. There might well be other States parties with an equal or \ngreater interest in a given country's apparent violation of the CWC, \nand it might be more fruitful in some cases for the executive branch to \nwork with those other States parties to secure the common objective of \na challenge inspection.\n\n\n                  maintaining robust chemical defenses\n\n  Some have asserted that if the United States joins the CWC, we will \nbe lulled into a false sense of security and drop our guard against the \ncontinuing threat of chemical weapons. This concern is frankly a bit \nmystifying. Aside from the risk that any arms control treaty might be \nviolated by a State party to it, U.S. military leaders are quite aware \nthat such potential military adversaries as Iraq, Libya, and North \nKorea are not planning to sign the convention. The Joint Chiefs of \nStaff support CWC not because it will automatically remove the need to \ndefend against chemical weapons, but rather because CWC is a vital step \ntoward reducing and combating that threat.\n  While the opponents' argument ignores the fact that the Pentagon has \nrequested $225 million in additional funds for chemical weapons \ndefenses over the next 5 years, a condition has nonetheless been added \nto address their concerns. Pursuant to condition 11, the Secretary of \nDefense shall ensure that U.S. forces are capable of carrying out \nrequired military missions in U.S. regional contingency plans, \nregardless of any threat or use of chemical weapons. In particular, \nU.S. forces must be properly trained, equipped, and organized to \noperate in chemically and biologically contaminated environments. This \nmeans not only improving the defensive capabilities of U.S. forces, but \nalso initiating discussions on chemical weapons defense with likely \ncoalition partners and countries whose civilian personnel would support \nU.S. forces in a conflict.\n\n  The administration has also agreed to assure that the U.S. Army \nChemical School remains under the supervision of an Army general. \nFinally, the President is required to submit exhaustive annual reports \nto Congress on the State of Chemical and Biological defense efforts.\n\n\n                        CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS\n\n  Some opponents of the CWC have alleged that it will violate the U.S. \nConstitution by permitting international inspectors to conduct \nwarrantless searches of U.S. facilities. Actually, a number of legal \nscholars have noted the specific constitutional protections written \ninto the convention. To ease any members' lingering concerns, however, \ntwo important agreed conditions have been added.\n  Condition 28 makes it crystal clear that no warrantless searches will \nbe permitted when access to inspectors is denied. All challenge \ninspections will require a criminal warrant based upon probable cause \nwhen consent to that inspection is withheld. An administrative warrant \nwill be required for routine inspections of declared U.S. facilities \nwhen consent has been withheld. Both of these warrants must be issued \nby a Federal judge--either a U.S. District Court judge or a U.S. \nmagistrate judge.\n  Condition 28 was reached through the combined efforts of the majority \nleader, Senator Helms, the administration and myself. It represents a \nsignificant concession by the administration, as the Constitution does \nnot require administrative warrants in cases of highly-regulated \nindustries. Condition 28 reflects the executive branch's confidence \nthat any challenge inspection mounted in the United States will, \nindeed, be based on sufficient evidence to justify a criminal search \nwarrant.\n  I want to compliment the majority leader, in particular, for his \nefforts on condition 28. I would certainly hope that the concessions he \nobtained from the administration on this major issue would reassure him \nthat the CWC's important contributions to the national security will be \nachieved without any violation of people's constitutional rights or any \nundue costs or harm to U.S. persons.\n  Condition 12 makes clear that nothing in the CWC requires or \nauthorizes anything that is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, as \ninterpreted by the United States. No administration would agree to a \ntreaty that violated the constitution, no treaty ever takes precedence \nover the constitution, and only the United States interprets our \nConstitution. The administration is quite willing, therefore, to accept \na condition stating these facts.\n\n\n                          RIOT CONTROL AGENTS\n\n  Concerns were raised that the administration planned to amend \nExecutive Order 11850 of 1975 to prohibit the use of tear gas in times \nof war to rescue downed pilots and to fend off attacks by combatants \nusing civilians as human shields. Condition 26 has been added to lay \nthis concern to rest.\n  Pursuant to condition 26, the President is prohibited from taking any \naction to alter or eliminate Executive Order 11850 of 1975. In other \nwords, all uses of tear gas by U.S. Armed Forces that are permitted \ntoday--including rescuing of downed pilots and against combatants when \nthey use civilians to shield attacks--will continue to be permitted \nafter the CWC enters into force.\n  In addition, condition 26 makes clear that nearly all uses of riot \ncontrol agents in peacekeeping operations will be permitted. The sole \nexception to that permission would be in the most unlikely case that \nthe U.S. role in a peacekeeping operation reached such a military scope \nand duration that the laws of war would pertain to it.\n\n\n                 TRANSFER OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS DEFENSES\n\n  Some opponents of CWC have asserted that article X of the convention \nwould require the United States to provide financial assistance and \nequipment to countries such as Iran and Cuba in order to improve their \nchemical weapons defense capabilities. This is an understandable \nmisconception of paragraph 7 of article X, which states that ``each \nstate party undertakes to provide [such] assistance through the \norganization.'' Paragraph 1 of article X defines ``assistance'' to \ninclude ``detection equipment and alarm systems, protective equipment; \ndecontamination equipment and decontaminants; medical antidotes and \ntreatments; and advice on any of these protective measures.''\n\n  The rest of paragraph 7 of article X makes clear, however, that each \nstate party is not required to provide all such assistance. A state \nparty may contribute to a voluntary fund for assistance, or agree to \nprovide assistance through the OPCW on demand, or simply declare what \nassistance it might provide in response to an appeal by the OPCW. So \nCWC does not compel the\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\nUnited States to give any country, let alone an enemy like Cuba, \nanything more than medical assistance or advice.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has proposed in condition 15 that the \nSenate bind the executive branch not to provide anything more than \nmedical antidotes and treatment to a rogue state pursuant to article X \nof the convention. While there is no real need to so bind the executive \nbranch, this proposal is certainly consistent with current \nadministration policy. As such, it may usefully allay the suspicions \nthat article X has aroused in some quarters, and is therefore worth \nsupporting.\n\n\n                 maintaining stringent export controls\n\n  Some opponents of the CWC see article XI of the convention as \nrequiring the Australia group--an informal alliance of potential \nsupplier states--to relax its export controls, which are a bulwark of \nnonproliferation. I have never shared that concern, because the \nAustralia Group has steadfastedly told the world that it viewed its \nexport control regime to be fully consistent with the CWC. \nNevertheless, condition 7 has been added to reassure those who worry \nthat the Australia Group would be hobbled by the CWC.\n  Pursuant to condition 7, the President must certify that he has \nobtained authoritative assurances from all other Australia Group \nmembers that they agree with the United States view that the CWC will \nnot weaken any Australia Group controls--and these assurances have, in \nfact, been received. In addition, the President is required to do what \nit takes to prevent any backsliding in the years to come. If the \nAustralia Group is weakened, the President will be required to consult \nwith the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a resolution of continued \nadherence to the CWC.\n\n\n                  protecting the senate's prerogatives\n\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle wish to preserve the Senate's \nconstitutional role in treaty-making. Several conditions address this \nissue.\n  Condition 1 asserts that the Senate reserves the right to add \nreservations to the resolution of ratification, despite the ban--in \narticle XXII of the convention--on reservations to the convention. This \ncondition asserts the Senate's right under the U.S. Constitution, but \ndoes not exercise it. It requires the administration to inform all \nother states parties that the Senate reserves the right to give its \nadvice and consent to ratification of the convention subject to \nreservations. Although the Senate has not exercised this right at this \ntime, it could do so in ratifying future amendments to the convention; \nthis condition puts all parties on notice.\n  If the United States decided not to cast its vote--one way or \nanother--on a proposed CWC amendment at an amendment conference under \nthe convention, it would be possible for such an amendment to be passed \nwithout a vote in the Senate. So condition 6 will bind the executive \nbranch to vote on every proposed CWC amendment and to submit any \namendment to the Senate for its advice and consent.\n  As explained in the discussion of condition 1, the CWC includes a \nprovision barring states parties from attaching reservations to their \nratification of the convention. A sense-of-the-Senate condition warns \nU.S. negotiators that they should not include such provisions in any \nfuture treaty.\n  The Biden condition on treaty interpretation, which has been attached \nto all arms control treaties since the INF treaty was approved in 1988, \nis reaffirmed in condition 24. It states the constitutionally-\nbased principle that the shared understanding that exists between the \nexecutive branch and the Senate about the terms of the treaty at the \ntime the Senate gives advice and consent to ratification can be altered \nonly subject to the Senate's advice and consent to a subsequent treaty \nor protocol, or the enactment of a statute.\n\n  Another condition is included which has been attached to major arms \ncontrol treaties in recent years, setting forth the Senate position \nthat any international agreement that would obligate the united States \nto limit its forces in a militarily significant way will be considered \nby the Senate only pursuant to article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \nConstitution. This is condition 25.\n  Condition 20 also purports to preserve the rights of the Senate, by \nasserting the sense of the Senate that the United States should not be \ndenied its vote in OPCW organs if Congress fails to appropriate the \nfull amount of funds assessed to the United States.\n  It should be noted that although paragraph 8 of article VIII of the \nconvention allows the Conference of States Parties to permit a state \nparty to retain its vote if the conference is satisfied that the \nstate's arrears are due to conditions beyond the control of the state \nparty, this is clearly a decision left to the states parties acting in \nthat conference.\n  I sincerely doubt that any international body will see the actions of \nCongress as conditions beyond the control of the United States, \nalthough sometimes the American people may sympathize with that \nconcept. Condition 20 merely states the nonbinding sense of the Senate, \nhowever, so it does no harm.\n\n\n                     Foreign Policy Considerations\n\n  Some people are concerned that the CWC has been oversold as a defense \nagainst the use of chemical weapons by terrorist groups. The Senator \nfrom North Carolina proposes, therefore, condition 19, by which the \nSenate will find that the CWC would not have stopped the Aum Shinrikyo \nGroup in Japan and that future terrorist groups will likely seek \nchemical weapons. Both of these statements are probably quite accurate, \nand no harm is done by attaching them to the resolution of \nratification.\n  Condition 8 deals with the matter of so-called negative security \nassurances. Despite the fact that the United States decided long ago to \ndestroy its chemical weapons stockpile, some are concerned that one \nimpact of the CWC will be to undermine the ability of the United States \nto adequately retaliate against a state that used chemical weapons \nagainst us, if that state has received U.S. assurances to non-nuclear \nweapons states that the United States will not be the first to use \nnuclear weapons against them--Such assurances are known as negative \nsecurity assurances--This condition requires the administration to \nsubmit a classified report on the impact of this new reality upon U.S. \nretaliatory options in such a case and upon the whole policy of \nnegative security assurances.\n\n\n                   u.s. chemical weapons destruction\n\n  Condition 27 is the result of negotiations between the administration \nand the senior Senator from Kentucky. It is an important effort to \nensure citizens concerned about the environment that the United States \nwill do all it can to select the safest methods for the destruction of \nour own stockpile of chemical weapons.\n  Condition 27 assures that the United States will be able, under CWC, \nto give full consideration to alternatives to incineration as the means \nto destroy U.S. chemical weapons pursuant to the convention. Since \nalternative means may be feasible only if we take the full time allowed \nby the CWC, which is more than the time allotted under current U.S. \nlaw, this condition states that the CWC time allotment may supersede \nthat in section 1412 of Public law 99-145.\n   Mr. President, this has been a lengthy explanation of what we are \naccepting in the 28 agreed conditions to the resolution of \nratification. It is lengthy for a good reason: because the senior \nSenator from North Carolina and I have truly reached many elements of \nagreement, and because several of those agreements are truly \nsignificant. In addition, given the absence of a report from the \nForeign Relations Committee, this statement is intended to create some \nlegislative history for the 28 conditions on which the Senator from \nNorth Carolina and I have agreed.\n  It is my sincere belief, Mr. President, that the adoption of these 28 \nagreed conditions, will answer many of the most vexing concerns that \nhave been raised by Members who find it difficult to decide how to vote \non advice and consent to ratification. I hope that my colleagues will \nstudy carefully how much we have achieved.\n  I trust they will understand that the remaining issues are ones on \nwhich we cannot accept the proposed conditions without killing U.S. \nratification of the convention or seriously impeding its \nimplementation. And finally, I urge my colleagues, in light of what we \nhave accomplished thus far, to take the culminating step and support \nfinal passage of this historic resolution.\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, over the past months South Dakota has \nsuffered some of the worst disasters in recent memory. The drifts of \nsnow that have paralyzed our State and killed over 100,000 cattle are \nat last melting, but their runoff has swelled our lakes and rivers to \noverflowing and forced thousands to evacuate in the face of devastating \nfloodwaters. Only the hard work of South Dakotans, building dikes and \nfilling sandbags to save the homes of their friends and neighbors, has \nprevented the serious disaster we are facing from having more \ncatastrophic consequences.\n  I am also proud to say that during these disasters, our bipartisan \nelected leadership has set politics aside and worked together for the \ngood of our State. Our Democratic President, our Republican Governor, \nour entire congressional delegation, and every local leader have made \novercoming the disaster our first priority. As Governor Bill Janklow of \nSouth Dakota stated, ``There is no way that Republican or Democrat \npolitics should come into play when we are dealing with the things that \nare vital to all the people of this State.'' Together, we believe that \nmeeting the needs of our families and our communities should always \ncome first.\n  This philosophy has served South Dakota well during its time of need, \nand I am convinced that what has worked in South Dakota can work here \nin Washington. Recently, we passed the 100th day of this Congress. \nSince we began this session, 14 million children attended classes in \nschools that are falling apart, 180,000 babies were born without health \ncare coverage and 51 million workers labored without a pension plan. \nUnfortunately, this Congress has accomplished nothing to meet these \ndire needs. It is now time to make good on our pledges of cooperation. \nJust as South Dakotans have joined together for the good of our State, \nwe in Congress must join together for the good of our country and \ndeliver much-needed relief to America's working families.\n\n  On the first day of the 105th Congress, I introduced bills to enact \nthe Families First Agenda to raise the incomes of working families, \nextend affordable health coverage to children, expand the retirement \nbenefits of workers, and make it easier for students of all ages to \nreceive a quality education. Now it is time to roll up our sleeves and \nget to work. I urge my colleagues to join with me to support America's \nfamilies. Every day we wait is another day they struggle to make ends \nmeet.\n  Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a very important letter I received from Kym Pacheco, a \nresident of Sioux Falls, SD. It is a heartbreaking letter, and it tells \nthe story of working families better than any words of mine. Despite a \n105-hour work week as a truck driver, Kym's husband earns just enough \nfor the family to get by. Each month they struggle to pay their rent \nand the grocery, gas, and phone bills. ``Mind you,'' she writes, ``none \nof this includes car repairs, school supplies, clothes, medications, or \ncar insurance. There are no luxuries--week-end vacations, a nice car, \ntrips to McDonald's. What we wouldn't do to be able to take our son to \nthe Black Hills for a week! . . . But we cannot put any money into the \nsavings. We literally live paycheck to paycheck!''\n  Mr. President, no one in our Nation who works 105 hours a week should \nlive one paycheck away from an empty stomach or a missed rent payment. \nFamilies like Kym's work hard but cannot get ahead, and they fear for \nthe future of their children. They have faith that life can be better, \nbut they are depending upon us to give them the help they need. We \ncannot let them down. As Kym continues, ``There are so many problems in \nthe U.S., but I honestly believe that when our government starts \npassing laws that actually give families affordable, decent coverage \nhealth insurance, decent wages, tax breaks for poor and middle class \nworking families, our country will become better. It would be a start! \nOur children deserve an opportunity to live better than we did!''\n  Mr. President, her children do deserve that opportunity, and we can \ngive it to them. Let us accept Kym's challenge. If we put the interests \nof working families before party politics, we can provide working \nfamilies with tax breaks for education and ensure that parents can \nafford to take their children to the doctor. We can ensure that in \nfuture years when Kym's children retire they will have financial \nsecurity. All of this is in our power, but to meet our goal we must \nwork together. I hope my colleagues will join me in this task.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3545-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3545-S3546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMENDING VOLUNTEERS ON THE FLOOD RELIEF EFFORT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to highlight the commendable effort \ndisplayed by the legion of West Virginia volunteers who have done so \nmuch to help their neighbors and communities affected by last month's \nflooding in sixteen West Virginia counties. Their selfless dedication \nto neighbors in need is in the finest West Virginia tradition of \ncommunity spirit and support.\n  The efforts of volunteers from the Fire and Rescue Departments \nthroughout the affected area are especially noteworthy. These heroic \nworkers rescued numerous families and individuals trapped by the raging \nflood waters that swept through my beloved state. You may recall some \nof the harrowing events displayed on television news, particularly from \nthose hardest hit counties of Kanawha, Cabell, and Wirt. Also working \nduring the storms and in their destructive aftermath, utility employees \nlabored long hours in driving rain and deep mud to restore electricity, \ngas, water, and sewer service to the affected communities.\n  Mr. President, churches have always sustained the people of West \nVirginia, and never more so than when disaster strikes. Aside from \nproviding physical sustenance to the affected residents, the community \nchurches that dot our hills and hollows have also provided flood \nvictims with moral and spiritual comfort to ease the pain of all that \nhas been lost. Particularly hard hit in this flood, the people of \nClendenin have received extensive and much-needed support from \nchurches, neighbors, and other charitable organizations. After all of \nthe floods of last year, it is uplifting to see that such strong \ncommunity spirit yet endures among the Mountaineers of West Virginia. \nThis year, as in previous years, volunteers, churches, and \norganizations like the Red Cross have risen above the flood waters of \ndisaster to provide comfort and hope to their neighbors. I am reminded \nof the words of poet, essayist, and critic Matthew Arnold:\n\n     Then, in such hour of need\n     Of your fainting, dispirited race,\n     Ye, like angels, appear,\n     Radiant with ardour divine!\n     Beacons of hope, ye appear!\n     Langour is not in your heart,\n     Weakness is not in your word,\n     Weariness not on your brow.\n\n  Surely, the concerned faces and helping hands of volunteers and \nchurch workers seemed divinely inspired to the flood victims who \nbenefited from\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\ntheir tireless efforts. Mr. President, I offer my thanks to all of \nthose individuals, congregations, and charitable organizations who \nrespond with such compassion and energy when disaster strikes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3545-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRETIREMENT OF DR. SHELDON HACKNEY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT \n                           FOR THE HUMANITIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week Sheldon Hackney, \nchairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, announced that \nhe would be leaving office and returning to teaching at the end of his \nterm of office in August. Dr. Hackney came to the endowment in 1993, \nfollowing a brilliant academic and administrative career, including \nservice as president of the University of Pennsylvania.\n  News of his retirement saddens all of us who know what a superb job \nhe has done at the endowment for the past 4 years. Perhaps his most \nnotable achievement has been in taming the intense political \ncontroversies that were swirling around the endowment when he arrived. \nThe controversies persist, but fortunately, they are muted because of \nhis leadership. The endowment has earned new bipartisan support because \nof the effective way he has explained its important mission to liberals \nand conservatives alike. He will be greatly missed, but I wish him \nwell.\n  Asked about his views on eliminating the endowment, Dr. Hackney \nresponded with characteristic eloquence,\n\n       The only legitimate argument against continuing it is from \n     someone who believes in a minimalist government, that \n     government shouldn't be in culture at all. The endowment does \n     things that no one else would do but need to be done if we \n     are to remember who we are and what the heritage of our \n     nation is.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the New York Times about \nDr. Hackney may be printed at this point in the Record. The humanity of \nthe man shines through, and through him the humanities endowment has \nshone through as well.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 21, 1997]\n\n                 Chairman To Leave Humanities Endowment\n\n                          (By Irvin Molotsky)\n\n       Washington, April 21.--Sheldon Hackney, who has led the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities during a period of \n     reduced budgets, told the White House today that he would not \n     seek another term as chairman and would return to the \n     University of Pennsylvania to teach history.\n       Mr. Hackney, who stepped down as president of Penn to come \n     to Washington four years ago, said today that he had planned \n     all along to step down when his four-year term expired in \n     August.\n       ``I never discussed it with the White House,'' he said, \n     ``but I'm sure I could have stayed.''\n       The endowment, which provides Federal money for research \n     and exhibitions on history and other scholarly pursuits, has \n     been less of a lightning rod for fiscal conservatives than \n     its counterpart, the National Endowment for the Arts. But it \n     has been bracketed with the arts endowment as the target of \n     spending cuts and its budget has been reduced in recent \n     years.\n       When asked about his disappointments as chairman, Mr. \n     Hackney said: ``The political situation changed, and I had to \n     spend more time than I wanted telling the public and Congress \n     what we do. I could have spent that time on programs.''\n       The change in the political situation that Mr. Hackney \n     spoke of was the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, \n     when many opponents of Federal spending for the arts and \n     humanities were elected to the House and Senate.\n       Spending for the humanities endowment has fallen from a \n     high of $172 million in 1993 to $110 million in the current \n     budget. President Clinton has asked for $136 million for next \n     year, but Congress is unlikely to approve that much.\n       ``Despite the turbulence of the times,'' Mr. Hackney said, \n     ``I feel very good. We've accomplished a lot.''\n       Besides keeping the endowment alive, Mr. Hackney said, his \n     accomplishments include making the endowment nonpolitical and \n     nonideological, reversing a pattern that he said took hold \n     during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.\n       Asked to provide a defense for continuing the endowment, \n     Mr. Hackney said: ``The only legitimate argument against \n     continuing it is from someone who believes in minimalist \n     government, that government shouldn't be in culture at all. \n     The endowment does things that no one else would do but need \n     to be done if we are to remember who we are and what the \n     heritage of our nation is.\n       ``One of the purposes of government is to create good \n     citizens. That's what we do at the N.E.H. We are a \n     democratizing force in American culture.''\n       Representative Sidney R. Yates, Democrat of Illinois, an \n     advocate of both endowments who was chairman of the House \n     committee that approved their financing when the Democrats \n     were in the majority, said he thought Mr. Hackney has \n     succeeded in removing the endowment from partisan politics.\n       ``We'll miss him,'' Mr. Yates said. ``I think he's been \n     very good. He's been a very good administrator of the \n     humanities endowment at a difficult time with less money.''\n       Representative Ralph Regula, Republican of Ohio, who is \n     chairman of the appropriations panel Mr. Yates once led, said \n     of Mr. Hackney, ``I think he's worked hard at giving the \n     N.E.H. good leadership, especially in the field of \n     libraries.''\n       Asked whether Mr. Hackney had kept politics and ideology \n     out of the endowment, Representative Regula said, ``He has \n     been very successful in that regard.'' He added, however, \n     that he thought Mr. Hackney's Republican predecessors had \n     also kept partisanship out.\n       A Republican critic of the endowment, Representative John \n     T. Doolittle, a Californian, said it spent money on unneeded \n     programs, money that could be better used ``to save Medicare \n     from bankruptcy and balance the budget.''\n       ``If there were ever a Federal agency or program that \n     deserves a trip to the chopping block, it is this sandbox for \n     the cultural elite,'' Mr. Doolittle said.\n       Mr. Regula did not agree with his Republican colleague. ``I \n     think it will survive in some form or another,'' he said. ``I \n     think the preservation of the culture of society is \n     important.''\n       Mr. Hackney said the endowment had supported many good \n     projects without getting much credit for it, like providing \n     some of the money for public television programs on Theodore \n     Roosevelt and the American West.\n       ``The public doesn't normally notice who is funding \n     projects,'' he said. ``People say: `Oh, my goodness. Did you \n     do that?'''\n       Mr. Hackney, an Alabamian, said that at Penn he would \n     return to one his great interests by teaching a course on the \n     history of the South.\n       When he was named chairman of the endowment, Mr. Hackney \n     was succeeded by Judith S. Rodin as university president.\n       ``I'm going to teach history and stay out of her way,'' Mr. \n     Hackney said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3546-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3546-S3548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE IMMIGRATION SUBCOMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF 1996 INS LEGAL IMMIGRATION \n                                NUMBERS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, yesterday, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service [INS] officially released its legal immigration \nnumbers for 1996. Attached please find an analysis by the staff of the \nSenate Immigration Subcommittee that helps place these numbers into \ncontext.\n  The analysis finds:\n  First, the 1996 increase in immigration is not part of a long-term \nrise in legal immigration but rather a temporary increase.\n  Second, many additional people being counted as immigrants in 1996 \nand 1997 were not new entrants but were already physically in the \ncountry as the spouses of those who received amnesty under the law \nsigned by President Reagan in 1986.\n  Third, the increase is due largely to INS processing delays that \ncaused many people who would have been counted as immigrants in 1995 to \nbe counted in 1996.\n  Fourth, after a 20-percent decline between 1993 and 1995, this short-\nterm increase in legal immigration numbers is expected to be followed \nby another decline to previous levels within 2 to 3 years.\n  And finally, in historical terms, legal immigration is moderate when \nmeasured as a percentage of the U.S. population--0.3 percent--the most \naccurate measurement of immigrants' economic and demographic impact. \nNumerically, legal immigration in 1996 was below the level recorded on \n10 other occasions since 1904.\n  As chairman of the Senate Immigation Subcommittee, I hope this \nanalysis sheds light on the legal immigration numbers released \nyesterday by INS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Immigration \nSubcommittee's analysis of the 1996 INS legal immigration numbers be \nincluded in the Record. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\n                Senate Immigration Subcommittee Analysis\n\n\n 1996 ins legal immigration increase part of a temporary rise followed \n by decrease to previous levels; '86 amnesty, ins processing delays in \n                            '95 led to rise\n\n       Washington.--The Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     (INS) today officially released its legal immigration numbers \n     for 1996. Attached please find an analysis by the staff of \n     the Senate Immigration Subcommittee that helps place these \n     numbers into context.\n       The analysis finds:\n       The 1996 increase in immigration is not part of a long-term \n     rise in legal immigration but rather a temporary increase.\n       Many additional people being counted as immigrants in 1996 \n     and 1997 were not new entrants but were already physically in \n     the country as the spouses of those who received amnesty \n     under the law signed by President Reagan in 1986.\n       The increase is due largely to INS processing delays that \n     caused many people who would have been counted as immigrants \n     in 1995 to be counted in 1996.\n       After a 20 percent decline between 1993 and 1995, this \n     short-term increase in legal immigration numbers is expected \n     to be followed by another decline to previous levels within \n     two to three years.\n       In historic terms, legal immigration is moderate when \n     measured as a percentage of the U.S. population (0.3%)--the \n     most accurate measurement of immigrants' economic and \n     demographic impact. Numerically, legal immigration in 1996 \n     was below the level recorded on 10 other occasions since \n     1904.\n\n         An Analysis of the 1996 INS Legal Immigration Numbers\n\n\nprepared by the staff of the senate subcommittee on immigration--april \n                                  1997\n\n       Summary: Between 1993 and 1995, the level of legal \n     immigration declined by 20 percent. An analysis performed by \n     the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has determined that \n     the increase in immigration reported by the INS for 1996 is \n     part of a temporary trend and that the overall immigration \n     numbers are projected to decline again within three years. \n     The analysis shows that legal immigration is projected to \n     plateau potentially in 1997, but more likely in 1998 or the \n     following year according to the latest INS projections--and \n     then to fall. Simply put, the 1996 increase from 1995 is not \n     part of a long-term rise in legal immigration.\n       The subcommittee analysis shows that the approximately 27 \n     percent increase in legal immigration in 1996, from 720,461 \n     in 1995 to 915,900 in 1996, is explained by three factors: \n     (1) INS processing delays in 1995 that led immigrants to be \n     counted in 1996, rather than in 1995; (2) The aftermath of \n     the 1986 Amnesty signed by President Reagan, which has \n     enabled formerly undocumented immigrants to sponsor their \n     spouses and children; and (3) the result of unused employment \n     visas in 1995 that on a one-time basis boosted 1996's \n     available total for family preference visas.\n       The 1996 immigration rate is lower than every year in the \n     nation's history between 1840 and 1930, actually one-third \n     the rate for many of those years, and lower even in absolute \n     terms than near the turn of the century. By the most accurate \n     measure of immigrants' demographic and economic impact on \n     America--the annual immigration total as a percentage of the \n     U.S. population--legal immigration remains moderate in \n     historical terms at only 0.3 percent of the populace.\n\n\n               background on the legal immigration system\n\n       Immigration categories are numerically restricted for \n     family and business, with the sole exception being the \n     ``immediate relatives'' of U.S. citizens, whose totals \n     changed little between 1986 and 1995. Their totals have risen \n     over the last year, but their rise is part of a short term \n     confluence of factors that is expected dissipate within the \n     next two to three years. Under U.S. law, an American citizen \n     can petition for (1) a spouse or minor child, (2) a parent, \n     (3) a married child or a child 21 or older, or (4) a brother \n     or sister. A lawful permanent resident (green card holder) \n     can petition only for a spouse or child.\\1\\ There are no \n     ``extended family'' categories for aunts or uncles in the \n     U.S. immigration system. Approximately three-quarters of all \n     family immigration visas went to the spouses and children \n     categories in 1996. The other one-fourth went to the parents \n     and sibling of U.S. citizens. In addition, up to 140,000 \n     people a year can immigrate with employment-based visas. \n     Refugees are admitted after entering the country following \n     the annual consultative process by which Congress and the \n     President set each year's refugee totals. Finally, there are \n     a limited number of ``diversity'' visas distributed to \n     immigrants from ``underrepresented'' countries. In the \n     immigration system as a whole, no country may receive more \n     than 7 percent of the total visas allotted in a given year, \n     although an exception is made for the spouses and children of \n     lawful permanent residents.\\2\\\n\n\n       legal immigration is projected to plateau and then decline\n\n       The analysis performed by the staff of the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Immigration leads to one overarching \n     conclusion: The 1996 increase in immigration is not part of a \n     long-term rise in legal immigration but rather a temporary \n     increase.\n       The conclusion that legal immigration will fall after a \n     temporary two- to three-year bump upwards is already part of \n     the public record. At a May 16, 1996 hearing before the House \n     Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, Susan Martin, \n     executive director of the U.S. Commission on Immigration \n     Reform, stated, ``As the INS figures released on April 25 \n     show, immigration levels will increase, without any change in \n     current law, for the next two years and then return to \n     approximately the level of last year.'' \\3\\ [Emphasis added.] \n     The 1995 total was 720,461, well below the 1996 total.\n     1. Processing Delays Artificially Inflate 1996 Totals\n       At the same hearing, House Immigration and Claims \n     Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX) correctly pinpointed \n     the primary reason that legal immigration was expected to \n     rise from 1995 to 1996. He stated, ``The FY 1995 figures were \n     artificially low. An administrative logjam prevented the \n     issuance in 1995 of immigrant visas to tens of thousands of \n     individuals who were eligible to receive them and to be \n     admitted immediately to the United States. This logjam \n     resulted from delays in processing applications for green \n     cards under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act, a new provision that was effective for the first time in \n     1995.'' \\4\\\n       As Rep. Smith pointed out, a new procedure that allowed \n     people to obtain green cards in the United States rather than \n     having to travel to a consulate in their home countries \n     significantly increased processing at INS offices in 1995 and \n     caused delays. Those delays caused at least tens of thousands \n     of people who would have been counted as immigrants in 1995, \n     to be counted in 1996 instead. In other words, the 1996 \n     increase is in many ways a bookkeeping phenomenon. As Figure \n     2 illustrates, when one smooths out the one-year blips in \n     1995 processing and other one-time anomalies and instead uses \n     two-year averages, the data show that since 1990 the general \n     direction in immigration has been downward.\n     2. The Aftermath of the Amnesty Artificially Increased 1996 \n         Totals: Many People Newly Counted Were Already in the \n         Country\n       The years 1989, 1990, and 1991 were artificially high \n     because of the amnesty of undocumented immigrants signed into \n     law by President Ronald Reagan under the Immigration Reform \n     and Control Act of 1986. Yet it is equally true that much of \n     the increase we have seen in annual immigration totals since \n     those years are also a result of that amnesty.\n       That brings us to an important point that illustrates why \n     many of those included in the 1996 increase do not represent \n     an increase in new people physically entering the United \n     States. In other words, many additional people being counted \n     as immigrants for the period 1996-1999 are already here.\n       Here is what happened as a result of the 1986 law: When \n     Congress granted amnesty to undocumented immigrants, it made \n     no additional visas available for close relatives of the \n     amnesty recipients, which eventually created a large backlog \n     in the category. Between 1986 and 1990, the INS adopted the \n     administrative policy of not deporting those relatives and \n     allowing them to obtain work authorization. In 1990, Congress \n     provided 55,000 visas a year to help these spouses and \n     children gain permanent residence and to remain lawfully \n     under Family Unity. Therefore, the spouses and children of \n     many immigrants legalized by the amnesty have been waiting \n     for their green cards while living with their sponsors in the \n     United States. Amnesty recipients have now completed their \n     five years of permanent residence required to apply for \n     citizenship. Now that those formerly illegal immigrants are \n     becoming citizens, under the law they can gain visas \n     immediately for their spouses and children without a waiting \n     list, since the spouses and children would be the immediate \n     relatives of U.S. citizens (and there is no quota on the \n     immediate relatives of U.S. citizens). In essence, that means \n     that much of the increase in immigration in 1996 and 1997--\n     most of which is in the category for the immediate relatives \n     of U.S. citizens--will be the INS handing out green cards to \n     spouses and children already physically here. It is that \n     accounting phenomenon that will disappear after a few years.\n     3. One Additional Factor: Unused Employment Visas\n       Another reason for the 1996 increase is the combination of \n     the lower immediate relatives total, which is related to the \n     INS processing delays, and unused employment visas from 1995. \n     Under U.S. law, if the number of immediate relatives of U.S. \n     citizens does not exceed a certain level (in practice \n     254,000), then the unused employment visas from that year are \n     added to the next year's total of family preference visas. In \n     1996, that made 85,000 more immigrant visas available to the \n     family preference categories. Under the law, all of those \n     additional visas went to the spouses and children of lawful \n     permanent residents. However, the way the law operates, those \n     additional visas will not be available in 1997 (because \n     immediate relative immigration in 1996 was above 254,000.) \n     The U.S. State Department has calculated that family \n     preference visas will decline from 311,819 in 1996 to 226,000 \n     in 1997, a drop of 27 percent.\\5\\\n       Figure 1 (on page 1), based in part on INS projections, \n     shows that after a plateau is reached potentially in 1997, \n     but more likely in 1998, legal immigration is projected to \n     decline again. The latest information from the INS indicates \n     that 1998 may be the peak year. It is possible that due to \n     INS processing and naturalizations we will find that 1999\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\n     is the high point. Most important, however, is that these \n     numbers will decline after this short-term rise. Note that \n     the INS projections in Figure 1 did not take into account the \n     impact of the income and sponsorship requirements passed \n     under the 1996 immigration bill. Those new requirements are \n     expected to have at least some effect in reducing legal \n     immigration, particularly among spouses and children, that is \n     not reflected in the INS projections.\n\n\n        in historical terms, legal immigration remains moderate\n\n       As a percentage of the U.S. population--the most accurate \n     measurement of the impact of immigration--legal immigration \n     is moderate by historical standards. The annual rate of legal \n     immigration in 1996 equaled just 0.3 percent of the U.S. \n     population--less than one-third the rate near the turn of the \n     century and lower than every year in the nation's history \n     between 1840 and 1930. Even in absolute terms, the 1996 total \n     is less than the annual totals near the turn of the century \n     when America was smaller and less economically developed, and \n     therefore less capable of absorbing new people than it is \n     today. Numerically, legal immigration in 1996 was below the \n     level recorded in 10 other occasions since 1904.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Our legal immigration system is based on America's \n     historical commitment to immigration and to the principle \n     that it is sound public policy to unite close family members, \n     help employers sponsor needed employees, and provide \n     humanitarian relief for those fleeing religious or political \n     persecution. While numbers are a part of the system, it is \n     important that we understand what the numbers mean and \n     approach them with a minimum of rhetoric, but rather with a \n     premium on intelligent debate.\n       Ben Wattenberg of the American Enterprise Institute \n     describes the current level of immigration using this \n     illustration: Imagine you are in a giant ballroom where 1,000 \n     people are gathered for a Washington cocktail party. \n     Champagne is being poured, waiters are carrying trays of hors \n     d'oeuvers, and into the room walk three more people. Those \n     three people represent the proportion of the U.S. population \n     that immigrants add each year. There is little evidence these \n     immigrants are spoiling the party.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ INA Sections 201 and 203.\n     \\2\\ INA Section 202(a)(1) states that the ``total number of \n     immigrant visas made available to natives of any single \n     foreign state . . . may not exceed 7 percent'' in a fiscal \n     year. Under the law, 75 percent of the visas for the spouses \n     and children of lawful permanent residents are not subject to \n     the 7 percent ceiling.\n     \\3\\ Statement of Susan Martin, Executive Director, U.S. \n     Commission on Immigration Reform, Subcommittee on Immigration \n     and Claims, U.S. House of Representatives, May 16, 1996.\n     \\4\\ Opening Statement, Chairman Lamar Smith, ``Projected \n     Increases in Legal Immigration,'' Hearing Before the House \n     Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, May 16, 1996, p. 3.\n     \\5\\ Immigrant Visa Control and Reporting Division, U.S. \n     Department of State, ``Various Determinations of Numerical \n     Limits of Immigrants Required Under the Terms of The \n     Immigration and Nationality Act as Amended by the Immigration \n     Act of 1990,'' for FY 1996 and FY 1997.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate home \nschoolers in Missouri who are celebrating Missouri Home Education Week, \nMay 4-10, 1997. As a parent and former teacher, I understand the vital \nimportance of sound education in a child's development. The \nopportunities for students who achieve educational excellence are \nvirtually limitless.\n  As a U.S. Senator I fully recognize that the character and \nproductivity of our Nation are directly linked to the quality of \neducation provided to America's youth. Throughout my career in public \nservice, I have been pleased to support the efforts of home schoolers \nto provide quality education.\n  Home educators in Missouri are making an extra effort to give their \nchildren the best chance for success in an ever-changing society. They \nrecognize the importance of family and judge home schooling to be the \neducational setting that is most appropriate. By personally guiding the \nscholastic endeavors of their children, home educators ensure that all \nfacets of a child's development are considered when preparing them to \nbecome active, productive, and responsible citizens.\n  In Missouri, home education has enjoyed considerable success in \nrecent years because of the tremendous support received from citizens \nall across the State who realize the significance of family \nparticipation in the educational process. Furthermore, Missouri home \nschoolers are establishing one-on-one relationships with adult role \nmodels and mentors who enrich home education learning by providing \nhands-on business experience. This exposure to the marketplace allows \nhome schoolers the opportunity to interact with business, community, \nand civic organizations.\n  I commend the achievement realized by home schools in the State of \nMissouri and applaud your noble work on this special observance of Home \nEducation Week in Missouri, May 4-10, 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3548-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3548-S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1619.

A bill to provide for expanded research concerning the \nenvironmental and genetic susceptibilities for breast cancer; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the new jersey women's environmental health act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator Lautenberg and I are \nintroducing the New Jersey Women's Environmental Health Act. I rise to \ndraw this country's attention to breast cancer and the threat that it \nfaces to all American women. It is estimated that more than one in \neight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. Over \n46,000 women will die each year. The American Cancer Society estimates \n6,400 new cases of breast\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\ncancer in New Jersey in 1997--an estimated 1,800 deaths in this year \nalone. It is for this reason that I speak today, in an effort to \nheighten the awareness of breast cancer in our Nation and its possible \nenvironmental causes.\n  Breast cancer in New Jersey is much worse than the rest of the \ncountry. New Jersey has the highest breast cancer death rate of any \nState in the Nation. Overall, New Jersey has an 11 percent higher \nincidence rate of breast cancer than the national rate. Between 1988-92 \nNew Jersey's rate was 110.8. For the United States the rate was only \n105.6. The highest counties include: Warren, 34.8 percent; Morris, 20.7 \npercent; and Monmouth, 18.5 percent. During this time, 19 of New \nJersey's 21 counties had a higher incidence rate of breast cancer than \nthe national average and two-thirds of these counties had a 10 percent \nor higher incidence rate of breast cancer than the national average.\n  Federal and national foundation funding is disproportionately low for \na State with a significant academic and research presence, and an \nexceptionally high death rate from breast cancer. The per capita \nexpenditure on breast cancer funding in New Jersey is only $0.15. \nNeighboring states with lower breast cancer rates have received \nsignificantly more funding per capita. New York receives $1.11 and \nMassachusetts receives $3.05. In general, New Jersey gets only $0.62 \nback for every tax dollar sent to Washington. We contribute $17 billion \nmore to the Federal Treasury than we get back--the lowest return in the \nNation.\n  I believe that behind our State's history of environmental problems \nlies the reasons for our high breast cancer rates. It is not a \ncoincidence that New Jersey, the State with the most Superfund sites, \nalso has the highest breast cancer rates. The current breast cancer \nresearch efforts are not being focused on epidemiological studies that \ninvestigate the effect of environmental factors. The value of providing \nexpanded research concerning the environmental factors for breast \ncancer in New Jersey is essential not only to New Jersey women, but to \nall women across the country.\n  I am optimistic that not only will this study provides some answers \nfor women in New Jersey, but will provide groundbreaking research on \nthe impact of environmental conditions on breast cancer rates which \nwill benefit doctors across this country in their efforts to find a \ncure for this tragic disease. I ask unanimous consent that this be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``New Jersey Women's \n     Environmental Health Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American Cancer Society estimates 6,400 new cases \n     of breast cancer will be diagnosed in New Jersey in 1997 with \n     an estimated 1,800 deaths.\n       (2) In New Jersey, from 1989 to 1993, 8,378 women died from \n     breast cancer. The average mortality rate per 100,000 was \n     31.1 for white women and 34.4 for African American women.\n       (3) New Jersey has the second highest breast cancer \n     mortality rate (31.1) of any state in the United States. New \n     Jersey also has more superfund sites (107) than any other \n     State.\n       (4) During the period from 1988 to 1992--\n       (A) New Jersey's incidence rate (110.8) of breast cancer \n     was 11 percent higher than the national incidence rate \n     (105.6);\n       (B) 19 of New Jersey's 21 counties had a higher incidence \n     rate of breast cancer than the national average; and\n       (C) two-thirds of the counties described in subparagraph \n     (B) have a 10 percent or higher incidence rate of breast \n     cancer than the national average.\n       (5) The State's University of the Health Sciences is one of \n     only 7 joint centers in the United States, and the only such \n     center in New Jersey, that house a National Cancer Institute \n     designated research center and a National Institute of \n     Environmental Health Sciences research center.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESEARCH CONCERNING BREAST CANCER.\n\n       (a) Grant.--The Secretary of Defense is authorized to award \n     one or more grants to the University of the Health Sciences \n     of New Jersey (hereafter referred to in this Act as the \n     ``University'') to enable the University and affiliates of \n     the University to conduct research, in collaboration with the \n     New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, \n     concerning environmental, lifestyle, and genetic \n     susceptibilities for breast cancer in the State of New \n     Jersey.\n       (b) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The University shall use amounts received under \n     the grant under subsection (a) to conduct a study to assess \n     biological markers, exposure to carcinogens, and other \n     potential risk factors contributing to the incidence of \n     breast cancer in the State of New Jersey.\n       (2) Epidemiological study.--The New Jersey Department of \n     Health and Senior Services shall be the co-investigator with \n     the University for any population based epidemiologic studies \n     under paragraph (1) that attempt to explore associations \n     between environmental and other risk factors and breast \n     cancer.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     University (and the affiliates of the University conducting \n     the study under this subsection) shall prepare and submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report describing \n     the findings and progress made as a result of the studies \n     conducted under paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated--\n       (1) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1998; and\n       (2) $2,500,000 for each of fiscal years 1999 through 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 632. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with \nrespect to the eligibility of veterans for mortgage revenue bond \nfinancing, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              mortgage revenue bond financing legislation\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Wyden that will help Wisconsin and several other States, \nincluding Oregon, Texas, Alaska, and California, extend one of our most \nsuccessful veterans programs to Persian Gulf war participants and \nothers. This bill will amend the eligibility requirements for mortgage \nrevenue bond financing for State veterans housing programs.\n  Wisconsin uses this tax-exempt bond authority to assist veterans in \npurchasing their first home. Under rules adopted by Congress in 1984, \nthis program excluded from eligibility veterans who served after 1977. \nThis bill would simply remove that restriction.\n  Wisconsin and the other eligible States simply want to maintain a \nprinciple that we in the Senate have also strived to uphold--that \nveterans of the Persian Gulf war should not be treated less generously \nthan those of past wars. This bill will make that possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Petroglyph Monument Establishment Act of \n1990 to adjust the boundary of the monument, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    the petroglyph national monument boundary adjustment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nfor the past 6 years, I hoped would not be necessary. This legislation \nis necessary, however, to ensure that the American people will continue \nto be able to enjoy the natural and cultural resources of Petroglyph \nNational Monument.\n\n  For almost 10 years, I have worked to provide needed protection for \nthe invaluable cultural resources located throughout the 17-mile-long \nescarpment on Albuquerque's west side. In 1990, New Mexico's \ncongressional delegation successfully enacted legislation which I \nsponsored in the U.S. Senate to establish Petroglyph National Monument. \nThe bill was signed by President George Bush on June 27, 1990, \nproviding protection for prehistoric and historic artifacts from \nlooting, vandalism, and imminent development.\n  That legislation provided a unique management program for the new \nmonument, directly involving the National Park Service, the State of \nNew Mexico, and the city of Albuquerque. Cooperation was and remains \ncritical because, among other reasons, the State of New Mexico and the \ncity of Albuquerque hold title to almost 63 percent of the land within \nthe boundaries of the monument. Albuquerque alone holds title to about \n3,800 acres of the 7,244 acres within the monument. In order to provide \nprotection of the petroglyphs and other artifacts along the escarpment, \na partnership between the three layers of government--Federal, State \nand local--remains the most appropriate way of managing these important \nresources.\n  Even before its introduction, I have already heard from several of my \ncolleagues that the Domenici bill regarding petroglyphs has begun to \ngenerate controversy. I am sure that many more things will be said \nabout it following today's introduction. By introducing this \nlegislation, I want to reduced the debate to the basic essence of the \nrelevant issues. It is about resolving a problem for two growing \ncommunities that encompass a national monument. That resolution \ninvolves providing access to less than one-quarter mile of a right-of-\nway that has been in the planning process for well over a decade. The \nproblem with that one-quarter mile stretch is that it falls on city-\nowned land within the current boundaries of the national monument.\n  This legislation will adjust the monument boundary to exclude \napproximately 8.5 acres, providing a corridor for the extension of \nPaseo del Norte. This accounts for approximately one-tenth of 1 percent \nof the 7,244 acres within the monument boundary. This is not an \nauthorization for the city of Albuquerque to begin construction on the \nroad. When passed, it will simply remove the Federal Government as a \nbarrier to the process of developing locally needed access to \nAlbuquerque's west side.\n  In order to maintain the local support needed to sustain a national \nmonument in an urban area, the city's needs must be acknowledged and \ndealt with. The extension of Paseo del Norte is an important piece of \nthe planned transportation network for the west side. Access to much of \nthe area for emergency services, such as ambulance and fire equipment, \nis currently inadequate. Albuquerque and Rio Rancho must have the \nability to deal with the needs of those who already live and work in \nthe area, and plan for needs of those who will live and work there in \nthe future. At this point, growth and development north and east of the \nmonument have eliminated any other reasonable alternatives that would \nresolve the problems that the cities face. The need for a resolution is \nindicated by demographic and traffic pattern projections provided by \nthe regional planning organization, the Middle Rio Grande Council of \nGovernments.\n  The extension of Paseo del Norte and the protection of the monument's \ncultural resources are not mutually exclusive ideas. They have been \nbrought together before when a coalition was put together in 1989 to \naddress these very same issues. At that time, the transportation needs \nand preservation concerns were coordinated to move forward with an idea \nthat all could support. That plan, which resulted in the creation of \nPetroglyph National Monument, acknowledged the idea that neither the \nPaseo del Norte or Unser boulevard extensions would detract from the \nintegrity of the monument, and the purposes for which it was created. \nSince that time, the city of Albuquerque has gone to great lengths to \nminimize any disturbance to the artifacts. In fact, the proposed road \nalignment would not directly impact a single petroglyph as it ascends \nthe escarpment.\n  This legislation will once again commit us to the goal of a national \nmonument that benefits the Albuquerque area, the Pueblo people, and the \npublic, at large. The relationship between the city and the National \nPark Service has deteriorated since all parties entered into a 1991 \njoint administrative agreement. The situation now goes beyond issues \nsurrounding the transportation planning of the city of Albuquerque, \ncentered around Paseo del Norte, and whether it should or shouldn't be \nextended to the west side of the escarpment. As I mentioned earlier, \nthe city of Albuquerque owns well over half of the land within the \nmonument boundary. A breakdown of cohesive and coordinated management \nof the monument and its natural and cultural resources continues, and \nthreatens to dissolve the support of the local communities and the \nsurrounding municipalities. As was the case when the monument was \nestablished, a return to the intimate working relationship between the \nNational Park Service and the cities of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho is \nrequired. This cannot happen, however, until the issues surrounding \ntransportation planning are resolved, just as they were when the \nmonument was established. Without a cooperative and productive \nrelationship between the cities and the Park Service, the monument will \nnever be what it was intended to be--a benefit to all Americans.\n  Throughout the ongoing debate, the urban development on Albuquerque's \nwest side has been a constant reminder that the monument does not exist \nin a vacuum. Efforts to manage and protect the monument's natural and \ncultural resources must be coordinated with the needs of New Mexico's \nfastest growing cities--Albuquerque and Rio Rancho. That is to say that \nneither altruistic protectionism, nor unmitigated growth can be \nparamount in this relationship.\n  Both the city and the Park Service have made it clear that \nlegislation is required to reach the goal we all desire. Unfortunately, \nthere is no agreement on what the legislation should include. The city \nsees its transportation and infrastructure needs as the most important \ncomponent. The Park Service believes that resource management and \nprotection need to be considered as the top priority. Both the Park \nService and the city have sound reasons for their respective positions. \nI believe that this legislation is not only the right thing for the \ncity of Albuquerque or Rio Rancho, but the right thing for Petroglyph \nNational Monument.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that neither the \nPark Service, nor the city of Albuquerque\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\ncan continue to pursue its own agenda without considering the needs of \nthe other. We must all begin to refocus our efforts on our ultimate \ngoal, providing for Petroglyph National Monument in a way that we can \nall be proud. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that is \ncritical to the communities of the Albuquerque area. Just as important, \nthis legislation is vital to the continued enhancement and protection \nof the national monument we created in that urban area to preserve \nthese invaluable cultural resources.\n  Without this, it seems to me the park will never again have \ncooperation between the city, the State, and the Federal Government and \nwhat could have been a marvelous example of government working together \nwill probably end up in shambles.\n  I send the bill to the desk and ask it be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deposit \nin the highway trust fund the receipts of the 4.3-cent increase in the \nfuel tax rates enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ntransfer 4.3 cents of the Federal gas tax currently used for deficit \nreduction to transportation purposes.\n  Specifically, this bill will transfer 3.8 cents to the highway \naccount of the highway trust fund and one-half penny to a new intercity \npassenger rail account to be used for Amtrak or other intercity \npassenger rail service.\n  Mr. President, this bill is important because it is time to give the \nAmerican taxpayers the confidence that the fuel taxes they pay will be \nused for transportation purposes.\n  The 3.8 cents deposited in the highway account means over $5.5 \nbillion in additional funds would be available each year for \ntransportation improvements. Those improvements could be for highway \nmaintenance or other infrastructure safety improvements; mass transit \nprojects; bikepaths; pedestrian walkways; or a variety of other \ntransportation projects that are eligible today under the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act.\n  This Nation is losing ground with regard to transportation \ninvestments. Japan spends four times the United States on \ntransportation as a percentage of gross domestic product. And the \nEuropeans spend twice as much.\n  These and other countries envy our transportation system. We cannot \nafford to allow our global competitors to outspend us on infrastructure \nimprovements. Our ability to remain competitive in the future is tied \nto maintaining an efficient transportation system and highly mobile \nworkforce.\n  And Amtrak remains an important component of such a transportation \nsystem. Every country that has a passenger rail system provides some \ngovernment financial assistance. It only makes sense that this country \ndo the same.\n  Amtrak is important to many communities around the country--it serves \nover 530 cities and towns. These include 12 in my State of Montana--\nLibby, Whitefish, West Glacier, Essex, East Glacier, Cut Bank, Malta, \nBrowning, Shelby, Havre, Wolf Point, and Glasgow. These Montana \ncommunities rely upon Amtrak as a transportation option.\n  And Amtrak is an important economic lifeline. Not only for the jobs \ndirectly related to Amtrak service, but Amtrak is an important tool in \nMontana's tourism industry. Each year, Amtrak brings thousands of folks \nto our State to ski, hike, or just enjoy the beauty of Montana.\n  But in order for Amtrak to remain a component of this Nation's \ntransportation system, it must have a dedicated revenue source. Such a \nrevenue source will give Amtrak the ability to do long-term \ncapitalization planning--planning and improvements that must be made in \norder for Amtrak to remain viable.\n  While I do not agree that Amtrak should be funded off of the top of \nthe highway trust fund as has been suggested by the administration, I \ndo feel we need to financially support Amtrak into the next century.\n  My bill will do that. It will provide a substantial increase in \navailable funds for all modes of transportation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 634\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for investments in disadvantaged and women-owned business \nenterprises; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          the minority and women capital formation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof introducing legislation captioned the Minority and Women Capital \nFormation Act of 1997.\n  I am introducing this legislation which is designed to be an economic \nstimulus to promote jobs and economic opportunity. Unquestionably, \nsmall minority and women-owned businesses can and must play an integral \nrole in expanding our economy, but they cannot do so unless we are able \nto close the great capital gap facing these businesses.\n  This bill, captioned the Minority and Women Capital Formation Act of \n1997, would close this gap by providing targeted tax incentives for \ninvestors to invest equity capital in minority and women-owned small \nbusinesses, as well as venture capital funds which are dedicated to \ninvesting in minority and/or women-owned businesses.\n  As long as the Internal Revenue Code continues tax incentives to \npromote specified business activities, then I believe this legislation \nis warranted. If we were to adopt a flat or modified flat tax which I \nfavor, and have proposed, then I would be willing to forgo the tax \nincentive because I believe sufficient additional capital would be \navailable for the purpose without the specific incentive.\n  Small businesses in general face limited access to capital. In many \ninstances, this lack of access amounts to a failure of many such \nbusinesses to succeed. But unlike other small businesses owned by \nminorities or women which have traditionally faced greater barriers in \naddressing private capital for startups, these businesses have been \nunable to achieve such funding.\n  Candidly, many of these barriers are founded in racism and sexism, \ntwo subjects we do not like to talk about but two subjects which are \nvery important and really very pervasive in our society.\n  While the United States has benefited from civil rights laws, we have \nnot yet moved ahead on the business front to provide the kinds of \ncapitalization which we need. The ``capital gap'' is a phrase adopted \nby the U.S. Commission on Minority Business Development. In its 1990 \ninterim report, the Commission found that the availability of capital \nis probably the single most important variable affecting minority \nbusiness. As stated by the Commission ``the problem is twofold: Lack of \naccess to capital and credit and the need for development of \nalternatives to conventional financial instruments and \nintermediaries.''\n  In its 1992 final report, the Commission said: ``Without timely \naccess to capital, you can't start or grow a business, particularly \ngrowth firms being weaned off solely Government business.''\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\n  In 1988, the House Committee on Small Business, in its report, New \nEconomic Realties, The Rise of Women Entrepreneurs, also noted the \nbarriers which women face in accessing capital and the need for the \nFederal Government to take into account alternative development \nfinancing institutions and eliminating or circumventing such barriers.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is designed to focus our attention on \ncritical elements of a national strategy for providing access to \ncapital and credit from minorities and women in business. The bill \nprovides investors, and others who invest equity, capital in a small \nminority or women-owned businesses or venture capital for minorities, \nAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, et cetera, will have tax breaks of, \nfirst, the option to elect either a tax deduction or a tax credit \nsubject to certain annual and lifetime caps and, second, a partial \ncapital gains exclusion of limited deferral of the remaining capital \ngain if it is reinvested in another minority or women-owned small \nbusiness.\n  Mr. Robert Johnson, president of Black Entertainment Holdings, a \nminority-controlled enterprise publicly traded on the New York Stock \nExchange, testified in 1992 before the Banking Committee on the \navailability of capital to minority businesses. He stated: ``The \nurgency of the problem requires more adventuresome kinds of policies. \nPolicies that are designed to deal with a specific problem should be \nproblem specific in their solution.''\n\n  Mr. President, I note that in the 1981 to 1990 timeframe, the venture \ncapital resources increased from approximately $5.8 billion to some $36 \nbillion but less than one-half of 1 percent of the capital raised by \nthe majority venture capital industry was invested in minority- or \nwomen-operated businesses, which demonstrates the need for legislation \nof this type and incentives.\n  I believe minority and women small business development is critical \nto urban revitalization, job creation, and long-term economic growth. \nNo one denies the need for urban revitalization and job creation to \nfacilitate a sustained economic recovery. And no one should deny the \nrole that women and minority business owners must have in this effort. \nDuring the 102d Congress as a member of the Banking Committee, I heard \nmany firsthand accounts concerning the lack of access to capital for \nminority- and women-owned businesses. In some cases the cause is \noutright discrimination; in other instances investor or lender \nignorance of the marketplace; in other fear. Whatever the cause, we are \nfacing an emergency that requires Congress' and the President's \nimmediate attention.\n  To avoid abuse, the bill also imposes minimum holding periods of 5 \nyears for such investments and contains recapture provisions for \ninstances where the minority- or women-owned business or venture \ncapital fund fails to remain qualified within the meaning of the \nlegislation.\n  Admittedly, my proposal may not be inexpensive. To address the cost \nissue, perhaps the bill should be limited to a tax credit, or perhaps \nto the capital gains benefit. In any event, I am willing to work with \nthe estimators, my colleagues, and others to modify my bill as \nnecessary to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating the capital gap \nconfronting minority- and women-owned businesses.\n  Some may question the use of tax policy in the manner I am proposing. \nHowever, just as we use tax policy to foster development of housing, \njobs, and research and development, so too should we utilize tax policy \nto foster economic empowerment of minority and women business owners \nwho will provide jobs and generate tax revenues.\n  Stated differently, this bill is really a Federal investment strategy \nfor such businesses. The proposed tax expenditures represent seed \ncapital to help develop greater self-sufficiency in the long term. In \nthis regard, the bill recognizes that capital targeted to women and \nminority business is an essential, but often overlooked component of \neconomic development. In my judgment, it is a very creative tool to \nspur business growth and job creation, particularly in distressed \ncommunities.\n  Another very important feature of the bill is the provision of \nsimilar tax incentives for those who invest in venture capital funds \ndedicated to investing in minority- and/or women-owned businesses. \nPrior to 1970, the Federal Government had no dedicated sources of \nfinancing for disadvantaged businesses. In 1971, however, Congress \nauthorized the creation of the specialized small business investment \ncompany [SSBIC] program administered by the Small Business \nAdministration. For the last 20 years SSBIC's have been the primary \nsource of capital for disadvantaged businesses. In the face of \ntremendous obstacles SSBIC's and the minority venture capital industry \nhave made a real difference. For example, according to the National \nAssociation of Investment Companies [NAIC], over the last decade they \nhave raised and invested nearly $1 billion in disadvantaged businesses.\n  In sum, Mr. President, there remains a need to facilitate the \ndevelopment of minority- and women-owned small business. We cannot \nallow the capital gap to grow. If we are to remain a productive and \ncompetitive nation, we must eliminate it. Moreover, there is no \nsubstitute for equity capital. Federal policies should not focus \nexclusively on debt financing. With targeted tax incentives, such as \nthose that I am proposing, we can cause greater investment of equity in \nbusinesses that traditionally have not been able to access it to any \nsignificant degree. I believe this capital formation bill will take us \na long way toward achieving this goal. I, therefore, encourage my \ncolleagues to join my efforts to enact this much needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a congressional commemorative medal for \norgan donors and their families; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            the gift of life congressional medal act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take great pleasure today in introducing \nthe Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act of 1997. With this \nlegislation, which doesn't cost taxpayers a penny, Congress has the \nopportunity to recognize and encourage potential donors, and give hope \nto over 52,000 Americans who have end-stage disease. As a heart and \nlung transplant surgeon, I saw one in four of my patients die because \nof the lack of available donors. Public awareness simply has not kept \nup with the relatively new science of transplantation. As public \nservants, we need to do all we can to raise awareness about the gift of \nlife.\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\n  Under this bill, each donor or donor family will be eligible to \nreceive a commemorative Congressional medal. It is not expected that \nall families, many of whom wish to remain anonymous, will take \nadvantage of this opportunity. The program will be coordinated by the \nregional organ procurement organizations [OPO's] and managed by the \nentity administering the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. \nUpon request of the family or individual, a public official will \npresent the medal to the donor or the family. This creates a wonderful \nopportunity to honor those sharing life through donation and increase \npublic awareness. Some researchers have estimated that it may be \npossible to increase the number of organ donations by 80 percent \nthrough incentive programs and public education.\n  As several recent experiences have proved, any one of us, or any \nmember of our families, could need a life saving transplant tomorrow. \nWe would then be placed on a waiting list to anxiously await our turn, \nor our death. The number of people on the list has more than doubled \nsine 1990--and a new name is added to the list every 18 minutes. In my \nhome State of Tennessee, 98 Tennesseans died while waiting last year, \nand more than 900 people are in need in a transplant. Nationally, \nbecause of a lack or organs, close to 4,000 individuals died who were \non the list in 1996.\n  However, the official waiting list reflects only those who have been \nlucky enough to make it into the medical care system and to pass the \nfinancial hurdles. If you include all those reaching end-stage disease, \nthe number of people potentially needing organs or bone marrow, very \nlikely over 120,000, becomes staggering. Only a small fraction of that \nnumber would ever receive transplants, even if they had adequate \ninsurance. There simply are not enough organ and tissue donors, even to \nmeet present demand.\n  Federal policies surrounding the issue of organ transplantation are \ndifficult. Whenever you deal with whether someone lives or dies, there \nare no easy answers. There are between 15,000 and 20,000 potential \ndonors each year, yet inexcusably, there are only some 5,400 actual \ndonors. That's why we need you to help us educate others about the \nfacts surrounding tissue and organ donation.\n  This year and last, Mr. President, there has been unprecedented \ncooperation, on both sides of the aisle, and a growing commitment to \nawaken public compassion on behalf of those who need organ transplants. \nIt is my very great pleasure to introduce this bill on behalf of a \ngroup of Senators who have already contributed in extremely significant \nways to the cause of organ transplantation. And we are proud to ask you \nto join us, in encouraging people to give life to others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 637. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \ncontinue full-time-equivalent resident reimbursement for an additional \none year under Medicare for direct graduate medical education for \nresidents enrolled in combined approved primary care medical residency \ntraining programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 The Primary Care Promotion Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Primary Care \nPromotion Act of 1997. This bill would restore full Federal funding \nunder Medicare for graduate medical education for physicians \nspecializing in approved combined primary care residency training \nprograms. This legislation is needed to refocus the recently issued \nHCFA regulations that reduce the level of Federal funding to graduate \nmedical education paid by the Medicare program.\n  While HCFA's goals--reducing Medicare spending and placing sensible \nlimitations on the number of new specialists trained in this country--\nare praiseworthy, we must not lose sight of the fact that we face a \nshortage of primary care physicians, and particularly those who treat \nchildren.\n  The Federal Government has used Medicare dollars effectively to \nsupport physicians who specialize in care for our seniors. Now, in my \nview, we must make a similar commitment to ensure that medical \nprofessionals are prepared to meet the health needs of our children. \nDespite what the bulk of our health policy would suggest, the health \nneeds of our children are very different from those of their parents \nand grandparents. Children aren't miniature adults, and they need care \nthat is tailored to their special needs.\n  This legislation would greatly benefit children, because it would \nenable physicians to complete advanced training in combined specialties \nsuch as internal medicine and pediatrics or emergency medicine and \npediatrics. A recent survey by the American Boards of Internal Medicine \nand Pediatrics demonstrates the wisdom of this investment: over 70 \npercent of the physicians who were trained in the combined specialties \nof internal medicine and pediatrics between 1980 and 1995 currently \nwork as primary care providers. Because the health needs of children \nare so varied and so different from those of adults, they often require \ncare by physicians who have received specialized training.\n  The Primary Care Promotion Act is supported by a wide variety of \nprofessional medical associations, including pediatricians, specialists \nin internal medicine, children's hospitals, and medical educators. This \nlegislation has received bipartisan support in the House of \nRepresentatives, where it has been introduced by Representative Louise \nSlaughter, and we expect similar support in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 639. A bill to require the same distribution of child support \narrearages collected by Federal tax intercept as collected directly by \nthe States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  child support arrearages legislation\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill designed \nto rectify an inequity in child support law which will enable families \nto keep more of past-due support owed to them. I am extremely pleased \nthat my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, has joined me \ntoday in offering this bill, and that Representative Nancy Johnson is \noffering a companion bill in the House.\n  Last year, my bill, the Child Support Improvement Act of 1996, was \nenacted into law as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act (Welfare Reform Act). This bill \ncontained comprehensive reforms to ensure that deadbeat parents could \nno longer renege on their responsibilities as parents to care for and \nsupport their children. It included provisions to dramatically improve \nStates' ability to collect child support, particularly across State \nlines, and to take maximum advantage of computer technology in order to \ntrack down missing parents and ensure that child support gets paid \npromptly. It also will help increase the rate of paternity \nestablishment, require the provision if health insurance coverage in \nchild support orders, and improve the process for modifying support \norders. In short, it promises to bring hope and financial stability to \nthe millions of children and their single parents who depend on support \nfrom absent parents.\n  I am introducing a bill today which will close one small loophole \nthat remains outstanding. Prior to the enactment of the Welfare Reform \nAct last year, a State that collected child support arrearages for a \nfamily that had left welfare could choose to reimburse itself for \nwelfare expenditures with the arrears that accrued before the during \nAFDC receipt, before it paid the family arrears that accrued after the \nfamily left AFDC. Two-thirds of States chose to pay themselves back for \nAFDC outlays before paying the family, leaving the family with little, \nif any, of the money that accrued after they left the rolls. The \nWelfare Act rightfully changes this to require States to first pay the \nfamily the arrears collected when the family was not on welfare, before \nit can reimburse itself for assistance outlays. This provision \nincreases the likelihood of a family's success in leaving welfare by \nensuring that the family receives more of the child support collected \non its behalf.\n  Unfortunately, a small provision inserted in conference creates an \ninequity for families, whereby arrears collected via a tax intercept \n(instead of wages garnished by the State) will not be affected by this \nchange. It does not make sense that whether or not a family receives \nthe funds depends on the method by which it is collected. This \nprovision also rewards those States\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nwhich do little to collect child support but rely instead on the \nFederal tax system to intercept the funds. My bill corrects this \ninequity by imposing the same distribution scheme on arrears collected \nthrough the tax intercept as it does on arrears collected by the States \ndirectly. This will ensure that families receive more of the past-due \nsupport that is owed to them, helping them to remain economically \nindependent and to stay off welfare. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill, which not only promises to help families, but will further \nour goals of keeping families off of public assistance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 640. A bill to extend the transition period for aliens receiving \nsupplemental security income or food stamp benefits as of August 22, \n1996; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    implementation delay legislation\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on August 22, 1997, in nearly 100 days, \napproximately half a million legal immigrants in this country, \ncurrently receiving SSI, will lose their benefits. These recipients are \nelderly or disabled--a vulnerable part of our population.\n  Of the 80,000 legal immigrants at risk of losing their SSI benefits \nin New York State, more than 70,000 are in New York City. The city \nestimates that there will also be 130,000 immigrants who will lose food \nstamps.\n  According to New York City estimates, the loss of SSI and food stamps \nto city immigrants is a loss of $442 million from the Federal \nGovernment to immigrants in New York City in 1998.\n  On April 17, I joined with my colleagues Senators Chafee, Feinstein, \nMoynihan, DeWine, Lieberman, and Mikulski to introduce legislation that \nwill allow immigrants who were in the United States legally and were \nreceiving SSI and food stamps on August 22, 1996 (the day the welfare \nreform bill was enacted) to continue to receive those benefits.\n  Legal immigrants who were in this country and receiving benefits at \nthe time the welfare reform act was enacted should not have the rules \nchanged midstream.\n  The legislation introduced last Thursday also allows refugees who \nwere legally in the United States as of August 22, 1996 to receive SSI \nor food stamps, without a 5-year limitation. Refugees who entered after \nAugust 1996 will only be able to receive benefits for 5 years.\n  Congress needs time to enact legislation that will protect the most \nvulnerable population--the elderly and the disabled who are relying on \nthese Federal benefits and refugees who are fleeing persecution.\n  Enacting a legislative fix will take time but the clock is ticking \ncloser to August 1997, when benefits are expected to be cut.\n  That is why Senator Chafee, DeWine, and I are introducing a bill that \nwill provide the necessary time for Congress to further examine options \nand take action.\n  The bill will delay the cut-off period for legal immigrants who are \nSSI and food stamp recipients until February 22, 1998.\n  A delay in implementation will also allow immigrants who are trying \nto naturalize an additional 6 months to complete the citizenship \nprocess. This is especially important, because under the Welfare Reform \nAct, a legal immigrant who becomes an American citizen is eligible for \nbenefits as any other citizen.\n  The naturalization process can prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare--\nespecially for elderly and disabled poor immigrants. These people \nshould not be unfairly penalized for being caught in the bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues review the merits of this bill, \nas well as the Chafee-Feinstein-D'Amato bill to restore benefits to \ncertain categories of immigrants, and hope for their passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S.J. Res. 27. A joint resolution designating the month of June 1997, \nthe 15th anniversary of the Marshall plan, as George C. Marshall month, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        marshall plan resolution\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today the nations of Europe enjoy \nhistorically unprecedented freedoms and economic success as democracy \nflourishes across the continent. This was not the case a mere 50 years \nago.\n  I rise today to ask my colleagues and the American people to recall \nthe state of the European Continent at the end of World War II. Like \nmany of you, I will never forget the horrible devastation that the \nworld witnessed in Europe: the destruction of the world's most \nremarkable cities; devastation of God's beautiful countryside; and the \ndespair of the people. Europeans endured not only the ravages of two \nworld wars, but also economic and political turmoil throughout the \nfirst half of this century. As I recall, even the elements seemed to \nplot against a post-World War II European recovery--one of the harshest \nEuropean winters on record was in 1946.\n  This situation might well have precipitated renewed divisions and \nanother war rather than a lasting peace. It was quite possible that we \nmay have never enjoyed, in our lifetime, a Europe such as it thrives \ntoday, if it had not been for the foresight and wisdom of then-\nSecretary of State, and former Army Chief of Staff, Gen. George Catlett \nMarshall.\n  On behalf of the American people, George Marshall conceived and \nimplemented one of the most benevolent acts of charity in the history \nof mankind. Under his stewardship, the European Recovery Program, or \nMarshall plan, provided over $13 billion in economic relief to the \nnations of Europe. Marshall's ingenuity and leadership restored hope \nand pride to a disheartened people, helping them to rebuild their \ncities and societies and again be positive contributors to the \ninternational community.\n  With the economic recovery of Western Europe came political \nstability. The Marshall plan, which Winston Churchill characterized as \n``the most unsordid act in history,'' enabled the re-emergence of free, \ndemocratic institutions. Today, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nand the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are \nsuccessful institutions which can trace their origins to the Marshall \nplan.\n  General Marshall outlined his visionary initiative during remarks \ndelivered at Harvard University in June 1947. That same month, he met \nwith representatives of European nations to encourage their \nparticipation. Today, as we approach the 50th anniversary of that \nmonth, I am proud to introduce this resolution to once again \nacknowledge the integrity, vision, and benevolence of George Marshall, \nstatesman and soldier, and the unparalleled importance of the Marshall \nplan in shaping the world of the 20th century. It is important that we \ncontinue to foster the virtues embodied in the Marshall plan; virtues \nwhich all the world continues to expect from the United States. I \ninvite the support of my colleagues to this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments to discuss our environment following Earth Day 1997.\n  In consideration of the 27th annual commemoration of Earth Day, the \nAmerican people should remember that they have been fortunate to live \nin an industrialized and prosperous society that has afforded \nenvironmental protection. Growing consumer demand for parks, improved \nair quality, and open land for hunting and hiking is largely \nresponsible for improving the quality and quantity of ecological \nresources. Advances in technology, production methods, and \nmanufacturing practices, an offshoot of our economic growth, have \nresulted in less pollution.\n  However, Mr. President, Earth Day in 1970 was not the beginning of \nenvironmentalism in this Nation. Rather, it was evidence of a trend. \nSince the turn of the century, a strong conservation movement, led by \nrural interests, wanted national policy that would manage those \nresources they depended on to survive. Beginning with the passage of \nthe Wilderness Act, Congress responded to those interests. In the last \n27 years, the United States has continued to make great strides in \nimproving the quality of its environment.\n  The United States of America has become a world leader in so many \nenvironmental areas. The Clean Air Act has been strengthened, and the \nClean Water Act and the reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nhave improved the quality of our Nation's environment. We can take \npride in the progress that has been made in the last 27 years since the \nfirst Earth day, and we have learned a great deal. We are in far better \nshape than we were in 1970.\n  According to the EPA, between 1970-95, air pollutants have decreased \nsubstantially. EPA has also observed that our rivers, lakes, and \ncoastal waters are cleaner today than 25 years ago. Carol Browner, \nAdministrator of the EPA, stated yesterday that the United States has \nthe best drinking water in the world. We now recycle almost 35 percent \nof our municipal waste, 40 percent of all paper, and 60 percent of all \naluminum cans. Our children consider recycling a way of life.\n  Since 1970, air pollution has been steadily declining, despite the \nfact that the U.S. population has increased by 28 percent and vehicle \ntravel has increased by 116 percent. This is due in large part to \nadvanced emissions equipment on newer cars. But we have learned as a \npeople to change our personal habits as we demand that industry change \ntheirs. Air pollution, for example, would continue to be greatly \nimproved if people kept their vehicles, old and new, tuned up.\n  Mr. President, we know that humans will inevitably effect the \nenvironment because they are an inherent part of nature itself. We are \nnot in a battle against the environment; rather, we now know that we \nare interdependent. Congress has further learned that top-down \nadministration and imposition of regulations may not achieve the goal \nof true interdependence, but incentives, cooperation, respect for \nproperty rights, and more local control does. As most Americans have \ncome to learn, if you want a better society, you build it yourself.\n  The term ``sustainability'' has come to represent our Nation's \nenvironmental goals. Activists, entrepreneurs, and scientists are being \nsuccessfully linked with ecosystems. Technological advancements have \nshown us how to improve the environment. Programs such as the Waste-\nmanagement Education and Research Consortium, or WERC, which I put \ntogether several years ago, are the future of environmental protection, \nnot top-down regulation imposing unfunded mandates to\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\nstates. Let us leave local environmental issues to the locals.\n\n  Sustainability is a goal best realized with local initiative. This \nNation needs more flexible, market-oriented regulations that allow \nbusinesses more options for controlling pollution but that retain \nlimitations on overall discharges. Concern and cooperation has bred \nenvironmental self-reliant activism.\n  Communities have just now been able to achieve the National Ambient \nAir Quality Standards, and air quality is improving. According to the \nEPA, air pollutants have greatly decreased since the first Earth Day. \nLet's let communities continue to improve, rather than impose strict \nand costly new air quality standards before we know that they are based \nin sound science. We should be proud that we are reaping the benefits \nof our current standards.\n  The working people of this country appreciate and have a healthy \nrespect for nature. People who live on the land are closer to nature. \nComing from New Mexico, I see the interdependence and cooperation of \nagricultural, timber, native American, urban and environmental \ninterests. Congress has funded such programs as my initiative to \npreserve one of the largest areas of riparian cottonwood in the world, \nthe Rio Grande Bosque. In the middle of a growing city like \nAlbuquerque, citizens can walk among the native trees and animals. At \nthe Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, rare migratory birds \ncoexist with agricultural development. We all strive to maintain a \ndelicate balance in our society and on our planet.\n  We all have to live on this planet, at least for now. Some might say \nprogress is a curse. I say we are blessed in this Nation to be leaders \nin environmental protection and to also enjoy modern conveniences. \nContinuing progress is a blessing to all our families; we must just \nproceed to take care of our planet as we learn to live better in it.\n  This Congress will continue to work to improve environmental quality, \nand we will build on the experiences and successes of the past. We must \npromise to better our lives, our Nation, and our world. Earth Day \nshould be every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3561-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CINCINNATI TEACHER AT THE TOP\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise with a great deal of pleasure \nand pride to inform my colleagues that the 1997 National Teacher of the \nYear is Sharon Draper, an English and language arts teacher at Walnut \nHills High School in Cincinnati, OH.\n  Ms. Draper won the 1997 Ohio Teacher of the Year Award and was \nselected from four finalists to the receive the Nation's top teacher \naward. President Clinton presented this award at a White House \nceremony.\n  In addition to her talents as a teacher, Ms. Draper is an \naccomplished award-winning author. Her novel ``Tears of a Tiger'' won \nthe 1995 Corretta Scott King Genesis Award. Her second novel, ``Forged \nBy Fire,'' has been recently published.\n  Ms. Draper's dedication and outstanding commitment to education as \nwell as her efforts to improve education are the envy of every school \nsystem and Ohio is justifiably proud of her accomplishment.\n  At a time when our education is under a great deal of scrutiny and in \nneed of much improvement, it is important to remember that there are \nmany examples of educational excellence. Certainly one outstanding \nexample is Sharon Draper.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Ms. Draper and it was an honor. I \nwas at the White House to participate in the ceremony where she \nreceived the Teacher of the Year Award.\n  Ms. Draper's 25-year teaching career has been filled with creativity \nand enthusiasm. I understand that she requires a research paper in her \nsenior level classes. When her students turn in their paper the day \nbefore the prom she gives them a T-shirt that proclaims ``I survived \nthe Draper paper.'' She says that she was probably born to be a \nteacher.\n  I am pleased that the Council of Chief State School Officers and \nScholastic, Inc., have selected Ms. Draper as Teacher of the Year. I \nknow that her students, school, the city of Cincinnati, and our State \nare very proud. I congratulate Sharon, her husband Larry, and children \nCory and Crystal for the contribution they have made to public \neducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3562-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHUCK CONNER\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, for 17 years Chuck Conner has been \nmy top agriculture and nutrition advisor, and for the last 10 years has \nbeen Republican staff director of the Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry Committee. Chuck is departing the Senate to become president \nof the Corn Refiners Association.\n  Chuck has ushered four farm bills through the Senate, including last \nyear's historic FAIR Act that ended 60 years of Federal production \ncontrols. Chuck's work can be seen in moving American agriculture to \nthe free market, thoughtfully downsizing the Department of Agriculture, \nreforming hundreds of USDA field offices, making food safer through \npesticide regulations, saving and then reforming the farm credit \nsystem, updating commodity futures legislation, and landmark reform of \nthe nutrition sections in last year's welfare reform bill.\n  Chuck was with me on my Indiana farm June 28, 1985, when then \nSecretary of Agriculture Jack Block and I announced the first \nConservation Reserve Program. Today that program is still a vital \ncornerstone of soil and water conservation in America, and the \nextension of the program last year was part of the most significant \nenvironmental legislation in the 104th Congress. Chuck has been \ninvolved every step of the way.\n  He has combined a strong academic background, with an agricultural \neconomics degree from the Purdue University School of Agriculture, and \npractical knowledge of how programs are implemented. His family \ncontinues to operate an 1100-acre corn and soybean farm in Benton \nCounty, IN. Chuck and his wife Dru maintain a herd of 100 registered \nAngus cows in Whitley County, IN.\n  Chuck and Dru met in the early 1980's while working in my office. My \nwife, Char, and I have enjoyed watching the growth of their four \nchildren: Katie, Ben, Andrew, and Emily.\n  I will miss Chuck's counsel, which Agriculture Committee members have \ntrusted and respected. He now takes his leadership skills to \nagribusiness. On the committee he has hired, trained, and developed a \ntalented staff that will be led by his longtime deputy Randy Green, \nmaintaining continuity in service.\n  I speak for majority and minority members of the Agriculture \nCommittee in wishing Chuck Conner, an extraordinarily talented and \nloyal friend, the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3562-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3562-S3564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRESS HAS 100 DAYS TO RESTORE IMMIGRANT BENEFITS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Congress has 100 days to restore \nurgently needed assistance to legal immigrants and refugees.\n  On August 1, 100 days from today, legal immigrants who have worked \nhard, but were injured on the job, will lose their Federal benefits \nunder last year's so-called welfare reform law.\n  Refugees will lose their safety net. These are men and women who fled \npersecution in their own countries, only to find persecution now in \nAmerica.\n  They are people who fought with us in Southeast Asia, and this is the \nthanks they get from hawks who kept the war going long after it should \nhave stopped.\n  The Vietnam war and the cold war are finally over. But in the rush to \nforget, we cannot forget these brave families and their sacrifices, and \ntreat them unfairly, because they are old or disabled.\n  In recent weeks, some needy immigrants have taken their own lives, \nrather than burden their families.\n  We must say enough is enough--100 days is long enough for Congress to \nundo the thoughtless damage an unthinking Congress did last year. I ask \nthat a few recent news articles on this issue may be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 22, 1997]\n\n  Confused by Law, Nursing Homes Bar Legal Immigrants--Fear Over Lost \n                                Benefits\n\n                         (By Rachel L. Swarns)\n\n       As the health care industry braces for Federal cuts that \n     will leave thousands of immigrants without Medicaid this \n     fall, nursing\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\n     homes have begun to mistakenly deny admission to some elderly \n     and sickly legal immigrants who will not lose their health \n     coverage.\n       Bewildered by the new Federal welfare law and fearful that \n     immigrants will default on their bills, some health care \n     centers in New York and around the country are asking \n     prospective patients for citizenship papers instead of \n     residency papers upon admission, hospital and nursing home \n     administrators say.\n       And while New York State health officials acknowledge that \n     a small group of immigrants will lose Medicaid as Federal \n     restrictions go into effect later this year, they warn that \n     the new practice unfairly denies care to the vast majority \n     who will keep that coverage.\n       But as health care administrators peer into the faces of \n     their elderly applicants and struggle to interpret the law, \n     some have found it easier to refuse all legal immigrants--\n     those with green cards but not citizenship--than to figure \n     out who will keep benefits and who will lose them.\n       ``It's heartbreaking, but we're all too terrified to admit \n     anybody who is not a citizen,'' said Sheryl Geminder, the \n     director of admissions at the Sephardic Home for the Aged in \n     Brooklyn, which now rejects all legal immigrants who need \n     long-term care. ``A green card was the ticket in six months \n     ago, but now our attorneys are warning us not to take any \n     chances.\n       The confusion is the unintended consequence of the changes \n     in the Federal welfare laws, which allow states to continue \n     Medicaid to some legal immigrants while denying coverage to \n     others.\n       New York, along with at least 35 other states, plans to \n     continue benefits to poor legal immigrants who entered the \n     country before Aug. 22 of last year, when President Clinton \n     signed the welfare bill. But those who have arrived since \n     then will generally find themselves ineligible for Medicaid \n     coverage for five years.\n       No one knows how many eligible immigrants have been turned \n     away from care centers for the elderly, but health care \n     officials in New York said that dozens had been rejected in \n     the last month.\n       And administrators at public hospitals in Miami and Los \n     Angeles, who are also reporting their first cases, fear the \n     problem will balloon if the law is not clarified, stranding \n     immigrants in hospital beds needed by acute-care patients.\n       Already, legal immigrants too sickly to bathe and too \n     senile to recognize their children are beginning to languish \n     in hospitals. And families who can no longer care for ailing \n     relatives now find themselves overwhelmed with few options.\n       ``If this continues, what will we do with these people?'' \n     asked Carol Burger, an administrator at Elmhurst Hospital \n     Center in Queens as she searched for a place for an 83-year-\n     old legal immigrant from Romania, one of about 20 patients \n     rejected by nursing homes for lack of citizenship. ``Where \n     are they going to go?''\n       Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican of Florida \n     and the chief sponsor of the new welfare law, called the \n     situation ``worrisome'' and said he had never intended to \n     deny care to eligible immigrants.\n       By law, nursing homes may refuse patients who cannot pay \n     their bills. But Mr. Shaw said he doubted that elderly care \n     centers that receive Federal funds, in the form of Medicaid \n     payments, had the right to turn away legal immigrants who \n     were eligible for care. ``There's no question that it's \n     discrimination,'' he said in an interview.\n       Mr. Shaw said that care centers needed better guidance from \n     state and Federal health officials and that his Congressional \n     committee would provide it, if others did not. ``I can \n     understand their confusion,'' he said of the nursing homes. \n     ``But obviously, some elderly people have fallen through the \n     cracks.''\n       Paralyzed by a stroke that left empty spaces in her memory, \n     Raisa Kinker, a 74-year-old legal immigrant from Ukraine, \n     spent one month at Huntington Hospital on Long Island, \n     rejected by one nursing home after another, until a Brooklyn \n     rehabilitation center took her in.\n       Withered by the stomach cancer that has left him marooned \n     at Elmhurst Hospital Center for two months, Lois Bejarano, 74 \n     and a legal immigrant from Colombia, has been told not to \n     even hope for a nursing home bed, although he, too, will keep \n     his Medicaid coverage.\n       And more than 30 legal immigrants from China, many of them \n     too crippled to walk or brush their thinning hair, recently \n     found themselves stranded with families who could not care \n     for them when a Staten Island retirement home rejected their \n     pleas for placement this month.\n       ``These families come all the way from Chinatown and beg us \n     to take their elderly relatives, and I've got to look in \n     their eyes and tell them no,'' said Cindy Miner, the case \n     manager at the Staten Island home, the Anna Erika Home for \n     Adults and Assisted Living Programs, which caters to elderly \n     Asian patients.\n       ``We've taken these people into our country, and now when \n     they need help, we have to turn them away,'' she said. ``It's \n     a horrible feeling. We'd love to take everyone, but it's just \n     too much of a risk.''\n       The confusion over eligibility stems, in part, from the \n     Federal Government's distinction between ``qualified'' \n     immigrants, who will keep benefits, and ``nonqualified'' \n     immigrants, who will lose them.\n       In New York State, virtually all legal immigrants, those \n     who arrived before Aug. 22, are considered qualified. These \n     noncitizens, who include legal permanent residents, refugees \n     and seekers of political asylum, will keep Medicaid, which \n     covers nursing home costs. Even the estimated 87,000 legal \n     immigrants expected to lose Supplemental Security Income \n     benefits, the Federal cash payments accepted by retirement \n     homes, will receive state funds to cover their stay, state \n     health officials say.\n       The S.S.I. recipients' Medicaid status will be re-\n     evaluated, but state officials say the coverage will continue \n     unless the recipients are no longer poor or disabled.\n       Although the State Legislature has not formally passed the \n     welfare law that includes this provision, Democrats and \n     Republicans say there is no dispute over the issue.\n       ``They should not be turning away this group on the basis \n     that they will be losing Medicaid eligibility, because that \n     will not happen,'' said Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for \n     the State Department of Health.\n       But a group of about 16,000 immigrants, considered \n     ``present under color of law,'' who have been granted \n     temporary residency and receive Government services, are \n     expected to lose both Medicaid insurance and cash benefits \n     beginning in August.\n       And legal immigrants who arrived on or after Aug. 22 of \n     last year--a group that will increase over time--will be \n     ineligible for Medicaid.\n       State officials said they had tried to make the \n     distinctions clear. But health care administrators for the \n     elderly are still frantically seeking guidance, calling \n     politicians, reading trade newsletters and viewing Government \n     World Wide Web sites.\n       ``I'm getting calls from nursing homes and they're saying, \n     `I have a legal immigrant here. What do I do?' '' said Scott \n     Sandford, director of regulatory affairs for the New York \n     State Health Facilities Association, a trade group that \n     represents 290 nursing homes.\n       ``We have been telling our members, `You have to be really \n     careful about someone who is not a citizen.' '' Mr. Sandford \n     said. ``We assume that Governor Pataki's proposal is going to \n     pass, but we can guarantee nothing. It's a real risk.''\n       The perceived risk varies from institution to institution. \n     The Cabrini Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, a 240-bed \n     complex in Manhattan still accepts legal immigrants. Menorah \n     Home and Hospital for the Aged and Infirm, a 253-bed center \n     in Brooklyn, on the other hand, has turned several away.\n       ``Some homes are being extra careful,'' said James E. \n     Piazzola, the director of social work at the Los Angeles \n     County-University of Southern California Medical Center, \n     which saw its first legal immigrants rejected from nursing \n     homes six weeks ago. ``Rumors are flying everywhere.''\n       Plans to ease the new welfare law's impact have been \n     bandied about for weeks. President Clinton wants to restore \n     most benefits to elderly immigrants. Republicans in Congress \n     want to give some states money to help them manage the \n     transition. And Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City \n     has filed suit to keep the Federal cuts from going into \n     effect.\n       But while the proposals fly, hospital administrators say \n     some legal immigrants are already suffering. And they fear \n     that the situation will only get worse as the summer deadline \n     for cuts in benefits approaches.\n       ``As we get closer to August, more and more of the \n     facilities are going to refuse them,'' said Jill Lenney, the \n     administrator of social work at Jackson Memorial Hospital in \n     Miami. ``They're going to be occupying acute-care beds, and \n     patients who need those beds will be spending more time in \n     the emergency room.''\n       Without clear guidance, nursing homes and retirement homes \n     currently refusing legal immigrants have no reason to change \n     their new policies, advocates for nursing home patients say.\n       ``There are obviously people who need care, who are not \n     going to be able to get it,'' said Cynthia Rudder, the \n     director of the Nursing Home Community Coalition of New York \n     State, which advocates on behalf of nursing home residents. \n     ``They're in limbo until the state makes some \n     determination.''\n       In a tiny apartment in Brooklyn, a 75-year-old legal \n     immigrant from Ukraine lives in that limbo. Rejected from the \n     Sephardic Home for lack of citizenship, Villy Vaysman lies in \n     bed, unable to move, his body mostly deadened by Parkinson's \n     disease.\n       He is too heavy for his 76-year-old wife, Irina, to carry \n     to the bathtub. So every morning, she washes him bit by bit, \n     rolling him from one side to another, praying all the while \n     that some nursing home will take him in.\n       ``I don't have the strength to take care of a paralyzed \n     man,'' she said as she wept last week. ``I don't want to \n     think that they won't take him. I don't know what we'll do.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 22, 1997]\n\n  Suicide Shows Why Welfare Fight Persists--Immigrant's Death Raises \n                       Questions Over Cuts in Aid\n\n                           (By Dana Milbank)\n\n       Stockton, CA.--A few days before his 76th birthday last \n     month, Ignacio Munoz clambered down into a dried canal bed \n     beneath the railroad tracks here, put a .35 caliber Colt \n     revolver to his right temple, and pulled the trigger.\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\n       Three weeks earlier, the Mexican-born laborer, who came to \n     America half a century ago, received an ``Important Notice'' \n     from the government warning him that he might lose his $400 a \n     month of Supplemental Security Income. The reason: Mr. Munoz, \n     though a legal immigrant, wasn't a citizen--and therefore \n     stood to lose his benefits because of welfare overhaul. \n     ``They're going to cut me off,'' he told friends after \n     receiving the letter. ``If I had a gun right now, I would \n     kill myself.''\n\n\n                         funds may be restored\n\n       It's difficult to know what causes any suicide, or what \n     other demons might have haunted Mr. Munoz. But in the debate \n     over welfare policy, the laborer's story provides just the \n     sort of powerful anecdote that can affect the course of \n     events in Washington. Ronald Reagan's tales of welfare queens \n     in Cadillacs helped spark the drive that led the government \n     to revise the welfare system last year. And now tales of \n     hard-working immigrants like Mr. Munoz are leading \n     policymakers from both parties to question whether some of \n     those changes went too far.\n       Leaders of both parties now support restoring some of the \n     funding cut last year from benefits for legal immigrants, \n     although they disagree on how much. Republican legislators, \n     under pressure from GOP governors and worried about the \n     public relations problems that stories like Mr. Munoz's could \n     cause, have already proposed adding back $2 billion of \n     funding for immigrants over the next two years--mostly for \n     SSI and food stamps. President Clinton and the Democrats are \n     proposing adding back much more--more than $14 billion over \n     five years. If the White House and Republican leaders are \n     able to reach a budget agreement, it will probably include a \n     compromise on increased immigrant funding somewhere in \n     between.\n       In Mr. Munoz's case, the sad irony is that he need not have \n     lost his benefits. The law requires immigrants to either \n     become citizens or prove that they have worked 10 years or \n     more in the U.S. to keep their benefits. Mr. Munoz had worked \n     in this country since the late 1940s, and a welfare counselor \n     told him he could obtain an exemption if he could document \n     his employment history. That, however, would have required \n     his patrons to acknowledge that they had employed him against \n     the law, and Mr. Munoz considered it a matter of honor not to \n     betray his former bosses.\n       ``I'd rather die,'' he told his friend Salvador Aguierre. \n     Lupe Marquez, another friend, explains it this way: ``He \n     really loved the patron. He got in his mind that he'd have to \n     put the finger on his patron. That's why he died.''\n       Mr. Munoz, whose nickname was ``Nacho,'' was born in 1921 \n     on a ranch in Colotlan, in the Mexican state of Jalisco, the \n     son of a laborer. He came to the U.S., illegally at first and \n     alone, in the late 1940s. He lived in labor camps and cheap \n     hotels or with friends. He held a string of odd, seasonal \n     jobs--pruning pear trees in the winter, picking olives in the \n     fall, working in a tortilla factory, and doing landscaping \n     and office cleaning at a local radio station. Anselmo Ambriz, \n     who met Mr. Munoz in the fields in 1951, says his friend \n     worked until age 70, sometimes for 10 hours a day.\n       Whenever he worked, he was dogged by a fear that border \n     police would catch him. Indeed, he was once returned to \n     Mexico but snuck back in soon after. ``He thought he was a \n     criminal,'' says Frank Gonzales, whose family housed Mr. \n     Munoz at various times.\n       Mr. Munoz developed intense loyalty to his patrones, his \n     employers through the 1980s: Knox LaRue and Arnold Toso. Mr. \n     Munoz worked illegally for both men, but Mr. LaRue, under an \n     amnesty program passed by Congress in 1996, obtained a green \n     card and a legitimate Social Security number for him in the \n     late '80s. ``He was a very nervous little guy.'' Mr. LaRue \n     recalls of the 5-foot-7 Mr. Munoz, who had bushy gray brows \n     over sad, dark eyes. ``He'd been on the lam for 40 years, \n     looking over his shoulder.''\n\n\n                         considered citizenship\n\n       Mr. Munoz stopped working after 1992 and moved into the \n     Franco Center, a big, concrete building for the elderly poor, \n     where he took a noisy one-bedroom apartment overlooking a \n     freeway. He paid the $184 monthly rent with his Social \n     Security payment of $286 and his $400 of SSI. At some point, \n     he contemplated becoming a citizen; among the possessions in \n     his apartment is a wrinkled, 11-page list of study questions \n     for the exam.\n       Mr. Munoz never married and had no children. He spoke \n     little English and never visited the cantinas (tavern) with \n     his friends. He had cataract surgery in January, and walked \n     stiffly because of arthritic legs, but friends say he showed \n     no signs of depression.\n       The trouble, says Mary Serna, a neighbor, ``all started \n     with that letter he got.'' He showed the letter to his friend \n     Mr. Aguierre. ``I worked all my life, now they're cutting me \n     off,'' Mr. Aguierre recalls Mr. Munoz saying.\n       He paid a visit to a local advocacy group called Concilio, \n     where Susan Casillas offered to help him document his work \n     history. On Monday morning, March 17, he returned unannounced \n     to the Concilio office. Ms. Casillas asked him to return at 1 \n     p.m. Instead, he walked that afternoon down to the railroad \n     track, past a cement and lumber yard, through some weeds and \n     down into the dusty canal bed. He was found bloody but still \n     breathing just after 1 p.m., the time of his appointment at \n     Concilio.\n       Mr. Munoz was buried in a simple gray coffin in a plot for \n     the indigent in the county cemetery. The police found $717.40 \n     in the dead man's pocket--the $1,000 in savings he had \n     recently withdrawn from the Franco Center office, less the \n     price of the gun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3562-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO EVELYN MARCONI FOR BEING AWARDED THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT \n                                 AWARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Evelyn Marconi of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for being \nhonored with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Rotary Club of \nPortsmouth.\n  Evelyn has been my friend for more than a decade. I can think of no \none more deserving of the recognition she is receiving by the \nPortsmouth Rotary Club.\n  She has given her life to public and community service. Evelyn has \nserved on the Portsmouth City Council for 10 years, four of those years \nas assistant mayor. In 1989 she was nominated for the prestigious \nNorris Cotton Republican of The Year Award.\n  Evelyn has also been a cornerstone of business in Portsmouth and is \nknown to everyone as she owns and operates the landmark Geno's Coffee \nShop. In 1980 former U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey recognized Evelyn's \nbusiness leadership and appointed her as a delegate to the Small \nBusiness Conference where she participated in the Women in Business and \nCapital Formation and Retention. She also was a delegate to the New \nHampshire Constitutional Convention.\n  Evelyn's community involvements range from organizing fundraisers to \nkeeping the local Pierce Island Pool open for the children, to being a \nmember of several foundations, committees and executive boards and \nserving as the first woman president of the Navy League of the United \nStates.\n  Among her neighbors Evelyn is known as a compassionate and concerned \nperson who makes chicken soup for the sick, helps out with babysitting \nand works to secure anonymous donations of food or clothing for the \nunderprivileged. Evelyn has been known to go out in a blizzard to \ndeliver food to shut-ins when the city's ``meals on wheels'' was \ncanceled due to bad weather.\n  Evelyn is always willing to take responsibility, whether to organize \nrides to the cancer treatment center for local patients, giving rides \non election day to any voter, chairing committees or helping people in \nneed. Whatever she commits to, she always does an outstanding job.\n  Mr. President, Evelyn has dedicated her time, talent and energy to \nserving the residents of Portsmouth in an exemplary way. I am proud to \nknow Evelyn, and to honor her outstanding community commitment, which \nis so important to the future and prosperity of Portsmouth. We are \nindeed indebted to Evelyn for her efforts in business, public service \nand community dedication. Congratulations to my friend, Evelyn Marconi, \nfor this distinguished recognition.

Mr. President, no one did more to bring peace \nand prosperity in our time than our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. \nPresident Reagan's economic and foreign policies gave us the longest \npeacetime expansion in our history and made the world safe again for \ndemocracy. But more than that, Ronald Reagan called us to our highest \nand best: we never spoke with more certainty or sat taller in the \nsaddle than when Ronald Reagan was riding point.\n  In his farewell address, Reagan told a wonderful story, a story of a \nrefugee and an American sailor. In the early eighties, the U.S.S. \nMidway was patrolling the South China Sea when the crew happened upon a \nsmall craft, a decrepit little boat crammed with refugees trying to \nmake their way to America. The Midway's captain sent a small launch to \nbring the ship to safety. And as they made their way toward the tiny \nvessel, a refugee glimpsed a crewman on deck and called out, ``Hello, \nAmerican sailor. Hello freedom man.''\n  It was, as Reagan noted, ``a small moment with a big meaning.'' \nThroughout our history, America has\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nbeen a nation dedicated to a proposition, a country committed to \nfreedom--freedom of religion, of speech, of assembly, and of the press. \nThat undying devotion has allowed us to know both wealth and power, for \nthey are the natural fruit of the democratic ideal. From manufacturing \nto basic science, from aerospace to the arts, it is a material \nabundance and cultural vitality heretofore unseen.\n  And freedom is the song America has sung across the globe whether \nmarshaling her troops or providing resources for the Marshall plan. \nFive times in this century patriot's blood has been spilled in the \nfight for freedom around the world. That is our history, it is our \ncommon calling, it is our shared wisdom.\n  And so as we stand on the verge of a new century, with the greatest \ntechnological and material advances mankind has ever known, we would do \nwell to ask ourselves: how stands the cause of freedom? Not just in the \nWestern Hemisphere, but around the world. For while America is safer, \nstronger, more prosperous today than at any time in recent history, a \nsound like a bell tolls softly in the night; and it warns of coming \nconflict.\n  Mr. President, there is a destabilizing force in the Pacific rim \ntoday--and it is not the Asian democracies. There is an entity, which \nthrough its emerging economic and military might, intends to assert its \npower--and it is not the Asian democracies. There is a political system \nthat sees as its enemy the free people of the world--and it is not the \nAsian democracies. No, the expansionist force in Asia is Communist \nChina, a country that cares little for international law, and even less \nfor the sacred nature of human life.\n  Now, Americans have long known of the existence of evil in the human \nheart. And yet strangely, we are loathe to confess it. We are \nJefferson's children, unrequited romantics, believers in the innate \ngoodness of man. But experience is both the best and most expensive \nteacher. And it has taught us a costly lesson that I fear is being \nlost: ``Totalitarians do not stop--they must be stopped.''\n  Communist China is presently engaged in a military build-up that is \nas spectacular as it is unsettling. The weapon's bazaar open for \nbusiness in Beijing includes a blue water navy and a 21st century air \nforce that will give China the capacity to exercise power throughout \nthe Pacific. Russia alone has sold billions of dollars of military \ntechnology to the Chinese, including cruise missile(s) capable of \ndefeating the antimissile defenses of the United States Navy.\n  These force-projection technologies are not about provid[ing] for the \ncommon defense; they are about providing an uncommon capacity to \nproject power. They threaten not just the democracies of Asia, but the \nAmerican sailors of the 7th Fleet who in the name of peace call the \nwaters of the South China Sea home.\n  Just as troubling as Beijing's buying binge is its decision to sell \nmissile and nuclear technology to Pakistan, Syria, and Iran. Over time, \nthis equipment will allow each to produce bomb-grade uranium. Now, \nChina contends that the sales are nothing more than a mutually \nagreeable exchange between sovereign nations. But the dispatch of \ncruise missiles to Iran has placed United States forces in harm's way. \nFor let us recall that it was a lesser version of this same missile \nthat took the lives of 37 American sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark.\n  As if this were not enough, Communist China has undertaken another \ndrive: a campaign of persecution and repression aimed at crushing \ninternal dissent. Beijing's policies of torture, arbitrary arrest, and \nexecution in Tibet have made horror ordinary.\n  Today, the President has an opportunity to challenge state \npersecution and champion individual freedom by formally receiving the \nDalai Lama. Unfortunately, administration thinking on his visit seems \nas muddled as our China policy itself. Why is it that the President has \nan open door policy for Chinese arms dealers, but the Dalai Lama must \nbe slipped through the White House back door? We should embrace the \npeople of China who yearn to breathe free, not toast the tyrants who \nordered tanks into Tiananmen Square.\n  Or, consider the case of Bishop Su. Hung from the ceiling by his \nwrists, Su was battered time and again about the head until all but \nunconscious. He was then placed in a cell filled with water where he \nwas left for days, unable to sit or [to] sleep. Tragically, Su is but \none of untold hundreds that have been beaten and killed. Their high \ncrime? A fidelity to God and the desire to exercise that devotion.\n  And who will condemn such barbarism? The administration has made not \na sound. Well, I would respectively remind them that to sin by silence \nmakes cowards out of men; and an act of cowardice this great has not \nbeen seen since Hemingway's Macumber heard the lion's roar.\n  As for United States exporters, there is little denying trade with \nChina has been of great value. United States goods and services exports \nto China have increased from $3.5 billion to over $14 billion in the \nlast decade alone. From power generation equipment to automotive parts, \nChina has pursued Western consumer goods as a means by which to fuel \nits military expansion. The West has willingly obliged. But at what \ncost, and to what end?\n  Chinese import duties are still five times higher on average than \nthose imposed by the U.S. and quadruple those of Japan. Nearly half of \nChinese imports are subject to further barriers. And certain key \nindustries such as electronics, aircraft, and telecommunications are \nshielded from competition altogether. It would seem that 18th century \nmercantilism is alive and well in 20th century China.\n  Mr. President, China's trade policies are about selective market \naccess that ensure merchandise trade deficits as far as the eye can \nsee; on human rights, Beijing is showing the world a reign of terror \nunparalleled in the post-cold-war era; and a tour of the Pacific rim's \nhorizon finds a Chinese defense buildup aimed at achieving superpower \nstatus at the Asian democracies, expense.\n  So what, then, is to be done? Just a decade ago, the vast majority of \nthe Congress seemed to understand who our enemies were and why. But \nsome in Washington today seem confused about what is a decent political \nsystem and what is not, which philosophies should be embraced or \nrejected, what is right and what is wrong.\n  We will never tame the Chinese dragon--no more than we subdued the \nSoviet bear--with the policies of appeasement. The way to bring China \ninto the community of nations, as Michael Ledeen and others have \nargued, is to talk truthfully and forcefully about the evils found \nthere; challenge Beijing to grant more political and economic freedom \nto its people; and maintain a military superiority that makes the cost \nof conflict too high.\n  There is an old Chinese proverb which says, ``When you want to test \nthe depth of a stream, do not use both feet.'' To end diplomatic ties \nand cease trading with the most populous nation on Earth would be the \nmarch of folly. I do believe, however, that we must look anew at both \nthe granting of most favored nation [MFN] status as well as China's \nacceptance into the World Trade Organization [WTO].\n  For we are now approaching a critically important stage in United \nStates-Sino relations as a new generation of leadership leaps forward. \nThey must know that adventurism in Asia will meet a firm response. They \nmust know we will not sanction the injuries and usurpations that the \nChinese people have suffered at the hands of the state. They must know \nthat we will support and defend democracy.\n  The theme is freedom. And the fundamental principle upon which we \nshould base U.S. trade policy is this: Truly free trade can only exist \nbetween free peoples. And the Chinese who watched treachery take hold \nin Tiananmen are most certainly not free.\n  More than 300 years before the U.S.S. Midway patrolled the South \nChina Sea, there was a great Puritan migration to a land called \nAmerica. And on board a very different ship, the Arbella, John Winthrop \npreached a sermon entitled, ``A Modell of Christian Charity.'' In it, \nhe laid out his expectations for the new colony; he spoke that, ``every \nman might have need of other'' and of a world ``knit more nearly \ntogether by the bond of brotherly affection.''\n  Winthrop was an early freedom man and his, like Reagan's, was a \ntranscendent vision. The society he foresaw was a true commonwealth, a \ncommunity in which each person put the good\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\nof the whole ahead of private concern. It should not surprise us, then, \nthat Winthrop's words upon arriving in America were some of Reagan's \nmost frequently quoted: ``We shall be a city upon a hill, the eyes of \nall people are upon us.''\n  Well, the eyes of all people are upon us again. And the question they \nask? Will America continue to stand for freedom? Or, will she fall \ncaptive to policies born of confusion and conciliation. The answer we \nsend will tell much about how brightly our city still shines.\n  For we stand on the cusp of a new and exciting age. By all accounts, \nthis has been the American century. The ideals that light our city have \nfound comfort's warm embrace across the globe; democracy has triumphed; \nmarket capitalism reigns supreme. But alas, China's shadow looms large. \nAnd the decisions of today will determine whether America alone will \nshape the tomorrows in which we live. So let us resolve to once again \nhoist up the flag of freedom. Let us resolve to extol the virtues of \ndemocracy to all who will listen. And not because democracy is our form \nof government, but because democracy is the only peaceful form of \ngovernment. With the hope that one day the long tug of memory might \nlook favorably upon us as we look approvingly on the generations who \nanswered freedom's call in decades passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/23/senate-section/article/S3564-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 24, 1997\n\n  Mr. KYL.
