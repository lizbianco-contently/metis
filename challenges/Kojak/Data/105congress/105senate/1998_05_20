The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1415) to reform and restructure the processes by \n     which tobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and \n     distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \n     minors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Kennedy/Lautenberg amendment No. 2422 (to amendment No. \n     2420), to modify those provisions relating to revenues from \n     payments made by participating tobacco companies.\n       Ashcroft amendment No. 2427 (to amendment No. 2422), to \n     strike those provisions relating to consumer taxes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask the manager that I may have 6 minutes to speak.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2422\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, when the Congress first conceived of \ncomprehensive tobacco legislation, the primary goal was to deter youth \nsmoking--I will say that again--the primary goal was, and is, to deter \nyouth smoking.\n  We have now discovered, through millions of documents--the State of \nMinnesota has led the way; my State, Minnesota, has led the way--that \nthe industry has over the years intentionally marketed to our children, \nintentionally targeted our children. Our children, our sons and \ndaughters--their profits. Our children's lives for their money. This is \nan unacceptable trade-off.\n  Mr. President, do not take my words as a Senator from Minnesota as \nthe final words on this matter. Let us just look at the tobacco \ncompanies' own documents.\n  An R.J. Reynolds document penned in 1976:\n\n       Evidence is now available to indicate that 14-18 year old \n     group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. \n     RJR-(tobacco) must soon establish a successful new brand in \n     this market if our position in the industry is to be \n     maintained in the long term.\n\n  Philip Morris in 1981:\n\n       Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, \n     and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke \n     while still in their teens . . . The smoking patterns of \n     teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris.\n\n  The 1998 report, ``Taking Action to Reduce Tobacco Use,'' published \nby the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, \nconcluded--and I quote--\n\n       . . . the single most direct and reliable method for \n     reducing consumption is to increase the price of tobacco \n     products, thus encouraging the cessation and reducing the \n     level of initiation of tobacco use.\n\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\n\n  And, colleagues, we can look at tobacco to see what effect raising \nprices has.\n  Between 1979 and 1991, real prices in Canada increased from $2.09 to \n$5.42. And when that happened, the smoking usage among 15- to 19-year-\nolds fell from 42 percent to 16 percent. This is dramatic evidence; it \nis not a conjecture on my part. It is an important analysis.\n  Now, colleagues, the tobacco industry has blitzed the Senate on this \namendment. We have a second-degree amendment that doesn't want to do \nwith any raise in price. And what are they saying? They are saying that \nthis will bankrupt us. What are they saying? This will create a black \nmarket.\n  But, Mr. President, Jeffrey Harris, who is a leading and impartial \nexpert, talks about the tobacco industry making about $5 billion in \nprofits in the year 2003. It does not sound like they are going to go \nunder.\n  And we can look at other countries--the United Kingdom, Ireland, \nDenmark, and Finland--all of which have added on taxes to reduce usage, \nnone of which has had a problem with this black market which we are \nsupposed to be faced with.\n  Mr. President, let me just simply say again what my colleague Senator \nKennedy has said. The $1.10 tax that we now have, the $1.10 increase in \nthe price--Senator McCain deserves a tremendous amount of credit for \nhis leadership. But the fact of the matter is, if we had $1.10, we \ncould decrease youth smoking by about 34 percent; that would be $1.10. \nIf we went to $1.50, we could decrease youth smoking close to 56 \npercent.\n  I say to my colleagues, even if the evidence is somewhat ambiguous, \neven if there are other studies suggesting that this might not happen, \nat least to this extent, what side do we want to err on? Do we want to \nerr on the side of not jacking up the price and dramatically reducing \nthe demand, especially among teenagers and young people, and getting to \na 60 percent reduction? Or do we want to err on the side of not having \nthe price high enough, combined with other smoking cessation programs \nthat we need to put in effect, and continuing to see our children \naddicted, continuing to see our children take up smoking tobacco, and \ncontinuing to see our children die at an early age?\n  Mr. President, let me conclude. Price increases will not bankrupt the \nindustry. Price increases will not create a black market. What price \nincreases will do is save lives. Let me repeat that one more time, \nbecause quite often what the tobacco industry has done over the years--\nI think my State of Minnesota has proven this through the documents \nthat we have unearthed--is what they do is what they know how to do \nbest, which is they simply lie and distort the truth.\n  So let me be clear about what this amendment is about. Colleagues, \nthe price increase in the Kennedy amendment will not bankrupt the \nindustry. The price increase that the Kennedy amendment calls for, \n$1.50, will not create a black market. What this price increase will do \nis save lives. It is for the lives of all Americans, it is for the \nlives of young people that should not die a premature death, that I ask \nmy colleagues to support Senator Kennedy's amendment.\n\n  Yesterday, my colleague from Massachusetts pointed out that an \nadditional 40-percent increase will mean that 750,000 more children \nwill not start smoking--750,000 children that won't start smoking. This \nis about saving lives. This is, I think, perhaps the most important \npublic health amendment that we have, because if we want to \ndramatically decrease demand and stop smoking among teenagers, we have \nto get the price up there to lessen the demand. This amendment does \nthat. I ask all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Minnesota for his excellent presentation and his compelling \narguments and for the persuasiveness of his argument.\n  The fact of the matter is on this issue the American people are on \nour side. The question is going to be in the next hour and a half or 2 \nhours whether the Members of this body are going to be on the side of \nthe children of this Nation and on the side of the parents of this \nNation in taking the kind of important steps that are recommended \nvirtually by every public health official that has studied this issue \nover a long period of time. We have placed in the Record the various \nstudies and the various support material.\n  The fact of the matter is, although there is some progress that will \nbe made under the proposal that is before the Senate, what will happen \nif there is no change at all, if there is no change at all, is that we \nobviously will not see any reduction in youth smoking. With the \nproposal that is before the U.S. Senate now, we will see a 34-percent \nreduction in youth smoking as a result of the increase in the cost of \ncigarettes. With the $1.50 increase, a 56 reduction. The attorneys \ngeneral established as a goal a 60-percent reduction. The Commerce \nCommittee established as a goal a 60-percent reduction. Our particular \nproposal will go to 56 percent and with the kind of look-back \nprovisions we will obviously be able to achieve this goal. That is what \nthis issue is about.\n  We will have the opportunity, as the Senator from Minnesota has \nstated, to save 750,000 American children from smoking, and we will \nhave the opportunity to save some 250,000 to 300,000 lives of children. \nThis is the most important public health issue.\n  It is important for us to look at what is happening to the young \nchildren of this country over the period of the last 5 years. Look what \nhas happened since 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997. Over this period of time, we \nhave seen the absolute explosion in the utilization of cigarettes by \nyoung people in this country. The target of the tobacco industry, as \ndemonstrated by their own material, has been with the youth of this \ncountry, and particularly with the minorities of this Nation. All you \nhave to do is look at these statistics from 1991 through 1997. There is \nan 80-percent increase in black and non-Hispanic use of cigarettes, 80-\npercent increase. This is what is happening in the United States of \nAmerica. Among Hispanics, it has gone up some 34 percent over the \nperiod of these past 6 years. Among white, non-Hispanic young people in \nour country, some 28 percent. This is an average rise, since 1997, of \n32 percent--32-percent increase.\n\n  What all of that means in terms of addiction, what all of that means \nin terms of the dangers with substance abuse, this is a gateway drug. \nMembers of the Senate are talking about doing something about substance \nabuse. You have a chance to do it in an hour and a half by doing \nsomething about curtailing the use by our teenagers of these \ncigarettes. This is a national tragedy. We have an opportunity in an \nhour and a half to do something about it.\n  You can have the various questions whether it really makes much of a \ndifference if we move ahead with an increase in price or does it really \nmake very much difference in terms of the young people of this country. \nLet's take a look at what the record has been from 1980 to the present \ntime on the issues of price and the issues of teen smoking.\n  We can have study after study after study, but, Mr. President, for \nthose opposed to this amendment, I hope they would be able to refute \nwhat this chart demonstrates, and demonstrates very convincingly. Here \nwe have in the early 1980s and 1982, we have a sharp increase in the \ncosts, the real price of cigarettes, and a sharp decline, considerable \nsharp decline in teenagers smoking. This is what Philip Morris said \nabout that, and we are not talking about an academic study. We are not \ntalking about medical economists. We are not talking about Members of \nthe Congress and the Senate who just want to see an decrease in smoking \nbecause we somehow think there might be some reduction in teenagers \nsmoking.\n  This is what the industry said in the Philip Morris memo from 1987 \nthat was in the Minnesota trial: ``The 1982, 1983 round of price \nincreases prevented 500,000 from starting to smoke''--that is indicated \nin this line here--``500,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. This \nmeans 420,000 of the nonstarters would have been Philip Morris smokers. \nWe were hit hard. We don't need that to happen again.''\n  ``We don't need that to happen again.''\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\n  No wonder out in the waiting room, in the reception room, I can't get \nin there because of the tobacco lobbyists--high-priced tobacco \nlobbyists. They don't want this to happen again. And it can happen. It \ncan happen. It can happen in an hour and a half from now if the Members \nof this body are going to put the public health first in this debate on \nthe issue that we have at hand.\n  Here the chart shows the increase in the price and the reaction as a \nresult of the statistic--the reduction in teenage smoking--and the \ntobacco industry acknowledging the relationship. So we have, as we went \nthrough the period of the 1980s, the increase in the real price, and we \nsaw a rather significant increase in the real price going up during \nthis period of time, and we see the corresponding reduction in terms of \nthe teenage smoking. Until when? Until when? Until 1991. Then what \nhappened to the real price? The real price went down and the real price \nwent down on what they call Marlboro Friday, when the Nation's largest \ntobacco company, Philip Morris, fired the newest salvo which reversed \nthe decade-long use in smoking. They slashed 40 cents off the brand of \nMarlboros, the most popular brand among children. The strategy was \ndesigned to protect prices. If Philip Morris reduced prices by 50 \npercent in Massachusetts, and a month later, R.J. Reynolds--the second \nlargest tobacco company, which manufactures Camels--had a corresponding \nreduction.\n  So we have the major tobacco companies going down, the major price \ngoing down. Look on this chart what has happened in terms of youth \nsmoking, escalating, going up dramatically. Price decline, youth \nsmoking increases; price increase, youth smoking goes down. We have \nseen that continue over a long period of time.\n  We could say what happened in here over the period for the last year \nor two, we have seen little blips going up, 10 cents, to cover the \ncosts of various settlements they have had, an increase of 35 percent. \nIt would not really reflect on this chart.\n  Now what we have seen in here is $5 billion in tobacco industry \nadvertising, an explosion in advertising. It makes our case, Mr. \nPresident.\n  It makes our case for the proposal that we have at hand. Increase the \ncost and the price of cigarettes, do it in a significant time with a \nshock treatment of 3 years. The way that we saw it this time, it is \ngoing to have a dramatic impact on young people. Increase the \nantitobacco advertising, which is in this bill; develop the cessation \nprograms, which are in this bill; strengthen the look-back provisions, \nwhich are in this bill; do the kind of prohibition on advertising that \nis in this bill, and you have the combination of elements that will \nwork to bring a significant reduction in teenage smoking--a significant \nreduction in teenage smoking.\n  Mr. President, we must have learned from the past. We have a pathway \nhere that is outlined by the history of this industry, and the things \nthat have been effective--not just studies, not just testimony, not \njust surmise, but real facts, Mr. President. Over that long period of \ntime, we have the incontrovertible case that has been made here \nyesterday, last night, and this morning, again, that cannot be \nanswered. We will hear answers like, oh, well, we will develop a \nsmuggling industry; we can't do this because we don't know where the \nmoney is going to be expended; we can't do this because we will have \nthis or that kind of a problem.\n  There is an issue before the Senate: Can we do something with regard \nto seeing a significant, dramatic reduction in terms of teenage \nsmoking? The answer to that is, yes, by supporting our amendment that \nvirtually every public health official in this country supports--not \nonly Dr. Koop, not only Dr. Kessler, but the Cancer Society, the Lung \nSociety, and every public health group across the Nation, Republican \nand Democrat alike. That is the issue that we have. Now is the time to \nmake that judgment. We will have the opportunity to do that in a short \nperiod of time.\n  Mr. President, I see others who want to address the Senate. I yield \nat this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, although we haven't established an exact \ntime for the tabling motion, as I mentioned last night, we will try to \ndo them sometime around 11 o'clock. But I do want the proponents and \nopponents of these amendments to have ample time to discuss and debate. \nI think we are working on an informal agreement that we will go from \nside to side. I see the Senator from Missouri here. If it is agreeable, \nI would like for him to have recognition next. I will just comment \nbriefly, if I could.\n  If the Ashcroft amendment is agreed to, smokers won't be relieved of \nany price increase in this bill. Quite the contrary. If the amendment \nprevails, the States, at an enormous time and expense, will resume \ntheir suits, as we all know. There have been four settlements already, \nand 36 other States are in line. As we know from the other four States, \nthey will prevail. There were four suits, four settlements. Minnesota \nis receiving twice--double--what they would have received as a result \nof the June 20 agreement between the attorneys general in the industry.\n  So let's not have any mistake. This amendment won't eliminate an \nincrease in cigarette prices, because when the tobacco companies agree \nto pay the State of Minnesota a certain amount of money, they increase \nthe price for a pack of cigarettes in order to be able to make a \nsettlement. That is  how it computes. Make no mistake, its passage will \ndelay getting about the business at hand, and 3,000 kids a day will \nbegin to smoke and a thousand will die substantially earlier as a \nresult.\n\n  Mr. President, I will make more comments later. Have no doubt about \nthe effect of the Ashcroft amendment, which would be simply to delay \nprice increases and delay our ability to attack the issue of kids \nsmoking, because there will be added expenses passed on to the consumer \nas a result of these settlements. In case the Senator from Missouri \nmissed it, Minnesota and the tobacco companies just settled for double \nwhat had been in the original settlement. Those costs will be passed on \nto the person who purchases a pack of cigarettes. Economics work that \nway.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wanted to indicate to my friend from \nArizona that the Senator from Missouri indicates to me that he intends \nto speak for a relative period of time. It was agreeable to him as a \nresult of that to try to accommodate a couple of Members over here, \nunless they want to wait until afterwards. I am just trying to balance \nit. Could the Senator perhaps give us some indication of the length of \ntime, so we can try to pin this down?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I can't give a specific time. I would be \npleased to let a couple of your folks go ahead, and I will follow them \nif that would be the understanding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have to go back and forth.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. He is going to talk sooner or later. I am sorry he can't \ndetermine how much time he is going to talk.\n  Mr. KERRY. Fine, Mr. President. We will try to stick with that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5149-5", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A NEW GRANDCHILD FOR SENATOR LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

With that appropriate announcement, and the joy that it \nbrings, we will yield to the Senator from Missouri and take our licks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2427\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the tobacco \nbill. While\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\nI will begin my remarks discussing my pending amendment to strike all \nof the consumer taxes out of the bill, I also wish to address the large \nexpansion of Government in the pending legislation. I will discuss the \ninevitable black market that will result from the policies in this \nbill. I will also address the failure of this administration to focus \nits priorities and resources on teen drug use.\n  Mr. President, along with my colleagues, I am truly concerned about \nteen smoking. However, I do not believe that is the focus of this \nlegislation. Teen smoking is not the central thrust of what is \nhappening here.\n  This is a massive, massive tax increase on low-income Americans. \nInstead of helping children, it is very likely to end up hurting \nchildren and hurting families. I think it is important that we \ncarefully review the content of this legislation with that in mind. \nThirty-nine percent of high school students in Missouri reported \nsmoking during the past 30 days. This is a terrible statistic to have \nto cite. However, communities in the State are looking for ways to \nreduce smoking in my State and it is working. It is working without \ndestroying the capacity of low-income families to provide for their \nchildren. It is working without destroying the capacity of low-income \nfamilies to be independent. It is working without an $800, or $900, or \n$1,000, or $1,600 tax increase on those low-income families. Three \npacks a day for a family at $1.50 a pack takes you to about $1,600 a \nyear.\n  If we can find a way to reduce the impact of teen smoking without \ntaking $1,600 a year out of the budgets of these poor families, that \nwill be $1,600 a year that could be spent for education, $1,600 a year \nthese families will be able to retain and spend for better health care, \nor it will be $1,600 a year these families can spend for food and \nclothing.\n  For example, I come from a town called Springfield, MO. It is my \nhometown. My family moved there when I was a very young lad. In \nstepping up its enforcement of local ordinances prohibiting the sale of \ntobacco products to teens, they are enacting constitutional limitations \non advertising. Parents, teachers, and community leaders are working \ntogether to fight the problem. They think they can do it, if they work \ntogether. I believe they can do it. They can do it without ruining \nfinances and the opportunity that low-income families ought to have to \nprovide for themselves. The tobacco industry knows they can do it. As \none tobacco executive stated, they can't win fighting teen smoking \nrules on the State and local level. The tobacco industry knows there \nare going to be rules there, and they can be there, and there can be \neffective rules.\n  If this tobacco bill contained the solutions to the problems that are \nbeing enacted in communities today, I don't think I could be here to \nargue nearly as effectively that this bill is not focused on teen \nsmoking.\n  A lot of communities are making possession of tobacco products \nillegal for teens. This bill doesn't do that. This bill says it is all \nright for teens to have tobacco. This bill basically says it is all \nright for teens to smoke. This bill just says it is wrong to sell it to \nthem and it is wrong to advertise it. But it doesn't really do anything \nabout the possession of tobacco.\n  Although Congress has the authority, we do not make it illegal for \nminors to possess or use tobacco even where we control the local \nsituation. We make the laws. We are the city government in some \nrespects for the District of Columbia. It would be possible for us to \nsay, at least where we have authority on military bases, or the \nDistrict of Columbia, that we could have laws against teen smoking and \nagainst the possession of tobacco. But we don't have that in this bill. \nWe only have rules regarding the point of sale. Whether one store or \nanother can sell it, and whether or not they can be on top of the \ncounter or under the counter, or whether or not the brand name can be \nvisible, or things like that, even then we only make the retailers \nresponsible for the transaction. There is no disincentive for teenagers \nto try to possess and acquire and smoke cigarettes. There is not any in \nthis bill. This is designed as if teenagers are totally expected to be \nirresponsible. First of all, the decision is, they can't make good \ndecisions; and, second, we don't ask them to make any good decisions. \nWe don't even ask them to refrain from smoking in this bill.\n  We create a massive tax increase on 98 percent of smokers to try to \ndiscourage 2 percent of all retail sales. What do I mean by that? Two \npercent of all retail sales in smoking go to teenagers; 98 percent go \nto adults. So we are raising the taxes on 98 percent in order to try to \ncreate a disincentive for the 2 percent.\n  Unfortunately, I don't think we have done a very good job, because we \ndon't even seek to make illegal the possession on the part of the 2 \npercent. If, in fact, we don't want teenagers smoking, why do we fail \nto say something about their possession of tobacco? Why do we fail to \nsay anything about their smoking? It seems to me that we are missing \nthe boat in a significant way if we don't say something about the \nsmoking.\n  For a long time now, we have had a responsibility imposed on the \ntobacco companies, and appropriately so, to label cigarettes and to \ntell people the truth about cigarettes on the package. As a matter of \nfact, you can't even have a billboard about cigarettes without saying \non the billboard something that is true about cigarettes. There ought \nto be said something through this legislation. We need truth in \nlabeling on this legislation. There is a big truth-in-labeling problem \nhere.\n  This is an $868 billion--that is not million, that is billion--tax \nincrease. It creates Government programs; after-government programs \nfunding, sort of, directed for the next 25 years to take decisionmaking \naway from future Congresses of the United States, designed to lock \nthings in; creates a huge Government regulatory scheme the likes of \nwhich we have not seen since the Clinton proposal to nationalize the \nhealth care system.\n\n  Here you have a situation. You say you are against teen smoking. You \ndon't even bother to outlaw possession of teen tobacco for teens even \nin places like the District of Columbia where you have the authority to \ndo so. You do not do what lots of towns are doing around the United \nStates of America in an effective program. You raise $868 billion worth \nof taxes, mostly on poor people, on people who can ill afford to pay \nit. You raise taxes on 98 percent of the smokers, who are the adults, \nin an effort to try to curtail smoking on 2 percent of the smokers, the \nyoung people.\n  We create this huge Government regulatory scheme which will have the \nFederal Government virtually in every store, supermarket, or \nconvenience store telling them how to run their business. This designs \na system that will undoubtedly create a black market in tobacco sales, \na black market that will make Prohibition look like a very peaceful \ntime in our country's history. Cigarette smuggling will become very, \nvery lucrative. Some people think that smuggling doesn't exist in the \nUnited States now. There is a big problem in cigarette smuggling \ncurrently, but it is just the tip of the iceberg, which will become \napparent if we continue on this plan to impose $1.50 a pack in terms of \nthe cigarette tax on the working poor of America.\n  I happen to be a father of three children. I was delighted to hear \nthe good news of the Senator from New Jersey. I happen to have some \ngood news in my own family. These are the pictures of my grandson who \nwas born just 8 weeks ago. I didn't really plan this to be a part of \nany presentation. But the Senator from New Jersey should have pictures \nshortly.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Would the Senator like to give me a chance to show \nmine?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I yield, with the opportunity to regain the floor \nat the end of his display.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wish the Senator the same good fortune, I say to my \ncolleague. I thank him.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator.\n  But I don't want my children to smoke. I hope that they have never \nsmoked. I don't know that they have ever smoked. I hope my grandson \nnever smokes. However, what I want more for them is that we have a \nGovernment that serves the needs of the American people rather than a \nGovernment that serves its own needs. I suspect that this bill, \nunfortunately, is a bill which tends to address the needs of \nGovernment, the perceived needs of the bureaucracy, as much as it tends \nto do\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\nanything that is beneficial, and certainly the kinds of impacts on \nAmerican families in terms of increased taxes on these hard-working \nindividuals of low income would more than outweigh the benefit.\n  I have sought to amend this with a simple amendment. My amendment \nwould strip this legislation of the provisions which impose $755 \nbillion in new taxes on the American people. More precisely, my \namendment strikes the upfront payment in the bill and the consequential \noutcome of that which would result in that kind of commitment by the \nAmerican people of $755 billion.\n  Those who support this bill would like for the American people to \nbelieve that it is a tough tobacco bill. But what the American people \nare beginning to find out is that this bill, while it is tough, is \ngoing to be tough on the American people.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are Members who need \nan opportunity to speak. I would be happy to yield the floor on the \ncondition that I would be given the floor at the conclusion of this \ntime to speak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, what the American people are beginning \nto find out is that tobacco companies won't bear the cost of this \npayment.\n  I regret my inability to cooperate with other Members of the Senate, \nbut an objection has been heard. I will continue with my remarks, but I \nhope to be able to accommodate my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, what the American people are beginning to find out is \nthat tobacco companies won't bear the cost of the payments, that \nconsumers will. This bill requires that the consumers pay the price. A \nlot of people are distressed. A lot of people have come to the \nconclusion that big tobacco is not worthy of being favored. Frankly, \nthere are a lot of things in this bill that big tobacco favors.\n  As a matter of fact, they helped write this bill. It has gotten a \nlittle bit beyond their desire in terms of a number of the \nrequirements, but many of the components of this bill are there because \nbig tobacco put them there, things that would limit the liability of \ntobacco companies and the like. But this bill, in terms of its taxes, \nis big money. This bill requires that the taxes be passed on to \nconsumers in the form of higher prices.\n  There has been some discussion about whether these are really taxes \nor not, because they are not called taxes in the bill. That is another \naspect about the truth in labeling that ought to exist here. We have \nrequired it of tobacco companies. We ought to require it of the \nCongress. These are charges which are authorized. They are authorized \nin the bill. They are basically required in the bill. But they are \nrequired to be collected as part of the price of cigarettes, and then \nthe money is to be given to the Government. And the Government is to \nspend the money. But we refuse to call them taxes.\n  Now, whenever the price of something is increased with the \nrequirement that the money be given to the Government and that the \nCongress then decide how the money is spent, that looks an awful lot \nlike a tax. That is the definition of a tax. Our failure to call it a \ntax in the bill doesn't mean that it is not a tax. It just means that \nit is a tax that we will not admit is a tax.\n  They say if it walks like a duck and squawks like a duck, if it \nquacks like a duck and acts like a duck, it is probably a duck. Well, \nthis is a higher price that is charged for these cigarettes. It is \ncollected from the people. It gets transmitted to the Government and \nthe Government spends it on Government programs. Now, I think that \nwalks like a duck and squawks like a duck. I think it acts like a duck \nand quacks like a duck. I think it is a duck or it is a tax, if you \nwant to use that word.\n  And here is the provision from the bill itself. I guess it is section \n404--I need to be corrected on that--instead of section 405. Frankly, \nwe haven't had this bill in its final form long enough to examine it. \nThis is another one of these bills that comes to the floor of the \nSenate before the Congressional Budget Office has had a chance to score \nit, before anybody has a chance to read it. We throw it on the desk and \nwe say we are starting to debate it. Little wonder we have some of \nthese numbers wrong.\n  Section 404 says, ``Payments to be passed through to consumers.'' So \nall the big, heavy penalties in this bill, they are not to be borne by \nthe tobacco companies. These are to be borne by consumers. Consumers \nare going to pay for this. And, obviously, that is something. So that \nthe bill doesn't just allow tobacco companies to recoup their costs, it \nrequires that they not impair their profits, that they not otherwise \nfind ways to keep the consumers from paying this very massive tax, a \nregressive tax that hits the poor people of America the most. It \nrequires that these taxes be paid by consumers. The only way this bill \nis going to have a major dent in the way tobacco is consumed is that \nthe Federal Government gets paid big, big bucks.\n  As I indicated earlier, many local communities--State, city and \ncounty governments--are providing ways to reduce teen smoking. They \nwant to do it by outlawing the possession of tobacco by young people so \nthat smoking by young people would be considered illegal. This bill \ndoesn't do that. This bill taxes the 98 percent of the adult smokers at \nan incredibly high rate, along with the 2 percent of teen smokers, and \nreally impairs the ability of families to make ends meet. It actually \npenalizes the companies if they do not pass these costs on. So no \ncompany, no tobacco company is to pay any of this $755 billion that I \nam seeking to delete in this amendment. It is illegal, according to the \nbill, to have the tobacco companies pay any of this money. This money \nis to be paid by consumers.\n  Also, my amendment strikes the annual payments required by this \nlegislation. Again, this bill actually requires the tobacco industry to \npass along this cost to consumers. Remember, these are not the real \npenalties on tobacco companies. These are taxes levied on the users of \ntobacco products. Under this amendment, tobacco companies would still \npay hefty penalties if teenage smoking targets are not met.\n\n  So my amendment does not save the tobacco companies from paying \npenalties if the teenage smoking targets are not met. The incentives \nfor the tobacco companies to avoid teenage smoking are left in this \nbill, and there is a serious penalty in the bill that would require \nthat the payments be made by tobacco companies if we do not reduce teen \nsmoking. That is left alone. What I take out of the bill is the $755 \nbillion in taxes on consumers.\n  A lot of people wonder why, if the tobacco companies are the bad \nfolks, as the subject of this bill, that instead of taxing the tobacco \ncompanies, we are taxing consumers. Well, they ought to wonder about \nthat. Basically, what we do is we leave the requirement that teen \nsmoking be reduced, we leave the penalties if you do not reduce teen \nsmoking on the tobacco companies. But we stop the tax that will take \n$800, $1,000, $1,600 from three-pack-a-day families, $1,600 a year out \nof their budgets, out of their take-home budgets.\n  So our approach is not to say that the tobacco companies should not \nbe responsible for reducing teen smoking. Tobacco companies were \nresponsible for promoting it. This amendment does not say they are not \nresponsible for reducing it. This amendment says the tobacco companies \nwill be responsible for reducing it, and if these tobacco companies do \nnot get it reduced, they, as a matter of fact, are going to be in \nserious trouble. They are going to have to pay very significant \npenalties. But I do not believe we should say that the American people \nare the ones who should be penalized for the conduct of the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  Frankly, that is what this bill does. There is a lot of evidence in \nthis case, in this situation about tobacco companies and about their \nconscious desire to focus their advertising on teen smokers and \npotential teen smokers, and there is a big presumption that if people \ndidn't start when they were teens, they wouldn't start later. It might \nbe that those people would start later on. You know, you can't \nautomatically assume that if someone starts when he is 14, if you don't \nlet him start when he is 14, that he would not start later when he was \n18, 19 or 20. Everybody starts driving a car at the age of 16. That \ndoesn't mean, if you move the age up to 20, that nobody would start \ndriving a car later on.\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\n  There is a presumption in all this data that somehow if they didn't \nstart when they were younger, they wouldn't start later. These same \npeople who start young while it is legal now may start older when it is \nlegal later if we were to do something like this. I don't think that \npresumption follows.\n  But Americans already are burdened with taxes that are inordinately \nhigh. Americans today are working longer and harder than ever before to \npay their taxes. How many families are there with both parents in the \nworkplace, working day, working night, trying to make ends meet, trying \nto have food and clothing for their children? And they are already \npaying incredibly high taxes. We are now paying the highest taxes \noverall in the history of this country. And surprisingly enough--I \nsuppose that it is not all that great a surprise--we have got taxes to \nthe point where the Federal budget is in surplus. The Congressional \nBudget Office indicates that the surplus will be between $43 billion \nand $63 billion. I think that when we have a surplus, we ought to be \ndebating how we reduce taxes on people, how we make it easier for them \nand their families, how we somehow make it possible for them to meet \nthe needs of their families instead--not how to siphon more money out \nof the pockets of working Americans.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will yield for a question with the understanding that \nI do not lose my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator has a right to \nyield for a question without losing the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator makes a statement that if this fee was \nnot paid, it would enable the family to spend--I think the figure used \nwas $1,600 on food and clothing. The Senator said that earlier. And if \nthe addict is using the money to buy cigarettes, that certainly doesn't \nfree up any additional spending power unless the Senator sees another \nway to do it. I am not quite sure I understand where the Senator goes \nwith that.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am not quite sure I understand the question. Are you \nsaying that they will use the money to buy additional cigarettes? If \nyou want to restate the question, I will be happy to have you do so. I \ndo not want to lose the floor by having a restatement of the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not lose the floor by \nyielding for a question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator before said that $1,600 a year that the \nperson would pay in additional taxes would prevent them from having the \nability to spend it on food and clothing, et cetera.\n  But, eventually, over a period of time that would be a cost which \ndoes not exist altogether for a million teenagers, and they would, \ntherefore, be able to exchange the money not used to buy cigarettes, if \nthey were able to close out on the smoking addiction, to be used for \nother things; is that not true?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If the Senator is making the point that these people \nwill not be buying cigarettes and therefore would not be paying this \ntax, that is contrary to what this bill assumes. This bill assumes this \nincome. And in order to assume this income, you have to presuppose that \npeople will not stop buying cigarettes.\n  You cannot get $868 billion over the next 25 years if people stop \nbuying cigarettes. The first presumption of this bill--there are \nseveral presumptions--is that people are addicted. That is one of the \nevils we are supposed to be addressing. But after we presume they are \naddicted, we take advantage of the addiction by imposing a tax on the \naddicted. And then we spend the money we receive from the tax. If they \nare going to quit smoking because the price goes up, then we are not \ngoing to get the money. You can't have both the ``quit'' and the \n``money.'' If people quit smoking, they won't pay the tax, and we have \n$868 billion in this bill that we are presuming people are going to go \nahead and pay. That is the money I am talking about, the $868 billion \nthat is coming out of the budgets of families.\n  What is stunning to me is that 59.4 percent of this tax increase, \n59.4 percent of it comes from people who make less than $30,000 a year. \n60 percent of the $800 billion--about $500 billion--is coming out of \nthe pockets of people who make less than $30,000 a year. We take that \nout of their pockets. We can't spend it here if they don't send it \nhere. So this whole bill is predicated on them sending it here. And \nwhen they send it here and we spend it, that means they can't spend it.\n  What do we spend it on? We spend it on 17 new boards and commissions, \nor--I guess there is an amendment now which says these are no longer to \nbe identified as boards and commissions. So we have gone from the lack \nof accountability of boards and commissions, to the anonymity of \nstealth commissions and boards that will be tucked away in agencies. \nAll the spending will still take place, but it will be done without as \nmany labels.\n  We are talking about a massive tax increase of $868 billion. That is \nwhat is going to happen. That is what is projected. You don't get the \nmoney from the people at the same time they keep the money. This money \ncan only be in one place.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question without losing his \nright to the floor?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would.\n  Mr. HATCH. The $868 billion is one of the estimates, is it not----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. HATCH. Of Wall Street analysts who have thoroughly developed \ntobacco models, economic models, and have spent literally years \ndeveloping these models?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. They say that when you extrapolate out the $1.10 price of \nthe Commerce Committee bill--or the managers' amendment as I think we \nshould call it--the actual price tag could range as high as $868 \nbillion, because the $1.10 number is based solely on the manufacturers' \nlevel and does not count the wholesale or retail markups or any other \nfactors which could lead to price increases, such as state excise \ntaxes?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think this is more conservative. If you were to go \nbeyond the $1.50----\n  Mr. HATCH. I am saying the $1.50 would be even higher, wouldn't it? \nThat is what I am asking.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. That's exactly right.\n  Mr. HATCH. The $1.50 number is certain to be even higher?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. We have understated the burden here.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I also ask my friend another question? Those who are \narguing for a $1.50 price increase are saying there will be no black \nmarket, that there will be no smuggling any consequence. Is it not true \nthat after California raised its excise tax in 1988, today they are \nfinding that one out of five packs of cigarettes are contraband today. \nIs that not true?\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have to look at my own experience as Governor. We \neven had problems with smuggling from neighboring States that had low \ntobacco taxes. Contraband is already a big problem in tobacco.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just show you this chart in connection with my next \nquestion. It is one thing to talk about Norway, Denmark and the United \nKingdom as some have in this body. It is entirely another thing to talk \nabout the United States of America where most of the big tobacco \ncompanies actually reside and exist.\n  This chart shows U.S. cigarette imports from Canada, 1984 through \n1996. You notice it was relatively level here up until 1990, when \nCanada suddenly increased their excise taxes dramatically. Then, all of \na sudden we have imports from Canada going up dramatically. There were \nU.S. cigarette imports from Canada in 1984, imports which then went \nback into Canada and sold as contraband at a lower price. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I think we invite a disaster in \nterms of black marketing and in all kinds of legal violations. We are \ngoing to be introducing young people to illegal ways of transacting \nbusiness on the black market. We are going to be introducing young \npeople to segments of society they should not be associating with.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee with \nme, and I believe is fully aware of the hearings, where we discussed \nthe fact that four major law enforcement organizations representing \nhundreds of thousands of policemen in this country\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\nsaid that if we go to $1.10, which we believe could extrapolate as high \nas $800 billion, that we would have a dramatic increase in contraband \nwhich would spawn all sorts of violence?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is aware of these compelling arguments from \nlaw enforcement?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield on this point?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to pose a question related to what the Senator from \nUtah has said. The Canadian experience, as the Senator is probably \naware, is critically important because many economists and others who \nstudy this data claim that the numbers asserting a 10-percent increase \nin prices results in a 6-percent decrease in consumption are false. In \nfact, if these numbers really held true, we could increase prices by \n200 percent and eliminate all smoking in the country. Everyone knows \nthat is a nonsensical result.\n  Is the Senator aware that, when challenged on this point, the \nadministration has used the Canadian experience as proof of the success \nof raising taxes? When challenged on the assertion that there is clear \nand convincing evidence of a dramatic decline in smoking and teenage \nsmoking as a result of tax increases, administration spokesman and \nTreasury Department official, Jonathan Gruber pointed to the Canadian \nexperience. I would like to read from an editorial by Nick Brookes \nprinted in today's Washington Post. Mr. Brookes is talking about the \nCanadian experience and quotes the health minister of Canada. \nBasically, as the Senator from Utah pointed out, the Canadians had such \na disastrous experience with black markets and smuggling that it \nactually drove the effective cost to teenagers of cigarettes down, not \nup.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish my question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish my question and then the Senator from Utah \nwill have the opportunity to ask one.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We need to have the regular order here in the Senate. \nEverybody has a right to speak, but we ought to have a regular order, \nparliamentary routine here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor and he \nhas the right to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Texas for \na question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Returning to the point on which I would like to base the \nquestion. The administration assets that there will be a dramatic \nimpact on teenage smoking by raising tobacco taxes. The question about \nthe impact of higher taxes on teenage smoking was posed today in USA \nToday. When Americans were asked, ``Do you believe higher cigarette \ntaxes will reduce teen smoking?'' 70 percent said no and 29.9 percent \nsaid yes? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I was not aware of that, but I am happy to have the \nSenator point it out.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The point I want to make is this: The administration has \nused the Canadian experience as proof of the effectiveness of raising \ntaxes on teen smoking. Canada raised taxes dramatically on cigarettes \nand then later decided to cut taxes. Is the Senator aware that the \nHealth Minister in Canada, Diane Marleau, has said that the \nGovernment's decision to cut taxes in Canada would actually reduce \nconsumption among teenagers because it would ``end the smuggling trade \nand force children to rely on regular stores for cigarettes where they \nare forbidden to buy them until they turn 19?''\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that, and I think it is a very important \npoint.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator aware that in Illinois, Massachusetts, \nHawaii, and Nebraska teenage smoking has increased as cigarette taxes \nhave risen?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that, and I think it reinforces the point \nthat the Canadian Health Minister was making, that there are times when \nan increase in the price increases the interest of youngsters in \nsmoking.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator concerned that that we could get into a \nposition of having an active black market, as is true now in many \ncountries in northern Europe, in Canada, and in many of our own States \nwith high tobacco taxes? If we end up spawning a black market so that \ncigarettes are purchased by teenagers and by adults illegally, does the \nSenator share my concern that we could get into a situation where the \nblack marketing of cigarettes could become an entre to inducing people \nto take a step beyond cigarettes to drugs?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If cigarettes sold illegally become commonplace, it \nmight well be that people will have greater access to an array of \ncontraband items--``Here, you can either buy cigarettes from me, or you \ncan buy marijuana from me, or you can buy drugs from me.'' I am aware \nof that potential. I answer the question of the Senator from Texas by \nsaying I am not only aware of it, but I am deeply concerned about it \nbecause drugs are a serious threat. They, in many respects, are far \nmore serious than the threat of cigarettes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator aware that in a poll taken last week, \nAmerican families were asked what concerns they have about what their \nteenager is doing? Thirty-nine percent were concerned about illegal \ndrugs, 16 percent were concerned about joining a gang, 9 percent were \nconcerned about their teenager drinking alcohol, 7 percent were \nconcerned about their teenager having sex, 7 percent were concerned \nabout their teenager driving recklessly, and 3 percent were concerned \nabout smoking. So if we create a black market by increasing tobacco \ntaxes, we could easily be taking a step that converts an issue that \nconcerns 3 percent of American families into an issue that concerns 39 \npercent of American families, that is their teenager using illegal \ndrugs.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I think the American people have a \npretty clear understanding of what the most serious long-term threats \nare, and they rank those appropriately. I think it would be a tragedy \nif we were to, out of good intentions, do something which resulted in a \nblack market and promoted drug use and smoking on the part of teenagers \nrather than curtailing both of those.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will ask one final set of questions, and then I will \nyield the floor.\n  As the Senator said, 34 percent of the cost of this tax will be paid \nby families earning less than $15,000 a year, 13.1 percent will be paid \nby families earning between $15,000 and $22,000 a year, and 12 percent \nwill be paid by families earning between $22,000 and $30,000 a year.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that an individual making less than \n$10,000 a year would see a 41.2 percent increase in their Federal tax \nburden as a result of this tax increase. The newest numbers I have seen \nindicate that an individual who smokes could see their Federal tax \nburden rise by $356 as a result of this tax. A couple where both \nhusband and wife smoke would see their tax burden rise $712 a year as a \nresult of this tax.\n  Here is my question: Considering the concern the Senator from Utah \nhas about black markets, what will the price of a pack of cigarettes be \nunder this bill?\n  It is my understanding that today, depending on which State you live \nin, the price is roughly $2 a pack. The underlying bill has a $1.10 tax \nper pack increase, and a series of other provisions that will drive up \nthe cost, including, the look-back penalty, some estimate it could be \nas high as 44 cents per pack; the liability cost, 50 cents per pack; \nthe licensing fee, 14 cents per pack; and the decline in volume could \nbe as much as 48 cents per pack.\n  I do not know how to assess these numbers. I certainly do not claim \nto be an expert on them. Does the Senator have any idea, what the price \nof a pack of cigarettes will be under the McCain bill and how much a \npack of cigarettes will be if this new amendment, raising the cost \n$1.50 per pack, is adopted?\n  It is a critical question. If we know the cost will be $5 a pack, for \nexample, we can look at the experience of Europe where they have \nsimilar taxes. We could look at their black market structure, look at \nthe amount of illegal\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\ntransactions occurring, and begin to see what the impact of this will \nbe. But nowhere have I seen any bottom-line figure on what the price of \na pack of cigarettes will be as a result of the underlying bill and the \namendment that the Senator is trying to kill through his amendment.\n  Does the Senator have any data on that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There is some data on that. Some analysts have \npredicted that the price per pack would be much more than the $1.10 \nincrease by the time you work it through the system. They have \nestimated that the increase will be $2.78 a pack.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So that would mean roughly $4 a pack, depending on what \nState you are in?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the price these analysts have indicated is \n$4.68. You first tack on the $1.10 tax. Then you add all the other \ncosts in this bill that will most likely be passed on to consumers. \nThen the look-back penalties capped at $3 billion a year have to be \nadded. The liability of $8 billion a year capped has to be added. In \nthe analysis, it was assumed only 20 percent of this will have to be \npaid out every year. However, due to changes in the bill, and no doubt \non behalf of the trial lawyers, I think 100 percent of the $8 billion \nwill be paid out every year.\n  It is clear to me that you have a very serious price increase. And \nthe suggestion that it is $1.10 or $1.50 is very, very conservative. \nThe truth of the matter is it is likely to be 2 to 3 times that much.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator continue to yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I continue to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. No one knows exactly the impact of this tax increase. One \nof the things we need to know, in order to estimate the impact of the \nbill on things like a black market, is what would be the price of a \npack of cigarettes. I assume the Senator is aware that one-half of all \ncigarettes consumed in Great Britain are purchased on the black market. \nWhen you reach the threshold of promoting illegal activity, you end up \nnot getting the revenues and dramatically lowering the price of the \nproduct. By adopting this amendment we could actually lower the \neffective price to teenagers of tobacco products by creating a black \nmarket that would come from the increase in price.\n  Is the Senator concerned about that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am concerned about that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator continue to yield to me?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield to the Senator from Utah for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have a series of questions I want to ask. I did enjoy \nand appreciate the questions asked by the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, because he raised a lot of very important points that were \nbrought out in the Judiciary Committee's hearings.\n  Keep in mind, when the Treasury Department testified before the \nJudiciary Committee, I sent a letter to Secretary Rubin beforehand \nasking for the economic model they had used to justify their forecast. \nAll they brought was a five-line chart--no model, no backup \njustification, no real economic analysis.\n  We had three of the top Wall Street analysts come in and provide us \nwith very highly thought-through analysis showing that the price of \ncigarettes per pack could go up somewhere between $4.68, $4.78 and \n$5.00 or thereabouts. And that is on the basis of the Treasury's \nprojected $1.10 increase, not the $1.50 figure we are debating today.\n  Now, my friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, has made a passionate \nplea here for $1.50. That would mean at a minimum an additional 40 \ncents more on each pack of cigarettes, although it will probably be \nhigher. That is at the manufacturer's level. That does not count all \nthe extrapolated things the distinguished Senator from Missouri has \ntalked about.\n  Is that right?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Massachusetts has suggested that the bill \nincrease each pack of cigarettes by $1.50 instead of $1.10.\n  Of course, everybody knows that the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and I share a common goal of reducing youth smoking, as \nevidenced by the Hatch-Kennedy bill which was enacted last year. That \nbill added an excise tax to reduce youth smoking and to help with child \nhealth insurance.\n  But is the Senator aware that there is no proof that raising the \nprice by $1.50 per pack would reduce youth smoking by 60 percent as has \nbeen alleged? Are you aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There isn't any proof.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not any?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is a vast presumption, and it is a dangerous \npresumption.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware there is domestic and international \nevidence that such a price increase will worsen problems for law \nenforcement officers and lower-income taxpayers?\n  Now our colleague from Massachusetts showed a chart of Canadian \ncigarette prices and youth smoking over time. Let me point out that \nchart also demonstrates how youth smoking is not predicted by price.\n  Between 1979 and 1981, Canadian prices were static, but youth smoking \ndecreased by 10 percent. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to be aware of it.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right. Our colleague from Massachusetts also suggested \nwe can use the Canadian experience to predict American youth behavior. \nIf true, then American and Canadian youths smoke for the same reasons--\npeer pressure and status. Many experts agree that status smoking, like \n$150 tennis shoes, is far less price sensitive. Even a $1.50 price \nincrease will fail in head-to-head competition with ads like this in \nSports Illustrated for Camel. Here is an attractive model smoking a \ncigarette--``What you're looking for'' the advertisement says.\n  The fact of the matter is that many members of the scientific and \nmedical communities do not see as essential a price increase of up \n$1.50.\n  Is the Senator aware that after following 13,000 kids for 4 years, \nDr. Philip DeCicca of Cornell University, in a National Cancer \nInstitute funded study--a National Cancer Institute funded study, a \npublic health study, if you will--found ``Little evidence that taxes \nreduce smoking onset between 8th and 12th grade''? Are you aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Dr. DeCicca's analysis is even more compelling when you \nlook at our principal target, those kids who never smoked. He found \nthat the effect of price on the probability of starting to smoke by \ngrade 12 was essentially zero, zip, zero; that price did not influence \nthem. Children were going to use tobacco products anyway because of \npeer pressure and status. It had no effect.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware.\n  Mr. HATCH. This study is crucial because it is perhaps the only \nscientific study tracking the smoking behaviors of the same kids over a \nperiod of time. All other studies have relied on a cross-sectional \nanalysis of unlike communities.\n  Now, is the Senator aware that just a few days ago the Congressional \nResearch Service released its updated report, ``The Proposed Tobacco \nSettlement Effects on Prices, Smoking Behavior and Income \nDistribution,'' where they carefully reviewed the scientific literature \non the effects of price on youth usage?\n  Now, let me just quote from that report. And I want to ask the \nSenator if he is aware of this?\n  The findings in these studies cast doubt on the large participation \nelasticities that were initially assumed in formulating policies to \nreduce teen smoking.\n  Perhaps this is true because while 36.5 percent of youth have smoked \nin the past month, only 14.3 percent of youth smoked more than 10 \ncigarettes each day. Experts believe addicted persons are less \nresponsive to price.\n  Now, let us not fool ourselves. Kids are different from adults and \noften unpredictable.\n  Is the Senator aware of those facts?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I certainly am. And I think the nature of the \nquestioning of the Senator is very helpful in developing for us all an \nunderstanding of the real impact of price in terms of teen smoking. I \nwelcome his questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe the Senator will remember, if he will, that Dr.\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\nFrank Chaloupka, who testified before the Judiciary Committee, has \nwritten: ``Youth and young adults have been found to be less responsive \nto price than older groups.''\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I was grateful for his important \ncontribution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Our colleague from Massachusetts showed a chart entitled, \n``Cigarette Prices and Daily Cigarette Smoking Among Canadians Age 15 \nthrough 19'' which he suggested concludes the price increase caused all \nof the reduced youth smoking.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me bring to the Senator's attention, during that same \nperiod, U.S. youth smoking decreased by 40 percent. So much for that \nargument of the Senator from Massachusetts. Were you aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have one final concern about the chart displayed by our \ncolleague from Massachusetts on tobacco use and price. That chart ended \nin 1991. It did not include any data since then. I want to show you \nthis chart again.\n  This chart shows the growth of Canadian exports to the United States. \nYou will notice up until 1991 the growth was minimal, hardly at all. \nAnd then it moved suddenly up. The Judiciary Committee heard testimony \nthat most of these cigarettes were smuggled back into Canada. Now, \nsince smugglers do not seek IDs, I suspect youth were able to easily \nobtain bootleg cigarettes at an affordable price. Maybe this is why we \nhave not seen the smoking prevalence rates and prices beyond 1991; \nperhaps that is why the chart of the Senator from Massachusetts ended \nthere. But this is when they hiked up the excise tax in Canada. Look \nhow the imports from Canada to the United States went up. Of course, \nthey continued to just skyrocket because they were sending their \nexports to the United States and then the contraband was coming back.\n\n  Only when they had to voluntarily reduce their prices did their \nexports to the United States go down.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If the Senator is asking if that represents a black \nmarket for cigarettes in Canada, I think he is right. These were \nimported to the United States for smuggling back into Canada, and it \nrepresents that while the prices were high in Canada, there was a real \naggravated problem with a black market in Canada. As long as you sell \ncigarettes illegally, I think selling them to underage individuals is \nan easy next step.\n  Mr. HATCH. If you listen closely to the debate, you will hear some \nassert with mathematical certainty that we need to increase the tax on \ncigarettes by $1.10 a pack, or $1.50 a pack, or by $2 per pack to get \nthe maximum health impact in terms of youth participation rates.\n  We saw that yesterday in the arguments from the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from North Dakota, respectively.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish my questions to the person who has \naccess to the floor.\n  And we have heard more today along those lines.\n  Now, we will hear about the Surgeon Generals' reports, about the \nInstitute Of Medicine report, about the Chaloupka study. Is the Senator \naware of the widely-cited findings that for every 10 cents that the \nprice of tobacco goes up we can expect to see a 7-percent decrease in \nyouth smoking? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that citation and study. I don't believe \nit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me go further. I am sorry to take so much of the \nSenator's time, but I think it is important.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think this is important.\n  Mr. HATCH. Those figures sound impressive at first, but we need to \nstop and question how applicable such a study is for a complex \nadolescent social behavior and for the price increases we are debating \ntoday. Are there not limits to extrapolating this estimate into the \nprice range that we are talking about today?\n  Mr. KERRY. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator not have to ask a legitimate question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been asking questions one right after the other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor, and \nhe does have the right to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator permit a parliamentary question? Would \nthe Senator from Missouri yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri has yielded for a question, \nwhich is underway. As soon as the Senator from Utah is finished with \nhis question, I will be happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware--and I apologize to my colleagues. I \ndo want to get through this, because this is important. The \ndistinguished Senator has raised these issues. He deserves a lot of \ncredit.\n  And, secondly, I point out that the other side had a lot of time last \nnight and this morning to talk about their positions on this. The \nrecord should be made clear that many of their allegations are \nincorrect. I believe the evidence shows that they are incorrect. I \nthink the Senator's answers to my questions will help to show that \nthere is a dramatically different explanation for many of the charts \nwhich have been displayed here last night and this morning.\n  Let me ask some more questions. Is the Senator aware there must be \nsome limits to extrapolating this estimate into the price range we are \ntalking about, because if we just straight-lined this projection to a \n$1.50 increase, we would have to expect that literally all youth \nsmoking would cease? That would be news to those many countries with \ncigarette prices which are more than $1.50 higher than in the United \nStates.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I think it is a point well made.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the Senator if he is aware of this? First, I believe \nboth intuitively as a parent and grandparent many times over, and from \nexamining the data, that if we raise the price of a product like \ncigarettes, as a general matter, we can expect children to purchase \nless of it--at least that is the common economic thought. But having \nsaid that, and, after all, it is a simple matter of economics that \nother factors are held constant. As price goes up, we can expect \nquantity and demand to go down.\n  I want to take just a few minutes to look behind the actual data of \nsome of the frequently cited studies. Is the Senator aware that a fair \nreading of the literature suggests we are not dealing with some sort of \nsimple, timeless, immutable algorithm when we are dealing with the \nprice/elasticity issue?\n  Is the Senator aware of that? He has been making that case here this \nmorning.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the Senator, isn't it reasonable to question that a \ndifference between the $1.10 tax and the $1.50 will not necessarily \nmean 800,000 premature deaths?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the Senator is entirely correct; to assume that \nyou can just automatically make that kind of change really is poor \neconomics. It starts in the primer and stays there rather than finding \nout the way in which the real world would react.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware it is unclear if such an analysis is \nfocusing on tax receipts made to the Treasury or the actual at-the-\ncash-register price?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Price is undoubtedly a key factor. I hope I have reviewed \nsome of the key data, and I ask if the Senator does agree with me that \nwe should not overemphasize price alone and, so to speak, put all of \nour eggs into that one price basket?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is very wise to point that out. I have to say that \nthe studies which the Senator has cited I think make that a compelling \nconclusion. You have to ignore an overwhelming weight of scientific \nevidence to persist in the naive notion that there is a straight line \nin extrapolation of price increase and demand reduction among \nteenagers.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator agree, in my view we can be most \nsuccessful in meeting our public health goals by coming up with a \n``basket'' of antitobacco policies that would include price increases, \ncounteradvertising, public education, enhanced enforcement measures, \ncessation programs,\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\nand marketing and advertising restrictions that go way beyond what the \nConstitution would allow us to legislate?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the Senator's position in that respect.\n  I believe if this were truly an antismoking measure for teenagers and \nthat were its real intent, we would have things like making illegal the \npossession of tobacco in areas where the Federal Government has \njurisdiction.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator agree we should come up with a \ncomprehensive package of mutually reinforcing policies, that if we come \nup with a package at all, overreliance on price strategy could be \nmisplaced?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I agree our pricing strategy is potentially very \nseriously misplaced in this measure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that the Institute of Medicine of the \nNational Academy of Sciences issued a report calling on the nation to \ntake action to reduce tobacco use? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask the Senator if he is aware of just a few short \nexcerpts from one paragraph of the 36-page report. The focus is on the \nneed for the level of required price increases. ``Raising the prices of \ntobacco products is a proven way of reducing tobacco use in the short \nand medium terms. Price hikes encourage the cessation and thwart \ninitiation. Higher prices have the added benefit of reducing use among \npeople not yet addicted to nicotine, including young people whose level \nof tobacco consumption may be even more sensitive to price. The impact \nand simplicity of price hikes were the main reason for the 1994 IOM \nreport's first recommendation of a $2 per pack cigarette tax \nincrease.''\n  Now the paragraph notes that this recommendation is consistent with \nthe Koop-Kessler report and the National Cancer Policy Board, which it \nnotes calls for a $2 price increase before concluding with this \nfollowing sentence: ``Such a price increase should also have the \ndesired disproportionately greater impact on preventing the initiation \nof tobacco use among young people.''\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that particular statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask if the Senator agrees. In fairly categorical \nlanguage, a price hike in the $2 range is characterized as a ``proven \nway to cut youth smoking.'' In fact, it almost sounds like the $2 per \npack comes right out of a mathematical formula.\n  The more something costs, the less of it a kid can probably afford. \nIn an era of $150-a-pair Air Jordans, we must allow for the possibility \nthat what kids will do, particularly when social status is involved, \ncan be a tricky, sometimes counterintuitive behavior that can involve a \nlot more than just sheer price.\n  Does the Senator agree with me on that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I definitely agree with the Senator. I think that \nhabits by young people in the marketplace frequently do not reflect \ntraditional economic analysis.\n  Mr. HATCH. Having set out the 1998 IOM study, I compare its tone and \nask the Senator if he agrees with the April 1998 CBO report called \n``The Proposed Tobacco Settlement: Issue From a Federal Perspective?''\n  Now, this CBO paper examines the literature and paints a far murkier \npicture of the state of evidence than did the IOM study. For example, \nthe first sentence of this section, entitled ``Response of Youth'' \nstates--and I ask the Senator if he is aware of this quote--``In \ncontrast with the consistent responsiveness of adults to changes in \nprice, the evidence on how young people respond is highly variable?''\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. It seems to me that it actually \nconfronts, in a very direct way, those other studies that make serious \npresumptions that are unwarranted.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Congressional Budget Office report: Is the Senator \naware of the Congressional Budget Office report reviewing many of the \nsame studies relied upon in the earlier 1994 Institute of Medicine \nstudy, and in the 1994 Surgeon General's report entitled ``Preventing \nTobacco Use Among Young People''?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it. I think it is very valuable that they \nhave done so.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is very important to this debate, it seems to me.\n  Does the Senator agree with me?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is very important.\n  Mr. HATCH. It would seem to me that anybody who is intelligently \nwatching this debate would want to consider this. Is that right?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the information provided in the CBO is critical \nto an intelligent decision in this matter.\n  Mr. HATCH. The CBO catalogued a wide range of elasticity and reports, \n``Most findings are on the high side of the range.'' However, the \nCongressional Budget Office next cites two studies based on the \nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that found \nelasticities near zero. After summarizing the data for a series of \nstudies, the Congressional Budget Office discussed a Cornell study that \nemployed a longitudinal methodology as opposed to a cross-sectional \nanalysis undertaken by most studies.\n  It said in the Congressional Budget Office report, ``The \nparticipation elasticities that DeCicca and colleagues estimated for \neach followup were similar to those found in the cross sectional \nstudies. The Congressional Budget Office considered roughly 0.5 to \n0.70. However, they found that when children who were already smoking \nat the time of the first survey in the eighth grade were excluded from \nthe analysis, the effect of price on the probability of starting to \nsmoke by the 12th grade was essentially zero.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it.\n  Mr. HATCH. This study found, after excluding those already smoking in \neighth grade, that the effect of price on the probability of starting \nto smoke by the 12th grade was essentially zero.\n  The Congressional Budget Office made the following comment with \nrespect to this study: ``Findings should be troubling to those who look \nforward to a large increase in tobacco prices as a foolproof means of \nreducing rates of youth smoking. It is possible that existing studies \nshowing high price elasticity among teens and young adults which use \nsimilar State level adjusters may have inadequately controlled the \neffect of the community environment.''\n  Is the Senator aware of that quote?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is a very important quote. That certainly does not seem \nto echo the almost unequivocal of some other studies.\n  To be fair, the Congressional Budget Office concludes that most of \nthe evidence does, in fact, point to a relatively high price elasticity \nfor young adults but concludes this discussion with the cautionary note \nthat all the would-be social engineers, it seems to me, should take to \nheart. We have plenty of them around here. ``Most of the evidence \npoints to a relatively high total price elasticity of tobacco \nconsumption among teenagers. But those estimates could be exceedingly \noptimistic. How young people would respond to large changes in the \nprice of cigarettes remains, like many of their behaviors, uncertain.''\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that CBO conclusion. I think it provides \nus with a sound basis for questioning what others are assuming, and \nthey are assuming that, I think, at serious peril.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator also aware that, unlike the Institute of \nMedicine, the Congressional Budget Office reads the studies and \nconcludes that the data suggests a level of uncertainty on the price \nissue?\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's be honest here. There are many uncertainties here. \nWe are talking about tobacco price increases never before contemplated \nor experienced in our country. But as we listen to this debate, I think \nit would be wise for all of us to heed the words of caution by the \nCongressional Budget Office when we hear someone say that all the \npublic health experts agree that price is the single most effective way \nto cut youth consumption.\n  Does the Senator agree with me on that statement?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think is dangerous to say that all the health experts \nagree, or all statistics agree. I think the Congressional Budget Office \nstudy clearly indicates that there are other factors that are very \nserious that interrupt what would otherwise be economic assumptions and \nthe assumption of addiction itself is a way of saying that ordinary \neconomics don't apply.\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. If data were unequivocal on the price issue, as some have \nalready argued, or will argue, in this debate, how is it that the \nCongressional Budget Office--I ask the Senator this --felt compelled to \nso carefully qualify what some characterize as a near scientific \ncertitude?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My view is that they are self-compelled because they \nwere interested in writing a record which was seriously flawed. The \nCongressional Budget Office's responsibility is to provide us with the \ninformation on the basis of which we can make good decisions, and not \nseriously flawed information. I think that there is responsibility and \nan opportunity to improve our potential for good decisionmaking. That \nis why they would have to challenge those studies which, obviously, \nwould be misleading if not understood in the light of the Congressional \nBudget Office qualification.\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, of course, if you were tied down to particular \nnumbers in a budget table or in a bill financing table and neither \ncould justify these numbers so that precisely the preordained amount of \nrevenue comes into the U.S. Treasury, you might be inclined to overplay \nthe public health rationale beyond what is warranted from the actual \ndata. Does the Senator agree with me on that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I would. If the President of the United States, \nfor instance, needed a certain amount of money, you might be inclined \nto find statistics which would provide a basis for generating that \namount of money.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the distinguished Senator if he agrees with me that \nthe American people, see if he agrees with me that the American people \nare not exactly unfamiliar with the sometimes backwards, the end-\njustifies-the-means, cook-the-books nature of policymaking in \nWashington.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They are not.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right. Why do you think the polls are showing that by \na decisive 70 percent to 20 percent margin the public thinks the \nCongress is more interested in the revenue and spending side of this \ntobacco legislation than we are in the public health component?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Well, for a variety of reasons. I am sure our history \nis part of that, but part of the reason is that in this bill we are not \ndoing some of the things which could be done to curtail teenage \nsmoking. So it becomes apparent that we are doing things that are not \nnecessary and not doing things that are necessary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator remember back in the late 1980s when the \nAmerican people made us repeal the catastrophic health insurance \nlegislation, the same public considered and soundly rejected the Rube \nGoldberg-inspired, Ira Magaziner-designed Clinton health care reform \nproposal?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. We are all well aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would submit to you that this is the same public that we \ncan expect to watch us closely as we perform our magic on this \nparticular bill. Does the Senator agree with me with regard to youth \nsmoking?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the public is already watching. It is reflected \nin measurements of the public sentiment when they indicate they believe \non about a 70 percent to 30 percent basis that this is a tax and spend, \nbig Government measure rather than a real smoking cessation measure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just bring to the distinguished Senator's attention \nthat during that same period of smoking decline in Canada, U.S. youth \nsmoking decreased by 40 percent without a price increase. So much for \nthe reasons that price is the only reason for youth smoking decrease. \nIs the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have one final concern with the chart that was used by \nour distinguished friend from Massachusetts on Canadian tobacco use and \nprice. As I said, that chart ended in 1991. When you look from 1991 on, \nCanadian imports to our country went up dramatically. Most were \nsmuggled back into Canada and created a huge black market. Does the \nSenator remember, before the Judiciary Committee, we had the former \nmayor of Cornwall testify before our committee?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that testimony.\n  Mr. HATCH. And he talked about how the black market came in with all \nof the accompanying organized crime and criminal activity to the point \nwhere his life was threatened, his family's life was threatened, people \nwere shot at, and all kinds of other unsavory criminal practices began. \nDoes the Senator remember that testimony?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that testimony, and I thank the Senator \nfor bringing it again to our attention.\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, the Judiciary Committee--I am sure the Senator is \naware of this, too--heard testimony that most of these cigarettes, on \nthat peak, that were imported into the United States were smuggled back \ninto Canada.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They send them out the front door and bring them in the \nback door.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. They sent them out and brought them back. People are \nsaying there is not going to be any smuggling here, not going to be any \nblack market. They are ignoring hundreds of thousands of police people. \nThey are ignoring the facts that occurred in Canada, England, and \nalmost everywhere else.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They are ignoring the fact that there is a lot of \ncigarette smuggling in the United States today at current taxation \nlevels. To aggravate that with an additional $1.50 a pack would be to \nskyrocket the smuggling problem.\n  Mr. HATCH. Since smugglers do not seek identification or IDs, I \nsuspect youth were able to easily obtain bootleg cigarettes. Keep in \nmind Mexico's per pack price is 94 cents. Right?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Maybe we have never seen the smoking prevalence rates and \nprices beyond 1991 in the distinguished Senator's chart because smoking \nrates did not increase when the tax was decreased by the Canadian \ngovernment.\n  Now, despite emphatic and passionate pleas, the scientific evidence \non the effect of price is equivocal. Does the Senator agree with me on \nthat?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There is ambiguity as to whether or not price is a \nconclusive determinant for teenagers in their decision to begin to \nsmoke.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that today Barry Meier writes a very \ncompelling article in the New York Times. He says:\n\n       But with the Senate having begun debate on Monday on \n     tobacco legislation, many experts warn that such predictions \n     are little more than wild estimates that are raising what may \n     be unreasonable expectations for change in rates of youth \n     smoking.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that comment?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. Meier also quotes Mr. Richard Kluger, author of a book \non smoking and health, who has said this. I ask the Senator if he is \naware of it?\n\n       I think this whole business of trying to prevent kids from \n     smoking being the impetus behind legislation is great \n     politics, but it is nonsense in terms of anything you can put \n     number next to.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am, I am in possession of the article, and I am \ngrateful for the work of Mr. Meier.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 20, 1998]\n\n           Politics of Youth Smoking Fueled by Unproven Data\n\n\n            Legislation's Desired Effects Dress Up as Facts\n\n                            (By Barry Meier)\n\n       It is the mantra of the nation's opponents of smoking: \n     sweeping changes in the way cigarettes are marketed and sold \n     over the next decade would stop thousands of teenagers each \n     day from starting the habit and spare a million youngsters \n     from untimely deaths.\n       President Clinton recently warned, for example, that one \n     million people would die prematurely if Congress did not pass \n     tobacco legislation this year. And Senator John McCain, \n     Republican of Arizona and the author of a $516 billion \n     tobacco bill, has urged lawmakers to stop ``3,000 kids a day \n     from starting this life-threatening addiction.''\n       But with the Senate having begun debate on Monday on \n     tobacco legislation, many experts warn that such predictions \n     are little more than wild estimates that are raising what may \n     be unreasonable expectations for change in rates of youth \n     smoking.\n       After the $368.5 billion settlement proposal between \n     tobacco producers and state officials was reached last year, \n     for example, the American Cancer Society said a 60 percent\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\n     decrease in youth smoking in coming years could reduce early \n     deaths from diseases like lung cancer by a million. But while \n     many politicians say the legislation would most likely \n     produce a 60 percent drop in youth smoking, that figure \n     appears to have come from projections and targets.\n       Social issues often spark unfounded claims cloaked in the \n     reason of science. But the debate over smoking, politically \n     packaged around the emotional subject of the health of \n     children, is charged with hyperbole, some experts say. \n     Politicians and policy makers have tossed out dozens of \n     estimates about the impact of various strategies on youth \n     smoking, figures that turn out to be based on projections \n     rather than fact.\n       ``I think this whole business of trying to prevent kids \n     from smoking being the impetus behind legislation is great \n     politics,'' said Richard Kluger, the author of ``Ashes to \n     Ashes'' (Knopf, 1996), a history of the United States' battle \n     over smoking and health. ``But it is nonsense in terms of \n     anything that you can put numbers next to.''\n       Everyone in the tobacco debate agrees that reducing youth \n     smoking would have major benefits because nearly all long-\n     term smokers start as teen-agers. But few studies have \n     analyzed how steps like price increases and advertising bans \n     affect youth-smoking. And those have often produced \n     contradictory results.\n       Consider the issue of cigarette pricing. In recent \n     Congressional testimony, Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy \n     Treasury Secretary, cited studies saying that every 10 \n     percent increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes would \n     produce up to a 7 percent reduction in the number of children \n     who smoke. Those studies argue that such a drop would occur \n     because children are far more sensitive to price increases \n     than adults.\n       ``The best way to combat youth smoking is to raise the \n     price,'' Mr. Summers said.\n       But a recent study by researchers at Cornell University \n     came to a far different conclusion, including a finding that \n     the types of studies cited by Mr. Summers may be based on a \n     faulty assumption.\n       Donald Kenkel, an associate professor of policy analysis \n     and management at Cornell, said earlier studies tried to draw \n     national patterns by correlating youth smoking rates and \n     cigarette prices in various states at a given time.\n       But in the Cornell study, which looked at youth smoking \n     rates and cigarette prices over a period of years, \n     researchers found that price had little effect. For example, \n     the study found that states that increased tobacco taxes did \n     not have significantly fewer children who started smoking \n     compared with states that raised taxes at a slower rate or \n     not at all.\n       Mr. Kenkel added that he had no idea how the price increase \n     being considered by Congress--$1.10 per pack or more--would \n     affect smoking rates because the price of cigarettes, now \n     about $2 a pack, has never jumped so much. And he added that \n     there were so few studies on youth smoking rates and price \n     that any estimate was a guess.\n       ``It is very difficult to do good policy analysis when the \n     research basis is as thin and variable as this,'' Mr. Kenkel \n     said.\n       Jonathan Gruber, a Treasury Department official, said that \n     the Cornell study had its own methodological flaws and that \n     the earlier findings about prices supported the department's \n     position. He also pointed out that Canada doubled cigarette \n     prices from 1981 to 1991 and saw youth smoking rates fall by \n     half.\n       Under the tobacco legislation being considered in the \n     United States, cigarette prices would increase by about 50 \n     percent. And while advocates of the legislation say that the \n     increase would reduce youth smoking by 30 percent over the \n     next decade, they say that an additional 30 percent reduction \n     would come through companion measures like advertising \n     restrictions and more penalties for store owners who sold \n     cigarettes to under-age smokers and for youngsters who bought \n     them.\n       The claim that comprehensive tobacco legislation would \n     reduce youth smoking by 60 percent over the next decade is \n     perhaps that most frequently cited number by advocates of \n     such bills. But that figure first emerged last year in a \n     different context and quickly came under attack.\n       The American Cancer Society, soon after the settlement plan \n     was reached in June between the tobacco industry and 40 state \n     attorneys general, said that one goal of that agreement--a 60 \n     percent decline in youth smoking rates over the next decade--\n     would spare one million children from early deaths from \n     smoking related diseases. The plan, which recently collapsed, \n     would have raised cigarette prices by about 62 cents over a \n     decade and banned certain types of tobacco advertising and \n     promotional campaigns.\n       But some tobacco opponents soon found fault with the cancer \n     society's estimates. For one, those critics pointed out that \n     the 60 percent figure represented only a target, and that \n     penalties would be imposed on tobacco companies if it were \n     not reached. And the cancer society, they added, had not \n     performed any analysis of the June deal to determine whether \n     in youth smoking.\n       ``They basically made up the number and I think it was \n     totally irresponsible of them,'' said Dr. Stanton Glantz, a \n     professor of medicine at the University of California at San \n     Francisco. ``It is like assuming that by snapping our fingers \n     we could make breast cancer go away.''\n       In a letter to Dr. Glantz, Dr. Michael Thun, the cancer \n     society's vice president for epidemiology and surveillance \n     research, acknowledged that the group's statement was based \n     on an ``if-then'' projection, rather than an analysis of \n     whether the proposal's programs would accomplish that goal.\n       ``The way the number was derived has nothing to do with \n     what will effectively get us there,'' Dr. Thun said in a \n     recent interview.\n       The new 60 percent estimate is based on a different \n     formulation. But it, like the cancer society statistic, also \n     coincides with a target for reducing youth smoking that would \n     result in industry penalties if not reached. And along with \n     questioning the impact of price on reaching such a goal, \n     experts are at odds over whether advertising bans and sales \n     restrictions would produce the projected 30 percent drop in \n     youth smoking.\n       In California, for example, youth smoking began to decline \n     in the early 1990's soon after the state began one of the \n     most aggressive anti-smoking campaigns in the country. But it \n     has begun to rise again in recent years.\n       Dr. John Pierce, a professor of cancer prevention at the \n     University of California at San Diego, said he thought that \n     reversal might reflect the ability of cigarette makers to \n     alter their promotional strategies to keep tobacco attractive \n     to teen-agers even as regulators try to block them.\n       For their part, cigarette makers, whose internal documents \n     suggest a significant impact on youth smoking from price \n     increases, appear happy to play both sides of the statistical \n     fence. Last year, they estimated that the price increase in \n     the June plan would cause sales to drop by nearly 43 percent \n     among all smokers over a decade. But now that Congress is \n     considering raising prices by twice that much, producers have \n     turned around and said that higher prices would undermine, \n     rather than help, efforts to reduce youth smoking.\n       Steven Duchesne, an industry spokesman, said tobacco \n     companies thought that high cigarette prices would encourage \n     those in the black market to target teen-agers.\n       ``Smugglers would sell cigarettes out of the back of trucks \n     without checking ID's,'' Mr. Duchesne said.\n       Experts agree that unless significant changes are made in \n     areas like price and advertising, youth smoking rates will \n     not decline. But unlike politicians, many of them are \n     unwilling to make predictions. Instead, they say that the \n     passage of tobacco legislation would guarantee only one \n     thing: the start of a vast social experiment whose outcome is \n     by no means clear.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to forward the article to the desk and ask \nfor its inclusion in the Record.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask the Senator, if he will, using another chart, \nour colleague argued last night that the 1993 American price decrease \nled to more youth smoking. I would call my colleague's attention to the \nfact that in at least 1 year both price and youth smoking decreased. \nLater, there was a dramatic increase in youth smoking without a \nproportional price increase. These facts provide further evidence that \nprice is not the only determinant of smoking behavior as some would \nlead us to believe. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it, and I am convinced that price is not \nthe only determinant.\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, tobacco analyst Martin Feldman, who actually did the \neconomics on this based upon an extensive model, unlike the Treasury \nDepartment, who was willing to testify and face cross-examination \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee, and I believe the Senator is aware of this, that between \n1986 and 1996, the real price of cigarettes in the United Kingdom, rose \nby 26 percent and national cigarette consumption fell 17 percent.\n  Is the Senator aware that youth smoking did not decrease during that \nsame time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think that data is very instructive. It tells us \nsomething about the fact that the youth culture is not always \npredictable in terms of traditional economics, that the price may not \nbe the determinant of whether individuals begin smoking as young \npeople.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that actually the British Office for \nNational Statistics reported that the percentage of smokers amongst \nthose 11 to 16 increased by 8 percent despite the healthy price \nincrease?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased that you would bring that to my awareness.\n  Mr. HATCH. Our colleague from Massachusetts, for whom I have the \ngreatest respect, would lead us to believe that all public health \nexperts advocate a $1.50 price increase to reduce teen smoking. There \nhas never been a U.S. price increase of this magnitude.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the fact that this would be a totally \nunique circumstance never before----\n  Mr. HATCH. Keep in mid it is a lot more than just a $1.50. That is \njust the\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\nmanufacturer's price. You go on up from there?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It would probably be something in the neighborhood of \ncloser to over $3 in terms of the increase in the price of cigarettes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware of the approach that I have been \ntrying to take toward this, that we believe it should be a payment \nschedule. There would still be excise taxes. We think it should be a \npayment schedule that the tobacco companies meet regardless of how \ntheir profits go, up or down. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the Senator's position in that regard.\n  Mr. HATCH. So the payment would not be affected by whether the excise \ntaxes go up or down. The payments would have to be made over a number \nof years, all $428 billion of them, which is $60 billion more than in \nthe settlement. Is the Senator aware of this, $60 billion more than the \nattorneys general, Castano group, et cetera, and tobacco companies' \nagreement back on June 20, 1997? Is the Senator aware of it?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the Senator's intention in that respect.\n  Mr. HATCH. So it is a stiff increase in penalty, but at least it is \nat a level where perhaps we can get the companies to come back on board \nand at least voluntarily agree to the advertising protocols, consent \nprotocols, and voluntarily agree to the look-back provisions and make \nthem, thus, constitutional.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I understand the Senator's position.\n  Mr. HATCH. You understand my position on that?\n  In 1996--is the Senator aware in 1996 Secretary Shalala estimated \nthat the 1996 FDA rule would reduce smoking by 50 percent over 7 years? \nGuess what? There was no price increase in that regulation.\n\n       Secretary Shalala used the word ``historic''--this is the \n     most important public health initiative in a generation. It \n     ranks with everything from polio to penicillin. I mean, this \n     is huge in terms of its impact. Out goal is very \n     straightforward; to reduce the amount of teenage smoking in \n     the United States by half over the next 7 years.\n\n  Are you aware of that statement by our Secretary, our esteemed \nSecretary?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, there was no price increase in that recognition. \nHow, we are being led to believe that price is the answer. It goes \nfurther. David Kesler said this:\n\n       Don't let the simplicity of these proposals fool you. If \n     all elements of the antismoking package come into play \n     together, change could be felt within a single generation, \n     and we could see nicotine addiction go the way of small pox \n     and polio.\n\n  Are you aware of that statement by the former----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the statement of Dr. Kessler.\n  Mr. HATCH. Former head of the FDA? Here is one by President Clinton:\n\n       That's why a year ago I worked with the FDA, and we \n     launched this nationwide effort to protect our children from \n     the dangers of tobacco by reducing access to tobacco \n     products, by preventing companies from advertising to our \n     children. The purpose of the FDA rule was to reduce youth \n     smoking by 50 percent within 7 years.\n\n  That was President Clinton's statement. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Indeed it was.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the point I am making here is no matter what we do \nhere will be a price increase. The question is, How far can you \nincrease it without it being counterproductive and producing an \noverwhelming black market in contraband all over our country. Is the \nSenator as concerned about that as I am?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am deeply concerned about the creation of a black \nmarket which not only destabilizes any of the intentions of this bill, \nbut probably would make cigarettes far more available to young people \nthan they are in society today.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the Senator's comments. These quotes by Donna \nShalala, by David Kessler, by the President of the United States, with \nregard to the FDA regulation supposedly going to reduce teen smoking by \n50 percent over 7 years--guess what, there was no price increase in \nthat regulation. Now we are led to believe that price increases are the \nsole answer--at least by the arguments made by the other side on this \nissue.\n  Is the Senator aware--let me just examine another factor and see if \nhe is aware of that. We are being told the Senate's inaction on a $1.50 \nprice increase over the next 3 years will culminate in children dying. \nIs the Senator aware of that argument.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that argument.\n  Mr. HATCH. It seems to have been made here regularly. If that is the \ncase, why, then, did the President of the United States advocate for a \nprice increase of up to $1.50 over 10 years? What does our colleague \nfrom Massachusetts know that the President didn't know?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am not in a position to answer that question. I think \nthe question is a very good question, but it would have to be addressed \nto the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this, and ask this question. You know, the \nvery people who are arguing for this $1.50 increase, it seems to me, \nare the very people who are pricing this bill right out of the \nmarketplace so we cannot get a constitutionally sound bill. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe that they have increased this, the cost of \nthis bill, by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have had witnesses from the left and the right, \nconstitutional experts, come before our committee and say that, \nbasically, without a voluntary consent protocol or a voluntary consent \ndecree with the companies on board, that literally--literally, you \ncould not have the advertising restrictions.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is pretty clear that the infringement of the \nfirst amendment that has been applied by the highest courts to \ncommercial speech as well as speech by ordinary citizens would be \nsubstantial were it not to have the complicity of those affected.\n  Mr. HATCH. Was not the Senator there in those Judiciary Committee \nhearings when these experts on constitutional law from the left to the \nright said this bill would not be constitutional, would be highly \nsuspect.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Unconstitutional both on the advertising restrictions, \nwhich of course that is what the FDA regulations call for, and on the \nlook-back provisions? Just to mention two.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am very well aware of the serious constitutional \nproblems of this proposed measure, which would be intensified, absent \nthe agreement of the companies themselves.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator remember Floyd Abrams, leading first \namendment expert in this country, in my opinion and I think in the \nopinion of most people, from the left to the right, in his statement:\n\n       Any legislation of Congress which would purport to do by \n     law what the proposed settlement would do by agreement, in \n     terms restricting constitutionally protected commercial \n     speech, is, in my estimation, destined to be held \n     unconstitutional? It is unlikely that at the end of the \n     day the FDA's proposed regulations could survive first \n     amendment scrutiny.\n\n  Does the Senator remember that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that statement before the committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that the American Civil Liberties \nUnion, speaking to the Senate Judiciary Committee, February 20, 1998, \nhad this to say:\n\n       Both the legislation and proposed regulation by the Food \n     and Drug Administration are wholly unprecedented and, if \n     enacted, will most likely fail to withstand constitutional \n     challenges.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that Judge Robert Bork said on \nJanuary 16, 1996:\n\n       The recent proposal of the FDA to restrict severely the \n     first amendment rights of American companies and individuals \n     who in one way or another have any connection with tobacco \n     products is patently unconstitutional under the Supreme \n     Court's current doctrine concerning commercial speech, as \n     well as under the original understanding of the first \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. That is why I mentioned the \ncommercial speech reservations that I had earlier.\n  Mr. HATCH. Isn't it a wonderful thing that the commerce bill, or \nshould I say the managers' amendment, has done that which nobody else \nhas ever been able to do in the history of this country; that is, bring \ntogether the ACLU and Robert Bork on this issue.\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That, indeed, is an amazing feat.\n  Mr. HATCH. It really is. But we also had testimony from Larry Tribe, \non the left, who also basically said this would be very \nconstitutionally suspect. Now, to make a long story short, the very \npeople who are arguing--I will ask the Senator this. Aren't the very \npeople who are arguing for this $1.50 increase the people who have \nbasically blown the tobacco companies out of the equation so that you \ncannot get the voluntary consent decrees to make these matters \nconstitutional so that this will work, not just from a price increase \nstandpoint but from an advertising restrictions standpoint, and from a \nlook-back provision standpoint?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is pretty clear they have boosted, or seek \nto boost the kind of financial impact to a very serious--hundreds of \nbillions of dollars--extent.\n  My objection is that this is all passed on to low-income people, \nconsumers. Obviously there are other impacts as well. Obviously it \naffects the ability of companies to participate in this kind of \nsettlement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware of, similarly, last week we heard \ntestimony on this issue. I asked Professor Burt Neuborne of the NYU law \nschool specifically if he thought the FDA rules could pass \nconstitutional muster. I have to say, he was one of the most impressive \nconstitutional experts I have had in my 22 years of listening to \nconstitutional law from experts on the Judiciary Committee. In asking \nhim a question, I pointed out that earlier in the hearing that Mr. \nDavid Ogden, counsel to the Attorney General, testified that the FDA \nrules were narrowly tailored and could satisfy the leading cases in the \narea of commercial free speech, the Supreme Court's decision in 44 \nLiquormart, and the Scenic Hudson cases.\n  So I asked Professor Neuborne whether the FDA rules were narrowly \ntailored, as required by current Supreme Court doctrine. I want to see \nif the Senator remembers what he said.\n  He said:\n\n       I could start by semantics. Mr. Ogden of the Justice \n     Department used the word ``appropriately tailored.'' He is \n     too good a lawyer to use the words ``narrowly tailored'' \n     because the FDA rules are not narrowly tailored. The FDA \n     rules take the position that all color, all figures, all \n     human beings are inherently attractive to children in a way \n     that causes them to smoke.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I think it is a profound insight \nand it absolutely represents good legal analysis.\n  Mr. HATCH. He went on to say:\n\n       But its not a narrowly tailored response to say that all \n     use of color, all use of human figures, all use of imagery is \n     banned so that adults can't see them either, and I don't \n     think that could be reasonably defended.\n\n  Do you remember that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that statement and I happen to agree that \nthere is a very serious constitutional problem with this kind of \nlimitation, even of commercial speech.\n  Mr. HATCH. He is not alone. I venture to say that any constitutional \nexpert who tries to contradict what these gentlemen have said is going \nto be in severe jeopardy of losing his or her reputation.\n  Is the Senator aware that this whole push to raise the cost, to pile \non, that basically knocks the tobacco companies out of the equation, to \npile on--which is what is happening in this bill and what certainly \nwould be extended by the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts--that that basically knocks the tobacco companies out?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am not in a position to say whether or not what the \ntobacco companies could do.\n  Mr. HATCH. They have said----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They have indicated clearly that the additions and the \naggravations and the different kinds of changes that have been made \nhave made it impossible for them to continue in their support of the \nmeasure.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no doubt in my mind that they are not going to \ncontinue unless we get this into some reasonable posture. Is the \nSenator aware that many people lost their breath when they first heard \nof $368.5 billion as the settlement figure given last June 20 by the \nattorneys general, the Castano group and the tobacco companies? They \nwere astounded. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it, and if the people lost their breath \nthinking this was to be paid by the tobacco companies, they will really \nlose their breath when they understand these costs are mandated by the \nstatute to be passed on to consumers.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator is aware, is he not, that there has to \nbe a way to pay for the program? If you don't have the voluntary \nconsent of the companies, albeit kicking and screaming, then how do you \nmake the bill constitutional in the end? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the Senator's position.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware of another position this Senator has, \nand I think many others as well, and that is that if this bill passes \nin its current form and is not constitutional, that there will be at \nleast 10 years of effective litigation by the tobacco companies who are \nnot going to allow them to climb all over them, especially when they \nknow these provisions are unconstitutional? Is the Senator aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that, and during that period of time, the \npoor people, the working-class people of the United States are going to \nhave a very, very serious tax increase as a result of this kind of \ngreed expressed here.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that we have 3,000 kids beginning \nsmoking every day and 1,000 will die a premature death?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware that 3,000 children try smoking every day. I \nam also aware there are about 8,000 children, according to General \nMcCaffrey, who try drugs every day. I am concerned we do not have a so-\ncalled solution here that really shoves people even more into the drug \ncategory.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that if a young teenager smokes, \nthere is an 8 times propensity to graduate to marijuana, and if that \nteenager then graduates to marijuana, there is a greater propensity to \ngraduate to harder drugs?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of linkages that have been drawn between \nmarijuana smoking and hard drugs.\n  Mr. HATCH. So if this price increases that we are talking about here, \nway above the $368.5 billion, do not bring the tobacco companies on \nboard--and the tobacco companies say they are not going to come on \nboard--then, basically, we are going to have 10 years of constitutional \nlitigation where approximately 1 million children a year will start a \nhabit later leading to their premature death because we failed to act \nproperly in this matter. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the fact that the absence of the tobacco \ncompanies in any final resolution would result in very serious \nlitigation which would involve serious delays.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that I have fought the tobacco \nindustry my whole Senate career, and I take second place to nobody as \nfar as trying to get this matter under control?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Indeed, I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that on one occasion, I was accused--\nI won't say by whom--of being a pawn for the tobacco companies, because \nI want to see this thing work and get it done?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There are a number of incredible things that have been \nsaid about the Senator, and I think that is one of them.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, it was very offensive to me. If we don't work this \nout so that the parties agree in a consent decree, then we are going to \nhave years of litigation where even more people will die from smoking-\nrelated diseases and millions of kids will be hooked on cigarettes.\n  In 1996, as I said, and I ask the Senator if he remembers this, \nSecretary Shalala estimated that the 1996 FDA rule would reduce smoking \nby 50 percent over 7 years. David Kessler said it. The President \nbelieves that. There was no price increase involved in that, just the \nrule. But that rule will not be in effect if we don't have a voluntary \nconsent decree.\n  And, I might add, there are those who believe that rule shouldn't be \nin effect under current FDA law, the way it is currently written.\n  Let me ask the Senator to consider another fact. We are being told \nthat\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\nthe Senate's inaction on a $1.50 price increase over the next 3 years \nwill result in children dying. If that is the case, then why did the \nPresident of the United States advocate for a price increase of up to \n$1.50 but over 10 years? Is the Senator aware that Surgeon General \nSatcher, our Nation's doctor, did not call for a $1.50 price increase?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to be made aware of that by the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Rather, he echoed the President's position. He referred to \nprices as one of the most cost-effective, short-term strategies to \nreduce youth smoking. Will the Senator help me to understand their \nfailure to be advocates, if the evidence is, as our colleague from \nMassachusetts said, ``overwhelming and powerful''? More recently, my \ncolleague and I attended a Judiciary Committee hearing to determine if \nit is possible to design a plan to keep kids from smoking. Is the \nSenator aware of this? Dr. Greg Connally, head of the Massachusetts \ndrug control program, testified that the remarkable success of the \nMassachusetts program in reducing by 30 percent cigarette consumption \nin the 18- to 24-year-olds was because of the clean air indoor \nlegislation and advertising. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it, and that is why I think it is \nunnecessary to massively burden working Americans with an oppressive \ntax in order to achieve what State and local entities are doing without \nthis kind of imposition on working people of America.\n  Mr. HATCH. That came right out of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish this line of thought, and I will be happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I reassert my right to the floor, and I will be happy \nto yield for another question, but I have yielded to the Senator from \nUtah and the floor is not his to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri controls the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's look more closely at the 1994 IOM study which is the \nbasis of the 1998 IOM study. A fair reading of this 1994 IOM study \nseems far less definitive than is being portrayed by some in this \ndebate.\n  On page 187 of the 1994 Institute of Medicine study, it says:\n\n       Only a few studies have examined the question of whether \n     cigarette price increases affect teenagers differently than \n     adults.\n\n  It then reviewed the only three studies done to that point in the \nUnited States. It found relatively high price elasticities in two of \nthese studies but noted that the third study, the second National \nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey, ``failed to find a \nstatistically significant effect of cigarette prices on cigarette \nsmoking in youths age 12 through 17.'' Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it, and I am pleased to have you remind \nus all of the information in these studies.\n  Mr. HATCH. So the data that is not so categorical as being portrayed \nby the proponents of this amendment. In fact, the 1994 IOM report noted \nthe conflict, not the consensus, in the data. It noted that that \nrequires further study.\n  On page 188 of the IOM study, it says this:\n\n       The conflicting results of the few U.S. studies have \n     examined the impact of cigarette prices on consumption by \n     adolescents, including possible substitution of smokeless \n     tobacco products in response to higher cigarette prices, \n     reinforce the need for new research to assess the potential \n     for using higher tobacco taxes to deter adolescent tobacco \n     use.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is clear that the studies are conflicting. Some of \nthe assumptions which have been purported by others to be universal \nsimply are not universal and are not supportable when they are alleged \nto be universal.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that in a recent peer-reviewed \narticle in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the authors \nconclude that price increases have limited value? Is the Senator aware \nof that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to be aware of it and thank the Senator \nfor bringing it to the attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Since the tobacco companies cut their prices to wipe out \nthe tax increases, these public health scientists attributed the \nsuccess of the tobacco control program in Massachusetts to other \ncomponents of the comprehensive program. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. In the same hearing, Dr. William Roper, who is Dean of the \nUniversity of North Carolina School of Public Health, called for a \nsignificant price increase but failed to recommend an amount. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the University of Wisconsin \nSchool of Medicine Center for Tobacco Research and Prevention and Chair \nof the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research clinical practice \nguideline panel on smoking cessation testified that one of the most \neffective ways to reduce youth smoking is to focus on the current adult \nsmokers. He never mentioned a price increase to reduce youth smoking. \nIs the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of it.\n  Mr. HATCH. We all know teenage behavior is at best unpredictable. Dr. \nWarner of the University of Michigan estimated that the 1983 doubling \nof the Federal excise tax would decrease the number of teenage smokers \nby 800,000. This estimate fell short by one-fourth. This overzealous \nestimate should give all of us pause in stepping into the unchartered \nwaters of a $1.50 price increase.\n  We should not lead our mothers in this society to believe that if we \nraise the price of cigarettes by $1.50, their children will not smoke. \nIs the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I agree with that. We should not mislead parents. I \nwould firmly underscore the idea that the single, most important factor \nin whether or not young people smoke is the extent to which their \nparents are active in helping them not to smoke.\n  Mr. HATCH. I tell my colleagues, I am just about through with my \nquestions for now. I will have many, many more later on other aspects \nof this bill. But I wanted to get these points across. I really \nappreciate the courtesy of my colleague and his forbearance in being \nwilling to answer all these questions.\n  The main point is, there cannot be clear and unequivocal support for \na price increase of $1.50. I have never seen a price increase of that \nmagnitude. That has never been done.\n  Dr. Chaloupka also writes that less educated persons are less price \nresponsive. An American adult, who is a one-pack-a-day smoker would \nface a $547 increase. The Senator has been making that case, I believe. \nIs that correct?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I believe a one-pack-a-day habit in participating \nin smoking would cost an additional $547--if you had three packs a day, \nit takes you to about $1,600. Money that is taken from the family. It \ndoes not matter how much the family makes. It could be very low income. \nMost smokers tend to be in the low-income areas. So it is a very, very \naggressive tax on low-income America.\n  Mr. HATCH. This tax increase would take away more than 5 percent of \nthe income of an American making $10,000 a year. Is that correct?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. In some cases that is the kind of bite it would take \nout of their ability to buy food, shelter, and clothing to provide for \ntheir families.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is it not correct, I ask my colleague from Missouri, who \nhas been making very important points here during this debate, is it \ncorrect that currently smokers with incomes under $30,000 pay almost 50 \npercent of the tobacco excise tax?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Well, right here under the new plan it is projected to \nalmost 60 percent.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. If this $1.50 goes through, it will be probably \nthat high. And even at $1.10, it would be approaching 60 percent; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I am disappointed that some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are so ready to support a new tax-and-spend \nprogram supposedly aimed at children but weighing so heavily on the \nbacks of addicted, low-income adult workers under the guise that they \nare helping children.\n  Does the Senator agree with me on that?\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I do.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will take only a few more minutes.\n  While I agree--I will make this clear--that a price increase is an \nimportant component of a comprehensive program, the reason I have gone \nthrough all this is there is no clear and convincing evidence of what \nthat amount should be.\n  Let us be honest, the CBO found there is uncertainty and the price \nrise is not foolproof.\n  Do you agree with that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I do agree that a price rise is certainly not a \nfoolproof strategy for reducing teen smoking. There are ways to reduce \nteen smoking, and a number of them are not included in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would just like to ask my friend maybe one or two more \nquestions.\n  If we have to have a tobacco settlement, would it not be much better \nto force the tobacco companies to come back on board so we can resolve \nthe constitutional issues and have voluntary consent protocols so we \ncan actually reduce youth smoking?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My view is we should target to do things we can \nactually do to reduce teen smoking, and we have to do it in a way that \nis not an oppressive tax burden on hard-working families, especially \nlow-income families in America.\n  The proposal to raise this tax to $1.50, the proposal to have it at \n$1.10 is an unacceptable incursion into the ability of families to \nprovide for themselves. That is why I oppose this $1.10 pass-through \ntax on American consumers, particularly low-income individuals.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that this Senator, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, has spent an extensive amount of time studying \nthis issue, trying to come up with a way that you can punish the \ntobacco companies while getting their consent to the advertising \nrestrictions, so they have to live up to the deal?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am fully aware of the Senator's efforts in this \nrespect and say he is to be commended for working so hard as he has. I \nknow of no other individual who has dedicated himself more thoroughly \nto the attempt to resolve these issues than the Senator from Utah as \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware of the Senator from Utah's long-term \nantipathy toward this industry?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Indeed I am. Everyone is aware of that. We could submit \nthat for the Record for which people could take judicial note.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware of how hard the Senator from Utah \nstudied just exactly what would be the highest amount we could charge \nand still keep the tobacco companies--yes, kicking and screaming and \nfighting, and say they are gouged--on board to get these voluntary \nconsent protocols so we can make this matter constitutional?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is pretty clear we can often find how hard \nsomeone has worked and studied by the nature of the questions they have \nasked. The nature of the questions you have asked is such that everyone \ncan know that you have done perhaps as much work as anyone could \npossibly do in examining these issues.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware----\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for an administrative question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have one or two questions.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is not up to the Senator from Utah to make that \ndecision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Will the Senator respond?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield further to me?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will not yield for a different set of questions at \nthis time. I am yielding to the Senator from Utah at this time.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to--I do not think the Senator from Utah \nis abusing the rules. I think I have the privilege to ask all the \nquestions I can. I think these have been intelligent questions. I think \nthey have been right on point. I think they hopefully will help to \nelucidate what we need to know.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator is not entitled to make a statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator agree with my last statement?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. HATCH. Now----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I ask one administrative question of \nthe Senator from Missouri?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri will yield for an \nadministrative question on the presumption and understanding that I \nretain the floor after the question has been asked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will not lose the floor upon \nresponding to the question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will not assert this, but ask the Senator \nfrom Missouri if he is aware that under the rules of the Senate, and \nunder precedence of the Senate, a Senator may yield for a question, a \nSenator may not yield for a statement in the guise of a question, and a \nSenator may not yield for a question proceeded by or followed by a \nstatement. And that under rule 194 of the Senate, either by request of \nthe Senator or by decision of the Chair, a Senator may be asked, in \nfact, to give up his right to the floor and take his seat if that rule \nis violated? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from Utah for a \nquestion and thank him for his questions. I appreciate the way in which \nhe has framed these questions. I think it has been very productive and \nhelpful in this debate.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for his leadership on the floor in \npointing out the problems that exist with regard to this ``piling on'' \nmentality. Is the Senator aware that we did it in the catastrophic \nbill, and we all lost that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no doubt that if the managers' amendment of $1.10 \ngoes through--does the Senator have any doubt that if a managers' \namendment of $1.10 goes though, let alone $1.50, that we will wind up \nwith another similar process and problems on our hands?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think we have a major problem on our hands. I am not \nconcerned about piling on the companies--I am concerned about piling on \nthe consumers, or piling on the poor people of America a tax burden \nwhich they should not be asked to carry for reasons which I think are \ninadequate to justify.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator and ask a final question. I \napologize to my colleagues for taking this time. As everybody knows, I \ndon't take an awful lot of time on the floor. If we are going to \nresolve this matter, it seems to me, and I wonder if the Senator would \nagree with me, that we have to take into consideration the \napproximately 50 million users of tobacco products in this society, \nmany of whom are hooked on these products, or at least addicted to \nthem; we have to consider the children; we have to consider using this \nmoney for tobacco-related purposes to the utmost extent that we can.\n  Would the Senator agree with me on those?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I agree we have to do what we can to appropriately use \nwhat resources we can to reduce teen smoking.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am concerned about what is going on on the floor right \nnow. I am concerned about the managers' amendment. I am concerned about \nit ever really working, and I imagine the Senator--and this is a \nquestion--is as concerned as I am.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am deeply concerned, particularly about the impact of \nthese massive taxes on low-income families and there ability to make \nends meet and maintain their independence.\n  Mr. HATCH. Despite what Michael Douglas said in the popular movie \n``Wall Street,'' greed is not good, and it is especially onerous and \nburdensome when the greed comes from Congress itself.\n  Would the Senator agree with me on that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I agree that greed is not good, and it is particularly \nrepugnant when it is Government asking for more and more from people \nwho can afford it less and less. I think that is what we have here--\nthose who are asking for more and more from consumers who can afford \nless and less.\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to personally compliment the Senator for his work \non the floor. I know he has taken a lot of time and has had to give up \nhis office work and a lot of other things to be able to join in this \ncolloquy, but this is important. I believe his colloquy is important if \nwe want to understand both sides of this issue on the $1.50. I want to \ncompliment the Senator for being willing to have the fortitude, the \ndedication, and the drive to stand here and do this.\n  I apologize to the rest of my colleagues for having taken as long as \nI have to ask these questions, but I think every question has been \npertinent and to the point and every question has tried to enlighten, \nand that is what questions are for. That is why the rules provide for \nit.\n  I thank my colleague for allowing me to do this.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to answer the \nquestions. I indicated the nature of the questions has been a very \nspecific, particularly questions regarding a variety of studies. These \nstudies have challenged the fallacious assumption that there is an \nautomatic streamline correlation between price increase and potential \nfor reducing smoking, especially among young people, and the clear \nindication on the part of the Senator from Utah, through his questions, \nof the amount of study, efforts, investigation, and analysis in which \nhe has engaged is the kind of analysis, investigation, study, and \nquestioning that will refine our ability to make the right decision \nhere.\n  (Earlier the following occurred and, by unanimous consent, was \nordered to be printed at this point in the Record.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for a minute so \nI can make an administrative announcement. it has nothing to do with \nthe issue at hand; it is so that we can provide courtesy to other \nMembers.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am please to yield, with this \nunderstanding: I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nremarks of the manager of the bill, I be allowed again to speak and \nhave my position on the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me just do this first.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, let me understand this. \nThe Senator from Missouri is asking that at the end of the managers' \nremarks he be recognized?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will yield only in a way that does not forfeit my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I won't object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the reason I interrupt is that many \nMembers were laboring under the correct impression that we were \nprobably going to have a vote about now on a tabling motion. Obviously, \nbecause of the extent of the debate and the desire of both sides to \nspeak, we will not have the tabling motion at this time. I will do so \nafter it appears that most Members on both sides have had an \nopportunity to talk about the issue. I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts agrees that we would not want to have a tabling motion \nsince the other side has not had an opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I finish speaking? Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has yielded to the \nmanager of the bill and then, by unanimous consent, he will resume \nrecognition.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe the unanimous consent agreement \nends when I complete my remarks; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senator from \nMissouri and the Senator from Utah until I finish my remarks. I think \nthat is a fairly common courtesy that is extended around here.\n  We intend to have a tabling motion on both the Ashcroft second-degree \namendment and on the underlying Kennedy amendment, and I would guess \nprobably within a couple of hours we will be able to finish the \ndiscussion on this side and have ample time to respond on that side. \nFor the benefit of my colleagues, I am trying to make this process as \nconvenient as I can for every Member of the Senate so that they can \nanticipate and adjust their schedules accordingly. I have now completed \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona not interrupt our questions and \nremarks.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks \nof the Senator from Arizona not interrupt the questions of the Senator \nfrom Utah in the Record.\n  I am pleased to yield to the Senator from Utah for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without object, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. We were going through this CBO report. I apologize to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona for irritating him. I thought he had \nfinished his remarks. I always intend to extend courtesy throughout the \nSenate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator extend that courtesy to me for the \npurpose of an administrative question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I reassert my right to the floor and \nindicate that I would be pleased to yield to the minority manager of \nthe bill for purposes of an administrative question, with the \nunderstanding that at the conclusion of his remarks, or question, I \nreacquire the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Missouri very much.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If there was a question propounded to me, it was during \nthe time when I was listening to another question. I need to have it \nagain propounded.\n  Mr. KERRY. I did not propound a question yet. I was waiting for the \nSenator to finish. I simply wanted to ask the following. There was an \neffort between the other manager and myself to try to have comity here \nso that we weren't really operating in a strict sense by asserting \nrights to the floor. We were trying to move back and forth in a \nrelatively fair manner, without any sense of trying to cut anybody off. \nThere is no effort here to stop somebody from being able to speak. \nThere is an effort to try to share the opportunities with a lot of busy \nSenators. So what we are trying to do is get a sense of the length of \ntime, in fairness to colleagues who are lined up to speak.\n  If the Senator wants to continue to speak, that is obviously his \nprivilege. He can also come back at any time and resume speaking. We \nare making no effort to hold the floor on this side. We are making no \neffort to delay. Each of the Senators will speak for a brief period of \ntime. So we are very happy to accommodate our colleagues. I simply ask \nhim if he might give us, at this point, some indication of either when \nhe would complete this round or whether he would be willing to allow \nsome other Senators, perhaps, to have a chance to also speak and then \nperhaps come back. We are trying to do this in a fair-minded way.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I answer the question without forfeiting my right \nto the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I earlier agreed and, as a matter of fact, urged you to \nhave Members from your side go ahead of me. I don't mind them having a \nchance to speak. When we sought unanimous consent for that, it was \nobjected to by the manager of the bill. I had intended, in every \nrespect, to provide for ample debate.\n  My view is that this is a very important topic. I learned last night \nin an announcement by those managing this bill that there would be an \neffort made to table this amendment without giving a full opportunity \nfor discussion and that there was a time set without even so much as \nseeking an agreement from Senators as to how much time could be spent.\n  In my judgment, if you are going to have an $868 billion tax increase \non the American people in pursuit of an objective, which is allegedly \nthe reduction of teen smoking, but has lots of other consequences and \nis unlikely to achieve the objective, we ought to at least be able to \ndebate it. So I am very willing to consider full debate. I want\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\nto have that on this issue. But the managers of this bill have \nbasically signaled to me that they intend to truncate debate, that they \ndon't want this discussed.\n  So it was my judgment that I needed to come to the floor and bring \nthe evidence with me and then speak about this bill. I intend to speak \nabout it and say what I think needs to be said. I am very pleased to \nhave questions raised. But when questions are raised, obviously, that \ncomes out of the time for me to make my remarks. That would extend the \ntime. I think my position is clear. Early on, I tried to make it \npossible for those in the Chamber to go ahead of me and make remarks, \nand that was rejected. So if my only choice is to make my own remarks, \nthen I will make my own remarks. But I sought to make it possible for \nothers to speak.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, without the Senator losing any right to the \nfloor, I ask if I may ask a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. With the understanding that I reacquire the floor at \nthe conclusion of the question, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if he would agree to the \nfollowing structure then.\n  Would it be agreeable to the Senator from Missouri, since he and the \nintercessions of the Senator from Utah have now taken up about an hour \nand 15 minutes, if we were to have perhaps 45 minutes or an hour for \nthose on our side to speak, with the understanding that when they are \nfinished the Senator from Missouri would then be recognized to again \ncontinue his remarks?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to let the Senator from Utah finish his \nline of questioning, and then I would be agreeable to such.\n  Mr. KERRY. Again, without the Senator losing his right to the floor, \nI propound a question. How long does the Senator from Utah think that \nmight be?\n  Mr. HATCH. Am I entitled to speak? I don't think it will be too much \nlonger. But I would like to go through my questions. I am not intending \nto delay here. This is a very large bill, perhaps the largest the \nSenate has ever considered, at least in recent memory. We need to \nquestion its full impact as we proceed. That is the right way to make \npolicy on such an important issue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Again, I ask the question without the Senator losing his \nright to the floor. Could we then enter into an agreement that I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senator from Utah has completed his \nseries of questions to the Senator from Missouri, that at that time \nthere be 1 hour allocated to this side of the aisle, to the Democrats, \nfor their debate, at which point the Senator from Missouri would again \nbe recognized to resume his comments?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is clear we are dealing with an issue of \ngrave importance, representing tremendous amounts of money, with very \nstrong passions on the issue. And, quite frankly, there is relatively \nlittle good information about the bill. We don't even know what the \nimpact of this amendment would be in terms of the cost of the product \non which the tax would be imposed. The logical thing to do is follow \nthe rules of the Senate. The rules of the Senate are very clear. As \nlong as a Senator wishes to speak, or answer questions, that Senator \nhas the right to do it.\n  I think, rather than interrupting the process, we would all be better \noff to just follow the rules of the Senate.\n  On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is it not a rule of \nthe Senate that one may ask for unanimous consent and, in asking for \nunanimous consent, we are following the rules of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection was heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will yield with the understanding that my right to \nthe floor is not forfeited to the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michele \nChang, a detailee to my staff, and Peter Reinecke and Sabrina Corlette \nof my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of the \nconsideration of S. 1415.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could continue----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to yield to the Senator, but I am in the \nmidst of yielding for questions to the Senator from Utah. I want to \npersist in that line of questioning. So I reassert my right to the \nfloor.\n  If the Senator from Utah was asking me a question, I would ask him to \nrequest that I yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator please ask unanimous consent that the \ncolloquy not be interrupted?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent of the Presiding Officer that \nour colloquy not be interrupted by these other proceedings, and that \nthe other proceedings be printed suitably at the end of the \nquestioning.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I certainly wouldn't want \nto interrupt that important colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I say that the distinguished Senator from Arizona may not \nappreciate this colloquy.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If that is a question, I am aware of that fact.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to admit that I don't appreciate some of the \ncolloquies that have gone on before, but Senators have a right to do \nso. This is too important an issue for the American public. We need to \nlook at the real facts on such important legislation. We are not just \ntrying to run any bill through because some people want to. I think \nthis legislation deserves debate. We are talking about price levels \nthat will amount to huge tax increases for some American people. We are \ntalking a bill which does not have the cooperation of the tobacco \ncompanies, thus raising serious constitutional questions.\n  (End of earliest proceedings.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled about the fact that \nwe are, in this process, taxing American families and taxing those \nAmerican families who have very limited income. Fifty-nine point four \npercent of the $755 billion that my amendment would take out of this \nbill, which are taxes on consumers--59.4 percent of that is to be paid \nby families with incomes of less than $30,000. If you move it up to the \n$60,000 level, you are talking abut almost two-thirds of the people, \nhard-working families from our culture, who struggle to put clothing on \nthe backs of their children and the right kind of food on the table.\n  There is a suggestion by some that they can just stop smoking \nautomatically. If they are going to stop smoking, why are we counting \non the money? We are counting on receiving almost $1 trillion over the \nnext 25 years from these folks, and it is predicated on the idea that \nthey can't stop smoking. If it were a switch that we could flip on and \noff, perhaps we would go find the switch and do it. But that is not \nwhat we are talking about. We are talking about taxing individuals who \ndon't have any elasticity of demand.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the elasticity of demand, \neconomics--that if you elevate the price, the demand will go down. If \npeople are addicted, they can't stop, so they have to pay. That is \nthese folks here--59.4 percent of the individuals paying this tax will \nbe individuals making under $30,000 a year.\n  Americans are working longer and harder than ever to pay their taxes. \nThe number of moms and dads, two parents in the family, both working; \nor in single-parent families, obviously, the only parent is working--we \nare taking more and more of their resources. We take now more of the \nincome of the American people than ever before in taxes. We are at \npeace, we are in prosperity, but still, Government is costing more than \never before. We have charged so much for Government, we\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\nare finding we have a $43 billion surplus. CBO says it might be up to a \n$63 billion surplus.\n  What are we going to do? Instead of giving people their money back, \ninstead of saying, ``You send it, we spend it,'' we should be saying, \n``You earned it, we returned it.'' No, we are not doing that. Where are \nwe going with this? We are inviting another $868 billion of burden on \nthose who can least afford to pay it. It is just incredible. We should \nbe debating how to return the money to taxpayers, not how to siphon \nmore out of their pockets. As currently drafted, the proposed tobacco \nbill is nothing more than an excuse for Washington to raise taxes and \nspend more money.\n  I might add that earlier I sent to the desk a modification of the \namendment making technical changes. That does not require anything. I \nwant to indicate to the Senate that I had done so, and it doesn't \nrequire action.\n  This proposed increase in Government and taxes is the biggest \nproposed increase since President Clinton's proposed increase on health \ncare. My own sense is that it took a while for the people of the \ncountry to realize what the Federal takeover in health care was going \nto do to this country, when the American people figured out what it was \ngoing to cost. And when the American people understand that this isn't \na penalty on the tobacco companies, this $755 billion that I want to \nknock out of this bill isn't something that the tobacco companies will \npay, this is something consumers will pay.\n  The law specifically forbids a tobacco company from passing this on \nto consumers. There is a mandatory rule that this can't come out of the \nprofits of tobacco companies. This can't come out of their retained \nearnings. This can't come out of their capitalization. This has to be \nimposed on the backs of these workers, these folks who are making under \n$30,000 a year, these additional folks making under $60,000 a year.\n  Here we could have an additional 17 boards and commissions. There is \nthe statute: ``Payments to be Passed Through to Consumers''--not \npayments to be endured or suffered by the tobacco companies. But these \nare payments to be undertaken by poor families. Three packs a day, \n$1,600 a year--that is what they are asking for, $1,600 a year off of \nthe tables, out of the houses, out of the budget for the children in \nthese families. That is what this is a law about. This is a law that \nwould take an enormous amount of resources from the families of \nAmerica. They are already paying taxes that are virtually out of sight. \nThey are already paying taxes for more than food, clothing, shelter, \nand transportation combined in this country, and we are going to add to \nthe poorest of the poor this incredible burden. Seventeen boards, \ncommissions, and agencies--they say they have been removed from the \nlegislation. The bureaucracies envisaged by the bill will still be \nthere; it is just that they are no longer sort of visible. We have gone \nfrom unaccountability to anonymity. That will not cure things. This \nhuge tax increase would be levied against those who are least capable \nof paying.\n\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, tobacco taxes are \nperhaps the most regressive tax that is levied in America. It is a tax \nthat hits poor people the hardest. And we are discussing what we want \nto do with that $868 billion of additional burden on the poor. About 60 \npercent of this tax increase would fall on families earning $30,000 a \nyear or less. Those earning less than $10,000 a year make up only 10 \npercent of the population, but 32 percent of those people smoke. So the \ncurrent tobacco tax represents 5 percent of the smokers' income in this \ncategory.\n  This would take from the people who are struggling to make ends meet, \nmaking $10,000 a year, 5 percent of their income. That is really a \npack-a-day habit we are talking about. We are not talking about a two-\npacks-a-day habit. If they have two packs a day, it is far more than 5 \npercent of $10,000. Those making between $10,000 and $20,000 a year are \nonly 18 percent of the population; however, 30 percent of them smoke. \nThe current tobacco tax would take a real chunk--2 percent of the \nsmokers' income--in that category. This bill amounts to a tax increase \non 31 percent of Americans who earn under $20,000 a year.\n  So among those who are the poorest of our hard-working Americans, who \nare low-income, they are the people who really get hit with this. And \n31 percent of all people making less than $20,000 a year are the \nindividuals who are going to be sustaining this tax burden. Households \nearning less than $10,000 a year will feel the bite of this tax \nincrease most of all.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that these households, \nthose earning less that $10,000 a year overall, would see their Federal \ntaxes rise by 44.6 percent--44.6 percent. Those making between $10,000 \na year and $20,000 a year make up 18 percent of the population; 30 \npercent of them smoke. In most areas of the country, somebody earning \n$10,000 a year is well below the poverty line. But here we come. We are \nso interested in additional revenue, at a time when we have surplus, \nthat we are willing to sock it to those who are low-income individuals.\n  We spend much of our time in this body trying to find solutions for \nthose in this income bracket. We have tax credits; we have welfare \nprograms; we have educational grants; we have job training programs. \nThey cost us billions of dollars a year. We try to lift people in those \nlow-income brackets out of their problems and difficulties. However, \ntoday, Members of this body are enthusiastically saddling them with a \nhuge, huge tax burden. In fact, some are even trying to make it worse.\n  It is pretty clear that some people have come and said that people \nwill stop smoking. I will get to that next. Here it is. The kind of tax \nincrease, if you are making under $10,000 a year, is 44 percent. We are \nnot really tax increasing anybody since most smokers are concentrated \nin this part of the graph. Low-income people are going to pay the \nlion's share. They are going to have very significant increases in \ntheir tax load.\n  Now, some Members were critical about the statement that this is a \nhuge tax increase on low-income people. It was stated that I was \nassuming that they would be irresponsible and not take care of their \nfamilies' needs. I am not saying here that anybody is irresponsible. I \ndo think that the Government has frequently been irresponsible. It is \nirresponsible to take this much of the income from people who are \ntrying to clothe their families and feed their families.\n\n  The revenue assumptions in this bill are based on the fact that most \npeople will continue to smoke. You can't have it both ways. You can't \nsay that people are going to suddenly stop smoking; you can't say that \nand still say you are going to spend the money and collect the money. \nThis is basically a tax, a tax that relates to the increase in the \nprice of cigarettes, a tax that passes money from low-income, hard-\nworking Americans to big Government in America so the Government can do \na wide variety of things.\n  Frankly, I think some of the things that this proposes to do are \nliterally laughable. Some of the programs that are in this bill are \ndesigned to curtail smoking overseas. So we are going to tax low-income \nAmericans, folks who are struggling at $10,000, $15,000, or $20,000 a \nyear to make ends meet; we are going to take money from them and go \noverseas and run antismoking campaigns. Now, in my judgment, that is a \nvery, very serious disconnect with what we are supposed to do. We are \nsupposed to make it possible for Americans to live decently and \nindependently and provide for their children, to have a framework in \nwhich Government at least lets them enjoy the fruits of the things they \nlabor to produce; and if we don't do that, it seems to me that we \nobviously have failed.\n  I don't believe we should be taking money from hard-working, low-\nincome Americans and putting it into a foreign aid system that tries to \ntell people on the other side of the world how they should act and what \nthey should do. If I believed that everybody would quit smoking, the \nimpact of this bill obviously would not be so significant because it \nwould not be a tax. But it is clear that there will be a tax, and there \nis a predicated set of receipts that is going to run between three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars and a trillion dollars. Everyone in this \nChamber, the administration, and health officials are making the \nassumption that people will continue to smoke.\n  As currently drafted, this legislation will cause somebody who smokes \ntwo\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\npacks daily to pay the Government an additional $803 a year. A lot of \nfamilies could take a vacation on $803. A lot of families could buy \nadditional clothing. A lot of families could afford courses at a junior \ncollege to change their skill levels and upgrade their jobs. A lot of \nfamilies could care for a relative or otherwise do something that we \nneed to get done rather than send this money to Washington, DC. That is \n$803 for somebody who smokes two packs a day. For a family smoking \nthree packs a day, it is even more.\n  My amendment would prevent that from happening. My amendment simply \nsays we are not going to punish the American people for that which the \ntobacco companies have done; we are not going to hurt the hard-working \nAmericans of low-income as a means of objecting to the abuses of big \ntobacco.\n  Moreover, as currently drafted, this legislation allows the tobacco \ncompanies to deduct the mandatory payments that are ultimately to be \npaid by consumers as regular business expenses. Over 5 years, that kind \nof writeoff would be worth about $36 billion in the tobacco industry. \nSo if we are giving a tax break to the tobacco industry that is going \nto be worth $36 billion to them over 5 years, and part of that comes as \na result of the fact that we are taxing individual consumers, I think \nthat is really unfair.\n  Let's take a second to understand this. In this legislation that is \nsupposed to be so tough on the tobacco industry--and, frankly, the \ntobacco industry participated in formulating almost all of the basic \ncomponents of this legislation--the companies act as a tax collector by \nsending the U.S. Treasury $102 billion over the next 5 years. Then they \nget a tax deduction, and they cost U.S. taxpayers--all taxpayers, \nwhether they are smokers or not--$36 billion in lost revenues because \nof the tax deduction.\n  What you get here is a subsidy through the back door. They send in \n$102 billion they collect from people and then they get $36 billion of \nit back as a tax break for the company. I think that is a particularly \nanomalous result. That is a result which we certainly do not really \nwant to have. They collect money from poor, hard-working Americans, \nturn it in, and when they turn it in they get a tax deduction of $36 \nbillion.\n  Before we consider passing a massive tax increase, it should behoove \nus to review the government's record thus far in respect to taxes, \nspending, and government employment. Where have we been recently in \nterms of tax increases, in terms of spending? In Washington, taxes and \nspending are the only things more addictive than nicotine. Policymakers \nin Washington think they know better how to spend the money of families \nthan American families do.\n  In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress passed 13 major tax \nincreases. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first meaningful tax \ncut since 1981. The tobacco tax increase would more than erase that \nrelief. We need more tax relief, not less. If we have the increase that \nis proposed here, it will totally erase the relief we gave last year. \nThe tobacco industry tax, then, proposed in this bill is not a tax on \nthe industry. It is a tax on the consumers. It would more than erase \nthe relief we gave them last year.\n  The tax relief date has now set a record of May 10. People work \nlonger this year for the Government than ever before. Federal, State, \nand local taxes claim 37.6 percent of the income of a median two-income \nfamily in 1997, more than the couple spent on food, and shelter, on \nclothing, and transportation combined.\n  During Bill Clinton's first 5 years in office the Federal Government \ncollected 19 cents in taxes for every dollar increase in the gross \ndomestic product. According to the Joint Economic Committee, the \nFederal Government is now taking a higher share of economic growth than \nunder any President in recent history. The Joint Economic Committee \ncontinues, The average rate during the entire era before Clinton from \nPresidents Eisenhower to Bush was 19 percent. Obviously, the Federal \nGovernment has yet to reject the idea that it can just tax and spend \nand tax and spend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that you wanted to modify your \namendment. Is that correct?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2427, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is correct. I modify my amendment which is at the \ndesk, which is technical in nature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2427), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted insert the \n     following:\n\n Certain Provisions Relating to Amounts in Trust Fund Null and Void.--\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the following \n     provisions of this Act shall be null and void and not given \n     effect:\n       (1) Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Section 401(b);\n       (2) Section 402(a); and\n       (3) Sections 401 through 406.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Does that last \nrequest require a unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does not require a UC.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Members of this body have been arguing over the past few days that \nthere is no tax in this bill. In fact, the Finance Committee, in its \nmark, at least tried to level with the American people by reporting out \na bill that calls it a tax. For a long time this was sailing under a \nsail which was mislabeled. Webster's Dictionary defines a tax as a \ncompulsory payment, usually a percentage levied on income, property, \nvalues, sales prices, et cetera, for the support of government. Let's \nlay this argument to rest now and forever. This is a tax. It is a \ncompulsory payment made at the point of sale for the benefit of \ngovernment. In this bill we have compulsory payments by the industry.\n  The bill then requires the cost of these payments to be passed on as \nprice increases to consumers, and even penalizes companies if they fail \nto collect this tax. Payments are used to fund massive programs for \nFederal and State governments. It has been said that industry is the \ngroup that is convincing people this is a tax bill. Frankly, industry \ncouldn't make this a tax bill if it weren't a tax bill. Frankly, this \nbody cannot keep it from being a tax bill if the language of the bill \nis really taxing. What we know is that the Senate can't keep it from \nbeing a tax if it is really a tax by calling it something else, and \nindustry couldn't make it a tax by calling it a tax. The truth of the \nmatter is it is an elevated price required to be collected, the \nproceeds of which go to support government.\n  The supporters of this bill claim this legislation is needed to curb \nteen smoking. ``Do it for the children'' is all we hear. But this bill \nis about big government, not about protecting the health of young \npeople. It is about more bureaucracy. It is about more Federal \nprograms. It is about higher taxes, new bureaucracy.\n  The bill reported out of committee contained 19 new boards, \ncommissions, and agencies--17 new boards, commissions and agencies--a \nblatant expansion of government claim under immediate and harsh \ncriticism. What happened? We have a claim that the bureaucracy has been \neliminated. But is it really? I don't think that it is really \neliminated. I think the names have been changed. But the same tangled \nmess as this chart represents still exists in this bill.\n  This is the structure of the National Tobacco Policy and Youth \nSmoking Reduction Act that was reported by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee on the 1st of May 1998, just a couple weeks ago. This is a \ncomplicated set of extremes. I might add that these are funding \nextremes. Money is flowing like a flood. The bureaucracy is still in \nthis bill. It is just more anonymous, less visible, less accountable. \nThe names may have been changed, but it is still the same animal.\n  Let's look at the whole chart. Here we have the International Tobacco \nControl Trust Fund. Interesting. The International Tobacco Control \nTrust Fund, foreign aid grants to support tobacco control. The \ninternational program is still here. I will talk more about it in a \nminute.\n  The Tobacco Asbestos Trust Fund, $21 billion allows payments to be \nmade for asbestos claims when Congress enacts qualifying legislation. \nPayments will be made out of the tobacco trust fund for the 22-percent \nset-aside for public health expenditures.\n  Compliance bonuses for States: Here it is. It is still in there.\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n  Research activities for CDC, Institute for Medicine, and NIH are \nstill in there.\n  State licensing program grants are still in there.\n  The National Tobacco Free Education Program is still on the chart.\n  The Indian tribe enforcement bureaucracy is still there.\n  The Indian tribe public health grants are still in there.\n  Counteradvertising programs are still in there.\n  The prevention of tobacco smuggling measure is still in there.\n  Veterans programs are still in there.\n  The National Tobacco Document Depository is still here.\n  Smoking cessation programs are here.\n  Child care development block grants are still there.\n  We are going to be taxing those lowest income families to provide \nadditional child care for others.\n  Tobacco community revitalization, this is the tobacco farmer; very \nserious questions about this particular portion of the bill.\n  The Senator from Texas talked about the so-called Tobacco Community \nRevitalization Program. He brought out, as a matter of fact, on the \nfloor yesterday the fact that he priced tobacco allotments per acre. It \ncould be purchased for about $3,500 or $3,600. Then he indicated that \nthe payment envisaged here was a multiple of about five times that \nhigh.\n  The international programs, which I mentioned, are kind of \ninteresting. The committee bill contained the American Center on Global \nHealth and Tobacco, which was authorized to receive $150 million a year \nso that we could sort of be influential overseas with our policy on \ntobacco.\n  We want to tax the lowest income families in America. We want to tax \nhard-working people, increase their taxes. My amendment would delete \n$755 billion in taxes on these individuals contained in this bill.\n  This bill is designed to fund things like the American Center on \nGlobal Health and Tobacco. The center is not to be found in the \nmanagers' amendment. In its place, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices is authorized to establish an international tobacco control \nawareness effort. So instead of having this agency sort of be out there \ncreated by the statute, we have just authorized the bureaucracy to \ncreate a new agency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is \nauthorized to establish an international tobacco control awareness \neffort.\n\n  Now, here we have to remember--we are taxing American low-income \nfamilies to do this--59.4 percent of all the taxes that go to establish \nthis international program on tobacco awareness are going to come from \nfamilies making less than $30,000 a year. What is this new effort \nrequired to do? One, support the development of appropriate \ngovernmental control activities in foreign countries--enhance foreign \ncountries' capacities to collect, analyze, and disseminate data about \nthe cost of tobacco use.\n  We are going to fund foreign countries so that they can have studies \non how much it costs to use tobacco. And we are going to do that by \ntaxing low-income people. Sixty cents out of every dollar in this \nprogram is going to come from families with less than $30,000--low-\nincome individuals, less than $30,000. How much money will this cost?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Missouri be willing \nto yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Missouri \nwhether he is aware that the chart that he has there is the \nrepresentation of the bill when it came out of the Commerce Committee, \nnot of the managers' amendment, and that under the managers' amendment \nall bureaucracies were, in fact, eliminated and only three existing \nentities exist? I wonder if the Senator is aware that there are only \nthree entities.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. As a matter of fact, I have been speaking about that. I \nindicated that this was the chart and these functions remain. But very \nfrequently, instead of the bureaucracy still being there and labeled \nand identified, you have a transfer from the bureaucracy to something \nthat you just ask the Secretary to do.\n  For instance, I have just been talking about the transition from the \ninternational tobacco control trust fund, and in its place the new bill \nhas ``the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to \nestablish.'' So instead of actually establishing, you just authorize \nthat a bureaucrat establishes it. You get it out of the bill, but you \nstill have it in terms of consequence, and you still have all the money \navailable to be spent for the same purposes.\n  That is my understanding of what has happened here, and you are going \nto have $35 million each year for the first 5 years, and then such \nfunds as may be necessary for these international activities. So I am \naware of the fact that the bureaucracies were taken out of the bill \nostensibly, but I am also aware of the fact that what you let go out \nthe front door it looks to me like you bring back in the back door, \nbecause the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to \nestablish--it is not in the bill anymore, but the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services is authorized to establish an international control \nawareness effort, and that is basically for the same purposes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator further yield for a \nquestion without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is the Senator not aware that each of those \nresponsibilities which are designated to existing entities are already \nexisting programs and existing efforts? Most of the requirements, \nwhether it is money in public health, money in farmer community \nassistance, or health research, they are all ongoing programs, but that \nthis augments their ability to be able to achieve the goals of existing \nprograms?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I understand that some of these programs are already \nprograms which are undertaken, but not even close to the extent that \nthis bill mandates--thus expanding the already oversized Government \nbureaucracy. I also understand that what we have here is a pot of money \nthat we think we can generate by taxing the lowest-income, hardest-\nworking poor people in the country. And what we are going to do is to \nstart spending more money for these overseas studies, and we are going \nto put 60 percent of that additional money that comes out of this \nadditional $868 billion tax--$6 out of every $10 is going to come out \nof the pockets of Americans earning less than $30,000 a year. That is \nreally troubling me.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Missouri yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to yield for a question, understanding I \ndo not yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I presided the previous hour, and I was fascinated by \nsome of the information that the Senator has been providing our \ncolleagues and the American people. Did I hear the Senator correctly \nthat 60 percent of the increased taxes in the base bill would fall upon \nlower-income Americans?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Well, people who earn less than $30,000 a year would \npay, according to the estimates, 59.4 percent. So I don't want to \ninordinately suggest that it is a full 60. It is 59.4 percent of those \ntaxes would hit people who earn less than $30,000 a year.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. For my benefit, how much in the base bill would a \npack of cigarettes increase?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Well, in the base bill it has been suggested that the \nincrease in the cost of a package of cigarettes would be about--total \nincrease would be about $2.68 at a minimum. That includes all the \nthings that are in the bill. The $1.10 which is the mandated price \nincrease, by the time it works its way through the system, would be \nabout a $2.68 increase in the price of cigarettes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Two dollars and what?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. A $2.68 increase.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Would the consumer buying a package of cigarettes \nactually see the price go up that much?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I would say it is fair to say they would be seeing \nthat increase in terms of the consequences of the bureaucracy in this \nbill.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. For a family of three, let's suppose, a mom and dad\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\nand a child, in which one or both smoke two packs a day between them or \nseparately--but two packs a day--then we are taking $5 a day, $1,500 a \nyear, away from their consumable income. Is my math approximately \ncorrect on that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It would include the current cost of the cigarettes. We \nare talking about a two-pack-a-day thing. It is really about, the \nincrease is about--you are right, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. So even with a $1.10 increase, we are looking at \nbetter than $2 a day, or a $600, $700 increase?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. At $1.10 a day, 365 days would be about $400, and \nfor two packs, that would take it to $800. I think it figures out to \n$803, if it is just at $1.10 on the increase.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I did a little focus grouping in Arkansas where I \njust asked people--one lady had six children, five of whom smoke. They \nare between the ages are 35 and 40, grown children. I asked her would \nthey quit smoking if it went up $1.50 a pack. She laughed. She said, \n``No, they won't. They are addicted, and they wouldn't do it.''\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My view--and I am pleased to have the question--my view \nis, this bill is predicated on the idea that people won't quit. If this \nbill were predicated on the idea that people would quit, we would not \nhave the big numbers and the big money to pass around. We are assuming \nthat these people who earn less than $30,000 a year are strapped in the \nhabit of smoking, can't quit, and therefore we are going to be able to \nhave $868 billion of their money over the next 25 years.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I could ask the Senator from Missouri, if a family \nis making $30,000, with children--and there are many of those in \nArkansas, many, many, tens of thousands--assuming the budget is tight \nalready, they are having a hard time making ends meet, that every \ndollar is already spent, where then would you anticipate them cutting \nback to pay that additional tax for cigarettes that is envisioned in \nthis proposal?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Families have a tough decision where they cut back, but \nI imagine it would hurt virtually everything they do in some measure. I \ndoubt if they would take it all out of one area. For instance, I don't \nthink they would stop driving their car, and I don't think they would \nstop eating. They can't do that. But I think virtually every aspect of \ntheir existence. If you are talking $800, $1,200 a year, $100 a month, \nfor instance, on three packs a day, if you take that $100 of a month \nout of the budget of low income families, we may drive some of them \ninto dependency. And that is last thing government should do is make it \nhard for people to provide for their families. We should be finding \nways to make it easier for people to provide for their families.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. With this very dramatic tax increase on low and \nmiddle income families, some people could loose their health insurance, \nend up on Medicaid conceivably?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Obviously, they could be forced into all kinds of \nreliance on outside sources. With the stress that would happen to a \nfamily that lost $100 a month by virture of this kind of massive \nFederal tax on the family, who knows what happens even in the way the \nfamily is composed in a setting like that because financial stress is a \nbig part of the challenge to families generally. This is an anti-family \nmeasure. This takes from families a very serious proportion of the \nresources they use to care for one another. And when we say that \nGovernment wants this money so badly it will take it from you, and we \nknow you are going to pay it because you are addicted and can't stop, \nwe have really allowed the greed of Government to overtake us. And to \nsay to families, it doesn't matter about you, we are so interested in \ndoing what we want to do--and it does shock me that we are going to \nspend this money overseas, keeping data about the costs of smoking \noverseas. I just can't imagine how many folks in Arkansas or my home \nState of Missouri, who are earning $30,000 or $10,000 or $15,000, would \nwant to make these kinds of payments so they could keep track of the \ncosts of smoking in foreign jurisdictions. That is mind-boggling.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If the Senator will yield for a further question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will yield for a further question.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Last weekend I read a 35-page summary of the 750-page \noriginal bill, but with the changes that have been envisioned--and the \nSenator has mentioned this in his remarks --how much would be going \noverseas for smoking cessation and education programs overseas? How \nmuch was that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The bill, I think, provides that there are $350 million \nfor each of the first 5 years. And then, after that, there would be \n``such sums as may be necessary.''\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Did I hear the Senator correctly in describing this \nas a kind of foreign aid bill, at least to some extent?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. We are paying for governments overseas. We are paying \nfor someone else's government, for their studies overseas. We are \nhelping foreign governments decide how costly it is for their citizens, \nI guess. I don't know if this is an idea to make sure--we want people \noverseas to make sure they realize how much it is costing them to \nsmoke?\n  I think we have a responsibility to people in this country, who know \nhow much it is costing them to live, to let them keep some of the money \nthey earn so they can help their families. But the $350 million a year \nthat goes into this program is something that I seriously question \nwhether we want to tax the lowest income people in America in order to \nachieve.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Am I correct in understanding that this would be a \nmassive transfer of wealth from the lower-income Americans to \ncitizens--people who are not even citizens of this country?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Most certainly. It would be taking money from low-\nincome Americans and transferring what resource they have to provide \nfor their families, a significant portion of it, and sending it to \nforeign governments so they can conduct studies about what the costs of \nsmoking are in their culture.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Am I further correct that the States that have low \nper capita income--because almost 60 percent of this will fall on those \nearning under $30,000 a year, States like Arkansas, which is ranked in \nthe lower 5 or 10 percent of income in the Nation--that this would fall \ndisproportionately upon those lower-income States?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Obviously. You know, 60 percent of all these sums are \ngoing to come from people who earn less than $30,000 a year. So States \nthat have a high population that earn in the category of less than \n$30,000 year are going to be paying far more of this than the other \nStates which have high-income individuals and are not so populated by \nindividuals who smoke.\n  Now the real correlation is, if you smoke, you are going to pay this \nincrease in taxes. It turns out that smoking is the custom, is the \nchoice--I think it is a bad one; I have never thought smoking was a \ngood choice--it is the choice of people who are low-income, and it is \nsomething they feel they choose to do. It just astounds me that only in \nWashington, DC, is a bad choice made by free people the basis for \ntaxation.\n  People are free. We haven't suggested they are not free to make this \nchoice. We just want to make it hard. We are apparently willing to make \nit hard for those people, and we are willing to do that in order to \nfund overseas programs.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Of course I appreciate that. I don't smoke. I have \nnever taken any money from any of the tobacco companies. I know anybody \nwho objects to this bill will be portrayed as being a defender of \ntobacco companies. I have never taken any.\n  But my question for the Senator would be. Has there been any study as \nto what kind of fiscal impact this would have on State and local \ngovernments? And is there a potential of it undermining the revenue \nbase that local governments would have because of the increased \ntaxation at the Federal level?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There are some interesting things that come as a result \nof this proposed tax increase.\n  No. 1, it would mean that the Federal Government profited more than \nany other entity or institution from smoking in this culture. We would \nhave more benefit from smoking than any of the companies would in \nprofit. So the\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nFederal Government would become the No. 1 beneficiary of tobacco use in \nthe country.\n  No. 2, if there is a serious black market problem with contraband \ncigarettes, then that changes a number of calculations. One of the \nthings it will change is, if people go into the black market on \ncigarettes sales, they not only don't pay their Federal tax, which is \nthis additional $1.50 that is being proposed here today per pack, but \nthey will also not be paying the State tax. You can't imagine some \ncontraband person saying, ``We are going to go ahead and pay all the \nState taxes on these contraband cigarettes, but we are not going to pay \nthe Federal tax.''\n  So it might well be if the black market develops a sense of intensity \nand there is a substantial velocity in the black market, that money \nwhich had previously been paid to States by cigarette marketers, that \nmoney from those packs that are no longer being sold in the open market \nbut are being sold in the black market, States could lose that revenue \nstream which they now have from the legitimate sale of cigarettes.\n  It should be noted that there is already a black market problem in \ncigarettes because of different State levels and just because the tax \nis so high. This would probably--frankly, it might serve to make \nmillionaires out of some people who are already dabbling in the black \nmarket for cigarettes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If the Senator will yield for one final question, as \nI listened to his comments, they reflected my own feelings--his concern \nabout low-income Americans. It struck me that those who have professed \nto be the greatest defenders of the poor are those who seem to be the \nproponents of this massive tax increase upon working poor Americans. \nBut the Earned-Income Tax Credit Program is a program designed to \nassist those who are working Americans, low-income working Americans, \nto prevent them from falling into dependency and being on the welfare \nsystem.\n  Is there anything in this base bill that would, in a sense, \ncompensate those low-income working Americans who are going to see this \nvery confiscatory tax imposed upon them through this dramatic increase \nin the price of cigarettes, to assist them in reforming the EITC \nProgram or in some way offsetting these additional taxes that they will \nbe paying? Or is this an absolute, real loss of consumable income for \nthose who are most poor in our society?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. This is a very good question. I thank the Senator for \nasking it. These are hardworking people, struggling. They get up early \nin the day, work late at night, sometimes rely on friends and relatives \nto help care for their children. Sometimes they can afford day care; \nsometimes they can't. But, basically, this is a bill which says we are \ngoing to take their money and we are going to spend it in this kind of \nbureaucracy.\n  As I indicated, some of these bureaucracies are relabeled and they \nare not constituted independently anymore. Some of these are \nconstituted only by virtue of the fact that they are authorized for a \nSecretary, a Cabinet Secretary, to appoint. But, by and large, in the \ngrand scheme of things, this is a situation where the money goes; it \ndoes not come. And the money --there is no specific indemnity for \nindividuals who are the people who are hit by this tax. I know of \nnothing in this bill that says, for people who have a very serious \nconsequence as a result of this tax, we are going to mitigate it in \nsome way. It is simply not there.\n\n  Frankly, we have to be honest. The proponents want to impose this tax \nto make it very difficult for people to smoke. But for people who are \naddicted, it will be more difficult for them to stop. And that is why \nthey can presume that we will be collecting these hundreds and hundreds \nand hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nthe kinds of inquiries that he raised. They go right to the heart of \nthe issue. This tax is focused on the lowest-income individuals in the \nUnited States, people who have the least capacity to pay. Frequently, \npeople making in the $30,000 range will be young people. They haven't \ngotten their incomes up high. They are the people with children in \ntheir families, so they need to be able to provide for those children. \nThey need to be able to make sure they are cared for. They need to try \nto start putting something away so those kids can someday go to \ncollege. Instead of allowing them to put something away, we are going \nto take something away.\n  For a two-pack-a-day family, that is $803 we are going to take away. \nPardon me, that is under the $1.10 figure; that is not under the $1.50 \nfigure. For a three-pack-a-day family, that will take you over $100 a \nmonth we are going to take away so that the family can't put it away \nfor when they have needs. Frequently, in many of these families, they \nare not in a position to put anything away. These are families \nliterally making it from check to check, and we are intending to come \nin and make this kind of substantial demand on them.\n  The bill requires States to have massive licensing schemes for \nretailers who sell tobacco products. So there will be significant new \nbureaucracies at the State level. These are just examples of \nbureaucracy in this bill. I want to mention that just once more. One of \nthe strongest aspects of this bill is the States will be eligible to \nreceive a total of $100 million a year in compliance grants if they \nreach a certain level where kids are unable to purchase tobacco \nproducts.\n  Then it requires States to give out part of those funds to retailers \nwith outstanding compliance records. Let me make it clear. It currently \nis illegal for a minor to purchase tobacco products in every State of \nthe Union. However, Congress is now establishing a program of \nbureaucracy to reward retailers for following the law. I think it is \npretty clear that this is the kind of double whammy that Government too \nfrequently has. It is against the law in the States for retailers to \nsell cigarettes to youngsters, and now we are going to have a special \nincentive program paying large amounts of money, up to $100 million a \nyear, if the retailers will only abide by the law.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was presiding the other day, and I want to make sure I \nunderstood you correctly. You drew a relationship between our tax \nreductions that we were able to pass last year that we all went home \nand were so proud of--and we are talking about the child credit, and we \nare talking about the estate tax changes, relating that to the tax \nincrease under certain assumptions. I would like to have you repeat \nthat for my benefit.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the facts are these: That this massive tax on \npoor people in the United States would more than wipe out the entire \ntax cut passed last year, and that is at the assumption level of $1.10 \na pack--not at the assumption level of $1.50 a pack, which is the \nKennedy proposal.\n  I want to make it clear that I am against the $1.10-a-pack increase, \nnot because it is an increase on the tobacco companies, but precisely \nbecause it is not. This is not a tax or an injury to the tobacco \ncompanies; this is something that is required of the consumer.\n  What I am saying is that we would collect so much money--even at \n$1.10 a pack--from people that it would totally erase last year's tax \nrelief.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If you will yield further, you are talking about the \nchild tax credit, you are talking about the education incentives, the \nestate and gift tax reductions, the IRA exemptions, the corporate AMT \nreductions--all of these would be offset in terms of a tax increase?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The family kinds of things, the capital gains sort of \nthings--these are the things that would be totally wiped out by the \nadditional collections which would be mandated under this bill. They \nare mandated that they be collected from, basically, the poorest people \nin the culture--60 percent, basically, under $30,000. It would mean \nthat over time, over the last 2 years, we would have had a tax increase \nnot a tax decrease.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If you will yield further, I think so often we talk about \nthe fact that 54 percent of the taxes would be paid by people with \nincomes under $30,000 a year. We forget sometimes to mention that only \n3.7 percent of the tax will be borne by those with incomes over \n$115,000, which I think is very significant.\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\n  I ask you this question since you represent the fine State of \nMissouri and I represent your neighboring State of Oklahoma. I had an \nexperience and I just want to see if Missouri is anything like \nOklahoma.\n  Over the last 10 days, I have had 3 days of townhall meetings \nthroughout the State. As you know, I am active in aviation. I have all \nthese townhall meetings at airports. With 20 meetings in 3 days--that \nwas kind of a record for me, because normally I do five a day--not one \ntime in one townhall meeting, in Watonga, OK, in Oklahoma City, in \nMiami, OK, right up on your border, or anyplace in Oklahoma, did anyone \nbring up the subject of the tobacco bill.\n  I brought it up in about half those meetings just because nobody had \nasked the question about this tobacco bill. Then when I talked to them \nabout it, they said they had read about it and they said, ``We're \nopposed to it.''\n  In Oklahoma, in those meetings, there was not one hand that went up \nwhen I asked, ``Is there anyone here who is in support of this tobacco \ntax increase in this tobacco bill?'' Not one.\n  Is there something unusual about Oklahoma, or could it be that this \nis really a beltway issue? Have you tested your people in Missouri on \nthis?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My encounter has been this: First of all, the bill is \nnot raised, but when people find out that instead of punishing the \ntobacco companies, we are taxing tobacco users, so that an individual \nwho earns less than $30,000 a year, if he is a two-pack-a-day smoker, \nhe is going to pay an additional $803 in taxes, they don't understand \nthat. They say, ``Wait a second, if you are trying to punish evil \ntobacco companies, if that is your objective, punish the companies but \ndon't punish hard-working Americans who are struggling to make ends \nmeet.''\n  My phones have begun to ring when people began to understand that \nthis is not a circumstance where we are going to try to punish the \ntobacco companies to that extent. The real punishment comes because \nthis law requires--this law forbids the tobacco company from taking any \nof this tax out of its earnings--it requires the company to ``pass it \non.''\n  What is interesting, it is even more anomalous than that. The tobacco \ncompany collects this $109 billion in the next 5 years, or whatever it \nis, and turns it into the Government, and we give them a tax deduction \nfor it so that they end up having a $36 billion subsidy that comes back \nfor their having, basically, been involved in the collection of this \nsum of payment to the Government.\n  My own view is that when people find out this bill really is a bill \nagainst hard-working Americans and it is a tax measure, that is when we \nare going to start hearing more about it. People thought this was \nantitobacco. There are some things in the bill that distress the \ntobacco companies, but, frankly, I am more distressed about what we do \nfor them--shutting down their liability, cutting it off. I think it is \nwrong to say that there is a certain amount that they can be liable for \nand no more.\n  You don't have any guarantees against lawsuits as a citizen. If you \ndo things that are wrong, people can sue you. There is no limit to what \ncan be collected against you if you do things that are wrong. This bill \nputs clear limits in for the tobacco companies, basically saying no \nmatter what you do, you can only have this much money awarded against \nyou in court.\n  So no matter how many people are affected, whether it is cancer or \nemphysema, lung disease, heart disease, no matter how much it is that \nthe courts might allocate against you, we are going to lock down the \nthing in this bill, we are going to provide a limitation.\n  Some people don't understand. Originally, they thought this was anti-\ntobacco companies, and the companies are upset with them, but there are \nlots of things in here which are procompany and they are really \nanticonsumer.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is interesting.\n  Let me ask just one more question, if I might, because I haven't \nheard it in this debate actually coming up. I had an experience. Over \nthe Easter recess, I went on a missionary trip over to west Africa to \nTogo, Nigeria, Benin, and that area. I thought it was the appropriate \nthing to do, to go over and talk about Jesus on the Easter break.\n  The international publications I saw when I changed planes in Paris \ngoing down over the Sahara Desert and then again coming out of the \nMiddle East, had articles--this is, what, 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago--\narticles on what a great boom our tobacco bill in this country is going \nto do for their tobacco industries. They were referring to both legal \nand illegal, I suspect. But has anybody looked at the effect that this \nwould have on the economies of those areas where they would be direct \nbeneficiaries of what we do here if this thing should pass?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is clear that there has been inadequate \nexamination. This bill hasn't had the kind of scoring that normally \nattends a bill. This bill was rushed and changed. The ink was not dry \non the changes when the bill was submitted.\n  Virtually no one had read the entire bill when it was offered. And we \nare now in this debate on the bill. And that is why I am willing to \ntake the kind of time we are taking to discuss it.\n  It was suggested yesterday that this massive tax increase would be \nconcluded, that we would know what we were going to do on it because \nthey were going to have a motion to table, and that motion to table \nwould end this debate.\n  I just do not think when you have this kind of massive Government--a \n17-agency creation; $868 billion--that you rush through. I think it is \nclear we need to have the kind of thorough discussion, discussion that \nwould allow us to debate the issues.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Lastly, I just ask if your office has received the same thing our \noffice has. We count letters when they come in and we read these \nletters from people who have picked up notions on this thing. And they \nare running right now in Oklahoma to my office--this is the district \noffices in Oklahoma as well as the office here--about 10 to 1 against \nthis massive takeover by the Federal Government. And one of the major \nconcerns they say is, ``What's next?'' You know, it is tobacco today. \nThen alcohol? Then fatty foods? Or what is going to be next?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Fatty foods I am worried about. I eat so many of them \nand I do not want them to take away burgers.\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. The last thing I mention is, I read an article in the \nWall Street Journal, I think last week, that talked about the nations \nthat have actually had this happen, causing great increases in taxes to \ntry to stop that particular habit--Denmark, Sweden, so forth--and that \nthe result has been they have had to repeal those tax increases in \nalmost every case.\n  Are you aware of that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. The debate this morning really helped, I think, to \nclarify the issue, that in England, for example, it is said that half \nof all cigarettes are sold on the black market.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Senator Hutchinson just asked me a very important \nquestion. If we drive things into black market sales, then States which \nhave been relying on reasonable tobacco taxes as a funding stream--if \nthe tobacco sales go into the black market and underground, we actually \nmake it very difficult for those States to continue with their programs \nbecause we will deprive them of the same stream.\n  America has seen the kind of chaos that can come to law enforcement \nwhen we condition people to do things that are illegal because \nGovernment gets so invasive and heavyhanded.\n  And if we condition people to be involved in illegal activities, \nwhere we have inordinate unjustifiable taxes that are imposed on \nconsumers, and we prepare them and teach them to be involved in the \nblack market, it is a lesson which we will regret having taught for a \nlong, long time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I applaud the Senator for taking the leadership to stop \nthis from happening. And I appreciate your yielding for questions.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and really appreciate \nthe questions which he propounds because they get to the heart of the \nmatter. And I appreciate also the fact that you have relayed your \nexperience with your town hall meetings.\n  No other Senator in the U.S. Senate, I would venture to say, no other \npublic official, deals with the public as intimately and aggressively \nas you do. You\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nknow, five town hall meetings a day, hopping from airport to airport; \nof course no other Senator that I know of has flown a light plane \naround the world on his own. I know that John Glenn has orbited the \nEarth. But you have stopped and talked to people most everywhere and \ncertainly in Oklahoma.\n  So I thank you for bringing that particular item to our attention.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would only respond by saying that I think I have told \nSenator Glenn, I may have more hours than he has, but he has a lot more \nmiles.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am sure that is the case. I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I just want to say this question of the black market is a very \nserious question.\n  If we aggravate the already tender situation which exists regarding \nthe smuggling of cigarettes, we could literally create a very serious \nproblem. And the problem not only relates to the loss of revenue to the \nGovernment, but it is also an issue that would and could be a problem \nwhich moves the black market in cigarettes from the sort of commercial \narea where black market cigarettes now are sold to stores and then the \nstores illegally sell cigarettes that have not had the right taxes paid \non them. It could move it into the general population.\n  If we start teaching young people that they can buy cigarettes \ncheaply on the black market, and they start to do things like that, it \nis, in my judgment, a very, very, very serious problem in terms of what \nwe have taught and what we have conditioned in this culture.\n  Furthermore, if we move the black market into sort of a retail \nsituation--and I have some awareness of this because when I was \nGovernor of my State, we had a significant cigarette tax, at least \ncompared to neighboring States. There is some tobacco grown in \nMissouri, but very, very little. But we border on serious tobacco \nStates, like Kentucky and Tennessee. And those States had very low tax \nrates. We had substantially higher tax rates. There were lots of \ncigarettes that came across the border of our States, but they really \nwere not sold on the retail market. They were sold to folks who would \nsell them in stores with phony tax stamps and the like.\n  But if we get to the point where we are going to have black market \ncigarettes sold in retail, and we condition young people to start \nsaying that ``I can break the law here,'' there are two consequences. \nOne, that is a very bad thing to get young people into. Two, those who \nare willing to break the law, to retail market substances which are \nillegal to sell to youngsters, probably will be selling other \nsubstances. So they may well be selling drugs, and they may say to the \nyoungsters, ``What do you want? I have cigarettes. I have marijuana. I \nhave drugs.'' And if you drive the price of cigarettes up \nsubstantially, it begins to make the price differential far less. So I \nhave very serious reservations about what we might do in terms of a \nblack market.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would be pleased to yield for a question to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you for yielding.\n  I appreciate the vast amount of knowledge that you have shared. And I \nhave actually a series of questions that I would like to have answered \nin regard to the bill. And like I say, I have been very impressed at \nall the knowledge.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I hope I can answer these questions.\n  Mr. ENZI. I recognize you do not have a laptop in which you can store \nall this vast information; you are using strictly the computer there. \nBut I have some concerns, and I would like to know what you think on \nthese concerns.\n  When I was out in Wyoming this last weekend, one of the State \nSenators there brought me the question--he said, ``Now during the last \nsession of the legislature, we looked at putting a 15-cent a pack''--\nthat is 15, not 50--``cent a pack tax on cigarettes in our State. And \nthat would raise $8 million a year for us. And now I hear Congress \ntalking about''--and at the time his knowledge was only on the $1.10, \nnot the much higher $1.50; it was $1.10 a pack--``and out of the $1.10 \na pack,'' which of course will be levied on Wyoming just the same way \nthe 15-cent a pack would be levied, ``our State will get $6 million.''\n  He is a little bit concerned about where all the revenue might be \ngoing. How could there be a miscalculation of that magnitude on the \namount of funds that would be delivered by this? He has done extensive \nresearch into it. And I have to say that causes some concern for me, \ntoo--when 15 cents a pack will produce $8 million and $1.10 will only \nproduce $6 million.\n  I guess maybe you might interpret that the $1.50 increase is to bring \nthat up to $8 million for us. But that sounds like a poor way to do \nbusiness.\n  Could it be that the $1.50 costs so much to collect, coming back \nhere, so much gets held by the bureaucracy, that we are only going to \nget $6 million bucks out of $1.10?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would venture to say the State of Wyoming does not \nhave a foreign aid program under the guise of the cigarette tax. So you \nwill not have a program to develop an awareness overseas of the costs \nof smoking.\n  One of the things that is in the international aspect of the bill we \nhave here is that money will be taken, hundreds of millions of dollars \nevery year will be sent to help foreign governments trying to decide \nwhat the cost of smoking is in their culture. I just don't think it is \nvery likely that the Wyoming House of Representatives and Senate, which \nyou presided over at one time, would be making that kind--the answer \nis, that is just a small part of what we are doing here.\n\n  I admit the foreign aid is not a big part of this bill, but there are \n17 new boards and commissions in the Federal Government, specific and \ncategoric programs, and this isn't designed to provide income to the \nStates. This is really a program that will provide income to the \nFederal Government. It will provide massive amounts of income to trial \nattorneys. It will provide serious income to tobacco farmers. If the \none aspect of this bill goes through, it will give them about $18,000 \nan acre for their allotments. Of course, farmers don't even own the \nallotments. In a lot of cases, it is owned by someone else. Most of the \nlands could be bought for far less than $18,000 an acre.\n  We are in a situation where this is a Federal measure which is going \nto support everything from foreign aid to trial lawyers and Federal \nprograms. It is no wonder it won't do Wyoming good.\n  Mr. ENZI. I need to ask how people would expect me to support $1.10 a \npack when the State legislature looked at 15 cents a pack totally \ndedicated to health and turned that down.\n  This one, as you mentioned, has all of these other ramifications. I \nknow that one of the ramifications is to cut down on teen smoking. So I \nhave addressed that in a number of trips I have made to the State. I \ntried to visit schools on Friday, and I am in Wyoming most of the time. \nI wonder how $1.10 is going to cause any concern. After all, kids will \npay $50 for a pair of tennis shoes--I actually said $50 to see if \npeople were paying attention. They will pay $150--I was in the shoe \nbusiness for 28 years--$150 for a pair of tennis shoes. The parents \ncan't afford it, but the kids can. In talking to these kids, they \nseemed to think that $1.10 a pack would be a deterrent for a few days \nuntil they realized how they were going to raise the other $1.10 a pack \nand maybe smoke one cigarette less, but probably not smoke cigarettes \nless.\n  These kids asked me, and I want to ask you, how the price of a pack \nof cigarettes going up will deter smoking when the cost of marijuana is \nextremely high and there is no indication of it going down and there is \nstill an increase in marijuana smoking. That is all black market. So if \nwe think we are doing an elimination of the black market, that creates \na great deal of concern to me, and apparently to you. I ask the Senator \nto give me some kind of an indication of whether the Senator thinks \nthat price will make a difference.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for the question. This \nwas the subject of a very serious set of questions that were propounded \nby the Senator from Utah earlier today. He literally went through the \nstudies that have been presented by the administration and the studies \nthat are being used to support the demand for a $1.50-a-pack increase, \nthe demands being\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nmade by Senator Kennedy in his proposal. Those individuals are not \nsatisfied with $1.10 a pack. They want to take it up to $1.50 a pack as \na tax increase.\n  Frankly, when you look at all the data, you can look at part of the \ngraph and it looks like it reinforces what is being said about smoking \ngoing down when you increase the price. Price--CBO seriously questions \nprice in terms of whether elasticity of demand depends on price. They \nraise a serious question about that, and they cite studies to challenge \nit. Of course, there isn't any elasticity in demand when a person is \naddicted.\n  So for the poor people of America who have been smoking and are \nsmoking, we are basically going to trap them, so that a poor person, \neven at the $1.10 level which is in the bill now--Senator Kennedy wants \nto move it to $1.50 per pack--at $1.10, that is two packs a day at $800 \na year. Poor people cannot afford to take that out of the family \nbudget. You sit around the kitchen table and say: What are we going to \nbe able to do this year? Can we get the new refrigerator? We need this, \nthat, or the other.\n  If we walk in and say, the first thing we have to do is take $803 out \nof your budget, it restricts the capacities of families to operate. So \nnot only are we threatening to do something that could hurt governments \nbut we will undermine the capacities of families to support themselves.\n  I think it is tragic when resources are consumed in smoking. I have \nnever smoked cigarettes. I don't believe it is a good investment. But \npeople are free to do that. I am not here to tell them what their life \nis and how they can operate. But for us to simply say we will hit the \nlow-income people of America with $400 if they are one-pack-a-day, $800 \nin new taxes if they are two-packs-a-day people, or if we are talking \nabout what the Kennedy proposal is, to give yourself basically a 40-\npercent increase on that, it is an amazing bite that we will ask to \ntake out of the disposable income of people.\n  Mr. ENZI. Let me ask another question that deals with this, \nparticularly with the kids smoking, because we have been trying to get \nat this problem of kids smoking for some time now.\n  I know the Senator is as distressed as I am that 3,000 kids a day are \nstarting this life-threatening addiction. Although I wonder if you know \nmore about where those estimates come from, because as far as I can \ntell, they are estimates, as is the percentage, that this will drop. We \nare talking about a 60-percent drop in youth smoking, and I think that \nis based on Larry Summers, Deputy Treasury Summers, when he said a 10-\npercent increase in the pack of cigarettes would produce a 7-percent \nreduction in the number of children who smoke. We seem to be going with \nthe theory that if you raise it high enough, it will get to zero. That \ndoesn't seem to equate with anything else that is happening.\n  I ask the Senator if he has seen--probably not--the latest issue of \nthe George Washington University magazine.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have not.\n  Mr. ENZI. A magazine put out by a university. I am a graduate of \nthat, so I think it is the premier university of the District.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will not respond to that question with an \naffirmative, but I will respect the institution.\n  Mr. ENZI. The feature of this month's magazine is actually called \n``Smoke Signals,'' and it is about the terrible rise in smoking on \nuniversity campuses. Now we are above the teenage level. We are talking \nabout a group who are more educated than other people. It would seem \nthat they ought to know more about smoking than the others. Obviously \nthey don't, because even though the rules of the university are \nincreasing, the amount of smoking is also increasing.\n  They have done a fairly extensive interview session with students \nfrom the university to find out what the causes are, why it is going \nup. It ranges from rebelliousness to all-out addiction, to a number of \nother things.\n  I ask if the Senator would be willing to have the article from the \nmagazine printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From GW Magazine, Spring 1998]\n\n                             Smoke Signals\n\n                            (By Jared Sher)\n\n       When it comes to smoking, America's colleges and \n     universities have come a long way since 1877--the year \n     Dartmouth forced its scholarship students to sign a pledge \n     not to spend any money on liquor, tobacco, dancing or \n     billiards.\n       Today, college students have the freedom to indulge in all \n     of those. Increasingly, they're doing just that, especially \n     when it comes to cigarettes and cigars. The recent rise in \n     the number of students who say they light up has some \n     educators and medical professionals fuming.\n       According to an annual survey of college freshmen conducted \n     by researchers at UCLA, more than 16 percent of the nation's \n     first-year students said they had smoked in the past year. \n     While that's not quite an epidemic, there's concern because \n     the 1998 mark is the highest in nearly 30 years. That 16 \n     percent is a significant surge after the mid-1980s, when the \n     percentage dipped into single digits for four straight years.\n       Not only are the numbers rising; they are doing so after \n     decades of clear medical evidence that smoking can kill. \n     Despite all the warning signs, America's youth are picking up \n     the habit with little regard for the potential long-term \n     health hazards.\n       Such is the case at GW as well. Although no studies have \n     been conducted to determine the exact number of smokers, \n     campus watchdogs believe the figure to be close to--and \n     perhaps higher than--the national average.\n       Smokers remain a fixture in Foggy Bottom. Even though \n     smoking is banned in all University buildings except \n     residence halls, cigarettes are readily available from street \n     vendors as well as the Marvin Center convenience store. And \n     students--as well as faculty and staff members--can often be \n     seen puffing away on the front steps of Gelman Library, or \n     just while walking down the street.\n       So why do GW students continue a habit they know is \n     dangerous? The reasons range from rebelliousness to an all-\n     out addiction that is extremely difficult to overcome, \n     especially in a high-stress academic environment. Most \n     students acknowledge the dangers of smoking, but many say \n     they can and will quit before the health risks become a long-\n     term threat to them.\n       ``It's the immortality issue. Young people don't think \n     they're mortal,'' says Matthew Sokolowski, BA '97, education \n     coordinator at the Jewish Historical Society of Greater \n     Washington. Sokolowski started smoking when he was 10 or 11, \n     having picked up the habit in the Boy Scouts. He thinks \n     younger smokers often are ignorant of the risks. ``It's only \n     people who are 45 or 50 getting sick, so you think, `Oh, I \n     can smoke as much as I want.' '' Now he admits he is \n     addicted, and trying to quit is extremely difficult. \n     Sokolowski has devised his own program for quitting, whereby \n     he steadily decreases the number of cigarettes he allows \n     himself to buy. ``I knew I wasn't going to be able to quit in \n     college,'' he says, because the stress levels were simply too \n     high.\n       That's been a problem for a number of GW smokers, many of \n     whom say they started smoking simply to socialize, but now \n     are stuck with the habit. While they all recognized the \n     health hazards that are all-too-apparent these days, ``the \n     addiction outweighs it,'' according to Zeid Sabella, a senior \n     from Jordan.\n\n\n                          ``i've got to quit''\n\n       ``Every day you say, `I want to quit, I've got to quit,' '' \n     he says, ``but you never do.'' He says smoking has taken its \n     toll on him physically already, a problem he notices every \n     time he tries to climb a flight of stairs and has trouble \n     breathing. ``I can't even jog a mile anymore.''\n       Some students began smoking in high school or junior high \n     just to fit in. Federal data show that the number of high \n     school smokers is growing dramatically.\n       Other GW undergraduates, like sophomore Molly Bell, from \n     Highland, Mich., picked up the habit almost by accident. ``I \n     think it had to do with my mom. She said, `You want to smoke, \n     let's go get some cigarettes,' '' Bell recalls. ``Then I just \n     started after that, even though her point was to get me not \n     to smoke, like I'd smoke so much I'd puke or something. It \n     didn't work.'' She was 15 at the time; she has now been \n     smoking for four years.\n       Once her parents realized their plan had backfired, they \n     tried to get her to quit. They even put her on a nicotine \n     patch. ``But every time I'd leave the house, I'd rip it off \n     and put it on my dashboard,'' she says. Ultimately, she says, \n     no physical remedy will work until the smoker is mentally \n     ready to quit.\n       Still, Bell remains confident that she'll quit once she \n     leaves school. ``I'm going to stop when I'm trying to \n     conceive. At that point I'll be able to because I won't want \n     to screw up my kids.'' One motivating factor: Her aunt smoked \n     while she was pregnant, and when the baby was born, it had to \n     be placed on a respirator.\n       ``I can't imagine quitting, and I don't know if I ever \n     will,'' laments 21-year-old junior Danielle Marcelli from \n     Philadelphia. Marcelli first tried a cigarette when she was \n     15 and hanging out with friends. Now, she too is addicted and \n     smokes one-and-a-half packs a day. ``I didn't think it was \n     bad because my whole family did it.''\n       Tobacco companies and Congress are discussing legislation \n     through which the companies would pay more than $300 billion \n     to help gain protection from lawsuits. Speculating on the \n     price hike that could accompany such legislation, Marcelli \n     says, ``Sometimes I say that if they really do raise it to\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\n     $4 a pack, then I'll quit.'' But she reflects for a moment \n     and changes her mind. ``I would probably get a job if I had \n     to support it, if it came down to it.''\n       Her roommate, Angel Fischer, tried her first cigarette when \n     she was just seven years old. She says that she is not \n     addicted, but she smokes anyway. She doesn't worry about \n     health risks, especially since she says she can quit at any \n     time. ``I think about it with my father, I don't think about \n     it with myself, because he's older and he's got that horrible \n     cough,'' Fischer says. ``I don't think I'll ever get to that \n     stage. I just have them when I'm out late.''\n       Fischer adds that the stress of a school environment helps \n     explain why so many students smoke. ``You can ask the same \n     questions about drinking or drugs or sex. Especially in \n     college with all the stress. Around midterms, it's like give \n     me cigarettes now!'' she says.\n       Senior Anne Henderson, 21, says she is ``surprised how many \n     young people do smoke, considering they know the dangers.'' \n     Nonetheless, she has been smoking on and off for five years. \n     ``It has to do with lifestyle. I do it on a social level. A \n     lot of social activity revolves around smoking. It does calm \n     my nerves, especially when I'm stressed out.''\n       She too is confident that she'll be able to quit when she \n     graduates. ``I'm not worried about when I'm 80,'' she says.\n\n\n                         a surprising increase\n\n       ``We feel like we've been seeing a lot of smoking on \n     campus,'' says Susan Haney, outreach coordinator for the \n     Student Health Service. ``It's alarming to see an increase.''\n       Experts agree that it's surprising to see increasing \n     numbers of people taking up a habit that any doctor will tell \n     you has a good chance of killing you. They also agree that \n     two factors impede efforts to stop smoking before it starts \n     among teenagers in America's junior high and high schools.\n       First of all, ``young people see themselves as impenetrable \n     fortresses, believing that they will live long and prosper,'' \n     according to LeNorman Strong, GW's assistant vice president \n     for Student and Academic Support Services' Special \n     Services. ``Their sense of being invulnerable is a major \n     challenge to educating them to make safe and healthy \n     choices of lifestyle.''\n       Secondly, messages regarding the dangers of smoking are not \n     reaching enough children. Too often, the content of a message \n     is aimed at getting people to stop smoking once they have \n     already started. Not enough attention is being paid to \n     preventing people from taking up the habit in the first \n     place.\n       ``A lot of the education has been geared toward adults, not \n     youngsters,'' says Strong, who until last August was GW's \n     executive director of campus life.\n       Moreover, children continue to see television and movie \n     personalities smoking on the screen, an activity that does \n     not go unnoticed when children decide to take up the habit \n     Dr. Gigi El-Gayoumi, an associate professor of internal \n     medicine at the GW Medical Center, cited a recent study that \n     showed teen-icon Winona Ryder to be the actress who smokes \n     the most on-screen, for example.\n       ``These are very powerful images,'' she says, adding that \n     the proposed tobacco deal between tobacco companies and the \n     U.S. government has as one of its major focuses ``reducing \n     teenage smoking and the targeting of advertising on \n     teenagers.''\n\n\n                   the banzhaf way: sue the bastards!\n\n       These images may have contributed to the recent increase in \n     smoking among teenagers. That, in turn, may mean more smoking \n     on campus. ``We know that smoking had previously gone down \n     considerably among older teens, but has been rising \n     dramatically over the past two or three years,'' says John \n     Banzhaf, a GW Law School professor who founded ASH (Action on \n     Smoking and Health), a public interest legal action group. \n     ``These are the people who are about to get into GW.''\n       Banzhaf, who has long been a thorn in the side of the \n     tobacco industry, has used legal action, instead of \n     persuasion and lobbying techniques, to win his battles \n     against smoking. His motto, he says, is ``Sue the bastards.'' \n     His actions are widely credited with leading to the ban on \n     tobacco advertising on television and the ban on smoking on \n     domestic airline flights.\n       He also was instrumental in the effort that ultimately \n     banned smoking in every GW academic and administrative \n     building in 1995.\n       At GW, Banzhaf has never hesitated to speak out. Once, he \n     interrupted a student-sponsored movie in the Marvin Center \n     because people in the audience were smoking in violation of \n     law. Another time, he remembers eating lunch in the \n     University Club, when he came across two fellow faculty \n     members smoking in an area that did not have a sign \n     permitting smoking. ``I almost had them arrested,'' he says. \n     They left the club just before the police arrived.\n       Each time he fought for further restrictions, he met heavy \n     resistance. ``And yet each time we've taken a step toward \n     eliminating this thing, it's worked,'' he says. When the \n     University decided to ban smoking in the vending machine area \n     on the ground level of the Marvin Center, ``people said \n     there'd be a riot if we did it.'' Suffice it to say there was \n     no riot, and for that matter very little controversy, which \n     only reinforces Banzhaf's argument.\n       ``Suddenly people began to realize there isn't a \n     requirement that you have to permit smoking,'' he says.\n\n\n                    ban smoking in residence halls?\n\n       Most GW student smokers support the smoking ban in \n     buildings, claiming the health hazards are too well known to \n     justify putting non-smokers at risk. Some, however, think the \n     ban has gone a little too far.\n       ``It's ridiculous,'' says Rany Al-Baghdadi, a senior from \n     Syria. ``There's a lot of smokers. What would it hurt non-\n     smokers to have a smoking lounge in the library or the Marvin \n     Center? Someone that's complaining about second-hand smoke \n     when he's 50 meters away from me--you know, get a life.''\n       Al-Baghadadi says that because it is so difficult to quit, \n     GW should make some accommodation for smokers. ``If it were \n     easy to quit, there wouldn't be any smokers.''\n       His friend Zeid Sabella, the senior from Jordan, disagrees, \n     ``One thing I am for is choice. A lot of people don't like \n     smoking. For example, I don't like smoking in my bedroom. I \n     stinks up the place.'' Sabella thinks it is entirely \n     justified to keep smoking out of campus buildings.\n       Sandra Falus, a sophomore from Hungary, thinks so too. ``I \n     know people who used to work in the Marvin Center Newsstand \n     when that area was the smoking section.'' She says her \n     friends had to quit their jobs because they suffered from \n     exposure to second-hand smoke. She adds that since most \n     smokers know what they are doing is unhealthy, they don't \n     feel discriminated against when they have to smoke outdoors.\n       Molly Bell says: ``As long as they don't ban it in the \n     dorms, there won't be an outcry.''\n       In fact, the last bastions for GW smokers have been the \n     residence halls, which remain islands of smokers' rights amid \n     a sea of restrictions. GW officials say the rationale behind \n     keeping the housing smoker-friendly is privacy, and the \n     differing rights of people in their homes versus their \n     workplaces.\n       ``There is regular discussion about banning smoking in \n     residential rooms, and it is often generated by students,'' \n     says GW administrator LeNorman Strong, but ``that's private \n     space. While the University does have some rights as a \n     landlord, we work hard to protect the privacy of students.''\n       Banzhaf is not certain that's enough of a reason to allow \n     the behavior to continue. ``I'm sure if someone wanted to \n     clean his bicycle with benzine in his dorm room, he wouldn't \n     be allowed,'' he says.\n       As for the legality of a smoking ban in residence halls, \n     Linda J. Schutjer, GW's assistant general counsel, is not \n     confident it would survive a challenge by current residents. \n     ``It's an issue of workplace versus where you live,'' she \n     says, adding that a ban in the dorms would likely do nothing \n     to stem the tide of smoking. ``It seems to me smoking is not \n     against the law, and if people want to come here and smoke, \n     there should be some accommodation made for that.''\n       Student Health Service's Haney, who is also a family nurse \n     practitioner, agrees. ``I'm not really sure a ban is going to \n     help. I don't think anybody's going to quit to come into a \n     residence hall,'' she says, suggesting that students would \n     sooner seek out off-campus housing than quit smoking.\n       Another area of concern to smoking opponents on campus is \n     the Marvin Center convenience store, which sells cigarettes. \n     Students are allowed to purchase products from the store \n     using their meal cards. Although Schutjer says it is against \n     policy to sell cigarettes on the meal card, it happens \n     anyway.\n       Despite all the controversy, smoking has not gone away. \n     Even in areas where it's banned, says Schutjer, ``I'm not \n     saying people aren't smoking. They're not supposed to be. We \n     still get occasional complaints.'' The University takes steps \n     to stop violators that may range from suspension to \n     dismissal. Recently, one employee of the GW Medical Center \n     was dismissed when he refused to stop his workplace habit in \n     the basement of the GW Hospital.\n       Smoking education lags significantly behind other areas, \n     such as AIDS and alcohol-abuse education. Nevertheless, both \n     educators and medical professionals at GW have committed \n     themselves to renewed vigilance in helping smokers quit. \n     Haney says that clinicians at the Student Health Service \n     always make a point of asking about smoking when they take \n     patient histories. If they come across a smoker, the \n     clinicians make it clear that there are readily available \n     resources--such as the patch--that can facilitate quitting.\n       ``We try to make people aware that we're there for them. We \n     don't want to badger them, but we don't want, by not saying \n     anything, to let someone think we condone smoking or don't \n     think it's a health issue,'' says Haney.\n       It's important for smokers to figure out for themselves why \n     they smoke, Haney says. Only then can they find a successful \n     method for quitting. She adds that Student Health is looking \n     into reviving smoking-cessation programs here in a joint \n     effort with the American Lung Association. Last Nov. 20, as \n     part of the American Cancer Society's Great American \n     Smokeout, Student Health offered ``Butts for Bubbles''--an \n     exchange of cigarette packs for bubble liquid--at a table \n     outside J Street.\n       Ultimately, Haney would like to conduct a thorough survey \n     to find how many smokers GW has and what their demographics \n     are--in other words, ``whom we should be targeting,'' she \n     says.\n       ``Smoking is something that needs to take priority.''\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I was fascinated to note that one of the people interviewed \nin this, one of the professors at GW is the person who founded ASH, the \nAction on Smoking and Health group, that I know from my days as mayor \nof Gillette has been very active in discouraging smoking, and their \nadvocacy has been on antismoking ads.\n  I ask the Senator if he reflects a little bit on what the effect of \nthe antismoking ads might be. They went to ads; they went to \nbillboards. I have a plastic sign in my office that thanks visitors for \nnot smoking. They also had a number of very clever slogans. I am not \nsure whether the Senator might have heard them. Some of them were very \ndisgusting and had people in disgusting situations that were smoking, \nall to curb, particularly, teen smoking. I think that has had some \neffect. It had some effect on members of my family. I think that it did \nhelp to cut down some of the teen smoking. But I would like to ask you \nwhat you think the effects on doing the antismoking would--how well \nthose would work on particularly teenagers as opposed to, or in \nconjunction with--whichever way you would care to answer it--a rise in \nprice of tobacco?\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Well, I think there are ways to discourage smoking. I \nthink the most effective discouragement is when parents work with their \nchildren, just like with drugs. I think that is the best way for \nparents to make sure their children don't smoke. Obviously, there are \nthings that we can do in government to help. A number of States and \nlocal governments have literally made it illegal for youngsters to be \nin possession of tobacco, just like they have made it illegal for \nyoungsters to be in possession of alcohol in certain settings. I think \nthose are the options.\n  One of the things I say in response to your question--because the \nSenator addresses the issue of 3,000 a day--is that the 3,000-a-day \nfigure, in my judgment, underestimates the number of kids who try \ncigarettes a day. I have heard estimates as high as 6,000.\n  What is interesting to me is that the drug czar, Gen. McCaffrey, \nindicates that 8,000 youngsters a day try illegal drugs. We are here \nwith an administration that wants to impose a tax of $868 billion on \nbasically low-income people in the United States to work on smoking, \nbut there is a notable absence in this administration in terms of what \nit wants to do about drugs. The most eloquent thing this administration \nhas been able to utter about drugs is, ``I didn't inhale.'' The second \nmost eloquent thing was on MTV where the President said, ``If I had to \ndo it over again, I would inhale.''\n  Now, when you have the President of the United States talking about \ninhaling drugs, I don't think that goes very far toward stopping people \nfrom smoking cigarettes. We have to be careful that we don't get our \npriorities out of whack so that we drive the price of cigarettes up or \ndrive cigarettes into a black-market situation where they will be \noffered as part of a menu of illegal drugs, where students and young \npeople in the culture might not only become acclimated and accustomed \nto dealing with black-market figures, which would be a very bad lesson \nto teach, but it would also, perhaps, introduce people to drug use as \nmuch as it does with cigarette use.\n  I firmly believe that cigarette use is deleterious, bad for your \nhealth. Frankly, everybody knows that. King James, the guy who directed \nthe translation of the Bible hundreds of years ago, admonished the \npeople of England that this stuff is bad for you, that it is not good \nfor you, it is bad for your health. We have known it, and there are a \nlot of things that are true about cigarette ads. I don't approve of \nthem and I don't like them appealing to our children. But let's also \nunderstand that most young people who start with cigarettes know it is \nnot good for their health.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am kind of fascinated that on our desks, \nevery day throughout the session, we get a copy of whatever bill is \nbeing debated, even if it is the same one being debated the day before; \nand if we take it back to our office, another one miraculously appears \nthe next day, in spite of the amount of paper involved with that and, \nas a plug for a computer, don't you think it would cut down on the \namount of paper if we could utilize a computer on the floor? That is \nnot really my question. This is a 753-page bill that is appearing on \nour desks. I know that you are aware that this isn't even the bill we \nare debating.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the fact that this is constantly in flux. \nAs a matter of fact, we talk about the absence of dry ink on so many \nthings that we consider here. When you are talking about a $868 billion \ntax increase, I think we ought to at least see dry ink before we vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, I have to agree. I want to ask, since this is 753 \npages, and there is another newer version that is 482 pages--\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. This is the newer version. This one isn't bound. I \ndon't know how many pages we have here, but it would be a real task, \nand to rush through something like that would be a disservice to the \nAmerican people, particularly those who would pay the huge increases in \ntaxes.\n  Mr. ENZI. The bill we are debating is the 753-page one, which \nmiraculously appears on our desks, even though the 482-page bill, which \nhas significant revisions in it, isn't available to us without a \nspecial request, and this appears to be the official version. But \nwhether it is 753 pages or 482 pages, it is a great deal for us to \ncover, even with all of the help of our staffs.\n  So I am curious as to whether the Senator feels that there is an \nadequate coverage of all types of tobacco done in this? We keep talking \nabout cigarettes. When I was growing up, there was a period of time \nwhen my dad thought cigarettes were pretty high, so he rolled his own. \nIt is kind of a western tradition. You get a little pack of Bull Durham \nand some cigarette papers. Today, people would probably think you were \nusing illegal drugs if they saw you doing that. We are phrasing this in \nthat form, anyway. People might go back to rolling their own. But they \ntake this thin piece of paper and put a little dip in it--I watched him \ndo this so many times, but I have not smoked--and then he put the \ntobacco in there and he had to lick the piece of paper and fold it \nover, and that thin paper would then stick, and it would have the \nsemblance of a somewhat cruddy cigarette. I suspect that even though \ncigarettes are not healthy, they were probably more unhealthy. The \nadvantage was that we saved the little canvas bag that it came in, \nfilled it with sand, and used that as a sinker on our fishing lines in \nthe canyon near our home and fished for trout. The tobacco bag worked \nwell for catching trout.\n  It was years later that I learned what it was probably doing to his \nlungs and eventually did do to him. I wonder if you feel that this \nadequately covers all of the types of tobacco and places an equivalent \ntax on them. We talk about the black market, but what we are talking \nabout here is a shift from one type of tobacco to another to get a \nlower price, and even some exclusions, apparently, for small \nmanufacturing companies.\n  So is this just going to force people to ``unbundle'' their \ncompanies--that is one of the words we use around here--and form a \nwhole bunch of small companies that manufacture this to avoid the tax? \nI watched people work loopholes on tax bills when I was the chairman of \nthe Senate revenue committee in Wyoming. I knew when we were holding \nhearings that there was someone out there who, at the moment we were \ndebating the bill, already knew the loophole and they were anxious to \ngo out and benefit from that. They weren't going to share that with us.\n  So do you feel there is going to be some kind of a shift done on this \nto the other kinds of tobacco as well as to the black market?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Wyoming asks a very, very important \nquestion. Frankly, it is a question to which I do not know the answer. \nWe are still dealing with a bill that is in the process and, obviously, \nif you run the price up on one kind of smoking, you may be encouraging \nanother kind of smoking--whether you are encouraging cigarettes bought \non the black market, or whether you are encouraging a roll-your-own \nvariety. I remember those slogans that used to be used, like ``save \nyour roll and roll your own.'' But you wouldn't make a real\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nsavings in your roll if there was a disparity in the price here. My \nmain concern has been that this is not a bill that has much promise to \nbe effective.\n  You know, the administration, as late as 1996, said they were going \nto cut tobacco smoking in youngsters by 50 percent in 6 years, and they \nweren't going to require any price increase. So they were going to be \nable to cut it in half. Now they don't expect to cut it in half, but \nthey are going to get $868 billion over the next quarter century out of \nAmericans' pockets. I think that is particularly onerous.\n  You mentioned the relationship of cigarettes and the construction of \nthem with one's own hands, and that obviously makes people think of the \nmarijuana cigarettes that people roll on their own. Frankly, the drug \nproblem is one that bothers me because I think we are inordinately, and \nperhaps inappropriately, focused, at least to a degree not warranted, \non cigarettes rather than on drugs.\n  As I indicated, General McCaffrey indicated that there are at least, \naccording to his numbers--and the numbers have been tossed around--more \nkids are trying drugs than they are trying tobacco. I think we ought to \nbe careful that we don't aggravate that problem.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am anxious to know and hope that the \nSenator from Missouri has the answer to how this 753-page bill or 482-\npage bill that we haven't had time to complete the review of yet--I \nrealize the Senator may not have the answer to this and what kind of \nemphasis it places on the family as playing a role in reducing tobacco \nuse. I have seen the statistics. Whether it is drugs or tobacco, the \nbiggest influence on whether kids use them are the parents and the \nattitudes that the parents have to them. And the parents, even if they \nsmoke, have a good influence on reducing teen smoking or youth smoking \nby saying that even though they do it, it hurts them; that it is not \nright, it seems to me.\n  The bill that is really trying to get at the heart of the problem, \nand if the statistics all point to the family emphasis, the family \nattitude, the family direction being the way to reduce smoking, it \nseems like this bill ought to have something in there that strengthens \nthe family and strengthens their role in doing this. It provides a \nmechanism for almost everything else in the world, including things \nthat are not health related. So it seems to me like there ought to be \nsomething in here that says something to families, ``You can make a \ndifference. How do we get you involved?'' I can't find that. I want to \nknow if the Senator from Missouri is able to find it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Frankly, I haven't found it. I thank the Senator from \nWyoming for asking the question. The impact on families here is pretty \nserious. But it is financial.\n  Basically, it is to say that for a three-pack-a-day family there is a \nminimum of $100 a month that goes out of their expendable income, in \naddition to the taxes. That is not just the cost for smoking \ncigarettes. That is additional taxes, $100 a month for three packs a \nday; that is, if you take the committee's $1.10 range.\n  My amendment would strip that $1.10 rate out because I don't think it \nis appropriate to punish people the way the tobacco companies have \ndone. If you go with Senator Kennedy's proposal, it is a $1.50-a-pack \nrate. You get to the point of about $1,600 a year for three packs in \nthe family at $1.50. I think that really makes it not only tough for \nthe families to do something about smoking, it makes it really tough \nfor the family to do things about all kinds of other things, like \nclothing the family, feeding the family, providing shelter and \ntransportation, health care, and other things.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I do.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, we have been trying \nto move this along in a fair-minded way. Three and a half hours ago I \nasked the Senator how long he thought he might be, and we were talking \nin terms of an hour or so. I know there have been a series of \nfascinating and very important questions posed in a spontaneous manner. \nBut that said, I wonder if the Senator might be able to share with his \ncolleagues what opportunities other people might have to debate this \nissue.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator for his question. I feel like I \nshould be able to finish by 2 o'clock, providing I don't spend a lot of \ntime responding to the questions of others. Most of my time on the \nfloor has not been accorded to me to make speeches. It has been in \nresponding to questions. I have to say it is probably better than had I \nbeen speaking because I find the questions to be very satisfying and \nvery enlightening.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator further yield without losing his right to \nthe floor?\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate full well that questions, in a \nway, have educated the Senate, and all we are trying to do is find a \nway. Obviously, some other colleagues planned their day, since we tried \nto do this outside sort of the rigorous assertion of the rules, if you \nwill. That said, would we be able to rely on and could we perhaps enter \ninto an agreement now that the Senator would finish at 2 o'clock at \nwhich point we would have an opportunity on our side to be able to \nallow a number of people to speak for a little period of time to try to \nbalance it out a bit?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If the Senator is talking about the opportunity to \ncurtail debate and schedule a motion to table, that is one of the \nreasons I felt like I had to move to provide the kind of debate which I \nhave provided, because without consultation, at least with me, about a \ntimeframe for the debate suggested, there would be a motion to table. \nAnd that happened in the last issue I was seeking to discuss in the \nSenate. I purposely wouldn't allow individuals to cut off debate. There \nis a lot of interest in this measure. I will personally do what I can \nto wrap up my participation. I will limit the amount of questions to \nwhich I will respond and make time available for others.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, that is exactly what \nwe are trying to find out. I will accept the Senator's word, obviously, \nthat he is going to try to wrap up around 2 o'clock and allow other \npeople to debate. So we will afford that.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I might add that I was a part of the \ncommittee that considered this bill. The committee was interested in \ngetting the bill out. It is no secret that I was the only member of the \ncommittee that voted against sending the bill to the floor. But I was \nasked not to have these kinds of discussions. The idea was that we \nwanted to get a bill to the floor where we could have discussion. That \nis what I want to have. I want to have that kind of discussion. There \nwas an effort not to have too much happen in committee. I understand \nthat much. My own view is if they would prefer to have the discussion \nof these issues on the floor, that is fine with me. But if you say you \ndon't want a lot of discussion in committee, and you say you don't want \na lot of discussion on the floor, you are trying to truncate the \ndebate. You want this thing to go through before we actually have the \ncomplete documents on what is in it. It is a $868 billion tax increase. \nIt finally dawned on me that I had better stand up and speak, and I had \nbetter try to accommodate the other individuals who want to speak.\n  I am pleased to have the assurance that there is not an idea about a \nmotion to table right away, that there is going to be time for other \ndebate on this.\n  I will try to conclude my remarks.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a couple more \nquestions? I understand the time deadline. I understand how those \nmotions work that lead to this kind of a need for the format for \ndebate.\n  Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds all Senators that the \nSenator retains the floor only for yielding for the purpose of a \nquestion, not for the purpose of a statement. And I want all Senators \nto understand that the Senator could lose the floor if the individual \nwho he yields to chooses to make a statement rather than ask a \nquestion.\n  Does the Senator yield for that purpose?\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield for the purpose of a question, and I would \nrequest the person to whom I am yielding to please preface your \nremarks. Does the Senator agree or not agree, if there is going to be a \nvery strict approach, which, frankly, there has never been in my \nunderstanding of the Senate to that kind of question. I ask that he \nstart his question that way. I don't want to yield the floor based on \ntechnical failure, if the Senator will begin with words of an \ninterrogatory nature.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. Does the Senator feel that the $1.10 or $1.50, as it \nis $1.50 right now, would have the amount of money the FDA needs to do \nthe kind of enforcement we have been putting on them? Does the Senator \nthink that when we talked about in the Labor Committee, which I am on, \nthe $34 million amount for the FDA and all of the things that would do, \nand that this bill has considerably more money in it than that for the \nFDA, does the Senator think that we are doing overkill, perhaps, with \nthe FDA? Will they be able to adequately use the amount of money that \nwe are talking about in this bill for that agency alone? It is a \nconsiderable expansion of that agency. Do you think that our agencies \nare set up in a manner that they can escalate the amount of spending \nthat they are very good at, but can they escalate the amount of \nspending they are doing to meet these new amounts that are coming in, \nparticularly with the FDA, which is critical to this?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think that is an appropriate question. There is \nalmost a 50-percent increase in funding for the FDA. Or did the Senator \nsay more than that? Frankly, I have every confidence that Federal \nagencies will spend the money you give them.\n  As I indicated, General McCaffrey indicated that there are at least, \naccording to his numbers--and the numbers have been tossed around--more \nkids are trying drugs than they are trying tobacco. I think we ought to \nbe careful that we don't aggravate that problem.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Frankly, I have every confidence that Federal \nagencies will spend the money you give them.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe that he calls into very serious question the \nidea that price alone is a major factor, or a controlling factor. And \nhe does so effectively by citing the kinds of information that the \nSenator has mentioned.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have sat for well over an hour now this morning, \nlistening to the colloquies, the questions, and the debates between the \nSenator from Missouri and the others who engaged him, concerned as we \nall are about teenage smoking, and concerned as we all are about what \nappears to have been a targeted effort on the part of some tobacco \ncompanies to increase teenage smoking. But the Senator from Missouri \nalso cited a poll, as did the Senator from Texas, that indicates that \namongst Americans the No. 1 issue with their teenage children is not \nsmoking but drugs. Would the Senator from Missouri agree with that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the poll and I am aware of the concern. \nAnd I believe that is correct. I believe Americans are far more fearful \nthat their children will be involved with illicit drugs than they are \nthat their children might experiment with smoking.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That same poll said that only 3 percent of Americans \nrecognize the use of tobacco products as a concern for their teenagers. \nI think their greatest concern was that the most damaging would be \ndrugs and other activities. Would the Senator from Missouri agree with \nthat?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the poll was very clear about that: 39 percent \ncared about drugs; 3 percent said they were worried about smoking.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Does the bill that the Senator from Arizona brings forward \ndeal with the issue of drugs or the misuse of drugs by our teenage \npopulations in this country?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Not to my knowledge.\n  Mr. CRAIG. A great deal of assumptions suggest that teenagers would \nslow their smoking, or discontinue smoking, or not start smoking as a \nresult of this bill. Yet, all of the other studies indicate that is \nprobably not the case. The Senator from Missouri cites a concern for \nelevated activities in black-market sales; is that not true?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I have pointed out that not only would elevated \nactivities in black-market sales result in perhaps even lower prices \nfor cigarettes, but it could, as a matter of fact, be a way in which \nindividuals are introduced to drug use.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is it not so that countries that have increased the price \nper pack of cigarettes dramatically, and found that those cigarettes \nthen moved into a black market, backed away from those taxes to bring \nthose products back into the market and away from the illicit activity \nof the black market?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think that has been a very clear experience. This \nprecipitous increase in the rates of taxes on cigarettes has been a \nvery sad experience by promoting black markets. Great Britain, or \nEngland, is said to have a black market of about 50 percent of all of \nits consumption. That is obviously something we don't want to teach or \ninstitute in this country. And other countries--Canada had a serious, \nvery, very serious, bad experience with its precipitous rise in the \nincrease of taxes on these kinds of products.\n  Mr. CRAIG. This Senator from Idaho is concerned that those who would \nsell black-market cigarettes are also now selling marijuana and cocaine \nto our young people. Does the Senator from Missouri have the same fear?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Obviously, if we were to take cigarette smuggling, \nwhich is now a commercial activity--the cigarettes are largely \ndelivered to stores and are sold in the ordinary course of business. If \nwe were to take that out of the commercial activity arena and put it \ninto the retail activity, so that they would be sold on street corners \nby drug dealers or others who would sell contraband in a retail \nfashion, I think we threaten substantially the young people of this \ncountry with the introduction in an array of things that would be sold. \nSomeone might offer: Now, you can either have cigarettes here or the \nmarijuana here or these pills here, or like that.\n\n  So, putting cigarettes into that setting may be a very evil sort of \nintroduction of those individuals to the drug culture in a way that \nthey would not otherwise be exposed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding. I \nknow he said he would like to conclude by 2.\n  I also appreciate his stressing the need for an expanded debate of \nthis issue. I hope the leadership, and obviously the managers of the \nbill, recognize that and are now recognizing the importance that we \ndebate this fully. I appreciate the responses of the Senator from \nMissouri to my questions.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his valuable \nquestions. I will now conclude. I have given my word to fellow \ncolleagues in the Senate that I would try to be out by 2 o'clock, and I \nwill. I thank the Senate for its accommodation.\n  Frankly, I appreciate this institution because it does provide a way \nfor individuals who really feel strongly about this measure to be able \nto talk about it.\n  We have a bill. The Senator from Wyoming pointed out that it was not \nthe one laid on the desk, because we have changes so rapidly. But here \nis the bill. There it is. This bill represents a $868 billion tax \nincrease on the backs of America's poorest working families; 60 \npercent--59.4 percent. Let me not exaggerate. The estimate is 59.4 \npercent of the $868 billion--59.4 percent of the $868 billion from this \nmeasure is to be paid for by people earning less than $30,000 a year.\n  I believe we should reject it. This is a massive tax increase. This \nis a massive expansion of Government. This is an affront to the effort \nof families to provide for themselves. And I believe it is something \nthat will be counterproductive. It invites all kinds of pernicious \nactivity, including the black market, including the potential for \nincreased drug utilization, including the loss of revenue to States \nwhen the black market emerges and no longer do those selling cigarettes \npay even State taxes.\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\n  But at the very bottom of it all, this is a $868 billion tax to be \nshouldered by the hard-working families who earn less than $30,000 a \nyear. That is inappropriate and to me it is unacceptable. I do not \nbelieve any of the lofty pie-in-the-sky--supposedly supported by \nstudies--objectives really justify it. We should pursue those \nobjectives in ways that are more likely to be successful and less \nlikely to be destructive of the capacity of hard-working families to \nsurvive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this side now \nbe permitted to consume, it is 2 o'clock, maybe 1 hour 15 minutes, to \nbe divided among Members on our side in order to have an opportunity to \ndebate the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right--I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts will be recognized to control the time \nfor 1 hour 15 minutes under his control.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Arizona for his \npurpose.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I just say to my colleagues that after the 1 hour 15 \nminutes that has just been agreed to on the other side of the aisle, I \nintend to offer a tabling motion at that time. No matter what happens \nto that motion, then we would like to proceed to an amendment on this \nside which would be that of Senator Gregg. And then, following \ndisposition of that, whether that is agreed to or not, we would then go \nto the Senator's side, back and forth, as we have.\n  Also, if my friend from Massachusetts will indulge me, I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from the National Association of \nConvenience Stores be printed in the Record, part of which says:\n\n       NACS, the National Association of Convenience Stores, is \n     very pleased that we have reached an agreement with your \n     committee and others involved in the process and NACS will \n     not object to the Senate's passage of S. 1415.\n\n  So, obviously, the National Association of Convenience Stores have a \ndifferent view of this legislation than the Senator from Missouri.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         NACS,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 18, 1998.\n     Hon. John McCain, Chairman,\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Hollings: The National Association \n     of Convenience Stores (NACS) is writing to express our thanks \n     and appreciation for addressing our primary concerns \n     surrounding the ``National Tobacco Policy Youth Smoking \n     Reduction Act,'' (S. 1415) which is being considered this \n     week.\n       As you know, NACS first expressed opposition to S. 1415 \n     because it would have given FDA expansive authority to \n     prohibit tobacco sales by specific categories of stores. This \n     authority was so broad, that many small businesses, who have \n     themselves had no record or history of unlawful sales to \n     minors, could lose the ability to sell a legal product. Our \n     second concern was that the legislation would exempt certain \n     tobacco retailers from all point-of-sale restrictions thereby \n     placing traditional retailers, such as convenience stores, at \n     a serious competitive disadvantage.\n       Over the last several weeks we have had an opportunity to \n     meet with your respective staffs and discuss alternatives to \n     these issues while also ensuring that we reach our common \n     goal--reducing underage consumption of tobacco by minors. \n     NACS is very pleased that we have reached an agreement with \n     your committee and others involved in the process and NACS \n     will not object to the Senate's passage of S. 1415. NACS will \n     also communicate this message to all our members as well as \n     allied trade associations that have expressed similar \n     concerns.\n       Thank you again for your willingness to work with our \n     industry on these very critical issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Marc Katz,\n                             Vice President, Government Relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2422\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have now been listening for a number of \nhours to the fundamental arguments in opposition to the amendment by \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts. Before yielding to colleagues \nwho are not at this moment here, let me take a moment to say a few \nwords about it.\n  I think any individuals listening to this debate, if they are not \naware of some of the history of the Senate or the history of how issues \nfall on either side here, might say, gee, that is a pretty good point.\n  The Senator from Missouri suggested that this is a big price \nincrease, and it is going to hurt the poor. I simply ask those \nlistening to this debate who measure these things to think about the \nhistory of who has defended the poor people and who has defended the \ninterests of the working families of this country.\n  It would be absurd to suggest that the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, who has been the champion of the minimum wage, the \nchampion of health care for children, the champion of education for \npeople who don't have access to it, who has consistently fought to \nprotect the interests of working families and of the poor, is somehow \nnow doing something that is totally contrary to those years of \ncommitment and record.\n  Yesterday evening, the Senator from Missouri held up a chart of all \nof the tax increases that have passed in recent years in the Senate. It \nis interesting, because if you look at every one of those tax \nincreases, there was an enormous difference, like night and day, \nbetween who was protected by Senator Kennedy and the Democrats on this \nside of the aisle and who was protected by the Republicans.\n  That is not the debate today. I don't want to go back through that \nentirely, except to say that the record is absolutely clear that in \nevery one of the tax proposals of our friends on the other side of the \naisle, people at the upper-income level made out better, and it was \nSenator Kennedy and Democrats and others who fought to protect the \nworking American. It was only after our efforts in the major budget \nagreement of last year that a single mother earning $40,000 managed to \nget even some tax benefit, and that tax benefit went from zero to \n$1,000 because we stood up and fought for that person.\n  That is not the fight today, except, Mr. President, to the degree \nthat we are talking about where some people are coming from. We are \ntalking about the lives of children. That has been lost in all of the \ndebate over the last 3\\1/2\\ hours. We are talking about the lives of \nAmerica's children. We know to a certainty that 6,000 kids will try \ncigarettes every single day, 3,000 of those kids will continue to \nsmoke, and 1,000 of those children will die early as a consequence of a \ntobacco-related disease. That is what we are talking about on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  It is an insult to suggest that the parents of working families or \nthe parents of the poorest people in America don't care as much about \ntheir kids having access to tobacco as other families. It is an insult \nto suggest that they are happy with the charts that show over the last \nyears, there has been an 80-percent increase among black and Hispanic, \npeople of color, an 80.2-percent increase in their use of cigarettes in \n1991, and in non-Hispanic and nonblack, it has only been 22 percent. \nWhy is that? I will tell you one of the reasons why, because the \ntobacco companies specifically targeted low-income communities. They \nwent after them.\n  It is a sad part of the history of this entire effort that we now \nknow, as a result of courageous attorneys general around the country \nwho have sued the tobacco companies, who have gotten documents from the \ntobacco companies, we now know specifically about this targeting. We \nknow that they targeted young people. They specifically set out to \ncreate addicts. What this debate is about is how you stop that. How do \nyou get kids to stop smoking? How do you keep them away from \ncigarettes?\n  Again and again, in the last 3\\1/2\\ hours, we have heard Senators \nsay, ``Oh, all it is going to do is raise the price. Why aren't they \ndoing'' this; ``Why aren't they doing'' that; ``No cessation programs, \nno research.'' That is not true. That is just not true, Mr. President.\n  The fact is that in this legislation, there are a number of things \nthat take place--cessation, research, counteradvertisements, penalties, \nlicensing to\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nrestrict youth access. It is unlawful for kids to buy the cigarettes, \nto possess the cigarettes. There is a lot of the strengthening of the \nlaw with respect to those things that will make a difference in kids' \nlives.\n  One other thing also makes a difference, Mr. President--how much it \ncosts. Sure, kids spend 100 bucks, 150 bucks sometimes on a pair of \nsneakers, whatever, but it is usually not a cash transaction. It is \nusually a very specific transaction where parents have helped them to \nbe able to do that. It is the cash they have in their pocket. It is the \npocket change, pocket money, whatever they can scrounge up that they \nspend on something like a cigarette that they are not allowed to buy, \nand most of their parents don't want them buying. If the price goes up, \ntheir disposable income is less available to buy cigarettes.\n  We know this. This is not conjecture, as has been alleged. This is \nknown as a matter of a number of studies, all of which show that for \nevery 10-percent increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, youth \nsmoking will drop by about 7 percent.\n  So the 40-cent difference that we are talking about in Senator \nKennedy's amendment is not just 40 cents. It is not just money. It \nmeans that 2.7 million fewer kids will become regular smokers, and that \nabout 800,000 or so over a period of years will not die as a result of \nthat. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about lives \nhere.\n  It is a matter of fact, also, that Dr. Koop and the Koop-Kessler \ncommission and the Institute of Medicine have actually recommended an \nimmediate $2 increase. I just ask anybody in America: Who do you \nbelieve? Do you believe Dr. Koop, the former Surgeon General of the \nUnited States, who had the courage to talk about these issues to the \nNation, or do you believe the advertisements of people who have an \ninterest of making millions and millions of dollars in the same way \nthey have over the years, people who were willing to lie and lie and \nlie to the American people about what the impact was, even when they \nknew what the impact was; people who are willing to target our children \nand say, ``This is the next generation of smokers. We have got to suck \nthem in. We have got to get them addicted.''\n  That is the fight on the floor of the U.S. Senate--who is going to \nprotect our children and who is willing to let the companies off the \nhook?\n  The fact is the studies show that if you raise the price--now, is \nraising that price a little bit tough on some working folks who buy the \ncigarettes? The answer is yes. I am going to be honest about that. But \nyou know, it is a lot tougher when their kid gets cancer, and it is a \nlot tougher when the country has to pick up the costs of 400,000 people \na year dying as a result of this addictive substance.\n  It is a known fact that 86 percent of all of the people who smoke \nstarted when they were young, they started as kids. So if you want to \nreduce the cost of our pulmonary sections of our hospitals, if you want \nto reduce the cost of kidney-related tobacco diseases, or heart \ndiseases, emphysema, cancer, the way you reduce the cost is by reducing \nthe number of people who have access to it.\n  Now, isn't it strange, in Europe, even after we raise the price, it \nwill still cost more for a pack of cigarettes in European countries \nthan here? What do they know that we do not know? It seems to me that \nwe ought to be responsible in this effort.\n  I know my colleagues are here now and want to speak. There is more to \nsay. But I will reserve that time. I want to give them ample \nopportunity to be able to speak.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island and after that, \nportion it out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me time.\n  Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending a meeting, along with my \ncolleagues, Senator Kennedy, Senator Conrad and Senator Lautenberg, \nwith C. Everett Koop. And Dr. Koop had the right prescription for this \naspect of the legislation. His prescription was quite simple: raise the \nprice per pack by $1.50. As the preeminent public health official in \nthis country, indeed in some respects America's family doctor, I \nbelieve his advice should be taken to heart by this body and we should \nmove to support this amendment by Senator Kennedy.\n  I am a very proud cosponsor of this amendment. Indeed, this is not a \nradical departure. Two committees of the Senate have already passed \nthis amendment--the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Budget \nCommittee. They have done so on a bipartisan basis.\n  So what is at stake here is reaffirming and confirming what has been \ndone already, what has been advocated by public health officials; and \nthat is to raise the price per pack by $1.50.\n  Study after study has confirmed the fact that this will make an \nimportant impact on the rate of teenage smoking. But these studies are \nless dramatic than the words of people who probably know best the \neffect of price and consumption with respect to tobacco products--the \nwards of the industry itself.\n  In 1981, a Philip Morris internal document stated, and I quote:\n\n       In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that \n     price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of \n     teenagers, and that the goals of reducing teenage smoking and \n     balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the \n     Federal excise tax on cigarettes.\n\n  That is not Dr. Koop. That is not the proponents of this amendment. \nThat is the tobacco industry, coolly, carefully assessing what price \ndoes to teenage smoking. And it reduces it.\n  In 1987, another Philip Morris internal document lamented a decline \nin youth smoking caused by price increases, their price increases. The \ndocument stated:\n\n       We don't need to have that happen again. So if the industry \n     understands what will be affected by a price increase, we \n     should understand also. But as I have indicated, research \n     findings from various sources confirm the fact that a \n     price increase will affect dramatically, decisively, and \n     positively the decline of teenage smoking.\n\n  In listening to this debate, one is struck by the different \napproaches one could take to the goal of reducing teenage smoking. I \nthink there are just two basic ways you can do that. First, if we are \nreally sincere about reducing teenage smoking, we can create an \nelaborate regulatory bureaucratic structure with agents in every \ncommunity who would monitor teen smoking, with reports that would go \nback and forth about teen smoking, with supervision of the distribution \nnetwork, and all sorts of ways to do it. Or we could use the market--\nthe most efficient device created by humanity to allocate goods and \nservices--we could use the market.\n  That is what this amendment proposes to do. It simply says, if we \nraise the price of cigarettes, we will cause a decline in teenage \nsmoking--efficiently, dramatically, and effectively.\n  So I argue, if anyone is a believer in the affect of the market on \nbehavior, if anyone believes that price makes a difference--and I think \nthat is the credo of both parties, but certainly the Republican Party--\nyou would be in favor of a market-oriented approach like this to \ncurtail teen smoking.\n  The only other alternative is that we are really not talking about \ncurtailing teen smoking on the floor today; we are talking about \nsomething else. But if you believe that we are here to reduce teenage \nsmoking, and you believe that the market can work wonders in terms of \nallocated goods and services, you should be supporting this amendment.\n  Now, as I indicated, the evidence is replete from many different \nsources of this effect. Reports from the Institute of Medicine's \nNational Academy of Sciences, the National Cancer Institute, the \nDepartment of the Treasury, the Surgeon General--all these indicate the \ncorrelation between price increases and reduced teenage smoking.\n  A National Bureau of Economic Research study in 1996 found that young \npeople were three times as sensitive to cigarette prices as older \nsmokers.\n  A 1997 study in Tobacco Control found a strong relationship between \ncigarette prices and youth smoking, with each 10-percent increase in \nprice resulting in a 9-percent reduction in youth smoking.\n  In its 1998 report, ``Taking Action to Reduce Tobacco Use,'' the \nInstitute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences concluded \nthat:\n\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\n\n       * * * the single most direct and reliable method for \n     reducing consumption is to increase the price of tobacco \n     products, thus encouraging the cessation and reducing the \n     level of initiation of tobacco use.\n\n  A National Cancer Institute expert panel in 1993 reported that ``a \nsubstantial increase in tobacco excise taxes may be the single most \neffective measure for decreasing tobacco consumption,'' and they also \nconcluded that ``an excise tax reduces consumption by children and \nteenagers at least as much as it reduces consumption by adults.''\n  The 1994 Surgeon General's report, likewise, indicated a real price \nincrease would significantly reduce cigarette smoking.\n  All of this data, all of these studies, come to the same conclusion: \nIf we want to reduce teenage smoking, if we want to use the efficient \nallocation mechanism of the market, we should raise the price to a \nsignificant level--$1.50 per pack.\n\n  Now, all of these experiences are academic. We can have a battle of \nreports and analysis back and forth here. But we have a real-life \nexample:\n  In Canada, between 1979 and 1991, when real prices increased from \n$2.09 to $5.42, smoking rates among young people 15 to 19 years old \nfell from 42 percent to 16 percent while overall consumption of tobacco \nproducts also declined--a huge decrease.\n  Now, this was a big sample, the country of Canada. Real price \nincreases and real dramatic results in decreasing teenage smoking. And \nwe have to do this because we all know and we all recite repeatedly the \nstatistics: 50 million Americans addicted to tobacco; 1 out of every 3 \nof these individuals will die prematurely from tobacco-related \ndiseases; three-quarters of them want to quit smoking, but they cannot \nbecause it is an addictive substance.\n  The conclusion they have come to and we should is it is better that \nthey never start. It is better that we take steps to curtail teenage \nsmoking when there is a chance to divert a young person away from this \naddiction. We know that over 90 percent of smokers started before they \nwere 18--again, a clarion call to us to take action to protect the \nyouth of this country.\n  Each year, 1 million children become regular smokers. And, as I said, \none-third of them will die prematurely. There are 5 million kids under \n18 currently alive today who will die from tobacco-related diseases \nacross the country.\n  It is disturbing, in my home State of Rhode Island, while smoking \nlevels have flattened out with respect to the overall population, high \nschool students seem to be smoking 25 percent more than they were just \na few years ago.\n  We have to act now. We have to use the most decisive tool we have, \nand that is price increases, to affect the behavior of young people so \nthat we will not see them needlessly die from tobacco-related diseases.\n  I support wholeheartedly and enthusiastically the effort by my \ncolleagues to ensure that we have an increase that will do the job, \nthat will have an effective way to curtail teen smoking.\n  With that, I yield back my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time did the Senator from Rhode Island consume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a total time of 54 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Miss Susan Goodman \nof my staff be accorded floor privileges during the consideration of S. \n1415.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have just been subjected in the U.S. \nSenate to what I think could appropriately be described as a \nfilibuster--4 hours of wandering discussion on an amendment that is now \nbefore the Senate.\n  During those 4 hours of that filibuster, 500 American youth under the \nage of 18 commenced their first use of tobacco products. One-third of \nthose 500 American youth during that 4-hour filibuster who started to \nuse tobacco will die, die prematurely of a tobacco-related affliction.\n  I have heard as I walked through the Chamber during this 4 hours \nmocking comments: Does anybody believe that we are really here to try \nto reduce teenage smoking? Does anybody really feel we are here to \nreduce teenage smoking? The answer is yes, we are here to reduce \nteenage smoking. That is the only legitimate reason that we can be \nhere. Anyone who does not start their debate by a clear statement of \ntheir commitment to that objective has debased this national debate \nabout the future of tobacco and the youth of America.\n  In 4 hours, 500 American youth have taken up smoking. Since May 20 of \n1997, 1 year ago, the number is 1,095,000 American youth under the age \nof 18 have taken up the use of tobacco, and 365,000 of those American \nyouth who have taken up tobacco in the last 1 year will die prematurely \nof a tobacco-related affliction. It is to them that this debate is \ndirected.\n  Mr. President, the best public health advisers available to us have \nrecommended that we set as a goal a 65-percent reduction in teenage \nsmoking over the next 10 years. That is a challenging goal, but it is \nan attainable goal. It is a goal which is going to stretch us in the \npolitical community. It is going to stretch those in the health, the \neducation, and especially the families of America to their best in \nterms of beginning to attack this scourge which, as my colleague from \nRhode Island has just indicated, is a growing scourge of teenage \nsmoking.\n  I believe that an important part of achieving that goal of a 65-\npercent reduction is to raise the price of cigarettes to as high a \nlevel as can be achieved without inducing other negative consequences, \nand to do that as quickly as possible. For that reason, I am a \ncosponsor of this amendment which would raise the price to what has \nbeen recommended by the public health community, $1.50 per pack, and to \ndo so in 3 years. This is consistent with legislation which I have \ncosponsored with Senators Chafee and Harkin.\n  It is not the only thing we need to do. We also need to have a \ncomprehensive attack against teenage smoking. That comprehensive attack \nneeds to include weapons such as restrictions on marketing and \npromotion--no more Marlboro Man, no more Joe Camel, appealing to our \nyoung people. It needs to include effective cessation efforts in the \nschools through public methods of communication. It needs to include \nlook-back provisions which will surcharge the industry and individual \ncompanies if they fail to meet the nationally established goals for \nreduction of teenage smoking. All of those are important.\n\n  But the reality is that the single most important part of achieving \nthe goal of a 65-percent reduction in teenage smoking is to get the \nprice to as high a level as reasonable as quickly as possible. The best \nestimates are that 85 percent of the effectiveness in terms of reducing \nteenage smoking will come through monetary means. The other 15 percent \nwill be the softer, more psychological efforts at education and \nrestraint on promotion and advertising.\n  It is appropriate that we should be using the monetary means as the \nprincipal force to achieve the goal of a 65-percent reduction. Some of \nthose who have spoken, either spoken directly or spoken through the \nform of very elongated questions, have inferred that there is something \nwrong with inserting the economic component into this debate. The fact \nis, there already is a substantial economic component.\n  As Members know, four States, including my own, have reached very \nsignificant settlements with the tobacco industry, in which the \nindustry essentially admitted that their costs in terms of cost to \ntreat people with addictions related to their use of tobacco are in the \nbillions of dollars. This is not a cost-free decision if we do nothing. \nIf we do nothing, we accept the fact that we will continue having the \nAmerican taxpayers pay these enormous annual costs to treat the \nillnesses of people who have been induced to smoke tobacco.\n  It is also appropriate in this era of free-market economies, where we \nare looking to laws such as supply and demand rather than laws of \nregulation as a mean of affecting human behavior, that we insert as the \ncornerstone of this legislation a significant economic disincentive for \npeople to utilize tobacco products, a disincentive which\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nwe know will have its primary effect on younger smokers, smokers to \nwhom discretionary income is more limited, smokers who are less \nphysically addicted to the use of tobacco.\n  Mr. President, for those who will oppose this amendment, I issue this \nchallenge. If you are not prepared to accept the goal of a 65-percent \nreduction in teenage smoking, then what is your goal and why are you \nprepared to support a lessened goal, recognizing that every percentage \npoint below 65 percent means that you are consigning thousands of \nAmerican young people each year to the scourge, the cost, the social \nissues related to the use of tobacco, and one-third of those who start \nthe process will end up dying prematurely because of a tobacco-related \naffliction?\n  If you are not prepared to accept the 65-percent goal, defend an \nalternative. If you accept the 65-percent goal but are unwilling to \naccept those things which are necessary to achieve it, then what is \nyour alternative? What will be the additional items that you will \nsubstitute for what the best experts in the public health community say \nis required to achieve that 65-percent goal?\n  We know that some of those noneconomic factors are already under \nassault, such as the promotion in advertising. So it becomes even more \nimportant that we adopt the amendment, as offered by Senator Kennedy \nand others, which will raise the price to the $1.50 level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Also having expired during that 10 minutes I have been \nspeaking, have been 41 American youth who have taken up smoking during \nthe time I have been speaking; 14 of those will expire prematurely \nbecause of tobacco-related affliction. It is to them that this debate \nand this issue is dedicated.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HAGEL). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of misinformation on \nthe floor of the Senate this morning. I heard the Senator from Texas \ntalk about an opinion piece in the Washington Post this morning saying \nthat if this $1.50 a pack were passed, we would have a massive black \nmarket. The Senator failed to point out who wrote the opinion piece. \nThat opinion piece, which I cited as being written by a Mr. Nick \nBrookes, was in fact written by Mr. Nick Brookes. But who is he? He is \nthe chairman and chief executive officer of the Brown & Williamson \nTobacco Corporation. Well, there is a credible source on this issue.\n  It didn't end there. I heard another of my colleagues suggest this \nmorning that what has happened here is going to lead to a $3 increase \nin the price of a pack of cigarettes, even though the proposal is to \nadd $1.50. How does that turn into $3? It is magical. They don't really \nexplain it, but they say that the $1.50 that would be imposed by this \nChamber all of a sudden turns into $3. Do you know whom they cite as an \nexpert? It is fascinating whom they cite as an expert. They cite \nSalomon Smith Barney. They cite their analyst.\n  It is very interesting to check the records on Salomon Smith Barney \nand see what they might have in the way of tobacco holdings. Do you \nknow what you would find out? Salomon Smith Barney and the other source \nthey have talked about this morning, Sanford Bernstein, together, own \nover 50 million shares of stock in the two top tobacco firms. Salomon \nSmith Barney owns 16 million shares of Philip Morris, 3 million shares \nof RJR. Sanford Bernstein, the other analyst quoted here, owns 30 \nmillion shares of Philip Morris, and they own 13 million shares of RJR. \nDo you think they are an objective observer here? I don't think so. I \nthink they have a lot at stake financially in the outcome of this \ndebate, and they are trying to influence that debate with this hocus \npocus analysis--hocus pocus that turns a $1.50 price increase magically \ninto a $3 price increase. It is nonsense.\n  The Treasury Department says that a $1.50 price increase translates \ninto--surprise of all surprises--a $1.50 price increase. The FTC says a \n$1.50 price increase translates into a $1.50 price increase. Dr. Harris \nat MIT, perhaps the most objective independent observer--out of \nGovernment, out of industry--says that a $1.50 price increase \ntranslates into a $1.50 price increase.\n  Mr. President, the question of whether or not raising prices will \nreduce consumption is a very simple matter. There isn't an economist in \nAmerica who would tell you that if you raise the price of something, \nthe consumption won't fall. Every economist understands that basic rule \nof economics. The experts all agree that youth smoking will decline as \nprices increase. Dr. Chaloupka, who has done perhaps the most thorough \nstudy of all of the studies, concluded that a $1.10 price increase \nwould lead to a 32-percent reduction. Dr. Chaloupka's work says that it \nwill lead to a 33-percent decline in usage, and the $1.50 will lead to \na 51-percent decline in usage. Those are estimates by economists.\n  We don't need to just look to economists, we can look to the public \nhealth community. Here I have a letter from Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, \nperhaps the two most credible sources on these questions. Dr. Koop, of \ncourse, is a former Surgeon General of the United States who served \nunder a Republican administration, and Dr. Kessler is a former head of \nthe FDA who served under a Republican administration and a Democratic \nadministration. They say $1.50 a pack. The American Lung Association \nsays $1.50 a pack. The American Heart Association says $1.50 a pack. \nThe American College of Cardiology says $1.50 a pack. The American \nAcademy of Pediatrics say $1.50 a pack. Those are the public health \ngroups. They have weighed in and they have made clear that is what we \nought to do.\n\n  But if you don't believe the economists, if you don't believe the \npublic health community, maybe you ought to listen to the New York \nTimes, what they have said. They have said in an editorial this morning \nthat you ought to go to $1.50 a pack. It is right here. The New York \nTimes of this morning:\n\n       The bill, drafted by Senator McCain and approved by the \n     Senate Commerce Committee, would raise cigarette prices by \n     $1.10 * * * That amount should be increased to at least $1.50 \n     per pack, which public health experts estimate is needed to \n     cut youth smoking * * *\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent to add 5 minutes total time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 2 more minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if you don't want to listen to any of \nthose folks, how about listening to the industry itself. This, I think, \nis dispositive on the debate. This is exhibit 11591 from the Minnesota \ntrial. Myron Johnston, Philip Morris. Subject: Handling and excise tax. \nThese are the industry's own words:\n\n       The 1982-83 round of price increases prevented 500,000 \n     teenagers from starting to smoke * * * those teenagers are \n     now 18 to 21 years old. This means that 420,000 of the \n     nonstarters would have been Philip Morris smokers. We were \n     hit hard. We don't need that to happen again.\n\n  Mr. President, if there is any question in any Senator's mind as to \nwhether or not increasing prices will reduce youth smoking, here is \nwhat the industry says, based on history. They say in 1982-83 when \nexcise taxes were increased, 500,000 teenagers were prevented from \nstarting to smoke. Those are the industry's own words. If you don't \nbelieve any of that, Mr. President, here is the experience in Canada. \nThe price went up, youth smoking went down. The relationship is as \nclear as a bell.\n  So the question before this body is, Whom are we going to protect? \nAre we going to protect the lives of kids, or are we going to protect \nthe profits of the industry? This analysis shows that if we go to \n$1.50, 2.7 million kids are going to be prevented from smoking. That \nmeans 800,000 lives will be extended and perhaps saved.\n  The industry says, well, it will bankrupt them. Here are the facts. \nIf we go to a $1.10-per-pack price increase, their profits in 2003 will \nbe $5 billion, according to the Treasury Department. If, instead, we go \nto a $1.50, their profits will be $4.3 billion. So the choice is \nclear--800,000 lives or $700 million in industry\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nprofits. That is the question before this Chamber. Do we save 800,000 \nlives of kids, or do we protect $700 million of industry profits?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I \nparticularly thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today to support \nthis important amendment offered by Senators Kennedy, Graham, Harkin, \nand others. I have worked closely with Senators Bob Graham and Tom \nHarkin for the past several months on the issue of a comprehensive \ntobacco bill. We came to one inescapable conclusion, which has been \nvoiced by the Senator from North Dakota and a host of others this \nafternoon: A steep increase in the price of tobacco products over a \nshort time is the single most important thing we can do to reduce \ntobacco use among children, or to deter them from taking up smoking.\n  How did we come to this conclusion? Well, Mr. President, we listened \nto the experts. Who are the experts? They are economists, public health \nresearchers, and even tobacco industry officials. They have all \nconcluded that price increases dramatically reduce smoking among \nchildren.\n  When I say experts, who am I talking about? Mr. President, there are \nplenty to choose from. The Institute of Medicine, the National Academy \nof Sciences, the National Cancer Institute, U.S. Department of \nTreasury, and U.S. Surgeon General have all documented the fact that \nincreases in tobacco prices have been shown to decrease tobacco use \namong children.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, economists from the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, University of Illinois at Chicago, University \nof Michigan, among others, have found a strong relationship between \ncigarette prices and youth smoking. Cigarette prices go up, youth \nsmoking declines; cigarette prices go down, youth smoking increases. \nThese institutions that I ticked off are hardly fly-by-night \ninstitutions.\n  If we doubt the expertise of these groups, why don't we take a look \nand see what the tobacco industry has said. I know the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has some quotes from the tobacco industry. I would like to \nsupplement those with others.\n  In 1981, the Philip Morris documents show that company officials said \nthe following:\n  ``Since youth and young adult price elasticity are much larger than \nadult price elasticity''--in other words, the relationship between \nprice going up, consumption down; price down, consumption up; those are \nwhat we call elasticities--``while adult smokers account for the bulk \nof cigarette sales, a substantial excise increase would substantially \nreduce smoking participation by young new smokers, but leave industry \nsales largely unchanged.''\n  In other words, it is the young people who decline. The old people, \nit does not affect them. That is a Philip Morris official saying that.\n  Mr. President, the evidence is clear. The most effective thing we can \ndo to prevent our children from taking that first deadly cigarette is \nto increase the price quickly and steeply.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Kennedy amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the floor managers.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. He \nhas worked on these issues for a long time. I think his voice is one of \nboth reason and enormous credibility.\n  I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank our friend for yielding \nthis time. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership on \nthis, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts for offering this \nimportant amendment.\n  For those of you following this debate who are wondering what is \nhappened here, we are 4 hours behind where we were supposed to be. \nThere was a minifilibuster on the floor here when the Senator from \nMissouri took the floor and slowed us down. So we will have a backlog \nof amendments with the Memorial Day weekend coming in the hopes that we \nwill not finish this bill. This is a time-honored Senate tradition. You \nhave seen it earlier on the floor. We are now 4 hours late.\n  I have an important amendment to offer, and I hope to offer it today. \nAnd others want to do the same. I say to those who are joining in the \nminifilibusters that the clock may be on their side but history is not. \nThey are on the wrong side of history in supporting the positions of \nthe tobacco companies.\n  Pick up the morning paper and take a look at what the tobacco \ncompanies are telling Americans about why they oppose the McCain bill, \nand why they believe the legislation we are considering on this floor, \nwhich would increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes to reduce the \nnumber of children smoking, the tobacco companies say that is wrong. \nAre the tobacco companies credible?\n\n  Exhibit A, photograph A, eight tobacco company executives, 4 years \nago standing before a House committee, under oath swearing that tobacco \nis not addictive. I rest my case about their credibility.\n  There are three issues for us to consider here in this debate.\n  The first, will price increase reduce teen smoking? It has been shown \nand needs to be shown again. We have a living example in Canada. As the \nprice of the product went up, children smoking went down. We know that \nkids have less disposable income. You raise the price of the product, a \nfew of them will say, ``I don't think I can afford this habit.''\n  That is what we are driving at. The experts come along and tell us \nthat is right.\n  We have a statement from Frank Chaloupka, Associate Professor of \nEconomics at the University of Illinois at Chicago who says: ``Based on \nthis research, I estimate that a $1.50 increase in the federal \ncigarette tax''--Senator Kennedy's bill, which I support--``implemented \nover 3 years and maintained in real, inflation-adjusted terms, will cut \nthe prevalence of youth smoking in half.''\n  Will price increases reduce teen smoking? Clearly they will.\n  Second is a $1.50 price increase better than $1.10? It is a \nreasonable question to ask. I think we can see what happens when we \ndeal with an increase of $1.50 over $1.10.\n  Take a look at this chart. If we had no change in the cigarette tax, \nthis is basically what would occur. We would expect the same prevalence \nof smoking. If we had a change of a $1.10 increase in the cost of \ncigarettes, we can see a 34-percent reduction in the number of young \npeople who are smoking. Now, take a look at $1.50. The conclusion is \nobvious; a 56-percent reduction.\n  So as we increase the price of the product, children stop using it, \nnot only in economic models, but in our historical experience in \nCanada.\n  The third question is this taxpayer. That is a legitimate question.\n  I will concede that the opponents of this tobacco legislation say \nthat this tax will necessarily hit lower-income Americans the hardest \nbecause they smoke the most. There are a lot of explanations for that, \nnot the least of which is the tobacco industry, which over the years \nhas really targeted those folks. Go into any inner-city area in America \nand take a look at the billboards and you will see block after block of \nalcohol and tobacco advertising. They believe that these folks and that \nincome category are more vulnerable to become addicted to tobacco \nproducts. They have been successful in luring them.\n  So we can tax the product and it will necessarily hit those in the \nlower-income category. Is it fair for us to tax it? We generally asked \nAmericans what they thought of this idea. I think you might be \ninterested in the results. When a poll was done, this poll was done by \na national organization paid for by the American Cancer Society and \nreleased a few days ago. The results are that a majority, 59 percent of \nAmericans, favor a $1.50-per-pack increase, Senator Kennedy's proposed \nincrease, while only 39 percent oppose.\n\n  When they were asked what would you do with the money that is raised, \nwhat do you think is a reasonable\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nthing to do with these new tobacco revenues, they said additional \nhealth research on cancer, heart disease, and other tobacco-related \nillness.\n  That is in this bill. That is exactly what we are setting out to do: \n82 percent to fund antitobacco education programs--they think that is a \ngood idea--81 percent, programs that are directed toward children to \nget them to stop smoking.\n  So you see what we have here is an attempt to slow down the debate on \nan important piece of legislation that is literally historic.\n  Eleven years ago, the Senator from New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg, and \nI embarked on a little project. I was a Member of the House at the time \nand he was here in the Senate. The two of us introduced and \nsuccessfully passed legislation to ban smoking on airplanes. It was the \nfirst time the tobacco lobby lost on the floor of the House and the \nSenate in history. I was proud to be a part of that partnership with \nSenator Lautenberg, and am happy to serve with him today and to be part \nof this debate as well.\n  How far we have come. Let us not miss this historic opportunity to \npass the Kennedy amendment to make certain that the $1.50 increase will \ntruly reduce the number of kids smoking to make certain that the goal \nof this legislation to protect our children is one that is served. The \ntobacco companies have spent billions of dollars to lure and addict \nthese children. Do we have the courage on the floor of the Senate to \nbeat back the filibuster and to muster the votes to protect those \nchildren and their families? I think we do.\n  I rise in strong support of this legislation. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in voting for it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nextremely articulate and compacted comments. I think it is the House \ntraining that permits him to come over and do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts for allowing me part of the time in the \nremaining minutes for the debate on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to say, first, just a quick note to my \ncolleague now in the Senate, formerly in the House, Senator Richard \nDurbin from Illinois, that at the time we worked on the smoking ban in \nairplanes, it looked like a hopeless quest. Everyone said, ``You will \nnever get it by.'' We worked, we pleaded, we cajoled, and we tried \neverything that we knew.\n  But the odds on the other side were formidable against us. And \nfinally we were able, through consensus, to develop a bill that took a \n2-hour ban on smoking in airplanes with the promise that after a study \nof about 18 months we would reconsider and look at what the \nconsequences were.\n  Well, it was overwhelmingly popular across the country. People began \nto demand that we stop smoking in airplanes altogether. Some said, \n``How can you suggest that a 2-hour ban is all right but a 4-hour plane \nride is full of smoke?''\n  And so it was by popular demand that we were able to get that kind of \na ban in place. And I remind my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, \nin April, the month just closed, we had the 10th anniversary of the \nimplementation of the smoking ban in airplanes. I can tell you, if \nthere is one thing that gets you an applause line when you are doing a \ntown meeting or meet in front of a group, when you say you were part of \nthe authorship of the smoke ban in airplanes, people say thank you, \nthank you, thank you, and tell you tales about not being able to fly \nbefore, having respiratory problems, asthma, you name it, could not get \nin an airplane, and today they feel as if they have been freed.\n  Well, it is the same thing here. This debate, frankly, I must tell \nyou, Mr. President, borders at times on the silly. We have to make a \ndecision here about what we are going to do about protecting the health \nof our people from the ills caused by tobacco and nicotine. And we have \ncome to a conclusion, a sad conclusion, that we cannot change the \ncourse of action. I say this, and I say it with terrible regret. We \ncannot change the habits of some 40 million-plus Americans who are \naddicted to tobacco and nicotine.\n  How they got started is a debate of and by itself, whether it was \nlike it was with me in the Army when they used to give us in our \nemergency rations, in case we got separated from our units or had to \ndepend on that for our sustenance--you always had a four-cigarette pack \nthat you could call on in the event of an emergency when you needed a \nsmoke. People were always waiting for the smoking lamp to go on so that \nthey could smoke. It was encouraged. It was part of our psyche.\n  I can tell you also, as one who smoked for 20-some years, that \nstopping was no easy chore. It is not easy for the 40-plus million \nAmericans who are hooked, stuck, can't get out of the tobacco habit. I \nhaven't yet met anyone who smokes who hasn't said to me: You know, I \nstopped a dozen times. I once stopped for 3 weeks. I once stopped for 4 \nweeks. And then my brother had the car accident. Or, my team lost on \nthe baseball diamond and we all started smoking and sitting around and \nmoaning--here we are, can't get away.\n  But we can get away from it if we help our children not to start \nsmoking in the first place, if we can stop them before they take the \nfirst puff, the second puff, or the 20th puff on a cigarette, because \nwe know that the hook takes like that, like a fish after bait. And that \nis what the tobacco companies are doing. They are trolling. They are \nfishing with bait for more smokers.\n  They now have a campaign on, a campaign to deceive the American \npeople, a campaign to say that they are just another business and that \nall these jobs of the people who work in the tobacco industry will be \nlost and the taxes will be lost. And meanwhile, what they do we \nwouldn't accept from anybody offshore who wanted to attack our America, \nkill 400,000 people a year, maim lots of others, render them at times \nunable to conduct their normal activities, lost productivity from their \njobs, et cetera, and get a tax deduction besides--besides all other \nthings, to be able to deduct the cost of addicting people, seducing \nchildren. It is an outrage.\n\n  Part of the campaign now is very interesting. I get mail, as we all \ndo, from constituents. I have a letter here from a fellow named Jack \nMcDonnell, Rutherford, NJ, which, by the way, is also the home of Tom \nPickering, Deputy Secretary of State, a great diplomat.\n  Mr. McDonnell writes:\n\n       My family received a letter today from the RJ Reynolds \n     Tobacco Company. The letter was addressed to my mother, and \n     requested that she write to you protesting the proposed \n     tobacco legislation . . . Unfortunately, she could not \n     respond herself. She died this February after a long and \n     horrible struggle against emphysema. My father, another ex-\n     smoker, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. My \n     family understands the real costs involved here, and the cost \n     of smoking far exceeds the costs of this legislation.\n\n  Now, what happened is the tobacco companies--and the companies I will \nread off here include Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, Lorillard, \nPhilip Morris, Inc., RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, United States Tobacco \nCompany. They send a letter out to people and they write:\n\n       Dear Mr.--\n\n  In this case, Robert Martin--\n\n       Since you registered your support for the proposed \n     resolution reached last year between the tobacco industry and \n     Government officials, private plaintiffs' lawyers, and \n     members of the public health community, Washington has \n     decided to press an agenda based on politics.\n\n  Politics, not reason.\n\n       Washington has been overtaken by politicians' insatiable \n     desire to tax and spend.\n\n  Not by the insatiable desire of a mother and father to save the well-\nbeing of their child, not in terms of families who want to keep the \nfamily together and do not want to see grandpa with emphysema when he \ngets to be an age when he could still be functioning normally. No; they \ndescribe the insatiable appetite of the politician.\n  Well, Mr. Martin writes to me. They gave him a postcard to which he \ncould affix a signature and send it to my office. And it says:\n\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I strongly urge you to oppose any \n     tobacco legislation that raises taxes, produces a black \n     market in cigarettes, threatens nearly 2 million American \n     jobs and expands the Federal bureaucracy.\n\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n\n  Reject these things. And it is signed with his name. He wrote \nunderneath that postcard. He sent me a sample of the postcard.\n\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I received this item in the mail. \n     As you can see, I was polled over the telephone by a machine. \n     The material given over the phone was very misleading the way \n     that it was presented. I am against smoking and like to see \n     it abolished. I am a lung cancer survivor. Keep up the good \n     work.\n\n  And it carries the signature of Bob Martin. He says:\n\n       If there is anything that I can do to be of help, please \n     call.\n\n  And he lists his phone number.\n  So that is the kind of campaign that is going on with these tobacco \ncompanies, designed to deceive the public that this is a major kind of \npublic interest campaign that the citizens are rising up against. Let \nthem tell the real story. Let them talk about the 400,000 deaths. Let \nthem talk about the lung disease.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I could have 1 more minute, please.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have to get on with the task of passing the $1.50-\nper-pack fee. I point out to you, Mr. President, and those who can see \nit, that the price of cigarettes in major industrial nations is quite a \nbit different than we have here in the United States: Norway, $6.82 a \npack; Denmark, $5.10 a pack; United Kingdom, $4.40. Down we get to the \nU.S.A., with a current price of about $1.94.\n  We know one thing, Mr. President. We have heard it in testimony and \nstatements given by colleagues in the Chamber that the way to stop teen \nsmoking most abruptly, to give them a jolt so that they will bolt, is \nto raise that price and raise it quickly and sufficiently. And $1.50 a \npack will do it. With the $1.50 a pack, we can see substantial \nreductions in the number of those who start smoking. And I hope that \nwhen the votes are counted here, people will look and see how their \nSenators voted to see whether or not they are going to stay with the \ntobacco companies or whether they are going to stay with the families \nand protect the children who will be dependent upon tobacco in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I believe I have about 20 minutes left; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, one of the key issues before this \nChamber is the credibility of the industry. The industry has a long \nhistory here of telling us things that just aren't so. I think we can \nall remember when the industry executives came before Congress, and, \nunder oath, told the U.S. Congress a series of things. One of the \nthings they told us is: ``Tobacco has no ill health effects.''\n  This is from the industry's own documents, which is a reflection on \nthat claim. This is a 1950s Hill & Knowlton memo quoting an unnamed \ntobacco company research director who said:\n\n       Boy, won't it be wonderful if our company was the first to \n     produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to the \n     competition.\n\n  The second claim by the industry has been that nicotine is not \naddictive. Again, looking at their own documents, this is a 1992 memo \nfrom Barbara Heuter, director of Portfolio Management for Philip \nMorris' domestic tobacco business.\n\n       Different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons. \n     But, the primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their \n     bodies. . . . Similar organic chemicals include nicotine, \n     quinine, cocaine, atropine, and morphine.\n\n  These are not my words. These are not the words of the public health \ncommunity. These are the industry's words. And it doesn't stop there.\n  Tall tale No 3: ``Tobacco companies don't market to children.''\n  This is from a 1978 memo from a Lorillard tobacco executive. He said, \n``The base of our business are high school students.''\n  High school students are the base of their business. Is there any \nwonder why we are here on the floor, talking about trying to raise \nprices to deter teen smoking to save lives? We have the evidence from \nthe industry itself. And it doesn't stop there.\n  Tall tale No. 4 in this presentation: ``Tobacco companies don't \nmarket to children.''\n  This is from a 1975 report from Philip Morris researcher, Myron \nJohnston:\n\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . my own \n     data . . . shows even higher Marlboro market penetration \n     among 15-17 year olds.\n\n  In this morning's New York Times we got more confirmation of where \nthis industry stands:\n\n       Last year they estimated that the price increase in the \n     June plan would cause sales to drop by nearly 43 percent \n     among all smokers over a decade. But now that Congress is \n     considering raising prices by twice that much, producers have \n     turned around and said that higher prices would undermine, \n     rather than help, efforts to reduce youth smoking.\n\n  This is a question of lives versus profits--lives versus profits. \nThat is what the evidence shows. Madam President, 800,000 children will \nnot suffer premature death if we go to $1.50-a-pack price increase. The \nquestion is, lives, 800,000 lives, versus profits of the industry, $700 \nmillion of profits. Because that is what the experts at Treasury tell \nus is the difference between $1.10 and $1.50-a-pack price increase. If \nit is $1.10, their profits in 2003 will be $5 billion. If it is $1.50, \ntheir profits are $4.3 billion--a difference of $700 million in profits \nto the tobacco industry in 2003 versus the question of the lives of \n800,000 kids. This is the question before the Chamber, the lives of \nkids or the profits of the tobacco industry. I hope and expect my \ncolleagues will vote to protect the lives of the kids over the profits \nof the tobacco industry.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota again. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself 3 minutes and then I will yield the rest to \nmy colleague from Massachusetts.\n  We heard an argument here today that the price is too high and that \nwe should not have this increase on the price of cigarettes because it \nis unfair to working people. I talked earlier about the impact on \nworking people of not having this increase. But we heard quoted during \nthe course of the monolog this morning a statement by the CBO. I would \nlike to put in the Record the ``Congressional Budget Office Proposed \nTobacco Settlement,'' a statement of April 1998, in which they say:\n\n       Based on a review of the empirical evidence, CBO concludes \n     that price increases would have a significant negative effect \n     on consumers' demand for cigarettes and, depending on the \n     ultimate increase in price, could be a highly effective way \n     of reducing smoking in the United States.\n\n  That is the Congressional Budget Office. Every single independent \nanalysis--and I am talking independent analysis, not hidden analyses \nthat are really one of the tobacco companies under some pseudonym. We \nare talking about the health experts of America, the people who do \nthese under peer-reviewed and appropriate methods of independent study. \nThey all suggest if you raise that price you will reduce teen smoking. \nI think every parent in America understands it. Every kid in America \nunderstands it. It is fundamental common sense as well as economics. If \nthe price of something goes up and you have only so much money in your \npocket, you decide differently how you are going to spend it. That is \nwhy we need to heed the advice of Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, all of these \nexperts, and do this.\n  In addition to that, we have heard if you raise the price it will, in \nfact, increase smuggling. But the truth here again is something \ndifferent. The Deputy Secretary Treasury, who is responsible for \nCustoms and much of our antismuggling effort, said:\n\n       The creation of a sound regulatory system, one that will \n     close the distribution chain for tobacco products, will \n     ensure that the diversion and smuggling of tobacco can be \n     effectively controlled, and will not defeat the purposes of \n     comprehensive tobacco legislation.\n\n  Madam President, that is precisely what the Senator from Arizona and \nthe\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nothers who have worked on this bill have done. There is an effective \nregime in here for antismuggling. There is additional money for \nenforcement. There are additional requirements of markings on cigarette \nboxes. There is a licensing of company requirements throughout the \ndistribution chain. There is accountability in the system. And there is \nthe ability to enforce.\n\n  Moreover, most of the problem of smuggling recently has been American \ncigarettes going to Europe, because they have the higher price and we \nhave the lower price. So this will, in effect, reduce that and create \nan equilibrium. I think most of those arguments have, frankly, been \nmisplaced.\n  In the final analysis, this is a vote about our children. We all know \nthe realities. The statistics have been thrown out again and again. We \nknow how many kids start smoking every day. We know how many will die. \nWe know to a certainty how many Americans are dying every year as a \nresult of the habit they gained when they were kids.\n  If people want a tax cut, the greatest tax cut you could get is to \nreduce the burden of their health insurance, the burden--I yield myself \n1 additional minute--the burden of all of the costs of our society as a \nconsequence of this addiction, of this narcotic substance. It is \nincomprehensible that we should not make it fit into a comprehensive \nplan of control, which is precisely what is in this legislation.\n  So the vote here is very simple. You can vote to try to save the \nlives of children or you can vote on the side of all the money that is \nbeing spent in those advertisements to protect tobacco companies and \nkeep their profits at the rate they are now at the expense of our \nchildren. That is exactly what the vote is on the Senate floor. Every \nexpert says: Raise the price, you reduce smoking of kids. If you don't \ndo that, then you wind up allowing those kids to continue to smoke, to \ncontinue to die, to continue to be addicted.\n  I think the choice is very, very clear. I yield the remainder of my \ntime to the sponsor of this amendment, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 8 minutes \n20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7\\1/2\\ minutes, if I could, please.\n  Madam President, I, first of all, thank our leader, Senator Daschle, \nwho has been a strong supporter of this particular amendment, a strong \ndefender of the health of the young people of this country and their \nfamilies, and my colleagues who have all spoken here, and spoken very \neloquently and compellingly.\n  I thank my friend from Massachusetts, our floor manager, John Kerry, \nKent Conrad, the chairman of our task force, and Frank Lautenberg, who \nis one of the great leaders on the issue of tobacco.\n  I am enormously grateful for Senator Durbin's comments as a leader \nnot only in the Senate now but also in the House of Representatives. \nAnd the eloquence of Bob Graham earlier today and the compelling \narguments that he made, I thought, were enormously convincing.\n  Jack Reed of Rhode Island has been a strong member of our task force \nand a strong defender of public health.\n  Tom Harkin, who has been in and out and has spoken frequently on this \nissue at different times, and many others, I can go down the list of so \nmany in our caucus. I also thank our friend and colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee, for his very strong support on this issue. I \ncommend him for making his statement. He is someone who has been \nstrongly committed to children on different health matters over the \nyears. I thank him for his leadership, and I thank others of our \nRepublican friends who voted for this in the Budget Committee, as well \nas in the Finance Committee.\n  We are very hopeful that in just about 20 minutes or so, when the \nroll is called, that a majority of the Members on both sides of the \naisle, Republicans and Democrats alike, are going to vote with the \nAmerican people, with the families of America and for the children of \nAmerica.\n  There will not be a single vote in the U.S. Senate this year that \nwill be more important to 275,000 children than the vote that we are \ngoing to have 20 minutes from now. We have the opportunity to make a \nmajor difference, a lifesaving difference for those 275,000 children.\n  The overwhelming, uncontroverted evidence that has been demonstrated \nduring the afternoon of yesterday, last night and in the course of \ntoday is the fact that this kind of amendment that we are offering \ntoday that will have bipartisan support can make the greatest \ndifference in the public health of the people of this Nation than any \nother action that we will take in the course of this year. That is a \nfact, Madam President. It is the most important vote that we will have \nthis year on public health for the families of this country, and we \nwill have it in just a few moments.\n  We don't have to go over the facts. We know what will happen if this \namendment is successful. More than 750,000 young people will not \ninvolve themselves in smoking; 250,000 will not develop cancer of the \nlungs; 250,000 will not develop heart disease because of smoking; \n250,000 of them will not develop emphysema, and the list goes on with \ndiseases that result from smoking in this country.\n  Who are we talking about? We talk about children in this country, but \nlet's be very clear about who those children are. We are talking about \nchildren who are as young as 12 years of age. Sixteen percent get \nstarted at 12 years of age; 37 percent are 14 and younger; 62 percent \nare 16 years of age and younger.\n  These are the individuals who are targeted by the tobacco industry. I \nlistened to those crocodile tears of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle about how distressed they are about what is happening to \nworking families. I give them reassurance, they will have a nice chance \nto vote for an increase in the minimum wage later on, and we will see \nhow distressed they are about all those working families that they are \nagonizing about and so distressed about because this is a regressive \ntax.\n\n  The reason it is a regressive tax is because it is the tobacco \nindustry that has targeted the needy and the poor and the working \nfamilies of this country. It is the tobacco industry that is to blame. \nIt isn't these families. How elite and arrogant it is for those on the \nother side of the aisle to cry these crocodile tears for working \nfamilies and their children who are going to get cancer and they don't \nwant to pay those taxes. Those working families care about their \nchildren. They care about them no less than those who come from a \ndifferent socioeconomic background. How arrogant can you be? How \ninsulting can you be to make that argument on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Finally, Madam President, there can be no argument about what has \nhappened over recent times, the explosion--the explosion--of use of \ntobacco by teenagers. It is a national disgrace. It is a national \ndisgrace, and we are faced with these facts.\n  You can talk about smuggling all you want. You can talk about it all \nyou want. These are the facts. This is the issue. Public health is the \nissue, the fact that it is an 80-percent increase among the black \nyouths in this country, 35 percent by Hispanic youths, 28 percent of \nthe white youths of this country, 32 percent year after year after year \nafter year because of the policies of the tobacco industry. And we can \ndo something about it on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The question is, \nWill we do so?\n  The question comes back, If we have to defend ourselves again, all \nyou have to do is--there is one simple chart. We all had our statements \nand our charts. This one says it all. What this chart says very simply \nand is expressed very clearly by Philip Morris in a memo of 1987--\nlisten to this:\n\n       The 1982-1983 round of price increases prevented 500,000 \n     teenagers from starting to smoke. This means that 420,000 of \n     the nonstarters would have been Philip Morris smokers. We \n     were hit hard. We don't need that to happen again.\n\n  There it is on the chart. There it is in 1982. This is the spike in \nthe increase of price, and that is the drop in terms of teenage \nsmoking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 1 more minute.\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\n  I say this is demonstrated right here as clear as can be. What we \nhave seen is, as the price has gone up over a period of years, teenage \nsmoking has gone down, except in 1982 when we had the wars, then we had \nthe drop, and we see that incredible spike and the leveling years with \n$5 billion a year in tobacco advertising, getting those children, \nholding those children, addicting those children in this country.\n  Madam President, now is the time. Now is the time to speak up for the \nchildren of this country. Now is the time to speak out about public \nhealth. We have not heard all morning long, all last night, all \nyesterday, we have not heard the opposition give the name of one \nnotable, credible public health official who denies what we have stated \nhour after hour about the dangers for the children of this country--not \none. They can't answer it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is why this amendment should be accepted.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts. I do so fully supporting \nwhat the authors of the amendment seek to achieve--a reduction in teen \nsmoking.\n  I, too, want to keep tobacco out of the hands of children. And I'm \nconvinced that the best way to achieve that goal is to pass a \nreasonable, comprehensive tobacco bill. I have not abandoned hope that \nsuch a reasonable bill can still be achieved. But I am convinced that \nthis amendment will make it more difficult to pass comprehensive \nlegislation, and I therefore will vote against it.\n  For over a year, I have been saying that I believe a resolution of \nthese issues that have dogged the tobacco industry are in the best \ninterests of all concerned, including children, public health \nadvocates, tobacco farmers, workers and their communities, the states \nand yes, the companies. To achieve the delicate balance that is a \nprerequisite to enacting such a complex bill, however, we need to \nremain centered. If the bill becomes too punitive in the one direction, \nor too protective in the other, we will fail ultimately to take \nadvantage of this historic opportunity to resolve these issues.\n  In that same spirit, I intend to oppose other amendments which would, \nif adopted, make final passage of a reasonable bill much less likely.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2427\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I move to table the Ashcroft second-\ndegree amendment No. 2427, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To ascertain the presence of a quorum, the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the vote on the tabling of the Ashcroft amendment, the \nSenator from Texas be afforded 10 minutes to speak, at which point the \nvote on whatever might occur.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator restate \nthat please?\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, the request is that we would vote on the \ntabling of the Ashcroft amendment now, at the conclusion of that there \nwould be 10 minutes for the Senator from Texas to speak, at which point \nthe manager for the majority, Senator McCain, would be recognized. That \nis my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The yeas and nays have been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question now occurs on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nSmith) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 72, nays 26, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 143 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--72\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--26\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Lott\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Smith (NH)\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2427) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. KERRY.

Madam President, we have had over a dozen Senators who \nhave stood up and said that while the Kennedy amendment raises the \neffective tax on a pack of cigarettes to $1.50 per pack, it has \nabsolutely nothing to do with money. Over and over, our colleagues have \nsaid this is not about money, it is about children. They say they don't \nwant the money, they want the impact of higher cigarette prices to \ndiscourage children from smoking.\n  It seems to me, Madam President, that if that is in fact what they \nwant, that there is a simple way to give it to them, and that is, we \nshould attach to the Kennedy amendment a tax cut aimed at the very \npeople who are paying this increase in the price of cigarettes. In \ndoing that--may I have order?\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I make a point of order that the Senate \nis not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. We will not \nproceed until the Senate is in order. The Senator from Texas is \nentitled to be heard. The Senator's time will not begin until there is \norder.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, we have a dilemma in that our colleagues assure us \nthat while this amendment raises hundreds of billions of dollars, that \nit is not about money. They say they don't want the money, they want \nthe impact of higher cigarette prices. But yet the cold reality is, \nthose prices are going to be paid in higher out-of-pocket costs by \nblue-collar workers all over America. Thirty-four percent of the cost \nof this tax increase that is now pending as an amendment here in the \nSenate will be borne by Americans who make less than $15,000 a year. \nForty-seven percent of it will be borne by Americans who make less than \n$22,000 a year.\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n And 60 percent of it will be borne by Americans who make less than \n$30,000 a year. None of this tax increase will be paid for by tobacco \ncompanies. Sixty percent of the tax increase will be paid for by \nAmericans who make less than $30,000 a year.\n  So if the motion to table the Kennedy amendment fails and the Kennedy \namendment remains pending, it would be my objective to offer, along \nwith Senator Domenici, a second-degree amendment that will repeal the \nmarriage penalty for working Americans in families that earn less than \n$50,000 a year. In doing so, Senator Kennedy would have the higher cost \nof tobacco, but the same people who are paying that tax, while seeing \nthe cost of cigarettes rise would, by having the marriage penalty \neliminated, where Americans who fall in love and work at the same time \nand get married now end up paying higher taxes for the privilege of \nbeing married, have that penalty eliminated, so that we would still get \nthe impact of a higher price on inducing children not to smoke.\n  But blue-collar working Americans, a waitress and a truck driver who \nare married and who both smoke, under this bill will pay an estimated \n$712 in new taxes, new excise taxes. We should give that money back to \nthem in a tax cut so that we don't dramatically lower the living \nstandards of blue-collar workers.\n  I want to remind my colleagues of the incredible fact that the \namendment before us, the Kennedy amendment, will mean that Americans \nwho make less than $10,000 a year will see their Federal taxes rise by \n53 percent.\n  So I urge my colleagues, in this rush to tax tobacco companies, to \nremember that the Kennedy amendment does not tax tobacco companies, it \ntaxes Americans who basically make less than $30,000 a year. It will \ndrive up the Federal tax burden of those who make less than $10,000 a \nyear by over 50 percent.\n  So I hope my colleagues will table the amendment. But if they don't \ntable the amendment, Senator Domenici and I will offer an amendment \nwhich lets the tax increase stand but simply takes the money and gives \nit back to blue-collar working families who are, I have to remind my \ncolleagues, the victims in this debate.\n  There is a terrible paradox that, instead of taxing the tobacco \ncompanies, we are taxing the very people who have been induced to \nsmoke, and therefore the victims are being punished with an \nexcruciating, bone-crushing tax increases so that a working couple will \npay $712 in taxes a year as a result of the Kennedy amendment.\n  If, in fact, our colleagues are only interested in the impact on \nteenage smoking, then they won't object to the amendment that Senator \nDomenici and I are offering because we don't take the tax off, we \nsimply say take that money, eliminate a discrimination in the Tax Code \nagainst married, working people, blue-collar families making less than \n$50,000 a year, and give them the money back. Also under our provision, \nwe would adjust for the marriage penalty before you calculate the \nearned income tax credit so that the substantial amount of the benefits \nwould go directly to those Americans who are making less than $10,000 a \nyear who are going to see their Federal tax burden grow by over 50 \npercent under this bill.\n\n  I would like to first ask my colleagues to remember, this is not Joe \nCamel that this bullet is getting ready to hit. This is not a big \ntobacco company. This is Joe and Sara Brown, two hard-working Americans \nwho have been induced to smoke. They are the victims in this whole \nprocess. And, yet, we are getting ready to take $712 a year out of \ntheir pockets. If we don't table this amendment--and I hope we do table \nit--Senator Domenici and I will offer an amendment that will take the \nmoney that is raised from this tax increase and we will give it back to \nthe very people who are going to pay these higher taxes. But we will \ngive it back to them by eliminating the marriage penalty, so that they \nwill have to pay more for tobacco, and hopefully they will stop \nsmoking. But they won't be poorer. They won't see their Federal tax \nburden go up by 50 percent. They won't be crushed by an oppressive and \nvery, very punitive and regressive tax.\n  Let's remember, it is the victim of the process who is being \nassaulted by this amendment. I hope my colleagues will vote for the \nMcCain motion to table it. But if they don't, Senator Domenici and I \nwill try to give our colleagues what they claim they want. That is, \nthey want the tax; they don't want the money. Well, let's give the \nmoney back to blue-collar working families in West Virginia, in Texas, \nin New Mexico and across the country who make less than $50,000 a year \nand who need every penny they get. They are the people who are outraged \nabout the fact that they have been exploited by being induced to smoke \nand in many cases have become addicted to nicotine. They are the ones \nwho are being harmed by the amendment we have before us.\n  I think the issue is clear. I hope my colleagues will not impose this \nmassive tax increase of $712 on a blue-collar working family where both \nthe husband and the wife smoke. I hope they will not crush them with \nthis tax. But if they decide to, if they decide to do it, then Senator \nDomenici and I will have an amendment to give the money back to married \ntaxpayers by eliminating the marriage penalty for American families \nthat earn less than $50,000 a year, and we will make the adjustment \nabove the line so that those who receive the earned income tax credit, \nthe poorest people in America who work, will receive the benefit of our \ntax cut.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am going to make a motion to table the \nKennedy amendment. Before I do, I would like to, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues who would like to know what is going on here, say our \nintention is--and none of this is by unanimous consent--but our \nintention is to move to the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, \nwho has an amendment concerning immunity.\n  In our custom of going back and forth, since Senator Gramm was the \nlast speaker, I would like to have Senator Kerrey of Nebraska be able \nto speak for about 15 minutes. Then we would move to Senator Gregg.\n  I would like to have a vote on that tonight. But I also urge my \ncolleagues to come and talk on the bill as well as its amendment, \nbecause I have been told by Members on both sides of the aisle that \nthere is great frustration that they have not been able to address the \nentire bill, much less amendments.\n  I intend to stay tonight as long as is necessary. I will force the \nSenator from Massachusetts to do the same thing, and we will try to get \nas much debate and discussion of this very important bill before we \nleave tonight.\n  Madam President, at this time I move to table the Kennedy amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have cleared this with all concerned \nparties, including the Democratic leadership.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the veto message to accompany S. 1502 be \nconsidered as read, printed in the Record, and spread in full upon the \nJournal, and further, that it be set aside to be called up by the \nmajority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval S. 1502, the ``District \nof Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1998.''\n  If we are to prepare our children for the 21st Century by providing \nthem with the best education in the world, we must strengthen our \npublic schools, not abandon them. My agenda for accomplishing this \nincludes raising academic standards; strengthening accountability; \nproviding more public school choice, including public charter schools; \nand providing additional help to students who need it through tutors, \nmentors, and after-school programs. My education agenda also calls for \nreducing class size, modernizing our schools and linking them to the \nInternet, making our schools safe by removing guns and drugs, and \ninstilling greater discipline.\n  This bill would create a program of federally funded vouchers that \nwould divert critical Federal resources to private schools instead of \ninvesting in fundamental improvements in public schools. The voucher \nprogram established by S. 1502 would pay for a few selected students to \nattend private schools, with little or no public accountability for how \nthose funds are used, and would draw resources and attention away from \nthe essential work of reforming the public schools that serve the \noverwhelming majority of the District's students. In short, S. 1502 \nwould do nothing to improve public education in the District of \nColumbia. The bill won't hire one new teacher, purchase one more \ncomputer, or open one after-school program.\n  Although I appreciate the interest of the Congress in the educational \nneeds of the children in our Nation's Capital, this bill is \nfundamentally misguided and a disservice to those children.\n  The way to improve education for all our children is to increase \nstandards, accountability, and choice within the public schools. I urge \nthe Congress to send me legislation I have proposed to reduce class \nsize, modernize our schools, end social promotions, raise academic \nstandards for all students, and hold school systems, schools, and staff \naccountable for results.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, May 20, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5190-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5190-S5215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have had a good bit of discussion today \nand two very important votes. I hope that we can move on now to some \nother amendments that really are important and will determine how this \nlegislation is eventually written.\n  I thank Senators again for keeping calm and working through this. The \nmanagers are working very diligently. I emphasize again to my \ncolleagues, while I think every Senator obviously needs to have the \ntime and will have the time he or she needs to make a statement, I do \nthink it would be wise if you can say what you have to say and we can \nmove on. To go for an extended period of time on an amendment 2, 3, 4, \n5 hours is going to make it very difficult to ever get a satisfactory \nresult.\n  I hope Senators will agree to some reasonable time limits. I am not \ngoing to ask for a unanimous consent agreement now. I don't think it is \nnecessary, but I will suggest the form that we might take in a consent \nagreement as to how to proceed.\n  It is my hope that Senator Gregg from New Hampshire will be \nrecognized next to offer his amendment, with Senator Leahy, regarding \nimmunity. Senator Gregg and Senator Leahy have been circling the area \nsince we started. They are ready to go. The debate should last the rest \nof this session today. It is my hope that the vote on, or in relation \nto, that amendment can be scheduled to occur first thing on Thursday \nmorning--I mean early--so we can move to the next amendment, which will \ncome from the Democratic side. Senator Daschle and Senator Kerry will \nhave to decide what amendment that will be.\n  Following the disposition of that amendment offered by the Democrats, \nthen I hope the Senate will consider the farmers' protection issue and \ndebate it, have a vote on that issue or issues in a way, hopefully, \nthat is agreeable and as fair as possible to both sides of that issue. \nThen we will really have a feel for where we are and can make an \nassessment about time and where to go from there.\n  I hope that Senators are comfortable with that. I think that it is a \nfair way to proceed alternating back and forth. We are not ducking the \ntough issues. This last amendment was a key amendment. This next \namendment is a key amendment. The farmers' amendment is critical to all \nconcerned. So I hope this will be acceptable and we can move in this \nway. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is, I think, a superb way to proceed. \nIt is the way we have been trying to proceed. I thank the majority \nleader for trying to structure it that way.\n  There was an understanding prior to that that the Senator from \nNebraska will proceed for 15 minutes, at which point Senators Gregg and \nLeahy will be recognized for their amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank both the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for allowing me to speak.\n  I have come to the floor to speak about the tobacco bill. I began \nseveral months ago to have conversations with Nebraskans about this \nlegislation. The first question I was asked is, Why do we need it? What \nhas happened here? All of a sudden we have a $368 billion to a $516 \nbillion piece of legislation being introduced and people want to know \nhow we got to where we are today.\n  I would like to describe, at least as I see it, how we got to where \nwe are today in May of 1998, from a point just as recently as 2 years \nago when there was no piece of legislation on the floor even remotely \napproaching something like this. ``Why all of a sudden is Congress \ntaking on something like this,'' is the question I get asked. I will \ntry to give Nebraskans an answer.\n  The second question I get asked is, ``What are we going to do? What \nis the purpose here?'' On behalf of 1,600,000 Nebraskans, I will \ndescribe what this law is attempting to do, what is the piece of \nlegislation which Senator McCain and Senator Kerry have brought before \nthis body all about.\n  The short answer to the question ``How did we get to this point?'' is \nthat there was a potential lawsuit. There was litigation that was being \nproposed by States' attorneys general against tobacco companies. There \nwas an attempt through the discovery process to get internal tobacco \nindustry documents, and one of the tobacco companies said, ``We'll \nprovide you the information you need to proceed with your case because \nwe are concerned that what we know is going to be discovered\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\nanyway, that there was an effort to withhold information from the \nAmerican people.''\n  What happened, in addition to some changes in State law, is that on \nthe 20th of June, 1997, there was an agreement--it was not even a year \nago--with 40 attorneys general in the United States and the tobacco \nindustry.\n  What they agreed to, Mr. President, on the 20th of June 1997, is very \nimportant, especially now that the tobacco companies have broken off \nfrom the settlement and are now advertising against this legislation in \nour States.\n  Again, I emphasize that the reason we are debating this tobacco bill \ntoday is not because the tobacco industry is afraid of Congress, and \nwhat we may do to them. Rather, they are afraid of 12 faceless men and \nwomen of a jury. They are worried about the evidence being introduced \nand now stipulated in court, showing that the tobacco industry knew \nnicotine was addictive and lied about it. They were, and still are \nworried about what a jury would do with this evidence. They were, and \nstill are scared that a jury will end up costing them a whole lot of \nmoney. That was the power that produced this offer to settle at $368 \nbillion.\n  That begs a question that Nebraskans need to try to answer. What was \nin that initial offer to settle? What were the tobacco companies \nwilling to do back on the 20th of June 1997?\n  First of all, they agreed to pay $368 billion over 25 years. They \nsaid they would make annual payments starting at $10 billion, going up \nto $15 billion by year 5, and every year thereafter.\n  Although they do not spell it out in terms of a per-pack price \nincrease like you hear them advertising against today, to make the $15 \nbillion-per-year payment, the tobacco industry would have raised the \nprice of cigarettes by approximately 62 cents a pack. Less than a year \nago, they, not Congress, were going to raise the price of cigarettes by \n62 cents a pack. Yet now, less than a year later, they have launched \nthis huge advertising campaign trying to convince you that Congress is \nthe bad guy trying to raise your taxes. They did this to settle \nlawsuits that they were afraid of.\n  Indeed, the next amendment that we are going to talk about is their \nliability. They were concerned about future liability, and they were \nwilling to pay out $15 billion a year, costing smokers about 62 cents a \npack, so they would not have to worry about it anymore.\n  They also agreed to pay $50 billion up front in punitive damages, \nmeaning for all their past wrongs that they knew they were guilty of \nabout misleading the American people, about nicotine's addictiveness, \nand marketing to our children.\n  Next, they agreed to let the FDA regulate nicotine as a drug. Next, \nthey agreed to pay huge fines if goals of reducing teen smoking were \nnot met. And, finally, they agreed to restrict their advertising and \nmarketing to youth.\n  I say, Mr. President, that almost all of what I have just described \nis in this tobacco bill. That is what the Commerce Committee has voted \nout of Committee, and that is what we are debating on the floor today. \nYet, less than a year after the tobacco settlement, the tobacco \nindustry is spending millions of dollars trying to convince the \nAmerican people that they had nothing to do with any of this and that \nCongress is the bad guy. This is the message they have paid lots of \nmoney to convince the people of. I have seen it in their television \nads, on postcards that are being mailed in to my office, and from the \nthousands of phone calls that I have received. Everything that they are \nobjecting to, and convincing others to object to, they agreed to back \non the 20th of June 1997.\n  A lot has happened since that settlement, Mr. President, that has \ncaused significant change to this legislation. First, the tobacco \nindustry settled a suit in Florida for $11 billion, they settled a suit \nin Texas for $15.3 billion--but the settlement that really changed the \nlevel of the playing field that we are on today was the one that \nhappened 12 days ago in Minnesota on the 8th of May. After 3 months of \na closely watched trial, just hours before the jury was going to get \nthe case, Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III and the tobacco industry \nsettled the case for $6.5 billion.\n  There were lots of firsts in this settlement. This was the first \nsettlement with a health insurance provider, in this case Blue Cross \nand Blue Shield, getting $469 million of the $6.5 billion.\n\n  This was the first settlement where the tobacco industry signed a \nconsent promising not to misrepresent the health hazards of smoking.\n  And perhaps most significantly, this was the first settlement where \nthe State received more money than it would have collected under the \n$368 billion settlement last June.\n  The $6.1 billion they settled on 12 days ago is 50 percent more than \nthe $4 billion they would have received under last summer's settlement. \nThis is significant. This is the justification for going from 62 cents \nto $1.10 per pack. This is the justification for increasing the total \namount that we are asking the tobacco industry to pay into the tobacco \ntrust.\n  Already, the tobacco industries have said they will raise prices to \nhelp defray some of their legal expenses. Indeed, in the past 9 months \ncigarette prices have been raised about 20 percent to help offset the \ntobacco industry's legal bills.\n  Again, Mr. President, I tell you the history of this bill because it \nis important to understand how we got to where we are today. A single \ntobacco company broke away from the rest and disclosed information that \nenabled us to get a settlement on the 20th of June 1997. There has been \nadditional settlements in Texas, in Florida, and most significantly in \nMinnesota that increased the dollar amounts from the base level \nagreement that was formed on the 20th of June 1997.\n  Mr. President, the next issue to discuss, this bill and the goals of \nthis bill, is a bit more difficult because things are changing at such \na rapid pace. The way I see it, from talking to Nebraskans about this, \nis that the goal of this legislation is clear. We need to prevent \nteenagers from starting to smoke and to help those Americans who do \nsmoke and want to quit.\n  Why, Mr. President? Well, there are a couple of reasons why. The most \nimportant one of which is that we now know, stipulated in court \ndocuments, that nicotine is addictive. It is not habit forming, Mr. \nPresident. It is addictive. And the qualities of the addictive property \nof nicotine, taken together with the toxins that are contained in the \ntobacco itself, create a tremendous public health problem.\n  I have 352,000 Nebraskans who smoke. I do not just want to raise the \nprices on those Nebraskans to try to decrease the amount of \nconsumption, along with FDA regulation and advertising and other sorts \nof things, I want to make certain that the money in this bill helps \nthem stop smoking.\n  Now, that should be our crusade. That should be our cause. Tobacco \nkills prematurely nearly 400,000 people every year. Approximately 2700 \nof these are Nebraskans.\n  Tobacco consumption produces tremendous health problems for the \n352,000 Nebraskans who smoke. And the best way for me to mitigate the \nproblem associated with an increased price is to give them a tax cut by \nhelping them stop smoking so their medical costs and lost wages from \nmissed work will be lower. My belief is, as we examine not only what \nthis legislation does in terms of regulation, in terms of advertising, \nin terms of restrictions on smoking in public places to make sure that \nwe reduce the number of people who become involuntary smokers as a \nresult of inhaling secondhand smoke, is that we pay attention to how \nthe money is spent. This is so we have some confidence that in our \nindividual States those citizens out there who are currently smoking, \nwho are addicted to nicotine as a consequence, that those individuals \nhave a chance to get off this addiction that is reducing the quality of \ntheir health and decreasing their life spans.\n  Mr. President, I examined the numbers in Nebraska. And 25 percent of \nthe men in Nebraska smoke; 19 percent of women smoke; 39 percent of all \nmy teenagers smoke. Nebraskans without a college degree are nearly \ntwice as likely to smoke as those with a college degree. A third of \nNebraskans with an income of $15,000 or less smoke compared to only 15 \npercent of those who earn $50,000 or more.\n  Again, Mr. President, tobacco is killing my people. And 2,700 of the \npeople who prematurely die every single year in the United States of \nAmerica are\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nNebraskans. It is addictive. It causes a physical compulsion, a \nphysical need. Taken in small doses, nicotine produces pleasurable \nfeelings that make the smoker want to smoke more. A majority of smokers \nwho become dependent on nicotine will suffer both physical and \npsychological withdrawal symptoms when they stop smoking.\n  Their symptoms are going to include nervousness, headaches, \nirritability and difficulty in sleeping, among other things.\n  Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago I met with 10 or 12 high school \nstudents in Burke High School in Omaha, NE. And I talked to them about \nthis problem of addiction. I think about 7 of the 12 were smokers. One \nof the students explained to me that ``A cigarette,'' she said, ``is my \nfriend.'' She is 16 years old. ``A cigarette,'' she said, ``is my \nfriend . . . it is always there for me: When I'm driving in my car, \nwhen I'm stressed out, when I'm going through a crisis . . . cigarettes \ndon't go out of town, I can count on them no matter what.''\n  I asked about 100 students to fill out a questionnaire about tobacco. \nAnd one of the more disturbing results in their answers was that the \noverwhelming majority of the current smokers said that although they \nsmoked today at age 16, and though some may continue smoking until they \nare 18, the overwhelming majority of these students said, ``We're going \nto quit.''\n  Well, Mr. President, because unbeknownst to them--and until recently \nthe tobacco companies were not stipulating that nicotine is addictive; \nnow it is universally recognized that it is--unbeknownst to these \nstudents, they are addicted. They have a physical craving for something \nand it is going to be very difficult for them to stop. Unbeknownst to \nthem, 90 percent of the 352,000 Nebraskans who smoke started smoking \nwhen they were teenagers. That is when it began.\n  So unbeknownst to them, they may think they are going to quit, but \nunless we intervene, and unless we help them--and hopefully through \nthis legislation we can help them--they are going to have a heck of a \ntime kicking this addiction.\n  Mr. President, cigarette smoking is harmful. Cigarette smoking, we \nnow know, is not only addictive, but taken as directed it is likely to \ndecrease your life span, likely to shorten not only your ability to \nwork, but shorten your time on Earth as well.\n  Mr. President, I intend during the course of the debate on this \nlegislation to focus my attention on a number of things.\n  One, this legislation must prevent teen smoking. It must reduce the \namount of teen smoking. I think perhaps one of the most important \nthings we are doing is giving FDA the authority to regulate.\n  I was practicing pharmacy back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth in \n1965, when Congress was debating whether or not to regulate Dexedrine, \n15 milligrams. This was a weight loss pill. It was the most rapidly \nmoving pharmaceutical in my drugstore in 1965. You could get a \nprescription from a doctor and refill it every other day if you wanted \nto for 500 Dexedrine. And the pharmaceutical industry was saying, ``No. \nIt is habit forming; it is not addictive.'' Today, through FDA \nregulation, Dexedrine 15 milligrams is available only for narcolepsy, \nand only small amounts are sold. I think the most likely reduction of \nteen smoking is going to occur not through the price increase, but \nthrough FDA regulation.\n\n  In addition, Mr. President, I intend to bring amendments to the floor \nto say that we have to make certain that we have community-based \nefforts in our States to reduce smoking of the adults out there who are \nalso addicted. It has to do that. It cannot be a top-down effort. It \nhas to be a community-based effort. The citizens are more likely to \nknow what needs to be done. I believe every single State needs to have \nsome kind of a research scholar connected to NIH to lead us in this \neffort.\n  This is a tremendous public health problem. It has come upon us, the \nhistory of the bill and the seriousness of this problem, relatively \nquickly. I am hopeful we can make certain this legislation gives us a \nfighting chance in my State, at least not just of increasing prices and \nincreasing the regulatory action, but of engaging the citizens \nthemselves and the smokers themselves in a serious challenge of trying \nto break themselves from this habit.\n  Finally, I know we are going to be debating on this floor the \nprovisions relating to the tobacco farmers. I am of the opinion that \ntobacco farmers need some assistance. It was not in the original \nsettlement. I praise Senator Ford and Senator Hollings for their work \nin trying to get provisions in there, but I believe these provisions \nare too generous and we need to scale them back. It is difficult for me \nin a State that grows corn, soybeans, wheat, barley, and lots of other \nproducts--under the Freedom to Farm Act they are getting substantially \nless than what tobacco farmers will be getting out of the program. I \ncan make a case tobacco farmers ought to get more, but I cannot make a \ncase they ought to be given all that is in this bill.\n  It is my hope that during the course of this constructive debate we \nare able to pass a piece of legislation that will increase regulation, \nthat will increase the price, will increase our involvement in our \ncommunity and decrease the consumption and the addiction to a substance \nwhich is killing our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 2433 to Modified Committee Substitute\n\n(Purpose: To modify provisions relating to civil liability for tobacco \n                             manufacturers)\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, this amendment has received a fair amount \nof attention and I believe is fairly well understood by most of the \nmembership, but it is important that we have a substantive discussion \nof it and an open debate of it over the next couple of hours. As I \nunderstand, Senator McCain has allotted that type of a time window. I \nvery much appreciate that.\n  I want to thank Senator McCain for his courtesy in allowing us to put \nthis amendment in order at this time, and certainly I appreciate the \nmanner in which he has managed this bill in such a fair way.\n  The immunity issue is really at the essence of this bill and the \npublic policy which this bill addresses. What we have here is an \nindustry which produced a product which it knew killed people. It is an \nindustry that produced a product which it knew addicted people. In \nfact, it created additives to that product so it would addict people at \na higher rate than were the product sold in its natural state. Then, \nknowing that it had a product that killed people, and knowing that it \nhad a product that addicted people, it then targeted the sales of that \nproduct on our kids.\n  That is an industry which deserves very little in the way of courtesy \nor support or protection--and that is what this amendment is about, \n``or protection''--from the U.S. Congress. Yet, within this bill there \nis proposed language which would give a historic, unprecedented \nprotection to the tobacco industry from liability on their lawsuits.\n  Now, we have addressed this issue before in this body. In fact, not \ntoo long ago there was a sense of the Senate which said there shall be \nno immunity for the tobacco industry. That sense of the Senate passed \nthe Senate by a 79 to 19 vote. This amendment is the real thing. It is \ncalling to account that sense of the Senate.\n  Now, the question here goes to the manner in which we, as a country, \nsell products. We are inherently the most capitalist, market-oriented \neconomy in the world. As a result, we have been the most prosperous \nsociety in the world economically. What this amendment is about is \nmaintaining a capitalist marketplace approach to the issue of the sale \nof a product in our society.\n  What this bill does in its present form is institute an antimarket, \nanticapitalist approach into the process of producing and selling a \nproduct in this society. It gives an artificial, inappropriate, \nlegislative protection to an industry from what has been the \ntraditional way in which consumers have a right of redress against that \nindustry.\n  Remember, in our society when a consumer, when John and Mary Jones \nfrom Epping, NH, are sold a product that doesn't work, they have a \nvariety of different avenues to address the failure of that product. \nShould that product harm them, one of their most appropriate avenues is \nto go to court to bring an action against the producer of that product \nand to get a recovery. That has been basically one of the essential \nelements for disciplining the marketplace in our capitalist society. We \nhave not, as has been pursued in other nations, especially those that \nuse a Socialist form of management of their marketplace, we have not \nhad the Federal Government or any government come in and tell a \nconsumer what they can and cannot buy, except in very limited \ninstances. And we have certainly not limited that consumer's ability to \nrecover should they be sold a product that doesn't work or that harms \nthem.\n  The right of redress in the court system, the right of redress for a \nconsumer, is at the essence of having a competitive marketplace and a \ndisciplined marketplace. When you eliminate that right of redress, \nwhich this bill does, when you take away the ability of the consumer, \nof the person who has been damaged, of John and Mary Jones of Epping, \nNH, to get a recovery for an injury they have received, you have \nartificially preserved the marketplace. But more importantly, you have\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\ngiven a unique, historic, and totally inappropriate protection to an \nindustry.\n  Now, let's think about this for a minute. Why would the Federal \nGovernment at any point in its history want to step in and bar the \nability of the consumer to use the judicial method of protecting \nthemselves in the marketplace? There might be instances where that \nwould happen--national defenses might be an example. Under our law, \nonce we did that in the area of people working at nuclear weapons \nfactories. There was a national defense issue.\n  Or it might occur if a product was deemed so beneficial that it was \nimportant to protect it. In those instances, of course, we have a \nsituation where the Government raises the visibility of the need to \nprotect the society as a whole over the individual. That has never \nhappened. We have never found a product that was so beneficial. Or if \nwe have, it has only occurred in the rarest of instances, so beneficial \nthat we give that sort of protection. So that is a very unusual \nprotection, to say the least.\n  But what we have here is the granting of a significant, unusual \nprotection of immunity to an industry that produces tobacco, which, as \nI mentioned in my opening statement, is a product that kills people, \nthat addicts kids, and addicts people and is targeted at kids. It is \nvery strange that we should pick that industry for which to give this \nsort of protection.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2434 to Amendment No. 2433\n\n(Purpose: To modify provisions relating to civil liability for tobacco \n                             manufacturers)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2434 to amendment No. 2433.\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, the amendment is a second-degree amendment, \nwhich simply perfects the amendment I offered, the underlying \namendment. I will give a copy of the changes to the other side. I don't \nthink they will find that they change the basic thrust of the original \namendment.\n  As I was discussing, the amendment goes to the question of immunity \nand why we would choose, for the first time in the history of this \ncountry, to grant immunity to an industry from lawsuits, which \nbasically changes the whole concept of the marketplace system in our \ncountry--why we would choose the tobacco industry to which to give that \nimmunity. It is just beyond comprehension that an industry that \nproduces a product that kills people, which they designed to addict \nkids, would be chosen as the industry to which we are going to give \nimmunity protection. It makes absolutely no sense. It skews the \nmarketplace. I simply point out to those who might be of a conservative \nphilosophy and may be following this argument that to have done this is \nan absolute affront to the concept of capitalism and a free market \nsociety.\n  Now, there is an attempt in the bill to address the liability that \ntobacco companies generate as a result of their action--an $8 billion \ncap. Some will tell us that is a lot of money and that should satisfy \neveryone as a manner in which to redress the concerns of the consumer, \nof the individuals, of the kids, of the parents, the mom and pops, who \nhave been damaged by the tobacco companies. And $8 billion is a huge \namount of money on an annual cap for recovery on the loss. But it \nobviously isn't what the market sees as the potential liability here. \nOtherwise, there would not be a cap in the first place. So by its very \ndefinition it is an affront to the concept of a market-type approach to \nthe selling of products in this country.\n  Equally important is the way this cap works. It gives a \ndisproportionate amount of power to the tobacco companies to decide who \nthe winners and losers are, because it is essentially a race to the \ncourthouse. The tobacco companies, under the proposal in this bill, \nwould control who gets to the courthouse first. If they decided the XYZ \nlawsuit was more amenable to them to settle than the ABC lawsuit, or \nMary Smith's lawsuit was less desirable to them, for some reason, than \nHank Jones', they can settle the ABC lawsuit, the XYZ lawsuit, and the \nMary Smith lawsuit, but they cannot settle the Hank Jones lawsuit, they \ncan make him litigate. And, by the time he is finished, they have \nsettled these other ones and, poof, the $8 billion is gone. So not only \ndoes it have the total irony of perverting the marketplace, it has the \nirony of giving the tobacco industry the capacity to choose who the \nwinners and losers are in the process of determining people who are \nsuing them for being caused physical damage.\n  Can you think of anything more ironic? You have been damaged, your \nhealth has been destroyed, or maybe someone in your family has died as \na result of the tobacco industry's actions, or some child was addicted \nand that child dies and the tobacco company gets to choose whether or \nnot that person is going to be a winner under the lawsuit process. How \nunbelievably ironic and absurd that is. But that is the way this cap \nworks. This is just one of the many, many technical problems with the \nconcept of a cap, because what I think it reflects is the idea that \nwhen you put an artificial cap into a huge, dynamic economy like the \nUnited States', you are basically creating all sorts of unintended \nconsequences that don't flow naturally in a capitalist system. Much \nmore appropriate is that you allow the capitalist system to proceed in \nits usual and orderly course.\n\n  Now, others will say, well, if you don't have immunity, then you \ninevitably drive these companies into bankruptcy. To begin with, we \ndon't have any idea that that is true. What we know is that these \nindustries are extraordinarily profitable. We know that, right now, \nthey are pursuing major buy-backs. Philip Morris, an $8 million buy-\nback; RJR, a buy-back of its stock. When you start buying back your \nstock as a corporate leader, you are saying your stock is undervalued. \nIf your stock is undervalued, it is the ultimate test that in the \nfuture you have a better chance of progressive sales and a strong \nmarket force for your industry.\n  So the concept that if they don't have immunity, they are going to \nend up going bankrupt, I think the marketplace has discounted and \nrejected that and said that is not going to happen. In fact, there is a \ntremendous earning capacity out there, and we already know there is a \ntremendous capacity to pass on to the consumer, because that is the \ntheme of this bill--to pass on to the consumer a significant part of \nthe cost. As long as they can pass through that cost, it doesn't impact \nthem at all, doesn't impact their capacity at all.\n  So from a substantive standpoint, bankruptcy doesn't make any sense \nas a defensive argument to this. But just from a purely logical \nstandpoint, it even makes less sense. Think about it this way. We are \nsaying that to save the industry from bankruptcy we have to put on this \ncap. But at the same time, we have to tax it. The reason we are taxing \nit is to discourage people from consuming the product. And the logical \nextension of that is that if you are successful in taxing people and \nmanaging to discourage them from using the product, you are going to \nreduce utilization, which one presumes would inevitably lead to the \ncollapse of the industry and potentially bankruptcy.\n  So the bill, by its very nature, is inherently saying that the \noptions of bankruptcy are there, but they are going to do it on a \ndifferent system--through the tax system. Yet, they won't allow the \nmarketplace to make that decision. They won't allow the marketplace to \ndecide whether or not this industry survives, which is the way, \ntraditionally, we have done it in this country. We don't traditionally \nsay to an industry, well, you are about to go bankrupt, which is \nsomething that this industry can't say, certainly in light of what it \nis doing with stock values--so we, the Federal Government, are going to \nstep in and give you unique protection; we are going to give you \nliability protection. And we certainly don't say it to an industry that \nhas produced a product that kills people and has addicted them.\n  For those people who don't believe this industry knew their product \nwas addictive, I will cite a few quotes. We have here quotes from the \nBrown & Williamson documents, disclosed as a result of the Minnesota \ncase, and from documents of RJR. Brown & Williamson in 1978--that is a \nlong time ago; this wasn't just yesterday:\n\n       Very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, \n     i.e., its addictive nature, and that nicotine is a poison.\n\n  These folks knew a long time ago that they were selling an addictive \nproduct that killed people. This is a quote from RJR:\n\n       Tobacco companies are basically in the nicotine business. . \n     .Effective control of nicotine in our products should equate \n     to a significant product performance and cost advantages.\n\n  That is a pretty cynical statement. It reflects the fact that the \ntobacco industry knew they were selling an addictive product.\n\n       Nicotine is the addicting agent in cigarettes.\n  The evidence is beyond question. They knew that it was a poison, that \nit killed people, and they knew it was addictive.\n  Second, there are some who may say, ``Well, they don't really target \nkids.'' That is very hard to defend also because the facts speak for \nthemselves from their own documentation. They look on kids as their \nsource of future revenues.\n  This is from the RJR documents of 1974:\n\n       Let's look at the growing importance of the young adult in \n     the cigarette market. In 1960, this young adult market, the \n     14-24\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\n     group, represented 21 percent of the population . . . they \n     will represent 27 percent of the population in 1975. They are \n     tomorrow's cigarette business.\n\n  How cynical could you be? Let's first produce a product that kills \nyou, let's make it addictive, and then let's target it at kids.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator be willing to yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to complete my statement, and then I will \nyield.\n  In 1974, ``Marlboro dominates in the 17 and younger age category, \ncapturing over 50 percent of the market.''\n  Obviously, Philip Morris knew that Marlboro was making money in that \narea.\n  I will not read the next statement, but it has the same context. Kids \nwere the target.\n  So we have here, as I mentioned earlier, the concept that we are \ngoing to be giving immunity, for the first time in our history, to an \nindustry. What industry do we pick? Do we pick the people who are \nmaking heart valves so you can live longer? Do we pick an industry that \nmakes hip joints to make you live longer? Do we pick the industry that \nis making a drug that will maybe make your life easier? Do we pick an \nindustry that makes cars so you can get places faster? No. We pick an \nindustry which targets kids with a poisonous product that they made \naddictive. And they knew it all along.\n  The last argument that we hear is,\n\n       We can't do this bill unless we have the tobacco companies \n     cooperate, and we can't have cooperation unless we have some \n     sort of immunity for the tobacco companies, unless we give \n     them this historic new authority and protection.\n\n  First off, that is not true. The vast majority of the advertising \ncontrols that we think are needed can be done without the tobacco \ncompanies' participation. Yes, there are some issues of the first \namendment that we can't step over. But for the most part, we can do a \ngreat deal to limit their access, especially to kids.\n  Second, we can compete with them. We can produce our own advertising \nprograms, which compete much more aggressively than they can in the \nmarketplace. Of course, that is the traditional American way: Make the \npoint, make it effectively, that tobacco kills.\n  But, most importantly, I think it ought to be pointed out here that \nwe are making a deal with the Devil and the Devil walked away from the \ntable. There is no tobacco company participation in this process any \nlonger. Here we are offering them the most significant legal protection \nprobably in the history of the country in exchange for them being \nwilling to give us some limited ability to limit their advertising \nactivities, and they are not even at the table to accept the offer. In \nfact, they have walked away from the table. They said they don't want \nto have anything more to do with this process.\n\n  The quote from the head of RJR is:\n\n       The extraordinary settlement, reached on June 20th last \n     year, that could have set the Nation on a dramatically new \n     and constructive direction regarding tobacco, is dead. And \n     there is no process which is even more remotely likely to \n     lead to an acceptable comprehensive solution this year.\n\n  With that statement, he walked out. He said, I am not going to \nparticipate in this and tobacco is not participating in this anymore.\n  So you have this almost pathetic situation where the U.S. Congress is \npassing immunity and giving this outrageous new authority to the \ntobacco companies to protect them from lawsuits. The tobacco companies \nhave walked away, and the U.S. Congress is sort of chasing after them \non bended knee, saying, ``Please, tobacco companies, please, tobacco \ncompanies, please take our offer.''\n  My goodness. First, we make a deal with the Devil, and then we chase \nafter him asking for him to take our deal. I mean it is just \nridiculous, it is inappropriate, it is not becoming of the Congress, \nand it is wrong.\n  The language which Senator Leahy and I have proposed here is \nessentially the same language which was in the original HEALTHY Kids \nbill, which was endorsed by the White House. I regret that we have not \nreceived White House support for reinserting this language. I regret \nthat the leadership within this Congress has not supported the \ninsertion, although on the House side I note, I believe that the \nSpeaker supports no immunity language, although I don't want to speak \nfor him. I have read reports to that effect.\n  But the point is that this is not dramatic language, it is not \noutrageous language, it is the language that was in the original \nHEALTHY Kids bill, and it essentially says no immunity. It says what \nthis Senate said back when we passed the sense of the Senate 79 to 19: \nNo immunity for the tobacco industry, because they don't deserve it, it \nis wrong, and it is inconsistent with the capitalist system.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator for a question. The Senator from \nMassachusetts had a question. And then I will yield to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. I know the Senator from Vermont has \nto go somewhere.\n  I want to ask the Senator if he is aware that there is a real \ndistinction between the notion that he has been using called \n``immunity'' and a limit on the exposure of liability. In fact, in this \nbill there is no immunity. They are liable for up to $8 billion on an \nannual basis. So that is not immunity.\n  Will the Senator not agree that the use of the word ``immunity'' is, \nin fact, an exaggeration?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I would not. I happen to think the use of the word \n``immunity'' is correct. The fact is that we are setting up a new \nstructure here where, for the first time, we are giving product \nliability protection to an industry which clearly doesn't deserve it. \nThe term ``immunity'' has become a term of art relative to that \ndiscussion. From my standpoint, the term of ``immunity'' properly \ndefines that. If the Senator from Massachusetts wishes to define it in \na more narrow sense and say, ``We are giving them product liability \nprotection but we are not giving them immunity,'' that is the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts's definitional approach, and that is fine. But the \npoint is the same. We are creating a unique, unusual, significant \naction which changes the jurisprudence that has dominated the \nmarketplace in this country for 200 years.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator is aware, obviously, that Minnesota settled a \nlawsuit. Minnesota settled a lawsuit, and other States have settled \nlawsuits, and in those settlements there is, in fact, the same kind of \nstructure contemplated in this bill. That is part of the system of \njurisprudence, is it not? It is a normal part of how you arrive at a \nsettlement of a dispute?\n  Mr. GREGG. First off, there is no lawsuit against the Federal \nGovernment. So that I don't think is applicable. I don't serve in the \nlegislature of Minnesota. If I did, I certainly would not have agreed, \nand I would change the law of Minnesota to not allow that settlement to \nhave gone forward should that decision be found to be constitutional, \nwhich I don't know whether it will be or not.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be brief. I want to say to the Senator that I will \nbe very brief.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is there an order of procedure, informal \nor otherwise?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that my good friend from Arizona, \nwho is managing the bill, sought recognition, and I will be perfectly \nwilling to yield to him for that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment \nof my friend and my neighbor from New Hampshire. I was thinking about \nthis. I thought to myself, why should we give big tobacco any special \nlegal protections? My friend from New Hampshire said that we are not \ndoing this for a medical company because they build some new kind of \nheart valve, and to get it out, we will give them special \nprotection; or somebody else comes up with a new cancer drug and we \nwant to give them special protection. We are\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\nbeing asked to give this special protection to tobacco. I have to tell \nyou, Mr. President, I don't have a whole lot of people in Vermont \nrushing up to me and saying, ``Oh, please, please, please, give \nimmunity to the tobacco companies. This is our No. 1 priority.''\n\n  In fact, this is whom they are asking to give immunity to. Mr. \nPresident, look at this stellar group standing, raising their hand, \nswearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, and \nthen they sat down and lied. I remember my days as a prosecutor. We \nused to see lineups like that, but they were usually a different type \nof lineup and you had numbers across the front.\n  These are not the people I want to give immunity to. These are not \nthe people I want to go back home to Vermont and say, ``I voted to give \nthem immunity.'' In fact, yesterday the former Surgeon General, Everett \nKoop, and the former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Kessler, endorsed the Gregg-\nLeahy amendment because they know Congress can protect the public \nhealth without having to protect big tobacco.\n  This really comes down to the issue of, Do you have to protect big \ntobacco in order to protect public health? I say no. What we should be \ndoing is protecting public health, that is it, not protecting big \ntobacco.\n  Now, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Hollings, and the White House have done a great job in \nnarrowing the list of special legal protections in the managers' \namendment, and I compliment Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and the \nWhite House for what they have done. But now that the Senate begins \nfloor debate on this revised bill, we have to go beyond that. We have \nto take the great work that my neighbor from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, and the others I have named have done. Then we have to say, once \nand for all, we are rejecting the tobacco industry's siren song for \nunprecedented legal protections.\n  I applaud Senator Kerry and Senator McCain and Senator Hollings and \nthe White House for going as far as they did, but I want to now go \nfurther, lock the door, close the door once and for all, and allow us \nall to go back home to our States and say we stood up to big tobacco, \nwe voted against immunity. It is time for Congress, and especially the \nSenate, to scrap the last remnants of the original sweetheart deal of \nimmunity for the tobacco industry. That was the sweetheart deal that \nwas in the proposed national settlement.\n  In theory, the tobacco industry will restrict its future advertising \nin exchange for legal protections from past punitive damages and other \npast and future damages. I reject this mirage of a deal because it will \nevaporate in a court of law. Any affected industry that is or is not \npart of the deal, such as a retailer or distributor or even a tobacco \ncompany, might sue to block these restrictions as being in violation of \nthe first amendment.\n  Many advertising experts, including the head of the Federal Trade \nCommission, predict such a suit will succeed in throwing out the \nadvertising restrictions as unconstitutional. In the end, Congress will \nhave been duped again by the tobacco industry. They will have given \nunprecedented legal protections in exchange for empty promises. They \nwill have said, ``You guys fooled us before when you testified under \noath, but we know you have now found religion and you are going to be \nfined this time and you haven't fooled us again.'' It reminds me of \nCharlie Brown and the football: ``Don't worry, Charlie Brown, I won't \npull the ball out this time.'' And we see that, of course, every year. \nOut goes the football, and flat on his back goes Charlie Brown.\n\n  Well, let's not do that to the people of this country. We have \nlearned a lot more about the industry's schemes. We have seen what \nAttorney General Skip Humphrey in Minnesota has pried loose from the \nhundreds of thousands of internal tobacco documents. Let's take a look \nat some of this.\n  Let's look at some of these things that came out of Minnesota, the \nreleased tobacco documents. Now, this is just marketing that is aimed \nat children. Look at this one:\n\n       To ensure increased and longer-term growth of Camel Filter, \n     the brand must increase its share penetration among the 14-24 \n     age group which represents tomorrow's cigarette business.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a typographical error. They are talking \nabout how they will increase--not just to start people at 14 years old \nbut how they will increase the market among 14-year-olds.\n  Philip Morris starts off being a little bit more responsible by \nsaying:\n\n       Marlboro dominates in the 17--\n\n  But then we see--\n\n       and younger age category.\n\n  RJR ``Product Research Report'':\n\n       Salem King shows encouraging growth by posting a four point \n     gain in the 14-17 market.\n\n  You wonder if whoever wrote this about encouraging growth, do they \nhave children of their own? Do they have children of their own that \nthey would brag about that?\n  Or look at Brown & Williamson:\n\n       At the present rate a smoker in the 16-25 year age group \n     will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect \n     in any other broad age category.\n\n  Again, Mr. President, as a parent, I find this reprehensible. To them \nthis was just marketing, and is that the kind of conduct that we should \nreward with unprecedented legal protection, that we should reward \npeople who target 14-year-olds? To use the language of the same 14-\nyear-olds, get real. We can't do it. If we grant immunity to this \nspecial rogue industry, we have lost all our common sense.\n  But if we go with the bill as now written, we will establish an $8 \nbillion annual cap on damages for tobacco claims. That is about $20,000 \nper family for the 400,000 Americans who die from tobacco-related \ndiseases each year. These are special provisions. They are unnecessary. \nWhy should the industry stop marketing to children? Why should they \nstop manipulating nicotine? Why should they stop cutting health \nresearch when they know this liability cannot exceed a certain amount? \nIf they know the liability is capped, then it just becomes a marketing \nploy.\n  Some might say, ``Well, they would not do that because they promised \nus.'' This is like saying the check is in the mail, I gave at the \noffice, or a few other versions of that. Why should anybody trust them? \nI do not. A liability cap eliminates the incentive for the tobacco \nindustry to change its corporate culture. It is kind of like having two \nwarehouses side by side and one has got locks on the doors and one \ndoesn't. And you have somebody who is inclined toward burglarizing a \nplace, and they say, ``Oh, I promised not to burgle those places.'' \nWell, they are not telling us the truth. We know which one they are \ngoing to go into. They are going to go into the warehouse without the \nlock. Let's put some locks on it.\n  I think, if you don't have the incentive of real liability facing \nthem, the promises they make to get the Congress off their backs today \nare the promises that will be forgotten tomorrow. If big tobacco could \nturn its liability exposure to fixed costs which they could pass on to \nconsumers and taxpayers, then they can keep on doing business as usual \nwithout the risk of litigation.\n  How will the liability cap work? Will it reward today's plaintiffs at \nthe expense of future injured parties? Because most lawsuits settle, I \nbelieve the tobacco industry will have a unique negotiating edge if \nthey have a liability cap. The industry will have every incentive to do \nsweetheart deals with favorite plaintiffs--do that first, then use the \nprospect of delayed payments in the future to force smaller \nsettlements. A payment delayed will result in justice denied for \nthousands of tobacco victims.\n  I said earlier, each week, when I go back home, I don't have a lot of \nmy fellow Vermonters coming up to me and saying, ``Hey, Pat, give \nimmunity to the tobacco industry.'' We Vermonters are known for our \ncommon sense. My fellow Vermonters are telling me that immunity for big \ntobacco makes no sense. In fact, the Vermont legislature \noverwhelmingly, Republicans and Democrats alike, passed a resolution \ncondemning any immunity for the tobacco industry in Federal \nlegislation. I think that is because the American people outside the \nbeltway understand that big tobacco does not deserve any special legal \nprotections.\n  I take seriously the admonition of Mississippi Attorney General \nMichael Moore, whom I respect greatly, who told the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last year that the proposed settlement\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\noffers Congress a historic opportunity to seize the moment and protect \nthe health of future generations. But I believe that we can seize this \nhistoric opportunity to curb teenage smoking without giving big tobacco \nany special legal protection. Under our amendment, a State may resolve \nits attorney general's suit or take on the tobacco industry in court, \nas Minnesota did. It is up to the people of that State, instead of \nWashington. That is the same approach used in the Conrad bill that has, \nI think, 32 cosponsors.\n  I am confident in my State of Vermont, Attorney General William \nSorrell knows the facts in his lawsuit against big tobacco. He is going \nto weigh the interest of Vermonters in deciding to opt out of the \nbill's settlement provisions. As one Vermonter, I am perfectly willing \nto put that decision in the hands of our elected officials in our \nState.\n  Our approach puts the interests of the children ahead of the \ninterests of the tobacco lobby. The public health community agrees that \nimmunity for the tobacco industry makes no sense. The Advisory \nCommittee on Tobacco Policy and Public Health, headed by Drs. Koop and \nKessler, wrote to Congress:\n\n       We oppose granting the tobacco industry immunity against \n     liability for past, present or future misdeeds. Congress \n     should focus its efforts on public health, not on the \n     concessions the tobacco industry seeks.\n\n  I agree. I agree. Dr. Koop called a liability cap a huge corporate \ngiveaway. He is right. I agree. After all, the only reason we are \nhere--and it is really a credit to it--is our civil justice system. In \nfact, without the use of class actions, without the likelihood of \npunitive damage recoveries, we all know tobacco companies never would \nhave come to the negotiating table. So let's not change our successful \nState-based tort system as it involves tobacco legislation. It has \nserved us well. After all, the same people who were in the picture I \nshowed earlier, raising their hands, swearing they will tell the truth, \nthe whole truth, nothing but the truth so help me--and I think they \nwere swearing on a tobacco leaf because now the Department of Justice \nis currently investigating them for criminal conspiracy and perjury. I \nwould say, if I can move that metaphor a little bit further, strip away \nthe tobacco leaf and see what is hidden behind it. I am not going to \ngive legal immunity to the same people who appeared here and lied to \nCongress while under oath.\n\n  Why in the world do we want to give big tobacco such legal \nprotections? Rely on common sense. Rely on the things I hear from my \nfellow Vermonters as I am in the grocery stores back home. Rely on what \nI hear, as I am walking down the street, from Vermonters of all \npolitical persuasions. Rely on the common sense I hear from my \nneighbors and friends of a lifetime back home. Then we will reject the \nunprecedented legal protections for the tobacco industry, and we will \nvote for the Gregg-Leahy amendment.\n  I believe it makes sense. I certainly find myself in total agreement \nwith what the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, \nsaid. That is the way I feel about it.\n  I understand from earlier discussions with the distinguished leader \nwe may not vote on this today; we may vote on it tomorrow. But whenever \nwe do, think what is in the best interests of the country. Think what \nis in the best interests of the people. And think, every Senator, how \nyou would answer this question when you go home if you are asked: Are \nyou willing to give immunity, even limited immunity, to the tobacco \ncompanies or not? If you are not, then you vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to both of \nthe proponents of this measure, for both of whom I have respect. But I \nmust say this amendment is really not connected to the reality of what \nis in this bill or the reality of what we are trying to achieve with \nthis bill. And I say that respectfully.\n  You might dub this amendment the ``kick the tobacco companies hard no \nmatter what the consequences'' amendment. This is the amendment if all \nyou want to do is hate the tobacco companies, all you want to do is \ncome here and show photographs of children or show us how terrible the \ncompanies have been. Nobody is going to argue. We all know that. We \nknow the companies have lied. We know they have been egregious in their \nbehavior. We know they targeted young people in this country. We know \nthey have come to the Congress, raised their hands, and not told the \ntruth. We understand all of that.\n  The question is, What are we going to be able to achieve here in the \nU.S. Senate in terms of conditioning their behavior, within the limits \nof our Constitution, within the limits of our ability to do so. We have \nheard the words said that the tobacco companies ``do not deserve \nimmunity.'' That is correct. They do not deserve immunity. And they are \nnot receiving immunity under this bill. There is no immunity. They are \nliable. There are simply two choices as to how they are liable.\n  They can be liable by paying the annual payments that will now come \nfrom the $1.10 that appears to be at least settled for the time being. \nThey will pay from that. And they will, in addition to that, have very, \nvery rigorous so-called look-back assessments. They will have to live \nup to those look-back assessments. Where, if they do not achieve a \nspecific level of reducing smoking among teenagers, then they get hit \nharder. They pay more. They pay more as an industry, up to $4 billion \non any year, and they pay more per child that is deemed not to be \nmeeting that level of reduction--$1,000.\n\n  That is a pretty steep penalty, $4 billion plus the assessment per \nchild if they don't meet the reduction levels; that is, if the \ncompanies do not decide to be part of the solution. If all they do is \nget assessed the $1.10 assessment, and all they do is meet the \nstandards of the look-back, they are subject to suit forever--forever. \nThere is no immunity. They are liable. They are liable--not even under \nthe cap. There is no cap under those circumstances. I ask my colleagues \nto focus on that in this bill. This is a two-part bill. One part offers \nthe companies the opportunity to be part of the solution. Only if they \nbecome part of the solution does there then apply a so-called cap on \nannual payments.\n  Even if there is a cap on annual payments, there is no immunity; \nthere is no avoidance of liability. We heard my colleagues stand here \nand say--let me quote it: ``The liability cap permits them to avoid \nchanging the corporate structure.''\n  Not true, Mr. President. The liability cap does not permit them to \nchange to avoid it. In fact, they only get a liability cap if they \nagree to change the corporate structure. That is the way it works now. \nThe incentive of the cap is the commitment to change the corporate \nstructure. If they change the corporate structure by agreeing to live \nby the FDA rules, by agreeing to live by the advertising restrictions, \nby agreeing to a whole set of requirements, that is the only way they \nqualify for the so-called cap.\n  The cap is annual. That is not immunity. That means they can be \ncharged up to $8 billion in the industry for every year on into the \nfuture, and it is indexed, incidentally, for inflation. That is \nimmunity? That is why so many people are on the floor saying, ``Hey, \nwait a minute, what are you folks doing in the U.S. Senate?'' because \nthere are some people here who think that is too tough.\n  The fact is, and I emphasize this again and again, there are two \nchoices for the companies: They can either take the assessment, be \nassessed the $1.10 and have the look-back provisions hanging over their \nheads and be sued and sued and sued by a State or an individual on into \nthe future, or they can decide they are going to sign up.\n  What are they going to sign up to? Each company will sign up to a \nwhole set of restrictions--FDA advertising restrictions, they would \nmake a substantial up-front payment, they would abide by the far \nbroader advertising restrictions that were in the June 1997 settlement, \nthey would create a document depository, and they would agree not to \nchallenge provisions in the bill and to abide by these provisions, \nnotwithstanding any future decision from the court on \nconstitutionality.\n  That is really critical, Mr. President. We are asking these companies \nto do a whole bunch of things that we can't get them to do unless they \nagree. We can't mandate that they give up their constitutional rights. \nNo matter what we\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\npass here, these companies have constitutional rights under the first \namendment. They have to come in and sign a consent decree and sign an \nagreement, and they have to agree, among other things, that there will \nbe no billboards within 1,000 feet of a school; that all advertising \nwill be black and white text unless in adult-only stores; that all \nadvertising in the text must be in black and white, unless in magazines \nwith 15 percent or less youth readership; it prohibits the sale or \ngive-away of any products with tobacco logos; it prohibits brand name \nsponsorship of sporting and entertainment events.\n  We can't do those things, unless the tobacco companies agree. What \nthey agree to is that they will do that. Even if the court decided \nlater that it is unconstitutional, they will abide by it. How are we \ngoing to get them to do that? How are we possibly going to get these \ntobacco companies to become part of the solution of keeping our kids \nfrom doing things unless they agree to do it, and the fastest way to \nkeep them from agreeing to do it is to say to them, ``We're just going \nto kick you around forever and forever, be subject to lawsuits forever \nand forever'' and not offer some incentive to come on board.\n  I reiterate, that is not immunity, it is a deal. It is a deal just \nlike the attorney general of Minnesota made, the attorney general of \nMississippi and the attorney general of Florida. That is what happens \nin the courtrooms of our country every single day. If you bring a \nlawsuit, as 44 attorneys general have done, then you go to court. But \nmany of these cases come to some kind of settlement before they \nultimately go to a jury verdict.\n\n  I remind my colleagues, the Senator from New Hampshire and the \nSenator from Vermont, in all of the years of bashing tobacco, in all of \nthe years of hating tobacco, in all of the years of summoning up these \nspeeches that whack them apart and say what they have done, not one \nlawsuit has been won in a courtroom. Not one.\n  What my colleagues are suggesting is that somehow the country is \ngoing to be better off by allowing that status quo to continue; that \nall we are going to do is have a bunch of lawsuits rather than trying \nto bring the companies into the process of helping to resolve this \nissue.\n  Again I say, if you want to have a document depository which, \nincidentally, helps people continue to sue and they are able to \ncontinue to sue up to the level of the $8 billion per year, that is not \nimmunity. The best of my judgment is that is a limitation on the \nexposure of immunity. It is a limitation on the degree to which you are \ngoing to have to pay out in a given year, and that is precisely the \nkind of certainty that the tobacco companies and the attorneys general \nwere trying to achieve in the agreement they came to last year.\n  Here we have in front of the U.S. Senate the opportunity to raise the \nprice and the opportunity to have very stiff look-back provisions that \nwill hang over the heads of the company. Let me just cite what those \nare, Mr. President, if you don't think those aren't tough. There are \ntwo look-back assessments. There is an industry-wide assessment and \nthere is an individual assessment.\n  Under the industry-wide assessment, the industry is going to have to \nreduce youth smoking 15 percent in years 3 and 4, 30 percent in years 5 \nand 6, 50 percent in years 7 and 9, and 60 percent in years 10 and \nbeyond.\n  If the industry fails to meet these targets, then there will be a \ngraduated industry-wide assessment of the following amounts: $80 \nmillion per point for missing the goals by 1 to 5 percentage points, \n$160 million per point for missing the goals by 6 to 9 percentage \npoints, and $240 million per point for missing the goals by 10 or more \npercentage points.\n  The total industry assessment will be capped at $4 billion per year, \nwhich is about 22 percentage points, and this will not be tax \ndeductible. If the industry fails to meet the youth smoking targets, \nthey will have to pay about 27 percent per pack. In addition to that, \nthere will be a company-specific amount of an assessment annually--\n$1,000 for each child who uses tobacco beyond the youth smoking \nreduction targets.\n  Mr. President, there is no way to suggest that that is immunity. You \ncan't be required to engage in that if you, in fact, have immunity. If \nyou have immunity, you walk away free. Immunity means you are not going \nto be prosecuted. Immunity means you don't pay. Immunity means there is \nno price. There is clear liability here and the liability, I think, is \nserious.\n  A final comment I will make is that participating manufacturers--and \nthis is very important--must agree to comply with all of the provisions \nin the act, including the provisions in look-back and in the annual \nassessments. They must also agree not to bring any court challenges to \nany provision in the act.\n  I ask the Senator from New Hampshire rhetorically, we can't get them \nto agree not to go to court. They are already challenging the FDA rule. \nThey are clearly going to challenge the constitutionality of the look-\nback provision. The only way we can get them to participate is by \noffering something, and the something is that you are going to settle \nthe lawsuits and you are going to have the ability to give them \ncertainty as to how much their liability is on an annual basis.\n\n  Also, they will agree to abide by the provisions in the act, \nincluding the annual payment in the look-back provision, even if a \nthird party challenges that provision and it is declared void by a \ncourt.\n  I emphasize that. Even if a third party challenges it, the tobacco \ncompanies that sign the protocol and agree to get the $8 billion \nlimitation on their annual liability will still have to agree to live \nby it. If any of them break any component of this act, they have no cap \nat all. They are subject to exactly what the Senator wants.\n  Here is the choice for the U.S. Senate: It is a choice of whether we \nare going to have a piece of legislation that makes sense, that is \nbuilt on common sense, that tries to bring the companies into the fold, \nthat tries to create a solution for this problem, or you just come out \nhere and feel happier bashing the companies.\n  And I think the choice is very, very clear for the Senate. I think \nthe Senator from Arizona, and Senator Hollings, and the others who have \nworked on this particular effort to create this structure have struck a \nbalance of that common sense and of a way of achieving the goals of the \nSenate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be brief, because I do not want to take the time \nfrom the Senator from Alabama who is going to speak next.\n  So I just mention administratively that, after discussion with the \nSenator from Massachusetts and with the majority leader, it would be \nour intention to have either a tabling motion or an up-or-down vote on \nthis amendment and the second-degree amendment around 10 o'clock \ntomorrow. It is my understanding that we will be in at about 9:30, and \nthat would give a half-hour tomorrow morning. So whether we have the \nunanimous consent agreement or not, that would be the intention of the \nSenator from Massachusetts and myself.\n  Second, the majority leader has asked me to announce that there will \nbe no further rollcall votes tonight.\n  I would like to say, and point out to my colleagues, that I have \nheard all day today that some of my colleagues have felt that they have \nnot been able to speak on the bill. There are others who want to speak \non the amendment. I encourage you to come over. As I mentioned earlier, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and I will remain here until such time \nas everyone is heard both on the bill and on the amendment.\n  So finally, Mr. President, I just received a letter from the \nPresident addressed to Senator Lott expressing President Clinton's \nopposition to the Gregg-Leahy amendment. I ask unanimous consent that \nthat letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I applaud the Senate for taking up \n     comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to dramatically reduce \n     teen smoking.\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\n     Every day, 3000 teenagers start smoking regularly, and 1000 \n     will die prematurely of smoking-related diseases as a result. \n     I urge the Senate to move swiftly to pass comprehensive \n     legislation that could save those children's lives.\n       Last September, and in my budget plan, I set forth five \n     principles for comprehensive tobacco legislation: Raising the \n     price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack over 5 years with \n     additional surcharges on companies that continue to sell to \n     kids; affirming the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco \n     products; getting companies out of the business of marketing \n     and selling tobacco to minors; promoting public health \n     research and public health goals; and protecting our tobacco \n     farmers and their communities.\n       I have made protecting tobacco farmers and farming \n     communities a top priority for this legislation, and I \n     believe Senator Ford's LEAF Act fully meets this standard. I \n     am deeply troubled by the Senate Leadership's recent attempt \n     to undermine protection for tobacco farmers and their \n     communities. I urge the Senate to work through this impasse \n     and ensure that small, family farmers are protected.\n       If that issue can be resolved to my satisfaction, the bill \n     before the Senate, as amended by Senator McCain's Manager's \n     Amendment, is a good, strong bill that will make a real dent \n     in teen smoking. Congress should pass it without delay.\n       I applaud Senator McCain and others in both parties who \n     have worked hard to strengthen this legislation. I am \n     particularly pleased that the bill contains significant \n     improvements which will help reduce youth smoking and protect \n     the public health:\n       Tough industry-wide and company-specific lookback \n     surcharges that will finally make reducing youth smoking the \n     tobacco companies' bottom line;\n       Protection for all Americans from the health hazards of \n     secondhand smoke;\n       No antitrust exemption for the tobacco industry;\n       Strong licensing and anti-smuggling provisions to prevent \n     the emergence of contraband markets and to prosecute \n     violators;\n       A dedicated fund to provide for a substantial increase in \n     health research funding, a demonstration to test promising \n     new cancer treatments, a nationwide counteradvertising \n     campaign to reduce youth smoking, effective state and local \n     programs in tobacco education, prevention, and cessation, law \n     enforcement efforts to prevent smuggling and crackdown on \n     retailers who sell tobacco products to children, assistance \n     for tobacco farmers and their communities, and funds for the \n     states to make additional efforts to promote public health \n     and protect children; and\n       The elimination of immunity for parent companies of tobacco \n     manufacturers, an increase in the cap on legal damages to $8 \n     billion per year, and changes to ensure that the cap will be \n     available only to tobacco companies that change the way they \n     do business, by agreeing to accept sweeping restrictions on \n     advertising, continue making annual payments and lookback \n     surcharges even if those provisions are struck down, make \n     substantial progress toward meeting the youth smoking \n     reduction targets, prevent their top management from taking \n     part in any scheme to promote smuggling, and abide by the \n     terms of the legislation rather than challenging it in court. \n     Because the First Amendment limits what we can do to stop the \n     tobacco companies' harmful advertising practices--which lure \n     so many young people to start smoking--we can do far more to \n     achieve our goal of reducing youth smoking if the companies \n     cooperate instead of tying us up in court for decades. If a \n     cap that doesn't prevent anybody from suing the companies and \n     getting whatever damages a jury awards will get tobacco \n     companies to stop marketing cigarettes to kids, it is well \n     worth it for the American people. I, therefore, oppose the \n     Gregg Amendment to strike the liability cap.\n       I strongly support these improvements, and I urge the \n     Senate to pass this legislation without delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator from Alabama has been waiting. I just \nmisspoke on one thing, and I want to, if I may, correct it, take 2 \nminutes, and then I will yield the floor.\n  When I talked about the things that the advertising is going to \nrequire, that was the components of the FDA rule itself. I want to just \nshare with my colleagues how, by bringing the companies in, it goes way \nbeyond the FDA rule, because they would then be agreeing to have a ban \non human images, animal images, and cartoon characters. They would \nagree to a ban on outdoor advertising, including stadia and mass \ntransit, they would agree to a ban on Internet ads accessible to \nminors, and they would agree to severe restrictions on point-of-sale \nadvertising of tobacco products. All of those things are what you get \nfor having the companies agree to be part of the process.\n  The final comments I would make is, I began the process very much \nfeeling that there should not be sort of a restraint liability, in a \nsense. When we sent this bill out of committee, there was a great deal \nmore restraint with respect to liability. And since the Commerce \nCommittee effort in putting the managers' amendment together, we have \ntaken out an extraordinary number of those restraints. I will not go \ninto detail now, but all of them were taken away, so that there was \nconsiderable increased exposure of the companies, which is one of the \nreasons why the companies are spending so much money now advertising \nand trying to refocus America on what this bill is not. And I think \nthat is a critical thing for us to keep in mind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for summarizing \nmany of the very significant restrictions that will be placed on the \ntobacco companies if they participate in the settlement.\n  But I really do believe, and can say with great confidence, that we \nare not dealing with a question of immunity when an industry agrees to \npay $750--$70 billion in payments to subject itself to many other \ncontrols and limitations. That is not immunity. And in fact, they have \nagreed, in addition, to pay $8 billion into a fund that would be \navailable for individual liability lawsuits--each year, $8 billion. It \ngoes up according to the cost of living index.\n  So I just say, this is a remarkable settlement. And it reminds me of \nthe case in which the client sues and gets everything he wants but he \nstill wants to keep suing because he wants to get a drop of blood.\n  Now, let me say this. I am not a defender of tobacco. I do not take \nany money from the tobacco industry. I believe it is a very damaging \nproduct to people's health. I know that as certainty as I am able to \nknow anything. I oppose its use. I believe anything we can do \nparticularly to keep youngsters from getting involved in tobacco is \ngood, because it is more difficult for them to quit once they start, \nand they become addicted quicker at a younger age. It is a very \ninsidious product, and we ought not to do anything that would undermine \nour effort, that I think has bipartisan support, to deal with smoking \nin America.\n  Let me talk about this subject on a broader basis. And I think our \nMembers ought to consider this on both sides of the aisle. It is above \npartisan politics. In my view, the law is too much with us late and \nsoon. We have too much litigation. Courts are clogged all over America \nwith more and more lawsuits every day. People cannot get speedy \njustice. Cases are backed up. Costs have increased. And it is not a \npretty sight.\n  As policy-setting Members of this Government of the United States, it \nought to be our goal to reduce that litigation, to do what we can to \nobtain justice in ways that do not require citizens of this country to \nexpend extraordinary sums of money over long periods of time for only \nmodest gain at the end of it. That is a principle in which I believe \ndeeply.\n  I have been a practicing lawyer all my career. I served as a U.S. \nattorney for almost 12 years, and I practiced law in private practice.\n  Let me just mention the asbestos litigation situation. Asbestos \ncaused a number of different diseases that have resulted in large \npayments by the asbestos companies. This was handled, in the normal \nlitigation of America, in the torts lawsuits that have been filed. Over \n200,000 of those lawsuits have been filed and concluded, 200,000 more \nare pending, and it is estimated there may be another 200,000 filed.\n  Now think about that. That is 600,000 lawsuits, perhaps more, having \nto wind their way through the court system, with lawyers, and fees, and \ncosts, and expenses. According to testimony we had before the Judiciary \nCommittee by one expert who studied this matter, less than 40 percent \nof the money paid by these asbestos companies actually got to the \nvictims, the people who were suffering disease because of their \nexposure to asbestos. Just think about that. Less than 40 percent of \nthe money they\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\npaid actually got to the victims of asbestos disease.\n  I think that is unacceptable. That is an unjustifiable event. It does \nnot reflect credit on the legal system, and it does not, even more so, \nreflect credit on the Congress and the Senate of the United States, \nbecause we should have legislation that can deal with that in a more \nefficient way.\n  So I just say, I am troubled by the prospect that we will allow \nlitigation to spring up all over America, that we can have a fund there \nto pay it, that we will have not 200,000 smoking suits, as they had in \nasbestos, but perhaps 500,000, 800,000, a million, several million \nlawsuits filed--tens of hundreds, maybe thousands in every community in \nAmerica, large and small, where lawsuits will be filed, clogging the \ndockets of the courts, taking up weeks to try, and incurring great \nexpense. It seems to me we can do better than that. I am certain that \nwe can do better than that.\n  What happens when a lawsuit of this nature is filed? And I have to \nagree with Senator Gregg from New Hampshire: This bill is not effective \nin what it intends to do. It needs to be amended. And Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont and I will be introducing legislation on this bill, an \namendment, that will distribute moneys that are paid in a fair and \nequitable manner, with the minimum of cost and the quickest possible \nturnaround time, so the people who are ill can receive compensation \nwhich they deserve, receive it quickly, without even having a lawyer.\n\n  Under the court system approach, just turning over tobacco lawsuits \nto litigation throughout America, we are talking about individuals \nhaving to hire attorneys. The Wall Street Journal has already noted \nthat attorneys--I believe, in Detroit or Chicago--are advertising for \ntobacco clients now. They are already advertising for clients so they \ncan file lawsuits. Traditionally, they will charge at least one-third, \nprobably more of them will charge 40 percent of the recovery on a \ncontingent fee basis. That means 40 percent of the money paid out by \nthe tobacco company won't go to the victim, but will go to the \nattorneys. In addition to that, there will have to be trials, court \ncosts, jury costs, deposition costs, medical costs, expert witness \ncosts, and great delays.\n  Before you can get any money out of this bill, you have to have a \nfinal judgment. Normally that would mean a judgment by the supreme \ncourt of the State, which may be 2 years or more in the offing. The \nresult of that, I suggest, for people who are suffering from lung \ncancer is that many of them, unfortunately, would not live to see any \nrecovery.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is also correct that it appears under \nthis bill the tobacco companies decide who gets paid. I don't know how \nthat came about, but it indicates they pay whoever they want to pay and \nthat counts toward their payment into this fund. That is not a rational \nway to see that injured people get paid. They should not be required to \ndo that. It will also cause a race to the courthouse because you don't \nget any money until you have a final affirmance of your judgment, and \nonly then can you come to the tobacco company and get your payment.\n  We should not be put in a situation in which two equally deserving \nclaimants have filed a lawsuit and one wins and he has a fast court \nsystem and he gets into the fund and gets his money first and another \none takes a long time before he ever gets his final judgment, before he \ngets money. We are creating a system that will be aberrational.\n  It will be aberrational in a number of other ways. Some States will \nbe favorable to these kind of lawsuits. Some States will not. Maryland \nhas already changed its law to make lawsuits against tobacco companies \neasier to file. Other States may do that. Traditional defenses such as \nassumption of the risk and contributory negligence may be vitiated by \nlegislation or court rulings, and lawsuits will move faster and more \nsuccessfully in one State, whereas another State that adheres to \ntraditional rules of law may not allow cases to move forward at all. It \nmay be unsuccessful wholly in one State. Indeed, we could have one or \nmore States virtually bankrupting the tobacco industry themselves if \nthey were to have unfettered litigation cases of this kind.\n  As a person who has practiced law for a long time, who has been in \ncourt on a consistent basis, I can tell you that the prospect of \nhundreds of thousands, maybe a million tobacco lawsuits being filed, \nburdening the judges and courts to a degree they have never known \nbefore is not a good thing. The taxpayers pay for that. Some will say \nit is a free-market deal. Just let people file their lawsuits and the \ngovernment is not involved in it. The courts are the government. Courts \nare the government. The taxpayers are paying for the judges, the \njurors, the clerks, the court reporters and everybody that manages a \ncourtroom, and the courtrooms in which these cases are tried. The \ntaxpayers are intimately involved in that.\n  We can do a lot better than this. I just say we cannot allow a repeat \nof the asbestos litigation situation. We cannot, as Members of this \nbody, allow a situation to occur in which less than 40 percent of the \nmoney paid out actually gets to the people who are victims of the \ncrime. They will say, well, in this bill they have arbitration over \nattorney's fees. I have heard that. So I have gone back and read the \nlegislation. This is the arbitration: If you are unhappy with the \nagreement you have with your attorney,  you can go to an arbitrator. \nThe attorney gets to name one member of the panel, you get to name one, \nand those two select a third. But if you have a standard agreement with \nthem on a one-third or 40 percent contingent fee basis, 40 percent of \nwhat you recover goes to the lawyer if you have that kind of an \nagreement. That is what the arbitrators are going to affirm. They are \nnot going to undercut written contracts between attorneys and clients \nthe way this thing is written.\n\n  So there is no protection here to substantial fees being paid to \nattorneys in all of these cases. We know it will take years for them to \nbe concluded. There will be a race to the courthouse to get judgment. \nSome States will allow suits to proceed. Others will not. Some people \nwill draw a favorable jury, win a big verdict, $100 million; somebody \nelse will have a jury that is more conservative and renders no verdict, \nzero verdict. This is not the way we ought to do it.\n  On this legislation, we begin the process of establishing a sane and \nrational method of distributing the funds that ought to go to those who \nhave been injured by tobacco. However, the problem with it is it does \nnot go nearly far enough. This is a classic mass tort situation. The \ngreatest mass tort situation, perhaps, in the history of mankind in \nwhich millions of Americans have smoked for a long time and they have \nhurt and damaged their health because of it, and as a result of that \nthey now want to seek compensation.\n  First, let me say something. I have to be very frank. No individual \nperson has succeeded in a lawsuit against a tobacco company, primarily \nbecause of the traditional rules of law that say if you undertake a \ndangerous activity and you are injured in that, you cannot sue somebody \nand ask for compensation because of it. The way this bill is written, I \nbelieve the likelihood is we will have more States like Maryland \namending their law, more pressure on judges and juries to get around \nthe traditional defenses to these kind of activities, which is somewhat \ndangerous, because what about the liquor companies and cirrhosis of the \nliver or other kinds of diseases that come from other kinds of \nproducts. Is there no barrier to that anymore?\n  I will say we have a major mass tort situation. We ought to deal with \nit in a comprehensive manner. We should not allow an unfettered lawsuit \nflood to dominate the American court system, resulting in some people \nwinning large verdicts, others getting nothing, delay, people dying \nbefore they have any recovery.\n  Senator Jeffords and I will be introducing a bill that will say if \nyou have a serious disease and have been disabled because of your \nsmoking, you can file a claim and within 90 days you can be paid. You \nwill not even have to have an attorney. We will limit the cost to 10 \npercent and we will dispense the moneys based on the seriousness of \nyour disease, the seriousness of your disability and whether or not it \nis connected to smoking. That is the kind of thing we can do. We can \nuse this money that the tobacco companies in this litigation demand \nthat they pay--\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\n$8 billion a year--and we can use that to compensate in a prompt and \nfair way those who have been injured. To do otherwise is just not a \ngood way to do business. It will enrich lawyers, it will burden the \ncourts, and it will guarantee an irrational distribution of funds to \nthose who have been injured and minimize the amount of money actually \ngetting to those who deserve to be compensated.\n  I will say that I do believe that this amendment should not be \npassed, that the payment of $755 billion, the agreement to give up \ncertain constitutional rights such as free speech and advertising is \nthe kind of settlement that is justifiable and proper under the \ncircumstances. We would make a historic step forward for America if we \ncan develop a way to ensure that those who are injured in a mass \ninjury-type situation such as this are compensated in a realistic and \nprompt way. I believe we can do that. For these reasons, I must ask my \nfellow Senators to vote no on the Gregg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a general \nstatement about the legislation.\n  Let me say this to begin with: I am very concerned by the speed with \nwhich this bill has come to the floor. It has really foreclosed any \nreal financial analysis--no joint tax figures that are adequate, no CRS \nanalysis, no CBO study.\n  For me, who represents California, there is a certain irony in \npassing a bill under these conditions. That irony is what we do that we \nbelieve is right for people may turn out to be very harmful for those \nvery people. And I want to say what I mean by this. I want us to pass a \ngood bill. What is a good bill? It is one that deters smoking; it \ndoesn't create a huge black market; it is constitutional; it would give \nthe FDA full authority to regulate the contents of nicotine; it would \nprohibit all advertising, which to me is very important, not the kind \nof crimped regulations, but a prohibition on all advertising; and it \nwould have some strong antismuggling provisions, both domestic and \ninternational.\n\n  We have heard Senators state the facts. Forty million Americans smoke \ntoday. Most of them are addicted. I don't think we have heard the \nCalifornia facts. Earlier, I was listening to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska say he was speaking on behalf of 1.6 million Nebraskans. \nMy goodness, in California alone, three times the population of the \nState of Nebraska smokes. We have 4.6 million smokers in California who \nare adults; that is, 19 percent of the population of the State of \nCalifornia smokes. You can figure how many of those people you believe \nare truly addicted, who would like to quit but can't.\n  Ten percent of our youngsters smoke; that is, 890,000 young people in \nCalifornia smoke. Let me give you a really chilling figure. One out of \nevery four high school senior is addicted to nicotine. One out of every \nfour high school senior in the largest State in the Union is addicted \nto nicotine. That is why I say an express prohibition on all \nadvertising is important to the success of any antismoking effort.\n  Mr. President, 1.8 billion packs of cigarettes are sold in California \neach year. On a per capita basis, 54 packs of cigarettes are consumed \nin California each year by every man, woman, and child in the State. \nAnd there are more than 32 million of us in that State. We already have \na 37-cent State tax. We have a 24-cent Federal tax. And on the ballot \nin November is an initiative placed there by Rob Reiner, which would \nput on 50 cents additional. So we will be over a dollar in tobacco \ntaxes in the State of California before this body and the other body do \nanything at all.\n  In California, 300 young people under the age of 18 begin smoking \ndaily. We all know the health consequences. Just yesterday, my closest \nand oldest friend called. She had just been diagnosed with lung cancer. \nShe quit smoking 30 years ago. Just the day before, I learned of the \nhusband of a very close friend of mine who just had a tumor, stage 4, \nthe size of a softball diagnosed in his lungs. So we all see this \nhappening to us every day. A good friend of mine just died from lung \ncancer --a lifetime smoker.\n  The hard part is not that we don't want to do something, but whether \nwhat we do is right. What really will turn around the teenage trap of \nsmoking and addiction? What is the right balance of penalties, \npressures, regulations, and health research for the next 25 years? If \nthe goal of this legislation is to reduce and limit youth smoking, and \nnot just creating a spending bill, we must address the link between \nprice of cigarette packs, the ratcheting down of nicotine, if the FDA \nhas full regulatory authority, a black market, and the availability of \ncigarettes to children. We need to make certain that we don't increase \nthe price of cigarettes so high that it becomes lucrative for smugglers \nand for organized crime to become involved in cigarette smuggling so \nthat, like cocaine, cheap black-market cigarettes will be available on \nstreet corners in cities all over our country.\n  Mr. President, there is already a black market in California. It is a \nsubstantial black market, and it is based on just the taxes I have \nmentioned so far--a 37-cent State tax and a 24-cent Federal tax. The \nState estimates they lose between $20 million and $50 million a year in \nrevenues.\n  We have all heard in the Judiciary Committee commentary that when the \nper-pack price increases beyond $3.60 to $4 a pack--this takes into \nconsideration what the public health people said could be added to a \npack--about $2--and what the industry analysts said, anything over $3 \nto $3.50--at that point we would create a black market in this country, \nunmatched by what happened in Canada in the 1980s.\n\n  I believe that, as I understand the McCain bill, within 5 years in \nthe State of California, with the item on the ballot, you will have a \nblack market in cigarettes unmatched by anything in history. According \nto an independent industry analyst, the price per pack in 1997 dollar \nterms, under the Commerce bill, would be $4.61. In California, with \nwhat is on the ballot in June, that will make it $5 a pack. If you \ninclude inflation, the McCain legislation would be $4.61, and that \nbecomes $5.11 if you add the 50 cents that is on the ballot in my State \nin November. That is above anything that anyone has said would be the \ntrigger point to create a black market in the State. This is a 25-year \nprospect, so the numbers only go up from there.\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing 2 weeks ago, John Hugh, the senior \nassistant attorney general of the State of Washington stated:\n\n       As tax rates have risen generally across the United States, \n     a new trend is emerging. Increasingly, tobacco products \n     manufactured outside the United States are being smuggled \n     into the United States and are sold on the contraband market. \n     In 1988, California increased its tobacco tax from 18 percent \n     to 35 percent per pack. Today, the contraband market is \n     estimated to be between 17 and 23 percent of the cigarettes \n     sold.\n\n  The impact of cigarette smuggling is enormous for this country and \nmost particularly for my State. First, there is, obviously, the loss of \nState excise tax revenues, which I said were $20 million to $50 million \nannually now.\n  Second, we have no control over the safety of cigarettes that are \nsmuggled in from overseas. For example, tobacco from China is much \nharsher, and the cigarettes are much more carcinogenic. And that is a \nvery likely contraband potential black market today. Even though all 50 \nStates have laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to people under 18, \nFederal sting operations show that four in ten teen smokers nationwide \ntoday succeed in evading such laws.\n  Individuals, including teens, find ways to buy available cheaper \ncigarettes. In Canada, when they increased tobacco prices by 150 \npercent in the 1980s, it is estimated that 40 percent of the cigarettes \nin Canada may have been contraband U.S. cigarettes, where a carton of \nCanadian cigarettes was $37 compared to $14 for U.S. cigarettes.\n  We also heard testimony about how a smugglers' ally developed in an \narea between Cornwall, ON, and Messina, NY, the epicenter of the \nCanadian contraband cigarette crisis.\n  It goes on and on and on with testimony.\n  There is a very real probability that within 5 years in California \nthere will be a major black market, if the McCain's per pack tax plus \nwhat happens on the ballot in California in June all go into law.\n  With almost 890,000 youngsters smoking, with one out of every four \nhigh\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nschool seniors addicted to nicotine, what prospects do we have, then, \nof really reducing teenage smoking unless we can get full regulatory \nFDA authority, and unless we can prohibit all advertising, which I \ndon't believe we will be able to constitutionally do unless the tobacco \ncompanies will agree to ban all advertising. To me, a ban of all \nadvertising is really going to be important if we want to help \nyoungsters to not smoke.\n  Let me tell you two things about the McCain bill that I cannot live \nwith.\n  I will shortly be introducing an amendment, along with Senators Boxer \nand Durbin, to cure an injustice in the McCain bill's treatment of \nlocal government. As presently drafted, the bill would wipe out the \nsuits that several local governments have filed against the tobacco \nindustry without providing a dime of compensation. That is simply \nunfair. The McCain bill currently would prevent local governments from \nsharing in any of the settlement funds now being provided for in the \nUnited States. San Francisco was the first local government to sue. It \nsued in June of 1996. The suit was joined in by 17 other California \ncities and counties representing over half of the population of the \nState of California. Local governments in three other States have also \nsued the tobacco industry. New York City; Erie County, NY; Cook County, \nIL; the City of Birmingham, AL; and Los Angeles County brought their \nown suits. These local governments have been litigating against the \ntobacco industry for 2 years. As a matter of fact, it was the \nCalifornia cities and counties which resolved the Joe Camel case in \nCalifornia. And as a result of that case R.J. Reynolds agreed to pull \nthe infamous Joe Camel campaign. R.J. Reynolds was required to disclose \nits confidential marketing documents. The release of those documents \nwas front-page news across the country.\n  The California county lawsuit is set for trial early next year. In \nthe absence of Federal legislation, the California counties and other \nlocal governments would expect to recover appropriate compensation as a \nresult of the trial or the settlement of these cases. The legislation \ncoming out of the Commerce Committee jettisoned all of these suits.\n  That is my first major point of a grievance with the McCain \nlegislation, in addition to it moving so fast and the cost such that I \nbelieve it creates a major black market.\n  The second objection is that the formula for distribution in the \nState disadvantages 26 States because it is based on an agreement among \nthe Attorney Generals and not on general population census figures. For \nexample, in California, if you use the population percentage as a \nformula mix, what happens is California's share of revenues is \nincreased 4 percent. And that is 9 percent to 12 percent, and that is a \nthird net additional cost for 26 other States to which we have sent a \nDear Colleague letter out today letting them know about this.\n\n  It is no secret that I have been working with the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, on a bill that might well avoid some of these problems--\navoid the black market for California, cover local suits and county \nsuits, provide a formula which is really based on what we are trying to \ndo, which is to stop youth smoking, and it makes sense in many other \nways.\n  Particularly, let me stress again that unless whatever we do here has \nsome encouragement for the tobacco industry to agree not to advertise, \nthe only prohibition we can probably impose, or perhaps--I say \nperhaps--some of those in the FDA rules, and even that will be \nlitigated and even that will hold up the legislation probably for 5 to \n10 years.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Utah is on the floor. I \nwonder if I might ask him this question. I have had the privilege of \nserving with him on the Judiciary Committee for 5\\1/2\\ years now. I \nregard him as a strong and positive constitutional expert.\n  Based on what the Senator from Utah knows of the Commerce Committee \nbill, does the Senator believe it will be contested in court, and does \nhe believe that it will withstand a constitutional test?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished Senator for her kind remarks. I \nhave listened very carefully to her.\n  There is no question in my mind--not only from my own personal \nevaluation and study of these issues, but also from conferring with the \ntop constitutional experts in the country, that both the original \nCommerce bill and the managers' amendment we are now discussing, are \nunconstitutional in scope and intent. This is especially true with \nregard to the FDA provisions where it would appear that the advertising \nrestrictions are too broadly conceived to be enforced. Both Larry \nTribe, a constitutional expert on the left, and Robert Bork a renowned \nscholar on the right, have concluded these provisions are problematic \nand raise constitutional concerns.\n  With regard to any other advertising ban, as embodied in the new \ntitle XIV of this managers' amendment, the only way they can go into \neffect will be if the tobacco companies actually voluntarily consent to \nthese restrictions on advertising. As the distinguished Senator knows, \nthey have not voluntarily consented. Far from it.\n  The companies have said they will fight this bill. This means that if \nthe McCain bill passes in its current form, and thus there is no \nvoluntary consent to the advertising provisions, we will have up to at \nleast 10 years of litigation. During that time, we face the possibility \nof having no money for our stated purpose of helping reduce youth \nsmoking, no money for smoking cessation, nor for any of the other \nstated purposes such as biomedical research, settling the state suits, \nand farmer transition payments.\n  And at the end of 10 years, it will be entirely likely that the \ntobacco companies will have won their suits because of the \nconstitutional infirmities within this bill.\n  I am just talking about advertising.\n  Then we go to the look-back provisions. There are at least two major \nconstitutional problems with the look-back provisions as written in \nthis bill.\n  One is that they are going to punish these companies even though they \ndon't show fault on the part of the companies when the projected youth \nsmoking reduction targets are not attained.\n  The constitutional experts have said that may constitute a bill of \nattainder which is expressly prohibited by the Constitution.\n  There are other constitutional infirmities with regard to the look-\nback provisions. So it doesn't take anybody on the side of tobacco \ncompanies 3 minutes to know that if they face the Commerce bill, in \nwhich they had no part in drafting, during which they were not even \nallowed to provide input, for which they gave no consent to waive their \nconstitutional rights, then it is a lot cheaper for them to litigate \nthe matter with a good prospect of winning than to pay over $800 \nbillion in the next 25 years.\n  I might add just parenthetically that by some estimates there could \nbe 1 million young children whose lives will be cut short prematurely \nbecause Congress has failed to write a constitutionally sound bill.\n  So the Senator raises very important issues; she raises very \nimportant considerations here and very important criticisms of this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  It really bothers me that many in this body are rushing to ``pile \non'' this legislation without trying to bring the tobacco companies \nonboard, albeit screaming and kicking.\n  Let me state for the record. I have no respect whatsoever for the \ntobacco companies.\n  I think that their record shows clearly they have lied to the \nAmerican people for decades. They knew their products were addictive. \nThey knew they caused cancer. They deliberately marketed their products \nto young children, and then denied it.\n  I would like nothing more than for them to pay a trillion dollars a \nyear.\n  But what I would like even more is for us to endorse a workable, \nconstitutionally-sound new War on Tobacco, and we are not going to do \nit by writing a bill which fails the constitutional test. Such an \napproach is destined for failure.\n  I remember clearly when Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore \ntestified before our committee, not once, but twice. He related that \nthe attorneys general knew all these evil things about the tobacco \ncompanies when they were negotiating the settlement\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\nlast year, they waded through all the relevant documents, and they \nconcluded that the far greater goal was to help a generation of youth \nfrom becoming addicted to tobacco than to continue to focus on the \ncompanies misdeeds.\n  If the companies broke the law, if anyone in the companies broke any \nlaw, they should be punished to the fullest extent possible. Nothing \nhere would preclude that. Nor should it.\n  But I get upset when some suggest that we can help children by \nthinking up literally every measure we can to punish the tobacco \ncompanies and then loading them into one constitutionally-infirm bill.\n  It seems to me it is possible to punish the companies, but at the \nsame time compel them to underwrite financially a new public health \nprogram that can do future generations more good than anything we have \never envisioned. We simply can't develop that comprehensive public \nhealth approach without the industry's consent, again, however \nreluctant.\n  I can go on and on. Tomorrow, I plan to go into greater detail on the \nconstitutional infirmities of both the original Commerce Committee \nbill, which everybody knew was just a vehicle for amendment, and the \nbill as now amended with the managers' amendment, which is just as bad \nas the original Commerce bill with regard to constitutional concerns.\n  So I thank the distinguished Senator from California for bringing \nthis out. I also appreciate her working with me to try to resolve these \ndifficulties. And, as my dear friend from California knows, the \noriginal settlement on June 20 of last year was for $368.5 billion.\n  All of us gasped for breath when we heard that. We thought, ``Why in \nthe world would the tobacco companies agree to pay $368.5 billion?''\n  The reason is because they want some limits of liability, even though \nthey will still have abundant liability; they want some finality to the \nlitigation that they face, a predictability that will allow them to \nmake the large payments we envision to underwrite the new public health \nprogram we are trying to develop.\n  And so, if we take away even the few aspects of limited liability \nthat are there, there is no chance at all of ever getting the tobacco \ncompanies to come on even a modest bill.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from California for being willing \nto help cosponsor the bill that we are working on that would require \n$428.5 billion in payments over 25 years, or $60 billion more than the \nJune 20, 1997 settlement.\n  I believe that if we can limit it to somewhere between $400 billion \nand $430 billion, and if we can include reasonable limited liability \nprovisions for the companies--limited liability provisions that \nrestrict class actions but do not stop individuals from suing--than I \nam hopeful we can get the companies to come back on board.\n  I am not sure if this is possible, but I think we ought to try, or \nthe whole program will be lost. And if we get them back on, then this \nwhole matter can work and work to the best interests of children and \nsociety as a whole.\n  So I thank my colleague for being willing to work together on this \nand, of course, for bringing up the points she is raising here today. I \nhope that at least cursorily answers her questions, and I will be glad \nto go into much greater detail later.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for that excellent answer and the \ndiscussion of the constitutional infirmities and what is apt to happen \nin the litigation which would really hold up a remedy for smokers, \nprobably for 10 years.\n  I would like to ask another question. Is it not correct, I ask the \nSenator, that you also are a member of the Finance Committee in \naddition to being chairman of the Judiciary Committee?\n  Mr. HATCH. In response to my colleague from California, it is \ncorrect. I am a member of the Finance Committee and, of course, on that \ncommittee voted against the $1.50 increase at the manufacturers level, \nnot because I would not like to punish the tobacco companies, but \nbecause that amount is excessive and in the process will not lead to a \nbill which can stop youth tobacco use.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have been troubled by the absence of sound \nanalytical data. I just sent my staff to the Joint Tax Committee, and \nas of May 18, there is a small report which shows the distributional \neffects of S. 1415 as reported by the Senate committee, but that is \njust the distribution of how the taxes would fall on the income groups.\n  To the Senator's knowledge, is there any sound analysis by a \ngovernmental entity such as CRS, CBO, or Joint Tax on the actual per-\npack costs of this bill out 25 years?\n  Mr. HATCH. As the Senator knows, we held extensive hearings on this \nissue in the Judiciary Committee. The Treasury Department sent up \nDeputy Secretary Larry Summers, who gave us a five-line piece of paper \nas the basis for their analysis. When we asked him about whether they \nhad a model, he wasn't able to respond very carefully.\n  There is apparently not much of a model backing up the Treasury \nDepartment's assertions in this area. But, on the other hand, we had \nthree of the top analysts from Wall Street who spend all of their time \nworking on tobacco-related issues trying to be able to be accurate in \ninforming their customers, and they had extensive economic modeling \ndone that showed the retail cost per pack of tobacco under the $1.10 \nbill that we have before us would be somewhere between, as I recall, \n$4.50 and $5.50 per pack. And if that is so, then the distinguished \nSenator's concerns about the black market are certainly legitimate and \njustified.\n  I might add that the Finance Committee last week did not view it as a \nprecedent for the future. But I cannot believe that it is good for the \nFinance Committee, good for the full Senate, and good for the American \npeople to consider what one Wall Street analyst has projected to be an \n$861 billion program without the Finance Committee having a meaningful \nopportunity to study the Treasury Department's estimates of the costs \nof the program.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I tried to get a full \nexplanation of the Treasury model before a hearing that we held on \nApril 30.\n  But, the administration failed to provide us with their model \ntogether with a full explanation of their assumptions. And what I can \nonly conclude from that is they did not have a model; perhaps they were \njust hypothesizing. I hope this is not so.\n  Late the night before the hearing, I succeeded in getting only a one-\npage summary table that some Treasury and White House staff insisted on \ncalling a model.\n  Let me just say that I hope we could all agree we should not launch a \nhuge new, multi-billion Federal program, with such far-ranging \nimplications, on the strength of a one-page chart.\n  It is also important for me to note that many Wall Street analysts \nhave been calling for a full explanation of the Treasury projections \nfor a few months. Several Wall Street experts have participated in \nmeetings with administration officials and Commerce Committee staff and \nexplained their own models and their own assumptions so this should \nhave been a very open process.\n  In fairness to the Treasury Department, I must say that finally, late \non May 12, but only after our hearing that same day where two financial \nanalysts testified--and this was 2 weeks after our hearing in which \nDeputy Secretary Summers testified--Treasury did provide our Committee \nwith an additional 11 pages of information.\n  For the record, I must note that this still is not everything I have \nasked them for. For example, Treasury s one-page summary table that \nthey insist on calling a model assumes a 23 percent reduction in \ncigarette sales from 1998 to 2003, based upon a semilogarithmic demand \nfunction with an initial elasticity of minus 0.45.\n  I might not know the difference between a semilogarithmic function \nand a hole in the ground, but there are experts who know how to assess \nthis information. These experts deserve a chance to analyze this data \non something this important. And the fact is, on the evening of April \n28, Treasury and the White House staff said they would send over the \nformula for this function, that they would send it right over.\n  At this meeting, it was explained to my staff that this function \ngradually reduced the price elasticity as the price climbed. Frankly, \nthis makes sense, because you would expect that as price goes up, there \nwould be fewer\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\nand fewer people left who are willing to pay the higher and higher \nprices.\n  But the administration officials also said that in year 5, for some \nstatistical reason, the Treasury elasticity function would actually \nincrease, under the Commerce bill assumptions.\n  So, while they are saying that as a general matter the elasticity \nwould get slightly lower as price climbed, they were also saying that \nin year 5, at least, this elasticity would actually grow higher.\n  You can see why anyone would want to study the underlying assumptions \nfor these conclusions very carefully, since elasticity of demand--that \nis, the responsiveness of individual consumption due to an increase in \nprice--is so important to the writing of this law.\n  Our debate on the floor over the Kennedy amendment calling for a \nprice increase of $1.50 per pack centered on this price elasticity \nissue. But the formula that was going to come right over from the \nTreasury never came on April 28, as they said it would.\n  At the April 30 hearing, I renewed this request by asking Deputy \nSecretary Summers to provide this information with the details of the \nso-called Treasury model. And, as I said earlier, the Treasury \nDepartment did finally send us additional information after our hearing \non May 12, but we are still waiting for their semilogarithmic demand \nfunction.\n  I have no reason to believe there is anything magical about this \ninformation and cannot imagine why it has not been provided. Certainly, \nit is not like I am asking for some sensitive top-secret security \ninformation.\n\n  We are asking for information to help us understand how to write \nproperly a bill that is being touted as having a $516 billion revenue \nimpact, but in reality which is probably $861 billion, according to \nthose who have developed full, detailed models with assumptions which \nthey are willing to make public in at least two open hearings.\n  So, I have to say the testimony we heard from these financial \nanalysts just completely blows away the Treasury Department testimony \nthat was given, and certainly the 1-page so-called model that they \npresented to the Committee, and even the 11 additional pages that they \ngave us which really weren't very helpful.\n  And I have to say I take exception about remarks made hear earlier \ntoday suggesting that these financial analysts had a vested interest in \nkilling the McCain legislation because it would help their investors. \nWe did, in fact, discuss this issue with the analysts at our recent \nhearing. They advised the Committee, and I believe they had no reason \nto mislead us, that their only vested interest was in providing \naccurate information to their clients. They have both recommended \nbuying and selling tobacco stocks, depending on the company and the \ntime.\n  The companies they represent do not own tobacco stocks, as was \nalleged here earlier, at least not in the traditional sense. It is \nclear that they may hold tobacco stocks for their clients who have \npurchased them, just as they hold stocks in a myriad of publicly-traded \ncompanies, but it is hard to argue that this is ownership of those \nstocks.\n  That was a little lengthy, but I don't know how else to explain it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I think that was an excellent \nexplanation, if we all understood it. I don't know a lot about \nlogarithms. I do know about per-pack cost. And I do know we have 5 \nmillion smokers, and almost a million juvenile smokers, in the State of \nCalifornia. And I do know that by all the testimony we had in the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, that if the price in 5 years is \nover $5 a pack, we have a whopping black market on our hands.\n  Would you agree with that?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no question in my mind about it. If we pass this \nlegislation the way it is currently written, we are going to have a \nblack market like you have never seen before.\n  When Canada raised its taxes so dramatically, they found this to be \nthe case. Remember the mayor of Cornwall, Canada----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Who came in and testified about how they threatened him, \nhis life, his family's life, how the city become inundated in organized \ncrime, until they finally had to reduce the size of the excise tax in \norder to prevent further black marketeering?\n  Remember how he told us his family had to be removed to a safe house? \nHow ordinary citizens could not even go out at night because they were \nafraid of random gunfire?\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts also showed a chart here \ntoday----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regular order here.\n  Mr. HATCH. That only went up to 1991.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I asked----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order is the Senator from California \nhas the floor. She has yielded for a question to Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am trying to answer that question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I am asking the chairman----\n  MR. McCAIN. Further parliamentary inquiry. Will the Parliamentarian \ndescribe the procedures here in the Senate called for as a result of a \nquestion, and that the Senate is not supposed to be abused by long, \nlengthy discussion of a question. This is clearly what is going on. It \nis not in keeping with the spirit of the Senate. There is another \nspeaker waiting to speak, and that is why I am concerned about it. \nOtherwise, I would not care.\n\n  I ask a parliamentary inquiry, to describe the procedures of the \nSenate in this case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator who has the floor may yield for a \nquestion. And the precedent prohibits statements in the guise of a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Chair repeat that, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedents, statements in the guise \nof a question are not permitted.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Statements in the guise of a question are not permitted. \nI thank the President. I made my point. If the Senators want to \ncontinue to abuse it, that is fine.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And I would make my point to the Senator in return. I \nhave asked no question in the guise of a statement. I believe, if you \nread the Record, the Record will reflect that. I have asked a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is very clear what is going on.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, could I ask the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia a question? Do I have the right to do that, under the \nparliamentary rules here today? If she will----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor--\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask her a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the Senator from Utah may ask her a \nquestion if she permits it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that is what I will do, because it seems to me \nthat some of the people around here are afraid to get the facts on this \nmatter.\n  And I have to say that it is highly offensive to have someone come \nhere and suggest that the distinguished Senator from California and I \nare not trying to get to the bottom of the facts, especially since the \nfacts are so complex here.\n  So I will ask the distinguished Senator from California, isn't it \ntrue that you are trying to get to the facts of this matter? Is that \nright?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. It is true.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I also ask the Senator from California, are you aware \nof the fact that we have had extensive testimony on this very issue \nbefore our Judiciary Committee? I hope this question is fair. I hope \nthat I will be permitted to ask it, under the Senate rules. I surely \nhope that the manager of the bill will recognize we are going to abide \nby the rules, if he wants to be a stickler on them. Is it not true that \nwe have had literally hours of testimony on this very issue?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, it is true. And I believe I was present at most \nof the hearings on this subject in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. And I would like to ask, isn't it true that the \ndistinguished Senator from California heard the testimony of witnesses \nsaying that if the per-pack price under the Commerce bill goes to $4.50 \nto $5.50 per pack, there is going to be an extensive black market? \nIsn't that true?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is true. The independent Wall Street analysts \nsaid they believed it would happen at $3 to\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\n$3.50 a pack. Mr. Myers, representing Tobacco-Free-Kids, testified \nbefore our committee that he believed you could take an additional $2 \non a pack before it would develop a black market. But the figures for \nCalifornia really, if the tax passes in June, indicate that the tax in \nthis bill, plus that tax, would be substantially above $5 within 5 \nyears.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware of this comment by CBO in April \n1998--and I hope this is in the form of a question that is acceptable \nto the manager of the bill--about black-market cigarettes:\n\n       Any legislation that would rapidly raise the price of a \n     product by a third or more would almost certainly spawn a \n     black market as people attempted to evade the high prices. \n     Tobacco is no exception.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator concerned about that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am very concerned about it, because, again, we have \n40 million smokers in the United States, 5 million of them in \nCalifornia. There is a huge market. There is a huge number of people \nalready addicted, and as the price per pack, plus reduction of smokers, \ncomes into play, the opportunity for a black market increases, and \nparticularly if you begin to ratchet down the addicting chemical which \nis nicotine.\n  It is a serious question. I am surprised, frankly, that people really \ndon't want to know more about it. I, frankly, am surprised that there \nis a rush to judgment. It seems to me that because of what we are doing \nis for 25 years, we better be right. I don't want to see in my State a \nhuge black market in 5 years and know that I voted to help make that \nmarket possible.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I ask the Senator from California another question \nthat I think is relevant to her concerns?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator comes from California, the largest populated \nState in our Nation. How many people live in California?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Oh, probably around 33 million today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Almost 34 million people, I understand.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Nineteen percent of whom smoke.\n  Mr. HATCH. Nineteen percent of whom smoke. Is the Senator aware that \none out of five packs of cigarettes sold in California happens to be \ncontraband?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe that is correct. Law enforcement has said \nthere is now a substantial black market in California. With the \nfranchise tax, port authorities advise that the State loses about $20 \nmillion to $50 million a year in revenue now from that market.\n  Mr. HATCH. And that jumped up when the State raised its tax by a few \npennies from, I think, was it 17 cents to 34 cents or something like \nthat.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct. There was a proposition on the \nballot that did do that. That generated the market. They have made some \nmajor arrests with large numbers of confiscated goods to go on the \nblack market.\n  Mr. HATCH. What do you think is going to happen in California and \nother States if that price is raised per pack from $2 to $4.50 or \n$5.50?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think if it goes from $2 to $4.50 in California, \nwith the number of people addicted and the fact that most are low \nincome, that it creates a black market. One of the concerns I have is \nthat it becomes a real pawn for organized criminal elements that also \nbrings on other serious repercussions. But I don't want the Senator \nfrom Utah, or anybody else, to mistake me. I want to see us have a \nbill. I want to see us have a bill that is going to be able to do the \njob, rather than have adverse, unintended consequences.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to agree with the Senator. And I have to say, is \nthe Senator aware that on May 4, 1998, testimony before the Senate \nDemocratic Task Force on Tobacco, Robert A. Robinson, Director of Food \nand Drug, Agriculture Issues, Resources, Community and Economic \nDivision of the General Accounting Office--who should surely win an \naward for one of the longest titles in Government--said:\n\n       Smuggling cigarettes from low- to high-tax States or \n     interstate smuggling prominent in the 1970s may be a \n     reemerging problem. Such activity is likely to occur when the \n     differences in cigarette taxes across the States are \n     significant enough to make it profitable. Recently, many \n     States have opted to sharply increase their cigarette taxes, \n     yet most low-tax States have not. As a result, recent studies \n     suggest that the level of interstate smuggling activity may \n     now be increasing. In fact, recent estimates suggest that \n     smuggling is responsible for States collectively losing \n     hundreds of millions of dollars in annual tax revenues.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I am aware of it. I am also glad that the \nSenator from Utah is mentioning this, because one of the most \ndiscouraging things here has been the rush to judgment, has been the \nfeeling of many people, very well-meaning, very much wanting to see \nlegislation in place, that if you pause to consider these impacts, \nsomehow you are un-American, somehow you are pro-tobacco. And yet, as \nwe know, the devil is in the details with all of these things. It \nreally is the long-term effect of a bill that we need to consider \ncarefully.\n  That is one of the reasons I have been, frankly, opposed to the speed \nwith which this bill is being pushed, and I think it is being pushed so \nthat we don't have this information in front of us, so that we don't \nunderstand the repercussions, so that a bill gets passed and everybody \ncan pound their chests and say what a wonderful job we have done and \nthen, boom, in 4 years, there can be a cataclysmic event like a big \nblack-market operation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just ask one other question of the distinguished \nSenator, because there has been some indication here that there is some \nsort of a game being played in this colloquy between the Senator and \nmyself. It is anything but a game being played.\n  We have seriously looked at these matters in 10 Judiciary Committee \nhearings, at which the Senator from California was in attendance. And \nthese are important issues.\n  I just ask the distinguished Senator, what are we going to do if we \ngo through all of this piling on mentality, as is embodied in this \nmanagers' agreement and many of the proposed amendments thereto, and, \nafter we get to the end of this, the bill is still constitutionally \nunsound? What happens if we have 10 years of litigation and the program \nfalls apart? Isn't that some justification for finding out the facts \nnow in order to either amend this bill or have a substitute amendment \nor other correctional measure? Shouldn't we really get to the heart of \nhow to develop a constitutionally-sound bill that will help reduce teen \nsmoking and solve some of these other problems in society? Does the \nSenator agree with me?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is absolutely correct, I say to the Senator. Not \nonly are we not playing a game, certainly no one in this body has asked \nme, representing the State, what would be the impact of a bill on the \nlargest State in the Union with the most smokers by far in California, \nwith the most young people.\n  I came to this body to use my brain, to try to work for my State and \ntry to see that whatever it is that I vote for doesn't have unintended \nconsequences.\n  I think all the purpose of this colloquy is to say that there may \nvery well be serious, unintended consequences, heightened by the fact \nthat we are moving so fast without any major governmental analysis of \nthe long-term, per-pack costs and what those costs might do when you \nmeasure elasticity, diminished market demand and a diminution of \nnicotine in a regulatory order by the FDA.\n  These are very serious things. I think they deserve consideration, \nand I thank you very much.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask the distinguished Senator one more question? It \nis this: I have sought to facilitate a thorough examination of public \ndiscussion of the Treasury model so policymakers can better understand \nwhy there is so much disparity between Wall Street and 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue on critical items like the estimates of the retail \nprice per pack of cigarettes under the Commerce Committee bill.\n\n  Is the Senator aware that we have heard the official estimate is that \nthe Commerce Committee bill will increase the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes by $1.10 per pack over 5 years? Many in the press simply \nreport that the price, not cost, will go up by just $1.10 a pack.\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\n  As I understand it, and I ask the Senator to help me to know if she \nunderstands it the same way I do, the Treasury Department and the \nproponents of the Commerce Committee bill believe that when you take \ninto account all other factors, you arrive at a real price in year 5 of \n$3.19 per pack. Although it is not a number that many of the bill's \nproponents seem anxious to get into public discussion, and the press is \nnot widely reporting it in nominal terms, this is how much money you \nactually have to pull out of your wallet. This $3.19 per pack figure \ntranslates at the cash register price of $3.57 in the year 2003 under \nthe White House and Treasury Department's estimates.\n  Now, again, I ask the Senator, is the Senator aware of those facts?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Actually, Senator, those are not the facts--they may \nbe the facts coming out of the White House.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But the facts in committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is the White House's spin here.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask the Senator this. Does the Senator recall that \nin September the President called for, and the White House repeated \nagain in February, bipartisan legislation that raises the price of \ncigarettes by up to --and that is up to --$1.50 per pack over 10 years? \nDoes the Senator remember the President calling for that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do.\n  Mr. HATCH. Given that the price of cigarettes is about $1.95 per pack \ntoday, it looks like the Commerce Committee bill or this managers' \namendment will achieve the $1.50 price hike 5 years ahead of schedule \nby the Treasury's own estimates. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct; yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right. Now, Wall Street analysts tell us the Treasury \nnumbers are off--way off, they say. They say that the actual price \nincreases under the Commerce Committee bill will be much higher than \nwhat Treasury is telling us. They say the price in real dollars will \nclimb to between $4.50 and $5 per pack in 5 years; and at least one \nindicated higher than $5 per pack, up to over $5.50. Is the Senator \naware of that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney projects in the \nyear 2003, the Commerce Committee bill, the old bill--but the revised \none is the same on the facts--will result in a real price of $4.61 per \npack. In nominal terms, this means that cigarettes will cost $5.11 per \npack. That is over $50 per carton. Does the Senator remember that \ntestimony?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe you are accurately reflecting the \ntestimony.\n  Mr. HATCH. David Adelman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter testified on \nApril 30 that the 2003 average retail price will reach at least $4.53 \nper pack if the Commerce Committee bill is adopted. His analysis also \nindicates that the price under this bill that is on the floor right now \ncould actually grow to $5.66 per pack or higher within 5 years. Is the \nSenator aware over that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, similarly, Gary Black of Sanford C. Bernstein & \nCompany, told the Judiciary Committee on May 12, 1998, that under the \nCommerce Committee bill the real price of cigarettes will exceed $5 per \npack in 2003. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely. And the point that you are making is \nreally reflective of the point that I am trying to make in a less \nerudite way. That point is, let us take the time to have a CRS \nanalysis, a CBO analysis, a joint tax force on some of the figures that \nwe are putting forward, because these are figures that have been \npresented to us in a formal way.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would ask the Senator if she is aware--let me emphasize \nthe $4.50 to $5-per-pack prices that these leading Wall Street analysts \nprojected in testimony to the Judiciary Committee, those prices are \nmuch higher than what the Treasury estimated and far higher than the \nwidely cited and widely reported $1.10-per-pack figure. Isn't that \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct--one of the reasons I do not know who \nto believe.\n  Mr. HATCH. So it is far higher than the up to $1.50-per-pack increase \nthat the President called for over a 10-year period; is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. If these Wall Street analysts are correct, and the \nTreasury estimates are off in year 5, under the Commerce \nCommittee bill, we may reach a price increase that is twice as high as \nwhat the President has called for; that is, a $3-per-pack price \nincrease rather than a $1.50 price increase. That is certainly a far \ncry from the $1.10 we hear so much about; isn't that so?\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just finish this.\n  What is more, according to these experts, we will reach this twice as \nhigh level twice as fast as called for by the President. I guess we \nshould ask whether the American public understands that what we may \nactually be talking about under the Commerce Committee bill is a $50-\nper-carton price for cigarettes.\n  Now, if you are like me, and do not, and will not, ever smoke, this \nmay not seem so bad, literally; but I just hope that the public health \nlobby does not next focus its attention on the problem of obesity, or \nwe may have chocolate ice cream at $20 a gallon, a $10 package of \npotato chips, or a $5 slice of apple pie, sold by prescription no \ndoubt, if we continue to follow this type of bureaucratic reasoning. Is \nthe Senator in disagreement with me on this? And I didn't even talk \nabout cheeseburgers!\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My point is, Senator, I do not really know whom to \nbelieve. And that is why I am where I am with respect to this bill. \nDifferent committees have had different testimony. I do not know \nwhether the Finance and the Commerce Committees actually had this \ntestimony. We had it in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Finance Committee did not hear any testimony on the \ntobacco issue; the Commerce Committee heard from Secretary Summers as \nwell as Mr. Feldman.\n  Is the Senator aware that the $1.10 price that is so widely reported \nin the media as the add-on to the current $1.95 or the $2-per-pack \nprice at the manufacturer's level does not include a whole wide variety \nof factors, like the wholesale markups, the retail costs, the \nadditional excise taxes added on by the States, litigations costs, the \nlookback, all factors that could be add-ons to the retail price under \nthis bill?\n  So it is pretty clear that it is a lot higher than what the media are \nreporting is $1.10. It is a lot higher, isn't it, than what the White \nHouse has indicated?\n  And I would just ask the Senator this other question: Isn't it \nplausible to believe these Wall Street analysts, whose very livelihoods \ndepend on trying to arrive at correct economic projections in order to \nadvise clients about whether or not to invest money, who have used \nextensive models to make those projections rather than just a 5-line \nsheet of paper?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think that is right. I think what has happened is \nthat we have seen a net figure applied as a gross figure when in fact \nit is just a beginning figure. It becomes an arbitrary cost added, and \nthen there are all these other costs that come on top that are not \nfactored in.\n  I think that is why we need a very thorough, objective report on what \nactual street prices of cigarettes will be, what you get them for in \nyour 7-11, what you buy them for in your supermarket, what it will be \nwith inflated dollars in 5 years.\n  If we know that with specificity, then I think we can make some \ninformed judgments as to whether, in each of our respective States, \nthis is apt to create a black market or not apt to create a black \nmarket. We then can relate this data to the distribution table that \nJoint Tax has done so you know what portion of this falls on the \nlowest-income people versus the highest-income people.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is it not true--this will be my last question--is it not \ntrue that under the substitute that the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia and I are working on, that we do not base this on a price \nper pack of cigarettes, our $428.5 billion, we base it on payments that \nhave to be made over 25 years?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Whether the companies--whether they sell a lot of \ncigarettes or not, they are going to have to make those payments; isn't \nthat correct?\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct. You see, the thing that bothers me \nis, in this rush to judgment, everything is evaluated based on the per-\npack numbers that are thrown around, based on what is a net addition \nthat will not be the real street addition. So there is no way, with the \nspeed this bill is moving, to know exactly what we are going to be \ndoing down the line. The beauty of our bill, if people should be \ninterested, is that we have tried to avoid that problem.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia for answering my questions.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. Have these questions been in order under the \nrules of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am asking the Parliamentarian if these questions have \nbeen in order under the rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe they are, Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, my goodness, I am so happy to find that out.\n  Thank you so much, Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. It has been a pleasure for me to \nwork with him.\n  Let me once again sum up, because I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine is waiting, and I do want to thank the Senator from Utah for \nhis leadership not only of the Judiciary Committee but in what we have \nbeen working on. I hope if people might be interested they would let us \nknow.\n  In the meantime, I am really not prepared, based on the analytical \ndata--and we have tried to get every single piece we could--to cast a \nvote which has repercussions for a quarter of a century and which would \nhave repercussions on a State where 5 million people smoke and almost a \nmillion youngsters and one out of every four high school seniors is \naddicted to nicotine. Until I have some of these answers and we know \nwhat the impact on the streets in Los Angeles, in San Francisco, in \nFresno, in San Diego, is going to be 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 \nyears, and 25 years hence--then we can cast an informed vote, and then \nwe can go home and say we really have done something good for the \npeople we represent.\n  I thank the Chair. I apologize and I thank the Senator from Maine for \nher forbearance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this week the Senate is debating far-\nreaching landmark legislation which gives us a historic opportunity to \ncombat teen smoking and in the process save millions of lives.\n  Tobacco use is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United \nStates, accounting for almost half a million deaths a year and billions \nof dollars in health care costs. More people die each year in the \nUnited States from smoking than from AIDS, suicide, alcohol and drug \nabuse, car accidents, and fires combined. Tobacco use in this country \ncarries a price tag of almost $100 billion a year in direct health \ncosts and in lost productivity.\n  Clearly, the single most effective thing we can do to improve our \nNation's health is to stop smoking. However, smoking rates are actually \nincreasing, particularly, and most tragically, among our young people. \nTragically, tobacco addiction is increasingly a teen onset disease. \nNinety percent of all smokers start before age 21. What is especially \ndisturbing is that children, especially girls, are smoking at younger \nand younger ages. Smoking is at a 19-year high among high school \nseniors and has increased by over 35 percent among 8th graders over the \npast 7 years.\n  The statistics for my own State of Maine are particularly alarming. \nMaine has the dubious distinction of having the highest smoking rate \namong young adults in the country. Thirty-two percent of our 18- to 30-\nyear-olds are regular smokers. Almost 40 percent of Maine's high school \nseniors smoke. If current trends continue, one in nine children will \ndie prematurely of tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death in Maine, \nresponsible for almost 2,500 deaths a year. Direct medical costs of \ntreating tobacco-related illnesses in Maine are about $200 million. \nIndirect costs--the costs associated with lost work time, higher \ninsurance premiums and so forth--are also estimated to be about $200 \nmillion.\n  These numbers speak for themselves. The status quo is simply \nunacceptable. If we are to put an end to this tragic and preventable \nepidemic, we must accelerate our efforts not only to help more smokers \nquit but also to discourage young people from ever lighting up in the \nfirst place.\n  I found one fact in a recent Maine survey of smoking habits to be \nparticularly disturbing. The smoking rate among young girls in my State \nhas increased by 30 percent since 1993. I think that this advertisement \ngives us a good clue why. It is a blatant and shameless attempt by the \ntobacco industry to entice young girls, to entice teenagers to smoke. \nWith more than 1,000 of the tobacco industries' best customers dying \nevery day and another 3,000 to 5,000 quitting because of health \nconcerns, smokers are literally a dying breed. As a consequence, the \ntobacco industry must hook thousands of new customers each day just to \nbreak even, and is now spending over $5 billion a year on advertising \nand promotional campaigns.\n  The tobacco industry actually claims that it does not target image-\nconscious young people with its advertisements featuring rugged \nMarlboro men and fresh-faced, model thin, ``You can do it'' young \nwomen. But, Mr. President, the evidence clearly proves otherwise. Just \nlook again at this magazine ad. It is very typical, very typical of \ncigarette advertising. This ad is not aimed at people my age. It \ncertainly is not aimed at people my parent's age. There can be no doubt \nit is not aimed at adults at all. It is aimed at teenagers.\n  Moreover, internal industry documents indicate that tobacco companies \nhave long known that tobacco use leads to addiction, serious illness, \nand death. Yet, they nevertheless continue to pursue children, to \ntarget teens through ads and promotional campaigns, and have even gone \nso far as to consider marketing Coca-Cola-flavored cigarettes.\n  A landmark 1991 study published in the Journal of American Medical \nAssociation showed that cigarette-smoking ``Smooth Joe'' Camel was as \nrecognizable to 6-year-olds as Mickey Mouse. Let me repeat that. Joe \nCamel was as recognizable to 6-year-olds as Mickey Mouse. The tobacco \nindustry claimed the ads were, in fact, directed at adults. A second \nstudy found that 98 percent of the 12- to 19-year-olds recognized Joe \nCamel, compared to just 72 percent of adults. As a result, Camel's \nmarket share among underage consumers rose from less than 1 percent \nwhen the Joe Camel campaign first began, to 33 percent when he was \nfinally put out to pasture.\n  More recent studies published in JAMA and elsewhere add further \nweight to the mounting evidence that advertising and marketing are the \nlinchpins of the tobacco industry's efforts to hook children on \nnicotine. A February 1998 JAMA study found that the effect of tobacco \nadvertising and promotional activities is ``strong and specific,'' with \nat least 34 percent of all experimentation with cigarettes by teenagers \nattributable to those activities.\n  Moreover, a 1995 article in the Journal of the National Cancer \nInstitute found that tobacco marketing has a greater influence over a \nteen's decision to smoke than whether or not their parents smoke or \ntheir peers smoke.\n  Other studies have shown that the cigarette brands most popular with \nteenagers are the ones most likely to advertise in magazines with the \nhighest youth readership. Moreover, unlike adults, the vast majority of \nyoung smokers prefer the most heavily advertised brands of cigarettes.\n  It is also far too easy for children and teens in the United States \nto purchase cigarettes. During hearings in the Labor Committee, we \nheard testimony that children living in 99 percent of our cities and \ntowns have very little trouble walking into a store and buying a pack \nof cigarettes, despite the fact that it is against the law in all 50 \nStates to sell tobacco products to minors.\n  Mr. President, during this debate, we have focused a great deal of \nattention on the $1.10-a-pack fee that the McCain bill imposes on \ncigarettes. Some have argued today that is simply too low and that an \nincrease to $1.50 or more a pack is necessary if we are going to curb \nunderage smoking. Others--and I\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\ninclude myself in this group--are concerned that the evidence linking \nteen usage and price is not conclusive. Moreover, I am very concerned \nthat a price increase of this magnitude is highly regressive and will \nfall mainly on adult smokers earning less than $30,000 a year. If we \nwere to increase the cost by the $1.50 that was proposed, it would have \nmeant that the average couple who smoke would be paying $712 more a \nyear in taxes. That is a very hefty tax increase on low-income \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, at some point, raising the tax on cigarettes ceases to \ncontribute to the reduction of smoking and becomes little more than an \nact of financial cruelty. Tobacco is highly addictive and there are \npeople, perhaps many people, who will not be able to quit smoking even \nwith an additional tax of $1.50 or more.\n  There is a point at which the tendency of the U.S. Senate to play God \nin the lives of the American people becomes dangerous. The notion that \nwe can cure addictions by creating enough deprivation for those who are \naddicted is a very arrogant one. If we are wrong, we do nothing more \nthan inflict suffering on those who do not deserve it.\n  While I respect the motives of its supporters, I could not, and did \nnot, back an amendment that carries such a risk and that is not truly \nneeded to fund the antismoking programs included in this bill. Those of \nus who legislate must draw lines, and recognizing that I am far from \ninfallible, I believe that a tax of $1.50 per pack crosses that line. \nIf our purpose is to inflict pain, it should be on those who profit \nfrom the addiction and not on those who suffer from it. That is why I \nshall vote to support the amendment offered by my friend and colleague \nfrom New Hampshire to eliminate the immunity protections afforded to \nthe tobacco industry by this bill.\n  My view on the $1.50-a-pack tax proposal has been strongly reinforced \nby conversations I have had in recent weeks with young people in my \nState in an attempt to find out what the true experts--our teenagers--\nbelieve would be most effective in stopping teens from smoking in the \nfirst place. I have asked this question to, among others, a seventh \ngrader from Portland, a Boy Scout troop in Dover-Foxcroft, high school \nstudents in Aroostook, and a teen smoker in Bangor. Significantly, none \nof these teens felt that a price increase would be the most effective \nmeans of discouraging teens from smoking.\n  As the addicted Bangor teen told me, ``I can't quit, so what  I'll do \nis cut back on going to the movies or going to McDonald's in order to \npay for cigarettes.''\n\n  Another teen told me that many students get their cigarettes by \nstealing them from their parents, so unless their parents stopped \nsmoking, their access to cigarettes will be unaffected.\n  Alex Pringle, a seventh grader from Portland, suggested that having \nsmokers who are suffering from lung cancer or other smoking-related \ndiseases come to schools would be the most effective means of \ndiscouraging kids from smoking. It would effectively make the link \nbetween smoking and illness, a link that is too often unrecognizable to \nteens who believe themselves to be invulnerable.\n  Teens throughout the State told me that they smoked simply because it \nwas ``cool'' or because it helped them feel more accepted by their \nfriends. From their comments, I have no doubt that the tobacco \nindustry's ads, such as the one I have displayed today, have sent a \nclear message to teens that teens who smoke are cool. I also have no \ndoubt that when teens see movie idols such as Leonardo DeCaprio smoke, \nthat message is, unfortunately, reinforced.\n  That is why the educational, counteradvertising, and research \nprograms funded by this legislation, as well as the advertising \nrestrictions, are so critical to our efforts to sever the deadly \nconnection between teens and tobacco.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Senators Jim Jeffords and Mike Enzi in \nintroducing the Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens, or the \nPAST Act, which adopts a comprehensive approach to preventing teens \nfrom smoking. The bill gave clear and comprehensive authority to the \nFDA to regulate tobacco products and incorporated the FDA's \nrecommendations on combating teen smoking, such as strong warning \nlabels, a ban on vending machine sales, a ban on outdoor advertising \nand brand name sponsorship of sporting events, and prohibition on the \nuse of images like Joe Camel and the Marlboro man. The legislation also \nheld tobacco companies accountable by imposing stiff financial \npenalties if the smoking rate among children does not decline.\n  Moreover, the legislation incorporates strong measures to ensure that \nrestrictions on youth access to tobacco products are tough and \nenforceable, and it promoted the development of State and local \ncommunity action programs designed not only to educate the public on \nthe hazards of tobacco and addiction, but also to promote the \nprevention and cessation of the use of tobacco products. We need to \nfocus on cessation programs. They are an important part of this bill.\n  It also called for a comprehensive, tobacco-related research program \nto study the nature of addiction, the effects of nicotine on the body, \nand ways to change behavior, particularly that of children and teens. \nWe don't know enough about addiction yet.\n  And finally, and very important, it called for a national public \neducation campaign to deglamorize the use of tobacco products to \ndiscourage teens from smoking.\n  Mr. President, we have made tremendous progress in recent years in \nmaking our streets safer from alcohol-impaired drivers. This was \naccomplished not only through tough drunk-driving laws, but also \nthrough a very effective national advertising campaign waged by Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving and others that has resulted in a change in our \nNation's attitudes toward drinking and driving. This is the approach \nthat we need to take to curb teen smoking.\n  The legislation we are considering this week contains many of the \npublic health provisions that were included in the PAST Act. While the \nlegislation before us tonight is not perfect and will undoubtedly face \nmany more amendments during Senate consideration, it does give us a \ncritical opportunity to address the teen smoking epidemic in a strong \nand comprehensive way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, while we may all agree that teenagers \nshould not be smoking, this bill goes well beyond reaching that goal.\n  We should all be deeply concerned about the ``tax and spend'' \napproach that the bill takes to resolving a social problem. The bill \nreaches right into the pockets of hard-working low- and middle-income \nadults who, even tobacco's most staunch critics acknowledge, have every \nright to smoke if they so choose.\n  And, it takes their hard-earned dollars to create yet more federal \nprograms and to pay trial lawyers billions of dollars. We're literally \ngrabbing money from the poorest Americans to buy trial lawyers more \nLearjets.\n  To what end? There appears to be uncertainty as to whether price \nincreases really have the effect of getting kids to stop smoking or to \nnever start in the first place.\n  And what is the real motivation here? If it were really to cut \nsmoking, we wouldn't phase it in, we would drop it right at once. But \nwe're not doing that because the tax-and-spenders want the revenues. I \nknow they're not doing it for the tobacco companies.\n  We all know that this isn't about smoking--it's about money.\n  What unpopular product or industry is next--now that we, our nation's \nlawmakers, have decided that ``and justice for all'' really doesn't \nmean what it says.\n  First, let's discuss the taxes imposed by the bill. Lots of people \nare jubilant at the prospect of this legislation passing. The \nplaintiffs' lawyers would become fabulously wealthy; the public health \ncommunity would get all of its favorite projects generously funded; \nand, of course, the bureaucrats will get write volumes of new rules.\n  The ones who won't be so happy are the working class families who \nhave been targeted to pay for it all.\n  In short, the McCain bill, through its highly regressive tax \nprovisions, inflicts enormous costs on lower- and middle-income \nfamilies. Let me put this regressivity problem in concrete terms. The \nincreased excise tax payments under the McCain bill are projected to \nexceed $690 billion over the next 25 years.\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\n  Based on analyses by the Joint Committee on Taxation, families with \nincomes less than $30,000 a year will wind up paying roughly 43 percent \nof these taxes. In other words, under the bill, families earning less \nthan $30,000 a year will have to pay roughly $300 billion in new taxes \nover the next 25 years.\n  This amounts to more than the total income taxes that these families \nare expected to pay over the same period of time.\n  The numbers are even more striking if we look at families earning \nless than $75,000 a year. Other experts have estimated that families in \nthis category will pay more than 83 percent of all the tobacco excise \ntaxes, which means that families earning less than $75,000 a year will, \nas a group, pay more than $570 billion in new excise taxes as a result \nof the McCain bill.\n  Where are the cries about regressive taxes? We're all so used to the \nlong speeches about taxes on the poor. Or is that argument just used \nfor convenience? This is the largest tax increase on the poor in \nyears--if not in all time!\n  It gets even worse. The numbers I just cited only take into account \nthe excise taxes imposed by the bill. The reality is that the increases \nin the prices of tobacco products resulting from this bill will be \nsubstantially greater in magnitude. This is because of the look-back \npayments and the increased sales taxes as well as wholesaler and \nretailer margins that will be tacked on to any excise taxes.\n  It is estimated that, based on projections of the actual increases in \nthe prices of tobacco products, the true cost over the next 25 years \nwill be more in the range of $380 billion for families earning less \nthan $30,000 a year. it will be more than $735 billion for families \nearning less than $75,000 a year.\n  These are truly staggering numbers. To put them in perspective, it is \nprojected that once the new excise taxes under the McCain bill are \nfully phased in, the annual cost to the family of a smoker earning less \nthan $30,000 a year will be $875.\n  For a smoker's family earning less than $75,000 a year, the cost on \naverage will be more than $950 each year. Now, a figure of $875 or $950 \na year may not sound like much to these plaintiffs' lawyers who are \nexpecting to get hundreds of millions of dollars. But I can assure you \nthat this money means a lot to families trying to get by on $30,000 a \nyear, or even on $75,000 a year.\n  If this doesn't persuade you, let's hear from the experts on Wall \nStreet. As noted by Morgan Stanley analyst, David Adelman: ``98.5 \npercent of cigarettes are legally purchased by adult smokers, and \ntherefore higher excise taxes will unfairly (and regressively) penalize \nadult consumers who choose to smoke.''\n  So, we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes \nto try to stop 1.5 percent of tobacco users from illegally buying \ntobacco. Why not just impose penalties on children who try to purchase \ntobacco? Well, I suppose, because it wouldn't be a jackpot for trial \nlawyers and Washington bureaucrats. The fact that it might help the \nchildren is irrelevant.\n  Mr. President, I, for one, was not elected to sock the American \ntaxpayer with more taxes. If teens are really our target, we owe it to \nthe taxpayer to first explore other non-price measures to combat youth \nsmoking.\n  At a minimum, we need to explore whether there are ways to rebate \nthese increased taxes back to the adult smokers who paid them--rather \nthan using these regressive taxes to fund huge new government programs.\n  Turning to the bill's disturbing reliance on new government programs, \nI find it highly ironic that we are here debating a bill that will \nincrease the size of the federal bureaucracy when this is the Congress \nthat is supposedly committed to reducing federal government bloat.\n  The bill takes over half a trillion dollars in tobacco funds to fund \nnew social programs or enlarge existing programs.\n  We also need to think long and hard about the bill's Orwellian \napproach--giving the federal government more power to look over our \nshoulders regarding the personal choices we make.\n  I'd like to take this opportunity to read into the Record a few \nexcerpts from recent articles, articulating these concerns:\n\n       Most Americans may not like smoking, but that doesn't \n     necessarily mean they favor a big-spending nanny state. Yet \n     if President Clinton and his supporters are allowed to \n     succeed with this tobacco pact, the same extortionist tactics \n     will undoubtedly be applied to other ``sins.'' Just imagine \n     how much government could ``do'' by slapping a health tax on \n     Big Macs and Budweiser.\n\n  That's from the Detroit News, on April 24, 1998.\n  I urge my colleagues to learn from experience. Too many times in the \npast, Washington has raised taxes in the name of one feel-good social \nprogram or another. The American people have consistently indicated \nthat they are tired of that practice.\n  We on the Republican side of the aisle were supposedly sent here to \nsee to it that the tax and spend era of big government ceases to exist. \nI'm not so sure we're holding up our end of the bargain when we propose \nto pass legislation along the lines of the bill we're debating today.\n  As I raised earlier in my remarks, we appear to be forging blindly \ninto a tax and spend approach to combating youth smoking, even though \nit is highly speculative that higher prices will even have this desired \neffect.\n  This legislation is going to result in a massive price increase for \nthe entire smoking population, including the 98 percent of legal adult \nsmokers. I think it is important that my colleagues are aware of all \nthe facts before they vote on it.\n  A Cornell University study found that there is no significant \ncorrelation between price levels and the youth smoking rate.\n  This study, conducted by researchers at the Department of Policy \nAnalysis and Management of Cornell University over a period of four \nyears, reexamined the relationship between price increases on tobacco \nproducts and the likelihood that children will smoke.\n  It analyzed the smoking habits of over 14,000 children in grades 8 \nthrough 12. To quote the study's conclusion: ``the level and changes in \ncigarette taxes [is] not strongly related to smoking onset'' for \nchildren between 8th and 12th grades.\n  In addition, this study casts doubts on the results of previous \nstudies which have directly linked smoking rates among children to \nprice, noting that ``* * * youth who face different tax rates also face \ndifferent anti-smoking sentiment * * *.''\n  The study suggests that previous research on youth smoking failed to \ntake into account differing public perceptions that smokers face across \nthe country. The Cornell study attempted to eliminate such extraneous \ninformation from their results.\n  Removing the effect of other factors, such as different State \nsmoking-related legislation, allowed researchers ``to directly examine \nthe impact of changes in tax rates on youth smoking behavior, and our \nresults indicate this impact is small or nonexistent.''\n  This view is also supported by statistical evidence from other \ncountries. As Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney has noted:\n\n       But we all know that kids don't stop smoking because of the \n     price of cigarettes. Let me give you an example. In England, \n     between 1988 and 1994, cigarette prices rose in real terms, \n     by 20 percent. In '88, 8 percent of them 11 to 16-year-olds \n     smoked. By '94, 13 percent of them smoked, after the price \n     increase. The White House will not take this into account. \n     And I don't understand why.\n\n  And, it's not just academia that questions whether increased prices \nwill deter kids from smoking. It is the kids themselves. Just ask the \nfour bright, young citizens who recently testified before the House \nCommerce Subcommittee on Health and Environment on March 19, 1998.\n  Of the four who testified about the effects of price increases on \nyouth smoking, three clearly stated that price increases would have no \neffect on the number of youth smokers, and the fourth didn't know what \nthe result would be.\n  As one teenager testified, ``[I]f money were a huge issue, then kids \nwouldn't be buying marijuana as much.\n  Another teenager testified:\n\n       [I]f you look, it's kind of weird how, people would be \n     willing to pay $150, $200, for shoes. And it's completely \n     outrageous; but people will complain about it. They'll moan \n     and groan; but they'll still pay. And, when it comes to \n     cigarettes--how much is it? Two dollars a pack?\n\n  We've heard it from the horse's mouth.\n  I closing, I know that the tobacco companies have become so unpopular \nthat nothing seems out of bounds. But,\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nwhatever our views are about how much pain to inflict upon the \nindustry, let us not forget that Congress also has an institutional \nresponsibility.\n  We should be concerned that the McCain bill will set a terrible \nprecedent that will haunt us for years to come. If we begin to use the \ntax code as a coercive means of social engineering, then I submit that \nthere is no end in sight.\n  Today, smokers will be asked to pay a huge share of their income to \nthe federal government and tomorrow, who will be next?\n\n       I fear the precedent of the anti-smoking remedies now \n     before Congress. What will they be used for next? Perhaps \n     fat. Excuse me, Big Fat. As I understand it, fat, when used \n     as intended, causes heart disease, which actually kills more \n     people each year than smoking. And have you seen any of those \n     chocolate ads, the ones targeting children, or the adult \n     versions, where a beautiful woman caresses a nougat bar with \n     her moist alluring lips? Consider that there are no warnings \n     on boxes of high-fat cake about the hazards to our health, no \n     restrictions on purchases of bacon by people under 26 and, to \n     my knowledge, no lawsuits. How about a fax tax?\n\n  That's from Fred Barbash in the Washington Post, April 19, 1998.\n  Mr. President, I believe that passage of the McCain legislation is \ngoing to have a dramatic impact on the lives of millions of adult \nsmokers across the country who are going to have to bear a significant \nprice increase to purchase legal tobacco products.\n  It also perpetuates a tax and spend mentality that our constituents \nhave rejected, as well as sets us sliding down the slippery slope. And, \nnot only do we have no hard data that this is going to achieve the goal \nof preventing kids from smoking, we have evidence suggesting that it \nwon't.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss why I believe it is so important that the U.S. Senate pass \nstrong legislation to protect our children from the tobacco companies \nthat are preying on them.\n  I got my real start in public service in Eugene, OR, right after I \ngot out of law school in my twenties in Lane County in Oregon. I \nstarted a senior citizens legal clinic. I was able to get almost all of \nthe attorneys in town to volunteer their time, coming to the senior \ncitizens center to help the older people with the varied legal problems \nthat seniors have.\n  At the legal clinic when I was in my twenties I saw firsthand the \nextraordinary health consequences that smoking has for our citizens. I \nsaw older people come to that legal clinic in Lane County in Oregon \nracked with emphysema. They were struggling for every breath.\n  I found myself, having organized this legal clinic to help older \npeople, having to console the widows and widowers of cancer victims, \nfamilies that lost loved ones years and years before their time. I saw \nthen when I set up that senior citizens legal clinic exactly what \ncigarettes can do to the health and well-being of our citizens and the \ntoll that they take on American families.\n  So when I decided to seek elected office I said that I would put a \nspecial focus on my service in the U.S. Senate in trying to improve the \nhealth care of our citizens. I said that I wanted to focus on health \ncare issues in a meaningful way, because I came to feel that if a \nperson doesn't have their health care, doesn't have well-being, then \nthey can't really focus on much of anything else. If they and their \nloved ones can't get access to decent medical care and they are \nsuffering, there really aren't many other issues that a person and a \nfamily can focus on.\n  When I came to the U.S. Congress, I said I am going to remember all \nthose seniors that I met at the legal clinic when I got out of law \nschool, and I said if we really are going to take strong steps to \nimprove the health of our citizens, we had to take on these tobacco \ncompanies, and that we will take them on even if it was a tough fight \nin order to make the lives of our citizens better when they got older. \nAnd it was just that simple.\n  The older people that I saw in that legal program didn't get started \nsmoking when they were 48 or 55. They got started in their teens. They \ngot started as kids when they were the age of Adam Wyden and his sister \nLilly.\n  So I felt then that all other issues revolved around whether our \ncitizens had their health. I remember those older people who came to \nthe legal clinic in Oregon. I said we are going to take steps to make \ntheir lives better, and I am going to make that a special focus of my \nservice in the Congress.\n  So when I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1980, I was \nable to win a position on the House Health Care Subcommittee, a \ncommittee that, in my view, turned out some of the most important \npublic health legislation in our country's history under the \nextraordinary leadership of Henry Waxman. I got to serve with one of \nthe most courageous public officials who has ever served in the U.S. \nCongress, the late Mike Synar.\n  Against all odds, against all odds when he faced tremendous \nresistance in his home district, the late Mike Synar was willing to \nstand up for kids, and, in fact, wrote one of the first and the most \nimportant public health statutes to protect kids against the tobacco \ncompanies that prey on them, the statute known as the Synar amendment. \nOf course, the tobacco companies worked very hard to try to get around \nthat because the Synar amendment stood for the proposition that we were \ngoing to enforce tough laws to protect our minors at the State level. \nThat was too much for the tobacco companies, just as they sought hard \nto get around the early advertising restrictions on the electronic \nnews, just as they sought to get around the early warning labels, they \nsought to evade the mission and the specific requirements of the Synar \nlegislation.\n  So Mike Synar, Henry Waxman, I, and others worked through the 1980s \nto try to rein in these tobacco companies and improve the lives of our \nchildren.\n  A little over 4 years ago we were at the now well-recognized hearing \nwith the tobacco CEOs who under oath addressed for the first time \nbefore the U.S. Congress these major public health questions that the \nSenate has been occupied with over the last couple of days.\n  Mr. President, it was an extraordinary hearing. It went on for more \nthan 7 hours. The executives said, for example, that cigarettes were \nsort of like Hostess Twinkies. They said that, of course, they never \never would target young people. And for more than 7 hours they said \nunder oath that cigarettes essentially were not something that the U.S. \nCongress should be focusing on. They said it is just like any other \nhealth concern a person might have with sugar or with fat. Why is the \nU.S. Congress singling out tobacco, was essentially their message over \na hearing that lasted more than 7 hours.\n  Chairman Waxman, Mike Synar, and others did, in my view, a \nsuperlative job trying to put the key issues on the record. When it \ncame to my initial turn I felt that it was especially important to get \nthe executives' position on whether nicotine was addictive. We had them \nall in front of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Subcommittee on \nHealth. They were under oath. So I simply said I am going to go down \nthe row. I am going to go down the row and ask each one of these \nexecutives one after another whether nicotine is addictive. So I began.\n  The first executive said nicotine was not an addictive substance. The \nsecond executive said that nicotine was not addictive. The third one \nraised questions again about why anyone would possibly have \nreservations about this issue, specifically why we would be asking \nwhether nicotine was addictive. And all of the executives then under \noath said for the first time that nicotine was not an addictive \nsubstance.\n  They contradicted the Surgeon General, who has come before health \ncommittees in the Congress for more than 20 years, and perhaps even \nmore importantly, they contradicted what their own executives were \nsaying for more than 30 years. That, of course, came out after the \nhearing took place. But what has been especially telling is that, after \nthat historic hearing in 1994 when the executives said nicotine wasn't \naddictive and didn't target kids, a voluminous record has been made by \nvarious committees in the Congress which documents and makes very clear \nthat these executives, in fact, knew all along that nicotine was \naddictive. There was not any question in their minds about whether it \nwas addictive.\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\n Their own documents had proved that. But yet they told the U.S. House \nof Representatives, the Subcommittee on Health, and myself specifically \nunder oath that nicotine was not addictive.\n  I think that moment contributed in a significant way to our achieving \na chance now to pass important legislation to protect our children. But \nthere were a number of other important issues that were brought up that \nday before the Health Subcommittee that have implications even this \nevening as the Senate considers this historic legislation. And I would \nlike to just touch on one of those.\n  At that hearing, it came to light that one tobacco company, Brown & \nWilliamson, was in fact genetically altering nicotine in order to give \nit an extra punch, in order to make it more addictive to children and \nothers who used the product. The Food and Drug Administration under the \nleadership of David Kessler had essentially brought this to light. The \ncommittee confronted the Brown & Williamson Company, and they were \nunder oath and said that they would cease utilizing this high-nicotine \ntobacco called 1Y. So this was more than 4 years ago. It came to light \nas a result of the investigative work done by the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  After the Brown & Williamson Company was caught using 1Y, this \ngenetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco, they said they would not do \nit anymore.\n  A number of things happened over the last 4 years. One of them was \nthat I had the honor of being chosen by the people of Oregon to serve \nin the Senate, and I was chosen to serve in the Senate January 30 of \n1996. Having had the additional privilege of being named to serve on \nthe Senate Commerce Committee under the outstanding leadership of John \nMcCain, and our ranking Democrat, Fritz Hollings, I had a chance to \nparticipate in the next round of important tobacco hearings under John \nMcCain's leadership. We held a number of them prior to the committee's \nconsideration of the legislation that is now before us. And when \nSenator McCain asked the executives--and a number of them, of course, \nare new--to come before the Senate Commerce Committee, I asked Brown & \nWilliamson what was the current status of the use of 1Y genetically \naltered, high-nicotine tobacco.\n  The reason I asked the question is that I had read news reports that \nthis special, genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco was in fact \nstill being used by the Brown & Williamson Company even though the \ncompany had said under oath that it would no longer use this \ngenetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco. And in fact at that \nimportant hearing chaired by our leader on the committee, John McCain, \nBrown & Williamson said in fact that they are now working off a small \nstockpile of genetically altered nicotine. There is already a criminal \ninvestigation underway.\n  The reason that I bring this to the attention of the Senate tonight \nis for just one reason. If this company is so brazen as to engage in \nthis conduct, having promised the American people that they would no \nlonger do it again, and now being watched under the scrutiny of the \nCongress, what will it be like, Mr. President and colleagues, when in \nfact the hot spotlight is turned away from tobacco? This company has \nengaged in activity that they pledged to the American people they no \nlonger would engage in, and they told the McCain committee that they \nare now working off a small stockpile of genetically altered, high-\nnicotine tobacco and that this product is being used in our country and \noverseas.\n  The other reason that I bring this to the attention of the Senate, \nMr. President and colleagues, is this goes right to the heart of the \nindustry's argument that it is a new day and that they are pursuing a \nnew standard with respect to corporate citizenship. Before the McCain \ncommittee, the executives came and said: We realize that what happened \nin yesteryear was no longer acceptable. We are going to clean up our \nact. We are going to make sure that young people are not targeted.\n\n  I think it is the impulse of all of us to say, new executives, new \nday; let's look at this anew. But when it came to light that Brown & \nWilliamson was again using genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco \nafter promising the American people and the Congress that they would no \nlonger engage in the practice, that is a pretty blatant contradiction \nof the claim that things really are different, that it is a new day, \nand that tobacco companies want to clean up their act.\n  As we consider this legislation on the floor of the Senate, Mr. \nPresident and colleagues, the Justice Department continues its inquiry \ninto the use of this genetically altered nicotine, and there have \nalready been criminal pleas that have been entered into.\n  Now, having said that, and noting some of the great challenges, let \nme also talk about what I think is a significant success, and I am \nparticularly pleased to have an opportunity to do it while Chairman \nMcCain is here and on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President and Chairman McCain, I will tell you that when I left \nthe Waxman hearings in 1994, walking out of that hearing room with the \nlate Mike Synar, I told him that I was not convinced that we would make \nreal headway in this fight to protect our children in our lifetime. I \nsaid to Mike Synar, ``We are going to be up against all of the odds. We \nare going to be up against a lobbyist tidal wave. I am not sure we are \never going to do it in our lifetime.''\n  We lost the late Mike Synar years before his time, but a lot of us \nsaid that we are going to continue that work. And we have the \nopportunity to do it because Chairman McCain was courageous enough to \ntake on this issue, come to Members of the Senate like myself, come to \nthe public health groups, and say that we are going to focus on this \nissue until we get it done.\n  He did not minimize how tough a job it was. All he has to do is look \ndown the row of his committee members. He has our good friend, Wendell \nFord, sitting a few places away from me. It is going to be a challenge \nto get Wendell Ford and Ron Wyden to support a bill. We both did in the \nSenate Commerce Committee.\n  I commend Chairman McCain at this time because we would not be on \nthis floor, we would not have made as much progress, had he not been \nwilling to take this issue on. I say to you, Mr. President, and to the \ncountry, we have come a long way. If you had told me 4 years ago, when \nI walked out of the Waxman hearings, that we would now be debating \nwhether to impose fines of billions of dollars on companies that do not \nmeet tough targets in reducing youth smoking, if you had told me 4 \nyears ago that we would be having a debate on how to do that and impose \nthose penalties, I would have asked you, ``What are you smoking?'' \nBecause I thought there would never ever be an opportunity like that in \nmy lifetime.\n  We have that opportunity because John McCain has focused on this \nissue and brought together a group in the Senate that certainly does \nnot agree on every single issue--that has been very clear--but does \nagree on how important it is to focus on this and get the job done.\n  Now, I do want to touch for just a few additional moments on several \nof the specific issues that have been important to me, and talk for a \nbit about why that is the case.\n  First, I am certain that many Members of the Senate have not heard \nabout the accountability requirements that are in the legislation that \nwe take up this week. And the word ``accountability,'' for me and most \npublic health specialists, is probably the single most important word \nin the discussion of this whole subject, because in the past it has not \nbeen possible to hold the tobacco companies accountable. For all of the \npast legislative efforts designed to rein them in--the Synar amendment, \nthe early warning labels, the restrictions on electronic advertising--\nthe industry would use their marketing and entrepreneurial talent and \nwould find a way around them. So when we focused on enforcement issues \nin the committee, I began to discuss with Chairman McCain and the \nbipartisan leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee how we could \nassure our children and future generations that there would be an \nongoing watchdog who would scrutinize the practices of the tobacco \ncompanies when they inevitably try to get around the new law that I \nhope this Congress passes and that I know President Clinton will sign.\n  The tobacco companies, once again, when we get a new law, will put \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nentrepreneurial and marketing talent to the task of getting around it. \nThey will have scores of slick strategies to employ to try to get \naround these protections. With the accountability requirements in this \nlegislation, we will have an ongoing watchdog who will be in a position \nto let us know when the tobacco companies start trying to evade an \nimportant new public health law, as they have done every single time \nfor decades.\n  With the accountability requirements, public health officials, the \nSurgeon General, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, and \nthe Office of Minority Health, will be involved in looking at company-\nspecific behavior to determine whether a company is trying to evade the \nrequirements of this law. They will be able to recommend at any time \nthat a company that seeks to evade the strictures of this statute ought \nto have any liability protection they have pulled. Tobacco companies \nclearly have not been straight with the Congress. All their documents \nthat came out after the 1994 hearings that contradicted what the \nexecutive said under oath in 1994 have made it very clear to me the \nsingle most important word in this debate--the single most \nintellectually honest word in this debate--is ``accountability.'' I, \nagain, thank Chairman McCain and his staff. They were under a lot of \npressure from powerful interests to essentially strip out these \naccountability requirements. Once again, Chairman McCain hung in there \nfor the public health, and I want to tell him how much I appreciate \nthat.\n  There are two other issues I would like to touch on briefly, with the \nfirst being the issue of the health care of our minority citizens and \nthose in communities inhabited by many minority Americans. For years, \nagain as has come out in documents since the 1994 hearings, the tobacco \ncompanies have shamelessly targeted these minority youngsters and \nminority communities to sell their products. I think it is critically \nimportant now that in this legislation there be resources specifically \ntargeted to these minority communities and to minority youngsters who \nare preyed upon by the tobacco industry. This legislation provides a \nfirst step toward addressing the  health concerns of minorities by \nassuring that all of the State efforts for smoking cessation and \nprevention include minority populations, and that services can be made \navailable through community-based organizations.\n\n  In the Congressional Black Caucus, for example, Congressman Bennie \nThompson has done a yeoman's job in terms of trying to focus both the \nother body and the U.S. Senate on this issue. I know they have talked \nabout this with Chairman McCain. This issue is not one that we are \ngoing to allow to be swept under the rug. It is not right to see so \nmany minority youngsters get involved with tobacco at an early age, and \nit is unconscionable the way these tobacco companies have targeted our \nminority communities. In addition to the support for the State plans \nfor smoking cessation and prevention, the Office of Minority Health \nwill be represented on the accountability panel. In my view, this is a \nsignificant win for the cause of minority health.\n  We are going to have much to do as we consider these questions \nthrough the rest of the debate in the U.S. Senate and in the House. I \nam particularly troubled about the prospect that some of the focus on \nimproving the health of our minority citizens, and specifically seeing \na reduction in smoking among minority youngsters, will get lost if the \nfinal judgment by the Congress on this issue is to create a State block \ngrant approach. I don't want to see this issue, which has been \nneglected for so long, lost in some sort of amorphous block grant \nwhere, once again, the health needs of minority youngsters and minority \ncommunities get lost. So there are going to be a number of Members of \nthe U.S. Senate who care about this issue, particularly Senators \nJeffords and Harkin, and I am looking forward to working with them to \nstrengthen the minority provisions, minority health provisions of this \nlegislation. I know that Congressman Bennie Thompson is going to bring \nhis talents and energy to doing that as the House considers the bill as \nwell.\n  Finally, there is one last issue I would like to raise. I have been \ntalking tonight about the needs of youngsters in the United States. I \nrepresent the people of Oregon. I have the privilege of representing \nthem, serving with my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith who, in my view, \nhas been a very strong voice for protecting youngsters in this debate. \nI appreciate that very much. We are both very proud to represent \nOregon, and to work to improve the health of youngsters all across this \ncountry.\n  But I come tonight, as well, to talk about an issue that I think \nought to strike at our moral conscience, and that is, as I have said, \nto say that it is critically important that we protect kids in Bend, \nOR, across the country, in Bangor, ME, and communities in between. But \nit is also critically important to protect kids in Bangladesh and \nBangkok, because a child is a child is a child. And I hope--it is my \nfervent hope--that when this bill heads to the President of the United \nStates, that we will have put in place extremely strong health \nprotections for youngsters across the world.\n  Let us not say on our watch that to pay for a settlement, a tobacco \nsettlement in the United States, the children around the world lost \ntheir health. Let us not sacrifice the lungs of youngsters around the \nworld to pay for a settlement here. Let's protect kids in the United \nStates. That is what we have a sworn obligation to do. But let us not \nforget youngsters around the world who don't have lobbyists, who don't \nhave lawyers and the great array of talent that so many powerful \ninterest groups have.\n  I will say that if we don't speak for those children all over the \nworld on our watch--the Presiding Officer of the Senate and I are about \nthe same age, I am a little older, I resent that, but a little older--\nbut on our watch, millions of youngsters around the world will get sick \nduring our lifetime and die needlessly. I know that the Presiding \nOfficer and all our colleagues don't want to see that. That is why I \nthink it is so important that we pass the provisions in this \nlegislation that will protect youngsters around the world when the \ntobacco companies target them.\n  Make no mistake about it, that is the game plan. The game plan for \nthe tobacco companies is consumption is going down here--it is well \ndocumented--and it is going up at a staggeringly high level around the \nworld. The evidence shows, for example, that for every smoker who quits \nin the United States, two start in China. There are countries around \nthe world that actually are in support of companies that sponsor \ncontests to see how many cigarettes a youngster can smoke at one time. \nIf we don't take the steps to protect these youngsters around the world \nwho are envisaged in the McCain legislation before us, we will have the \nbizarre situation where a tobacco company in the United States won't be \nable to slap a decal on some car or something that is utilized at a \nsporting event, but that same company will be able to participate in \nthese contests around the world to see how many cigarettes a youngster \ncan smoke.\n  I don't think we ought to have that kind of double standard where we \nsay we are going to protect kids here but we are really not much \ninterested around the world. I know that this is an issue that a lot of \nMembers are not familiar with, but we are going to take the time over \nthe next few days and, in the days ahead, to make sure that they are, \nbecause I think those kids count, too.\n  The legislation before us today is not all that I would want, and it \nis not all that Senator Durbin and Senator Wellstone and Senator Harkin \nand many others who have been interested in this issue would want \neither. We really had our ideal plan and consideration in the Senate \nCommerce Committee. Chairman McCain was straight and realistic with us. \nWe knew that we couldn't win that kind of package on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate, so we vowed that we were going to lay a foundation to \nprotect the health of youngsters around the world, as well as \nyoungsters here, and that is what we have done in this legislation.\n  It wouldn't be my first choice, but to tell you the truth, Senator \nHollings, who very graciously worked with us essentially nonstop over \nthe weekend, wouldn't think it is his first choice either. But that is \nwhat the legislative\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nprocess is all about. What this legislation does with respect to kids \naround the world is very, very important.\n  Make no mistake about it, it is a strong beginning at laying out a \nglobal policy to protect kids around the world. It essentially does \nthree things.\n  First, for all time--for all time--it gets the Federal Government out \nof the business, through the U.S. Trade Representative and other \nagencies, of promoting the sale of tobacco overseas. For the first \ntime, the U.S. Trade Representative will be directed to consult with \nthe Department of Health and Human Services concerning any trade \nactions related to tobacco. The U.S. Trade Representative will not be \nacting in a vacuum. They are required to let the Congress of the United \nStates know when tobacco companies approach them on these matters. I \nthink it is fair to say that with respect to the role of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and the Federal agencies that are charged with leading \nthe international trade effort, that never again, as a matter of \nFederal law, will we have them promoting the sale of tobacco overseas.\n  Second, for the first time, we will require that U.S. health warnings \non cigarette packs for exports are carried in a specific way. In \neffect, we are making it clear that the kind of warning labels, health-\nspecific, that we have in the United States have to apply overseas. If \nthe other governments around the world choose to put another warning \non, it has to be substantially similar--substantially similar--in terms \nof the warning provided to our citizens.\n  It would not be right, as our colleague Dick Durbin has said, to let \nthem off by putting on a warning, ``Well, cigarettes may cause bad \nbreath,'' or, as some have seen in other parts of the world, \n``Cigarette smoking may be inconvenient to your neighbor.'' That won't \ndo.\n  Around the world, as a result of the legislation  incorporated into \nthe McCain bill that we are considering now on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, the warning that is health specific used in our country will \nhave to be used around the world by regulation unless it is \nsubstantially similar. Those labels will make it clear that smoking is \nharmful, and they will be scientifically based.\n\n  The administration is charged with finding the most effective \ncompliance mechanism and assuring that the labels are in the language \nof the country of destination. That is extremely important and \nsomething long sought by the public health groups.\n  Finally--I guess our colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, took \nparticular issue with this--this for the first time puts resources into \nthe effort to work in an educational fashion around the globe. Several \nhundred million dollars is devoted to our participation in these global \nkinds of health efforts which are critically important, because if, for \nexample, we learn about an important educational innovation that really \ndoes reach kids--for example, some of the counteradvertising that is \nalready showing real promise in deterring youth smoking--we want to \nmake sure that this kind of information is easily shared with the \nglobal network of public health specialists.\n  This isn't going to be sort of sock the Government. This is to make \nsure that kids around the world don't get sick. If we can prevent those \nillnesses, those countries will be able to avoid some of the much \nlarger medical bills which often, as our colleagues know--particularly \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate because of his role in foreign \naffairs--and avoid coming to our Government to ask for support to deal \nwith it.\n  So again, if we can prevent these illnesses among young people, \nparticularly as it relates to tobacco, my sense is that the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate will see fewer demands for help with much greater \nmedical bills which will come about as youngsters get hooked and \naddicted to tobacco.\n  Finally, the bill sets up a system to combat smuggling, and in much \nthe same way the Federal Government today enforces the law against the \nsmuggling of alcohol. And in regard to the smuggling provisions, I \nparticularly want to commend the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, who has long been involved in this issue.\n  The tobacco companies, as a number of our colleagues already noted to \nme, do not want these provisions in this legislation. They do not want \nthese provisions to ruin their business plans to target kids overseas. \nThat is what the game plan is all about, Mr. President, and colleagues. \nIt is about recognizing that consumption is going down in our country \nand skyrocketing around the world. With the export provisions, through \nremoving the U.S. Trade Representative and Federal officials from the \nbusiness of promoting tobacco permanently, through the warning labels, \nthrough the funds to participate in educational efforts, we make a very \nstrong start to protect kids around the world. And I again thank \nChairman McCain for his help.\n  Mr. President, I want to wrap up with one last point.\n  I think I am the only Member of the U.S. Congress on either side who \nhad the privilege in the last few years to participate in historic \nhearings in both of the Commerce Committees. I had the honor of serving \non Henry Waxman's subcommittee as a Member of the other body and I am \nnow honored to have the chance to serve with John McCain, who has done \nso much to bring this bill to the floor tonight.\n  I will say that I think we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to \nprotect kids. That is what this is all about. At the end of the day, it \nis not about all these arcane and technical questions that we are \ndebating on the floor of the Senate. That is not to say those questions \nare unimportant. They are. They are very important.\n  I will tell you, all of our colleagues who I have heard have been \nasking important questions. But as we ask those important questions, \nlet us not lose sight of the end game here, which is to protect kids.\n  We have a President who is willing to take on the tobacco lobbies. \nThat is a major reason we have come thus far. We have a chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee who has reached across both sides of the \naisle to try to fashion a strong bill. We have public health groups all \nover this country who have made the case with their volunteers, with \ntheir physicians, with their nurses, with all of the individuals who \nparticipate in these superb organizations that now is the time, now is \nthe time to act. And that means passing a bill in this Senate.\n  It is not going to be the perfect bill. It is not going to be what \nany of us would like in an ideal world. That is why I said there are a \nnumber of aspects of the export provisions that I was very bothered to \nsee disappear. Senator Hollings has concerns about what is in there--\nthat is the process of fashioning legislation--but we were able to make \na strong start at protecting our kids. And if the Senate passes this \nbill, and does it in a timely way, we can make a difference for kids \nhere and around the world.\n  But I say, Mr. President, and colleagues--and I will conclude with \nthis--the clock is ticking. It is not exactly an atomic secret that \nthere are not many days left in the session. And delay is the best \nfriend that the advocates of the status quo could possibly have. Delay \nis the very best friend of the tobacco lobbies that want to engage in \nbusiness as usual. Delay is a perfect opportunity for all of those who \nsay, ``Tobacco company profits ought to come before the health of kids, \nthat, well, we just have to study this longer. We don't know all the \nfacts.''\n  I say, Mr. President, and colleagues, that we will have a chance all \nthe way through this process, through the amendments on the floor, and \nthe House considers its legislation and passes it, as we go to \nconference, we will have a chance to learn more, to refine this \nlegislation and to improve it. That is what we did through the many \nhearings that were held in the Senate Commerce Committee. That is what \nhas happened through the work done by the Labor Committee, the \nJudiciary Committee, with so many of our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. But let us not miss this opportunity to pass this \nlegislation. We have to do it soon. The clock is ticking.\n  Mr. President, this bill will be good for our children. More \nimportantly, it will be good for our children's children. It is my \nfervent hope that this Senate passes this legislation, and does so in \nan expeditious way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Arizona.\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before my colleague from Oregon leaves the floor, I \nexpress to him, first of all, my appreciation for his kind remarks, \nwhich I do not deserve. Second of all, I thank him for all the work \nthat he has done on this legislation. Without him and his incredibly \nactive participation in this effort, we would not have been able to \nreach the goal of getting a bill through the Commerce Committee and now \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  But most importantly, I thank the Senator from Oregon because he was \ninvolved in this issue very long before I or most of the Members of \nthis body were involved. He and former Congressman Synar embarked on \nthis effort long ago. And sometimes we have a reputation, which is well \ndeserved as politicians, of butterflying from one issue to the other \nand forgetting the one of yesterday for the one of today and tomorrow.\n  Senator Wyden does not take that approach on any issue, but on this \nissue he has been steadfast. He has been courageous. And, very frankly, \nhe has been criticized from time to time, when the mood of the country \nwas not as it is today. There was a time when we did not know all of \nthe details about the tobacco companies having deceived the American \npeople. There was a time when the tobacco lobby, we all know, had a \nmuch greater influence on both sides of the Capitol than today. It was \nduring those times that Senator Wyden carried the torch for the \nchildren of America.\n  I will always be grateful to him. And history will record that \nSenator Wyden was a key and vital player in that effort. So I extend my \ngratitude to Senator Wyden and remind him that we have a great deal yet \nto do. I know I can count on him to do it.\n\n\n                          EXPLANATION OF VOTE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to inform the Senate of the reason \nI voted ``present'' on the Faircloth amendment related to attorneys' \nfees in tobacco litigation.\n  I abstained on this vote because my husband's law firm is co-counsel \nin several lawsuits against tobacco companies filed in California state \ncourt by health and welfare trust funds.\n  The Ethics Committee has advised me that voting on an amendment such \nas this ``would not pose an actual conflict of interest'' under the \nSenate Code of Conduct.\n  However, I decided that this vote could create the appearance of a \nconflict of interest and therefore I abstained by voting ``present.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5190-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, this evening, a number of us will be \ngathering together to honor Stuart Balderson who recently retired from \nthe United States Senate after nearly four decades of exemplary \nservice. I would like to take just a few moments to thank Stuart and to \nwish him well as he begins the next chapter of his life.\n  On May 23, 1960, Stuart Balderson, a twenty-two year old fresh out of \nthe Navy, came to work in the United States Senate. At that time, \nLyndon Johnson was the Majority Leader and Dwight D. Eisenhower was in \nthe White House. Stuart was brought on board by Secretary of the Senate \n``Skeeter'' Johnston and assigned a position in the Senate Finance \nOffice. Over the course of the next 38 years, Stuart worked in every \ndepartment of that office, including payroll, accounting, retirement \nand benefits, and legislative budgeting. In 1980, he assumed its top \nposition, Financial Clerk of the United States Senate, and served in \nthat capacity for the next 18 years.\n  Over the past 38 years, Stuart has seen a lot of history on Capitol \nHill. To give you an idea of how much things have changed, when Stuart \nbegan working in the Senate, the Capitol Building was still using \ndirect current from its own generators. You needed to use an AC adaptor \nif you wanted to plug in any electrical equipment, but there wasn't \nmuch electrical equipment to plug in. In those days, ``computers'' \nreferred to the people who calculated the numbers rather than to any \nmachines they used. Stuart's predecessor, Bill Ridgely, used to call \nthose the ``Bob Cratchitt'' days of the Disbursing Office, when the \nSenate's bookkeepers, like Bob Cratchitt in Dickens' A Christmas Carol, \nwore green visors and armbands and sat on high stools.\n  A lot has changed since then. The number of Senate employees relying \non the Senate Finance Office to handle their paychecks has more than \ndoubled. Total Senate expenditures have risen from $25.9 million in \n1960 to $583.3 million in 1997. In many ways, Stuart grew with the \nSenate, but the two things that always remained constant were his \ndedication to this institution and the financial integrity he brought \nto the job.\n  I know I speak for many other members and staff, past and present, \nwhen I say that we will miss Stuart. We commend him for his long and \noutstanding service and we wish him well as he retires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5215-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, when Jimmy Stewart died last July, less \nthan a year shy of his 90th birthday, which would have been today, \nmillions of Americans of all ages felt they had lost a dear friend. \nThey had grown up with great films such as ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' \n``Harvey,'' ``The Philadelphia Story,'' and the one that's probably \nmany Americans' personal favorite, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.''\n  I was fortunate to get to work with Mr. Stewart during the 1970s when \nwe were on the campaign trail across North Carolina. Dot and I will \nnever forget travelling with him introducing him to the citizens who \nfelt that they already knew him.\n  Perhaps what I like most about ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' is \nthe manner in which Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra captured the \ntimeless principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence. In \ndescribing the them of the picture, Capra said: ``The more uncertain \nare the people of the world, the more their hard-won freedoms are \nscattered and lost in the winds of change, the more they need a ringing \nstatement of America's democratic ideals.''\n  Jimmy Stewart, Mr. President, in a sense was playing a character \nmodeled after Abe Lincoln. According to Capra, Jefferson Smith was \n``tailored to the rail-splitter's simplicity, compassion, ideals, humor \nand unswerving moral courage under pressure.''\n  A year ago, on the occasion of Jimmy Stewart's eighty-ninth birthday, \nJohn Meroney of Advance, N.C., wrote a Wall Street Journal essay, ``A \nHero Larger Than Those He Portrayed,'' celebrating Jimmy Stewart's life \nand career. I learned about John Meroney when he was a student at Wake \nForest University. I am persuaded the reason Jimmy Stewart appeals to \nJohn and other young people isn't simply because Mr.\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\nStewart made some of the greatest pictures of all-time. I believe, Mr. \nPresident, that it's the contrast between Jimmy Stewart and so many of \nthose who live and work in Hollywood today. It's hard to imagine anyone \nout there capturing America's heart the way Jimmy Stewart did, and via \nhis countless films, still does. It's as John Meroney put it, it isn't \nbecause Jimmy played great characters. It's because of the way Jimmy \nStewart lived his life.\n  So, Mr. President, in commemoration of the birthday of an American \noriginal, James Maitland Stewart, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof Mr. Meroney's column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 20, 1997]\n\n                 A Hero Larger Than Those He Portrayed\n\n                           (By John Meroney)\n\n       Beverly Hills, Calif.--James Stewart turns 89 today, and he \n     will mark his birthday in a fitting manner--quietly at home, \n     without the trappings of celebrity that he has avoided his \n     entire life. It's also fitting that a man whose movies \n     celebrate middle American values has lived in the same, \n     rather plain Tudor-style house on a block absent the typical \n     L.A. glitz for almost 50 years.\n       Mr. Stewart is not just one of the greatest American movie \n     actors of all time, he's also probably the last cultural icon \n     from his generation. Although it helps, working with \n     directors like Ford, Wilder, DeMille and Hitchcock doesn't \n     necessarily bring such exalted status. Nor does having your \n     face projected 50 feet tall on movie screens for four \n     decades. Many others have been that fortunate, yet are now \n     forgotten. The parts you play, the message you carry, the \n     life you live--that's what gives audiences what Mr. Stewart \n     calls the ``little tiny pieces of time that they never \n     forget.''\n       It was the director Frank Capra, an Italian immigrant who \n     had a love affair with America, who gave Mr. Stewart the \n     roles that stand out as eloquent and intelligent celebrations \n     of American ideals and principles. Perhaps the best of these \n     was found in Capra's 1939 feature ``Mr. Smith Goes to \n     Washington,'' in which Mr. Stewart played Jefferson Smith, an \n     idealistic young man who becomes a U.S. senator only to have \n     his hopes shattered when he discovers that his political \n     heroes are dishonest. In a town where politics is a serious \n     game, he's told, players have to check their ideals at the \n     door. When he challenges this orthodoxy, Smith learns lessons \n     the likes of which Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas could \n     appreciate. But in the end, Smith triumphs, justice prevails, \n     and a political machine is destroyed.\n       The establishment wasn't amused. Halfway through the \n     Constitution Hall premiere, senators and congressmen began \n     walking out. Members of the press corps, portrayed as elite \n     snobs with their own agendas, were outraged. The Senate \n     majority leader, Alben W. Barkley, called the movie a \n     ``grotesque distortion, as grotesque as anything I have ever \n     seen.'' Ambassador Joe Kennedy wired Columbia Pictures \n     President Harry Cohn from London and pleaded with him to \n     block the European distribution, fearful it would be used as \n     propaganda by the Axis powers.\n       Moviegoers in America and abroad saw ``Mr. Smith'' \n     differently. In France, it was the last English-language film \n     to be shown before the Nazi ban in 1942. Audiences there \n     spontaneously erupted with standing ovations during Stewart's \n     scene at the Lincoln Memorial. Observed one reporter: ``It \n     was as though the joys, suffering, love and hatred, the hopes \n     and wishes of an entire people who value freedom above \n     everything, found expression for the very last time.''\n       Like some of his roles, Jimmy Stewart's life also \n     symbolizes the American dream. Born near the Allegheny \n     mountains in the coal mining town of Indiana, Pa., he was \n     raised by parents who instilled in him values Hollywood \n     couldn't corrupt. His father ran the local hardware store, \n     which was, for Mr. Stewart, ``the center of the universe.'' \n     When he won the Best Actor Oscar for ``The Philadelphia \n     Story'' in 1941, he remembers, ``It was 3:45 [a.m.] when I \n     got home and the phone rang. It was my father: `I hear on the \n     radio they gave you a prize or something. What is it, a \n     plaque or a statue?' I told him it was a sort of a statue. He \n     said, `Well, send it home to me and I'll put in the hardware \n     store window.' So the next day, I got it, packed it up, and \n     sent it. It was there for 20 years.''\n       Drafted in 1941--``I keep saying that's the only lottery I \n     ever won''--Mr. Stewart became the commander of an Eighth Air \n     Force squadron, and a genuine war hero. After flying some 25 \n     missions over enemy territory with a copy of Psalm 91 that \n     his father gave him in his pocket, he returned to Hollywood \n     in 1945 as Col. Stewart, and was promptly decorated with the \n     Air Medal and Distinguished Flying Cross. Active in the \n     reserves until 1968, Jimmy Stewart retired with the rank of \n     brigadier general. Of his combat experience, and the horrors \n     of war, Gen. Stewart once said, ``Everybody was scared. You \n     just had to handle that. I prayed a lot.''\n       During the 1940s and 1950s, while making such popular films \n     as ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' ``Rear Window'' and ``Harvey,'' \n     Mr. Stewart found that his traditional conservative political \n     beliefs were becoming increasingly unpopular among his \n     colleagues. Hearings by the House Un-American Activities \n     Committee and its foray into Hollywood proved troublesome for \n     Mr. Stewart because of his staunch anticommunism. It tested \n     his long friendship with Henry Fonda, an outspoken liberal \n     critical of HUAC. But Mr. Fonda couldn't resist his friend's \n     intrinsic decency, and they agreed not to discuss politics to \n     preserve their friendship. Mr. Fonda also understood that Mr. \n     Stewart's beliefs had not come cheap. Unlike many families \n     here who have escaped making the sacrifices that freedom \n     often demands, the Stewarts lost a son in Vietnam when their \n     oldest was killed in 1969.\n       The authenticity in Jimmy Stewart's personal life, so \n     evident in his film career, seems to be a rarity in \n     Hollywood. ``There was something so totally real in his own \n     way,'' Kim Novak, his co-star in ``Vertigo,'' told me. ``How \n     often can you find somebody who's spent his whole life in \n     Hollywood but represents so much of America?''\n       Director Ron Howard acted with Mr. Stewart in ``The \n     Shootist,'' a 1976 film that teamed them with the Duke. \n     ``John Wayne was sort of a mythological figure,'' says Mr. \n     Howard. ``Stewart wasn't aspiring to that. He was a character \n     for us to relate to.''\n       The way Jimmy Stewart has lived his 89 years is an example \n     today's celebrities--and every American, for that matter--\n     would do well to emulate. When asked in a documentary on his \n     life how he wanted to be remembered, Mr. Stewart answered: \n     ``A guy who believed in hard work, and decent values, love of \n     country, love of family, love of community, love of God.''\n       George C. Scott, Mr. Stewart's co-star in ``Anatomy of a \n     Murder,'' and now one of his neighbors here, summed it up \n     best, albeit sadly, when he told me: ``They don't make them \n     like that anymore. Hollywood misses them already, I'll tell \n     you that.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5215-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT OF THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STUDENT \nOPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP ACT OF 1998--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 128\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval S. 1502, the ``District \nof Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1998.''\n  If we are to prepare our children for the 21st Century by providing \nthem with the best education in the world, we must strengthen our \npublic schools, not abandon them. My agenda for accomplishing this \nincludes raising academic standards; strengthening accountability; \nproviding more public school choice, including public charter schools; \nand providing additional help to students who need it through tutors, \nmentors, and after-school programs. My education agenda also calls for \nreducing class size, modernizing our schools and linking them to the \nInternet, making our schools safe by removing guns drugs, and \ninstilling greater discipline.\n  This bill would create a program of federally funded vouchers that \nwould divert critical Federal resources to private schools instead of \ninvesting in fundamental improvements in public schools. The voucher \nprogram established by S. 1502 would pay for a few selected students to \nattend private schools, with little or no public accountability for how \nthose funds are used, and would draw resources and attention away from \nthe essential work of reforming the public schools that serve the \noverwhelming majority of the District's students. In short, S. 1502 \nwould do nothing to improve public education in the District of \nColumbia. The bill won't hire one new teacher, purchase one more \ncomputer, or open one after-school program.\n  Although I appreciate the interest of the Congress in the educational \nneeds of the children in our Nation's Capital, this bill is \nfundamentally misguided and a disservice to those children.\n  The way to improve education for all our children is to increase \nstandards, accountability, and choice within the public schools. I urge \nthe Congress to send me legislation I have proposed to reduce class \nsize, modernize our schools, end social promotions, raise academic \nstandards for all students, and hold school systems, schools, and staff \naccountable for results.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of \n1978 to enable the Secretary of the Interior to more effectively use \nthe proceeds of sales of certain items; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n           FISH AND WILDLIFE REVENUE ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to amend the \nFish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978.\n  This bill will allow the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary \nof Commerce to more effectively use proceeds from the sale of forfeited \nand abandoned wildlife items.\n  Mr. President, there is a warehouse in Commerce City, Colorado, \noperated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is filled with \nwildlife parts and products.\n  It is the National Repository for items that have been forfeited or \nabandoned to the U.S. Government and are being held for disposition by \nthe Service.\n  Some of these items are quite unusual: mounted rhinoceros, coral \njewelry, stuffed alligators, elephant foot footstools.\n  Some of these items are endangered or otherwise protected by law, and \nit is illegal to import them into the United States.\n  Those companies or individuals who were caught trying to do so either \nabandoned the items or they were forfeited to the U.S. Government \nthrough a legal process.\n  The Service distributes these wildlife items to museums and to \nschools for conservation education programs around the country.\n  Anyone who flew through Denver's old Stapleton Airport, for instance, \nmight have seen a display in the main terminal reminding travelers \nabout various laws regulating importation of wildlife and wildlife \nproducts.\n  A similar display is being erected at Denver International Airport.\n  In addition to the unusual wildlife specimens stored at the Service's \nColorado Repository are some more familiar items such as leather boots, \njackets, purses, watchbands, and sea shells.\n  These are in the possession of the Service because, in many cases, \nthe required foreign export permits were not obtained or the items were \nfalsely identified.\n  Although it is legal to possess and sell many of these wildlife \nitems, there is, of course, a procedure for importing them. This \nincludes obtaining the required foreign export permits prior to \nimportation and properly declaring the items.\n  If these procedures are not followed correctly, then the items can be \nseized.\n  Abandonment or forfeiture actions are then initiated with title being \ntransferred to the Government.\n  Many times, however, the people who try to bring them in will just \nabandon them to the Service.\n  These items are retained by the Service at the Commerce City facility \nuntil an appropriate disposition can be made.\n  I want to take just a moment here to point out that the Repository in \nquestion is located on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal northeast of Denver.\n  This inactive military facility is in the middle of a transformation \nfrom a Superfund site to the largest urban wildlife refuge in the \ncountry.\n  The Arsenal, which once produced nerve agents and chemical weapons, \nis now a haven for eagles, migratory birds, deer, and other wildlife.\n  I've been told that there is hope to one day introduce bison back \ninto the 27 square mile facility.\n  The old Arsenal will become a new gem in the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem, and an excellent resource for the people of Colorado.\n  A Service priority for disposing of these wildlife items is to \nutilize them in scientific and educational programs.\n  There are, however, many items in the Repository inventory excess to \nthe needs of these scientific and educational programs.\n  Those excess items which are not given a high level of protection--\nthose that are not endangered, or marine mammals, or migratory birds--\ncan legally be sold on the open market.\n  If these surplus items were sold by the Service at an auction, they \nwould generate proceeds which could be used to offset operational costs \nof the Repository, thereby allowing for a more efficient use of \nappropriated funds by the Service and a saving of money for the tax \npayers.\n  But there is a hitch. Current law mandates proceeds from the sale \nexcept for those that can be used for rewards, must be returned to the \nGeneral Treasury.\n  This sounds fine, until you consider the mechanics of holding an \nauction.\n  An auctioneer charges a commission which is usually a percentage of \nthe proceeds from a sale.\n  Since the Service estimates that they have about one million-dollars \nworth of surplus wildlife items on hand, which is a 10 year backlog, \nthey can expect to pay the auctioneer a commission of around 15 percent \nor about $150,000.\n  Now, the budget for the Repository in Fiscal Year 1998 is $310,000 \nwith salaries alone costing 80 percent of that number. They simply \ncannot pay about half of their funding towards an auctioneer's \ncommission, and that is what they would have to do under current law.\n  Although a sale would bring in money, the majority of the proceeds \nwould go to the General Treasury, and the Service would have to use \nmoney already in their operational budget to pay for the sale.\n  Needless to say, there are not enough funds to pay the auctioneer's \ncommission, so the auction does not take place and the wildlife \nproperty sits and decays.\n  What this bill would do is allow the Fish and Wildlife Service, and \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service under the Commerce Department, to \nkeep the proceeds from the selling of wildlife products at an auction.\n  The money would be used for very specific purposes.\n  These purposes, except for one, are all related to the task of \nstoring, shipping and disposing of the forfeited and abandoned items \nlocated around the country.\n  The other uses of the funds I will explain in just a minute.\n  This bill specifically says that the Services can use the proceeds of \nthe sale for:\n  (1) Shipping items from one location to another;\n  (2) Storage and security of the items;\n  (3) Appraisal of the items;\n  (4) Sale of the items--this is necessary to pay an auctioneer's \ncommission; and\n  (5) Payment of any valid liens against the objects.\n  As you can see, this will not allow the Services to establish a slush \nfund for their use.\n  The bill requires the money may be used only to continue paying for \nrewards, storage and shipping of the property, and to facilitate the \ndisposal of the items, thereby making them available for the people of \nthe United States.\n  The other use for the proceeds is very special.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service administers a program that \nprovides for the distribution of dead eagles to Native Americans so \nthey may be used for religious and cultural purposes.\n  As you probably know, bald and golden eagles are highly protected and \nit is illegal for anyone to kill an eagle or possess an eagle carcass \nor its feathers.\n  The way the program is set up, dead eagles are sent to the National \nEagle Repository, which is also located on Rocky Mountain Arsenal in \nCommerce City, Colorado.\n  There they are cataloged, processed, and shipped to Native Americans.\n  Even though the Repository distributes about 1,000 eagles to Native \nAmericans each year, there is currently about a three year wait to \nreceive an eagle carcass. This is because of the limited number of \neagles being received at the Repository.\n  Most have been trapped, or electrocuted, or have collided with power \nlines and cars--they are not in very good shape.\n  When an eagle is received by the Repository, attempts are made to \nmatch\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nthe type of eagle with that being requested, i.e. bald or golden, \nimmature or mature.\n  Requests for individual feathers are also filled.\n  The Repository is so concerned about customer service that they will \nreplace any broken or missing feathers with whole ones from another \nbird.\n  The cost to box and ship an eagle is about $50. This cost is absorbed \nby the Service rather than being passed on to the Native Americans.\n  This bill will allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to use the \nproceeds from an auction to assist the eagle program by paying for \nboxes, dry ice, and other costs associated with shipping the eagles.\n  For instance, some of the proceeds could also be used to purchase \nchest freezers to be placed in regional collection points.\n  This would be for short term storage of the eagles near where they \nare initially found.\n  This would hopefully increase the number of eagles being sent to the \nRepository and subsequently increase the number being shipped to the \nNative Americans, thereby reducing the waiting period to receive an \neagle.\n  Before I close here, let me stress--the auctions will only be selling \nwildlife items that are legal to possess and sell in the U.S., items \nlike boots, belts, wallets, purses, shell products, etc.\n  These items have a valid place on the U.S. market.\n  Items that have a higher scientific or educational value will be \ndistributed to museums and schools.\n  No products from endangered species, eagles, marine mammals, or \nmigratory birds will be sold.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act already gives the authority to \nsell those items that are surplus for scientific and educational needs.\n  The Act is silent, however, as to what happens to the proceeds from \nthe sale of abandoned items, so by default they go to the General \nTreasury.\n  The Services are therefore precluded from being able to utilize these \nfunds.\n  If this bill is enacted, the proceeds from the sale of forfeited and \nabandoned items will aid in the shipping, storing, and disposing of \nwildlife products to scientific and educational programs and the \ndistribution of eagles to Native Americans for religious and ceremonial \npurposes.\n  I hope this bill can be moved quickly in the Senate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill with \nmy colleague Senator Allard. This bill represents a move towards \nefficient use of government funds, and support for the valuable \nprograms carried out with those scarce funds. The bill would initially \ngenerate approximately $1 million for the Service through the sale of \nitems derived from fish and wildlife that are currently stored by the \nService. This money would be used to cover the costs of disposing of \nthese items--which is now a financial drain on the Service--and to fund \nprograms that loan these items to schools and Native American groups \nfor educational and religious purposes.\n  Each year, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) receives hundreds \nof thousands of items derived from fish, wildlife and plants, such as \nskins, furs, feathers, jewelry, etc. These items can be seized, \nforfeited or abandoned during enforcement of Federal wildlife laws, and \nthey are eventually shipped to the National Wildlife Property \nRepository in Colorado. The Repository currently has about 150,000 \nitems, with about 50,000 items stored elsewhere.\n  Under current law, the Service may dispose of fish, wildlife or other \nitems forfeited or abandoned to the U.S. government, either by loan, \ngift, sale or destruction. There are certain restrictions on disposal \nof those items. For example, items made from threatened or endangered \nspecies, marine mammals and migratory birds cannot be sold according to \nthe laws that apply to those particular species.\n  Revenue from the sale of forfeited items go to the Service for \ncertain program operations; however, revenue from the sale of abandoned \nitems go to the General Treasury, and are not available to the Service. \nMore than 90 percent of the fish and wildlife items are abandoned, so \nthat the Service would receive very little revenue from sales of these \nitems. Indeed, under current law, the costs of selling these items \nwould outweigh any revenue, so that the Service has no incentive to \nsell them.\n  The Service must further expend funds for the shipment, storage and \ndisposal of the items that it acquires. In addition, the Service will \nmake many of these items--those that cannot be sold under law--\navailable for Native American religious and ceremonial purposes, \neducational purposes, and research, but must expend its own funds to do \nso. The Repository was appropriated $310,000 for operations last year. \nAfter overhead, only $61,000 was available for disposal of these items.\n  Disposal includes two programs in particular. The first, known as \nCargo for Conservation, provides wildlife specimens to schools for \neducational programs. Under this program, the Service has distributed \nalmost 400 educational kits to various organizations. The second \nprogram provides eagle carcasses and parts to Native Americans for \nreligious and ceremonial purposes. Under this program, the Service has \nfilled almost 1,500 requests for eagles, eagle parts and other raptors \nin 1997 alone, although there is currently a two year backlog in \nfilling orders for some eagle carcasses.\n  The bill would specifically amend the Fish and Wildlife Improvement \nAct in two ways. First, it would authorize the deposit of proceeds from \nthe sale of forfeited and abandoned items into Service accounts rather \nthan into the general treasury. Second, it would expand the use of \nfunds received through these sales to include costs incurred by \nshipping, storage and disposal of these items, as well as payment of \nany liens on these items.\n  I would like to note that this bill does not change existing \nauthority with respect to items that may be sold by the Service. It \ndoes not allow the sale of items derived from threatened and endangered \nspecies, marine mammals, or migratory birds. The Service already has \nauthority to sell certain items for which it is lawful to do so. This \nbill merely allows the Service to keep revenues derived from any items \nit sells, and to use those revenues for certain programs. This is a \nbill representing efficient use of government funds.\n  At the same time, this bill is not intended to imply that the Service \nshould sell everything that it lawfully can in order to maximize \nprofits. It is my understanding that the Service has no intention to \nsell items derived from sensitive species, including those that are \ncandidates for listing as endangered or threatened. It is also my \nexpectation that, in considering which items to sell, the Service would \ntake into account the biological status of any species used for that \nitem, and any implications that the sale may have for conservation \nefforts relating to that species. For example, any sale by the Service \nshould not encourage new markets that may undermine protections \nelsewhere. Lastly, the Service should ensure that the sale of these \nitems does not undermine enforcement efforts within the U.S.\n  In summary, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill with Senator Allard. \nOur staffs have worked closely with each other and with the \nAdministration in drafting this legislation, and I look forward to \nworking on this bill in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Graham, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Warner, Mr. Stevens, \n        Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 2095. A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation Establishment Act; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n national fish and wildlife foundation establishment act amendments of \n                                  1998\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act \nof 1984. This legislation makes important changes in the Foundation's \ncharter, changes that I believe will allow the Foundation to build on \nits fine record of providing funding for conservation of our nation's \nfish, wildlife, and plant resources.\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established in 1984, to \nbring together diverse groups to engage in conservation projects across \nAmerica and, in some cases, around the world. Since its inception, the \nFoundation has made more than 2,300 grants totaling over $270 million. \nThis is an impressive record of accomplishment. The Foundation has \npioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing \nthe North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in Flight for \nneotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon Save the \nTiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for Sterling \nForest in New York and New Jersey, to name just a few.\n  Mr. President, the Foundation has funded these programs by raising \nprivate funds to match federal appropriations on at least a 2 to 1 \nbasis. During this time of fiscal constraint this is an impressive \nrecord of leveraging federal dollars. Moreover, all of the Foundation's \noperating costs are raised privately, which means that federal and \nprivate dollars given for conservation is spent only on conservation \nprojects.\n  I am proud to count myself as one of the ``Founding Fathers'' of the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation. In 1984, I, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Howard Baker, George Mitchell, and John Breaux, saw \nthe need to create a private, nonprofit group that could build public-\nprivate partnerships and consensus, where previously there had only \nbeen acrimony and, many times, contentious litigation.\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has more than fulfilled the \nhopes of its original sponsors. It has helped to bring solutions to \nsome difficult natural resource problems and is becoming widely \nrecognized for its innovative approach to solving environmental \nproblems. For example, when Atlantic salmon neared extinction in the \nU.S. due to overharvest in Greenland, the Foundation and its partners \nbought Greenland salmon quotas. I and many others in Congress want the \nFoundation to continue its important conservation efforts. So, today I \nam introducing amendments to the Foundation's charter that will allow \nit to do just that.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is quite simple. It makes three key \nchanges to current law. First, the bill would expand the Foundation's \ngoverning Board of Directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will \nallow a greater number of those with a strong interest in conservation \nto actively participate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's \nactivities.\n  The bill's second key feature authorizes the Foundation to work with \nother agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Department \nof Commerce, in addition to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mr. President, it is \nmy view that the Foundation should continue to provide valuable \nassistance to government agencies within the Departments of the \nInterior and Commerce that may be faced with conservation issues. \nFinally, it would reauthorize appropriations to the Department of the \nInterior and the Department of Commerce through 2003.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation I introduce today will \nproduce real conservation benefits and I strongly urge my colleagues to \ngive the bill their support.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, nearly fourteen years ago President \nReagan signed P.L. 98-244, an act to establish the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation as a charitable, nonprofit corporation of the \nUnited States specifically to further the conservation and management \nof the Nation's fish, wildlife, and plant resources. Since that time, \nthe Foundation has funded more than 2,200 conservation projects through \ntheir partnership and challenge grant program.\n  In the State of Idaho alone, the Foundation has funded nearly 100 \nprojects worth over $19,000,000. The good news is that they have done \nthis work with only $5M of federal money. That is nearly a four to one \ncontribution from the private sector. In addition, there have been many \nprojects in adjacent States that benefit the Stat of Idaho.\n  But the Foundation has had its share of controversy. A Foundation \ngrant to the Pacific Rivers Council may have allowed the Pacific Rivers \nCouncil to use other resources to nearly shut down the economy of \nseveral counties in the State of Idaho. A federal judge shut down all \npermitted activities in our national forests when the Pacific Rivers \nCouncil brought suit against the United States Forest Service and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service for failure to consider cumulative \nimpacts of permitted activities under the Endangered Species Act. The \ntwo agencies could not agree on the extent and nature of the \nconsultations, so the Federal judge shut down all activities in our \nnational forests until they were in compliance. Even the plaintiffs in \nthe suit were surprised by the effect of their suit. They quickly \njoined the effort to reverse the injunction and to have the two Federal \nagencies agree on a solution.\n  Since then the Foundation has implemented procedures into its grant \ncontracts to prevent a recurrence of the devastating injunction \ntriggered by the Pacific Rivers Council. The Foundation has repeatedly \nstated that ``it does not engage in lobbying or litigation and does not \nallow its grants to be used for those activities.''\n  And, I recognize that the Foundation has provided grant monies to \nsupport studies of grizzly bears and wolves in the Pacific Northwest. \nHowever, in my review of those grants I am pleased to say that the \ngrants have been used to discover basic biological information about \nthese predators. The Foundation has produced educational materials, \nbacked research on the impacts of human activities, improved sanitation \nand safety will bear-proof dumpsters, supported GIS mapping of bear \nhabitats, and brought in non-federal partners.\n  During the years I have been acquainted with the Foundation, I have \nfound that they work with the entire spectrum of interests to leverage \nthrough private partners a limited amount of federal funding into \nsignificant monies for conservation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today Senator Chafee, chairman of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, has introduced legislation to \nreauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. I support the \nFoundation and the activities it undertakes to further conservation and \nmanagement of our nation's fish and wildlife resources.\n  Created by Congress in 1984, the Foundation has forged a strong \nrelationship between government and corporate stakeholders, fostering \ncooperation and coordination. It has been successful in bringing \nprivate sector involvement, initiative and technology to bear in \nsolving conservation problems. With this reauthorization, the \nFoundation's record of providing real on-the-ground conservation will \ncontinue.\n  Mr. President, all federal money appropriated to the National Fish \nand Wildlife Foundation must be matched by contributions from non-\nfederal sources: corporations, State and local government agencies, \nfoundations and individuals. The Foundation's operating policy is to \nraise a match of at least 2 to 1, to maximize leverage for our federal \nfunds. With the financial assistance of the private sector and the \ntechnical knowledge of the States, the Foundation can be both effective \nand responsive to conservation needs.\n  All of the Foundation's projects are peer reviewed by agency staff, \nstate resource officials, and other professionals in the natural \nresource field. No project is undertaken without the input and support \nof the local community and state interests. The Foundation has also \ninitiated a process to solicit comments from members of Congress \nconcerning grants in a member's district or state.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that distinguishes the Foundation \nfrom other conservation groups is its results in the field. The \nFoundation has worked with over 700 agencies, universities, businesses \nand conservation groups, both large and small, over the last decade. \nThese relationships have helped the Foundation become one of the most \neffective conservation organizations in the nation.\n  In Mississippi, for example, the Foundation has supported local \nhabitat restoration projects to help private landowners install water \ncontrol structures to provide wintering habitat for migratory \nwaterfowl. Our farmers have learned that it also benefits weed control, \nseed-bed preparation, prevention\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\nof erosion--all at a lower cost. The Foundation has provided grants to \nassist private landowners in restoring bottomland hardwood habitats \ncritical to migrating neotropical songbirds and other water-dependant \nwildlife species. These efforts are helping to maintain the state's \noriginal wetlands habitats.\n  Activities of the Foundation do produce real on-the-ground \nconservation benefits for the resources of our nation. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2096. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Foilcat; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        CERTIFICATE OF DOCUMENTATION FOR THE VESSEL ``FOILCAT''\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \ndirect that the vessel Foilcat, Official Number 1063892, be accorded \ncoastwise trading privileges for a fixed duration and be issued a \ncertificate of documentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. \nCode.\n  The Foilcat was originally constructed in Norway, in 1992, and is a \nhydrofoil vessel presently under renovation in a U.S. shipyard. It is \n84.2 feet in length and is expected to be less than 100 U.S.C.G. \nregistered tons.\n  The vessel is owned by Steven Loui of Honolulu, Hawaii. Mr. Loui \nwould like to utilize his vessel to evaluate the use of hydrofoil \ntechnology in the establishment of a high speed ferry demonstration \nproject. However, because the vessel was built in Norway, it did not \nmeet the requirements for coastwise license endorsement in the United \nStates.\n  The Hawaiian islands are exposed to high and rough surf and it is \nincumbent that we utilize high speed technologies in order to overcome \nthe impediments of high surf and transportation distance requirements. \nFoilcat utilizes advanced hydrofoil technologies enabling the vessel to \ntravel at high speeds while also providing safe and comfortable \npassenger ferry service. Should this technology as applied in passenger \nferry service, prove successful, a series of these types of vessels \nwill be built in the U.S.--using U.S. workers. Mr. Loui is planning to \ninvest almost three times the amount of the vessel's purchase price in \nrepairs and upgrades in a U.S. shipyard. My reflagging request would be \nfor a limited time period, which would provide adequate time to \nevaluate the use of this technology in the establishment of inter and \nintra-island passenger ferry service.\n  The owner of the Foilcat is seeking a waiver of the existing law \nbecause he wishes to use the vessel to evaluate high speed technology \nin passenger ferry service. His desired intentions for the vessel's use \nwill not adversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If he is \ngranted this waiver, it is his intention to comply fully with U.S. \ndocumentation and safety requirements. The purpose of the legislation I \nam introducing is to allow the Foilcat to engage in the coastwise trade \nand the fisheries of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITED DURATION WAIVER OF COASTWISE TRADE LAWS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding sections 12106 and 12108 \n     of title 46, United States Code, section 8 of the Passenger \n     Vessel Act (46 U.S.C. App. 289), and section 27 of the \n     Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 U.S.C. App. 883), the Secretary \n     of Transportation may issue a certificate of documentation \n     with appropriate endorsement for employment in the coastwise \n     trade for the vessel Foilcat, (United States Official Number \n     1063892).\n       (b) Termination.--The certificate issued under subsection \n     (a) shall be in effect for the vessel Foilcat for the \n     period--\n       (1) beginning on the date on which the vessel is placed in \n     service to initiate a high-speed marine ferry demonstration \n     project; and\n       (2) ending on the last day of the 36th month beginning \n     after the date on which it became effective under paragraph \n     (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2097. A bill to encourage and facilitate the resolution of \nconflicts involving Indian tribes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\nindian tribal conflict resolution, tort claims, and risk management act \n                                of 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Indian Tribal \nConflict Resolution, Tort Claims and Risk Management Act of 1998 to \ncontinue the discourse on matters involving Indian tribal governments \nsuch as providing a mechanism for the collection of legitimate state \nretail sales taxes and affording a remedy to those persons injured by \nthe acts of tribal governments, or those acting on their behalf.\n  By introducing this legislation, I am hopeful that tribal leaders, \nconcerned parties, and those affected by the actions of tribal \ngovernments can find some common ground and craft innovative solutions \nto these issues which I believe will continue to hamper Indian tribes \nunless dealt with appropriately.\n  It has been said that because of Indian tribal immunity from \nlawsuits, states have no enforcement mechanism to collect state retail \ntaxes on transactions made to non-members. Similarly, opponents of \ntribal immunity charge that tribal immunity prevents injured persons \nfrom seeking legal recourse for their injuries.\n  The Supreme Court has held that on retail sales made to non-members, \nIndian tribes are under a duty to collect and remit such state taxes. \nThe Court made it clear that there are numerous remedies available to \nthe states in such situations including suits against tribal officials; \nlevying the tax at the wholesale level before goods enter reservation \ncommerce; negotiating agreements with the tribes involved; and if these \nprove unworkable, then seeking congressional action.\n  At least 18 states and numerous tribes have chosen the negotiations \nroute to settling their differences short of litigation and acrimony. \nTestimony presented to the committee on March 11, 1998, revealed that \nthere are approximately 200 intergovernmental agreements between Indian \ntribes and states providing for the collection and remittance by the \ntribes of state sales taxes on sales made to non-members.\n  Rather than waive the immunity of all tribes--those who have chosen \nto deal with the issue of taxation through agreement and those who have \nnot--the legislation I introduce today declares the policy of the \nUnited States to be the reaffirmation of the federal obligation to \nprotect Indian tribes, people, and trust resources and property of \nIndian tribes. In fulfilling that obligation, the United States should \nmake available the framework and machinery for the amicable settlement \nand resolution of disputes, including tax matters, involving states and \nIndian tribes.\n  The achievement of mutual agreements is the major objective of this \nbill, and in addition to encouraging such agreements, this legislation \nprovides for the creation of an ``Intergovernmental Alternative Dispute \nResolution Panel'' to consider and render decisions on tax matters that \ncannot be resolved through negotiation.\n  The panel will be composed of a five member team including \nrepresentatives of the Departments of Interior, Justice, and Treasury; \none representative of state governments; and one representative of \ntribal governments. Rather than create a ``new'' mediation framework, \nthis bill relies on the existing Federal Mediation and Conciliation \nService to provide mediation services for such situations.\n\n  Title II of the bill is intended to provide a remedy in tort \nsituations for those tribes that are not covered by the Federal Tort \nClaims Act, or covered by private secured liability insurance.\n  This title would require the Secretary of Interior to obtain or \nprovide tort liability insurance or equivalent coverage for each Indian \ntribe that receives tribal priority allocations from the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs (BIA).\n  Because many, if not most, Indian tribes maintain some type of \ninsurance coverage, the Secretary is obligated to determine the type \nand adequacy of coverage already provided in order to avoid duplicative \nor redundant coverage.\n  Significantly, and as is the case with insurance policies now in \nplace for\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\nmany tribal governments, the policy of insurance must contain a \nprovision prohibiting the carrier from raising the defense of sovereign \nimmunity with respect to any tort action filed involving the tribe. In \nthis way, injured persons would be afforded a remedy. Such policies \nwould also contain a provision precluding any waiver for pre-judgment \ninterest or punitive damages.\n  The Secretary would prescribe regulations governing the amount and \nnature of claims covered by such insurance policy, and would also set a \nschedule of premiums payable by any tribe that is provided insurance \nunder this bill.\n  Lastly, as Indian tribes have begun to re-develop their economies and \nare beginning to assert their influence, issues and matters have \ndeveloped that should receive the attention of a full-time, \nintergovernmental body to review and analyze such situations.\n  This legislation creates the ``Joint Tribal-Federal-State Commission \non Intergovernmental Affairs'' to thoughtfully and deliberately \nconsider matters such as law enforcement, civil and criminal \njurisdiction, taxation, transportation, economic development, and \nrelated issues. Two years after enactment, the commission is required \nto submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the \nPresident, the Committee on Indian Affairs in the Senate, and the \nCommittee on Resources in the House of Representatives.\n  Finally, let me say that I do not agree with those who suggest that \nthe doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity is an anachronism and one no \nlonger deserving of protection. Several of the states, as well as the \nfederal government, have chosen to waive their immunity from suit in \nvery limited circumstances and under strict conditions.\n  It is simply inaccurate to suggest that tribal governments are the \nlast repository of immunity. Whether by limiting damage awards as some \nstates have done, or eliminating entire classes of activities that will \nnot trigger immunity waivers as the federal government has done in the \nFederal Tort Claims Act, the doctrine of immunity is alive and well in \nthe United States.\n  That there are issues that need to be dealt with I agree; that the \nway to address these issues is through involuntary, broad-based waivers \nof immunity, I disagree heartily. I call on the quiet, thoughtful, and \nreasonable people on both sides of these issues to craft solutions that \nrespects Indian tribal governments and yet provides reasonable \nsolutions for legitimate problems that do exist.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the contents of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2097\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Tribal Conflict \n     Resolution and Tort Claims and Risk Management Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Indian tribal sovereignty predates the formation of the \n     United States and the United States Constitution;\n       (2) a unique legal and political relationship exists \n     between the United States and Indian tribes;\n       (3) through treaties, statutes, Executive orders, and \n     course of dealing, the United States has recognized tribal \n     sovereignty and the unique relationship that the United \n     States has with Indian tribes;\n       (4) Indian tribal governments exercise governmental \n     authority and powers over persons and activities within the \n     territory and lands under the jurisdiction of those \n     governments;\n       (5) conflicts involving Indian tribal governments may \n     necessitate the active involvement of the United States in \n     the role of the trustee for Indian tribes;\n       (6) litigation involving Indian tribes, that often requires \n     the United States to intervene as a litigant, is costly, \n     lengthy, and contentious;\n       (7) for many years, alternative dispute resolution has been \n     used successfully to resolve disputes in the private sector, \n     and in the public sector;\n       (8) alternative dispute resolution--\n       (A) results in expedited decisionmaking; and\n       (B) is less costly, and less contentious than litigation;\n       (9) it is necessary to facilitate intergovernmental \n     agreements between Indian tribes and States and political \n     subdivisions thereof;\n       (10) Indian tribes have made significant achievements \n     toward developing a foundation for economic self-sufficiency \n     and self-determination, and that economic self-sufficiency \n     and self-determination have increased opportunities for the \n     Indian tribes and other entities and persons to interact more \n     frequently in commerce and intergovernmental relationships;\n       (11) although Indian tribes have sought and secured \n     liability insurance coverage to meet their needs, many Indian \n     tribes are faced with significant barriers to obtaining \n     liability insurance because of the high cost or \n     unavailability of such coverage in the private market;\n       (12) as a result, Congress has extended liability coverage \n     provided to Indian tribes to organizations to carry out \n     activities under the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.); and\n       (13) there is an emergent need for comprehensive and cost-\n     efficient insurance that allows the economy of Indian tribes \n     to continue to grow and provides compensation to persons that \n     may suffer personal injury or loss of property.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to enable \n     Indian tribes, tribal organizations, States and political \n     subdivisions thereof, through viable intergovernmental \n     agreements to--\n       (1) achieve intergovernmental harmony; and\n       (2) enhance intergovernmental commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' has the \n     meaning given the term ``Executive agency'' in section 105 of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Indian country.--The term ``Indian country'' has the \n     meaning given that term in section 1151 of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (3) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n     meaning given that term in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e)).\n       (4) Panel.--The term ``Panel'' means the Intergovernmental \n     Alternative Dispute Panel established under section 103.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of the Interior.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50 States \n     and the District of Columbia.\n       (7) Tribal organization.--The term ``tribal organization'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 4(l) of the Indian \n     Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450b(l)).\n\n     SEC. 4. DECLARED POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to continue to preserve and protect Indian tribes, \n     Indian people, and trust resources and property of Indian \n     tribes; and\n       (2) that the settlement of issues and disputes involving \n     Indian tribes and States or political subdivisions thereof, \n     through negotiation and accommodation, may be advanced by \n     making available full and adequate governmental facilities \n     for fact finding, conciliation, mediation, and voluntary \n     arbitration to aid and encourage Indian tribes, States, and \n     political subdivisions thereof--\n       (A) to reach and maintain agreements; and\n       (B) to make reasonable efforts to settle differences by \n     mutual agreement reached by such methods as may be provided \n     for in any applicable agreement for the settlement of \n     disputes.\n                 TITLE I--INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS\n\n     SEC. 101. INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMPACT AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The consent of the United States is \n     granted to States and Indian tribes to enter into compacts \n     and agreements in accordance with this title.\n       (b) Collection of Taxes.--Consistent with the United States \n     Constitution, treaties, and principles of tribal and State \n     sovereignty, and consistent with Supreme Court decisions \n     regarding the collection and payment of certain retail taxes \n     of a State or political subdivision thereof, the consent of \n     the United States is hereby given to Indian tribes, tribal \n     organizations, and States and States and Indian tribes may to \n     enter into compacts and agreements relating to the collection \n     and payment of certain retail taxes.\n       (c) Filing.--Not later than 30 days after entering into an \n     agreement or compact under this section, a State or Indian \n     tribe shall submit a copy of the compact or agreement to the \n     Secretary.

A bill to preserve the sovereignty of the United States over \npublic lands and acquired lands owned by the United States, and to \npreserve State sovereignty and private property rights in non-Federal \nlands surrounding those public lands and acquired\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\nlands; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                american land sovereignty protection act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of American public \nlands and private property rights, I am concerned about the setting \naside of public lands by the federal government for international \nagreements and oversight. The absence of congressional oversight in \nsuch programs as the United Nations Biosphere Reserve is of special \nconcern to me. The United Nations has designated 47 ``Biosphere \nReserves'' in the United States which contain a total area greater than \nthe size of my home state of Colorado. That is why today I introduce \ncompanion legislation to H.R. 901, the American Land Sovereignty \nProtection Act, introduced by Representative Don Young, to preserve \nAmerican sovereignty and halt the extension of the executive branch \ninto congressional constitutional authority.\n  We are facing a threat to our sovereignty by the creation of these \nland reserves in our public lands. I also believe the rights of private \nlandowners must be protected if these international land designations \nare made. Even more disturbing is the fact the executive branch elected \nto be a party to this ``Biosphere Reserve'' program without the \napproval of Congress or the American people. The absence of \ncongressional oversight in this area is a serious concern.\n  In fact most of these international land reserves have been created \nwith minimal, if any, congressional input or oversight or public \nconsultation. Congress must protect individual property owners, local \ncommunities, and State sovereignty which may be adversely impacted \neconomically by any such international agreements.\n  The current system for implementing international land reserves \ndiminishes the power and sovereignty of the Congress to exercise its \nconstitutional power to make laws that govern lands belonging to the \nUnited States. The executive branch may be indirectly agreeing to terms \nof international treaties, such as the Convention of Biodiversity, to \nwhich the United States is not a party, and one which our country has \nrefused to ratify.\n  A ``Biosphere Reserve'' is a federally-zoned and coordinated region \nthat could prohibit certain uses of private lands outside of the \ndesignated international area. The executive branch is agreeing to \nmanage the designated area in accordance with an underlying agreement \nwhich may have implications on non-federal land outside the affected \narea. When residents of Arkansas discovered a plan by the United \nNations and the administration to advance a proposed ``Ozark Highland \nMan and Biosphere Reserve'' without public input, the plan was \nwithdrawn in the face of public pressure. This type of stealth tactic \nto accommodate international interests does not serve the needs and \ndesires of the American people. Rather, it is an encroachment by the \nExecutive branch on congressional authority.\n  As policymaking authority is further centralized at the executive \nbranch level, the role of ordinary citizens in the making of this \npolicy through their elected representatives is diminished. The \nadministration has allowed some of America's most symbolic monuments of \nfreedom, such as the Statue of Liberty and Independence Hall to be \nlisted as World Heritage Sites. Furthermore the United Nations has \nlisted national parks including Yellowstone National Park--our nation's \nfirst national park.\n  Federal legislation is needed to require the specific approval of \nCongress before any area within the borders of United States is made \npart of an international land reserve. My bill reasserts Congress' \nconstitutional role in the creation of rules and regulations governing \nlands belonging to the United States and its people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for enhanced Federal sentencing guidelines \nfor counterfeiting offenses, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n           counterfeiting sentencing enhancement act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Counterfeiting \nSentencing Enhancement Act of 1998. My bill would tighten the \nsentencing guidelines' base offense level in recognition of the fact \nthat advances in computer and printing technology have fundamentally \nchanged the nature of counterfeiting. This bill would bring our \nnation's counterfeiting laws out of Gutenberg's printing press era and \ninto the modern computer age.\n  Counterfeiting of our nation's currency is a serious and growing \nproblem. Incidents of computer generated counterfeiting have increased \ndramatically over the last three years. In 1995 only one half of one \npercent of counterfeit U.S. currency passed were computer generated.\n  Today, just three short years later, computer generated counterfeits \naccount for approximately 43 percent of the counterfeits passed.\n  Traditional counterfeiters use offset printing production methods \nthat require specialized equipment including printing presses, engraved \nprinting press plates and green ink. These counterfeiters encounter a \ncumbersome process that is messy, is harder to conceal, and requires \nthem to produce in large batches.\n  However, a rapidly growing number of today's counterfeiters are using \npersonal computers, scanners, digital imaging software, full color \ncopiers, and laser and inkjet printers. They can also use the Internet \nto instantaneously transmit the computer images needed for \ncounterfeiting. This technology, which is readily available and \nincreasingly affordable, enables criminals to produce high-quality \ncounterfeit currency in small batches and at a low cost. It is this \nability for counterfeiters to easily produce in small batches that has \nrendered our sentencing guidelines outdated and less effective as a \ndeterrent.\n  Our sentencing guidelines under current law are based in a world \nwhere the realities of offset printing required counterfeiters to \nproduce in rather large batches. That reality no longer exists. \nBasically, the more counterfeit currency a counterfeiter got caught \nwith, the stiffer the sentence. Using computer technology, today's \ncounterfeiters can simply print out smaller batches of counterfeit \ncurrency whenever they want to. This allows these criminals to \neffectively fly just under the radar of our sentencing guideline \nthresholds.\n  The administration recently acknowledged the extent of the problem. \nIn a March 5, 1998, letter to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Treasury \nSecretary Robert E. Rubin wrote that ``increases in computer \ncounterfeiting cases represent not only a threat to our law \nenforcement interests, but also seriously threaten the integrity of our \nU.S. currency. Maintaining the stability and integrity of U.S. currency \nis essential to preserving the benefits derived from the dollar's \nstatus as a world currency.''\n\n  In response to these enhanced counterfeiting techniques, the \nDepartment of Treasury has been redesigning our nation's currency to \nmake it harder to counterfeit. In addition the Secret Service has \nstepped up its battle against counterfeiters, both at home and abroad. \nBut more needs to be done. This bill is another important step to \ntoughen the penalties for counterfeiting.\n  Specifically, my bill strengthens the sentencing guidelines so that \nincreases are based on offense levels determined by the amount of \ncounterfeit bills produced and a point system based on the offender's \nprior criminal history. Under current law, the base offense begins with \nlevel 9 for convictions involving $2,000 in counterfeit currency or \nless. Increases in this level occur according to the amount of \ncounterfeit bills over $2,000. Thus a defendant's guideline\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\nrange in counterfeiting cases depends largely on the amount of \ncounterfeit inventory seized when the operation is shut down.\n  Increases in sentencing are also determined by the prior criminal \nhistory of the offender. Points are added for such things as: prior \nimprisonment; offenses committed while on probation, parole, or \nsupervised release; offenses committed less than two years from prior \nrelease; and other misdemeanor and petty offenses.\n  Under current law at base offense level 9, seven points are needed \nfor the imposition of a prison sentence of 12 to 18 months. Without \nthese points for prior criminal history many offenders simply are being \nreleased on probation. I believe these sentencing guidelines are too \nlenient and fail to address the growing problem of counterfeiting.\n  Therefore, my bill increases the base offense level in section 2B5.1 \nof the Federal Sentencing Guidelines by not less than two levels to \nlevel 11. Under my bill, an offender would need only four points to \nreceive the same 12 to 18 month sentence which previously required \nseven points. This relates to all counterfeiting offenses to address \nthe overall harm counterfeiting can have on the integrity of U.S. \ncurrency.\n  Second, my bill adds a sentencing enhancement of not less than two \nlevels for counterfeiting offenses that involve the use of computer \nprinter or a color photocopying machine. This would place this new \nclass of computer counterfeiters at an offense level of 13. Here, an \noffender would need zero points to receive the same 12 to 18 month \nsentence. The increase in my bill would provide for actual prison \nsentences in many of the cases where previous offenders were only \nreceiving probation. I believe this legislation clearly addresses our \ngrowing problem with counterfeiters by imposing stricter sentencing \npenalties.\n  Mr. President, counterfeiting threatens the very underpinnings of our \neconomy, the American people's confidence in the integrity and value of \nour nation's currency, the U.S. dollar. The ``Counterfeiting Sentencing \nEnhancement Act of 1998'' will send a clear message to criminals who \nare even thinking about counterfeiting. I urge my colleagues to join in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENTENCING GUIDELINES FOR COUNTERFEITING OFFENSES.\n\n       The United States Sentencing Commission shall amend the \n     Federal sentencing guidelines to provide--\n       (1) a sentencing enhancement of not less than 2 levels, \n     with respect to the base level for offenses involving \n     counterfeit bearer obligations of the United States, as \n     described in section 2B5.1 of the Federal sentencing \n     guidelines; and\n       (2) an additional sentencing enhancement of not less than 2 \n     levels, with respect to any offense described in paragraph \n     (1) that involves the use of a computer printer or a color \n     photocopying machine.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 2100. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to increase \npublic awareness concerning crime on college and university campuses; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                  campus crime disclosure act of 1998\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Campus Crime \nDisclosure Act of 1998. My legislation amends the Crime Awareness and \nCampus Security Act of 1990,\n  Educational institutions were once safe havens where we sent our \nchildren. Unfortunately, today we are all aware of the increase in \nviolence that has reached as far down as our elementary schools to our \nyoungest and most innocent victims. I would note that just recently, in \nthe rural Pennsylvania community of Edinboro, a young teenager \nlamentably shot a teacher to death at an 8th grade graduation dance and \nwounded other students. While there is much that Congress can do to \nreduce violence in our society and across all levels of educational \ninstitutions, my legislation is focused on our national commitment to \nimproving public safety on college and university campuses, where young \nadults are often away from their homes for the first time and living in \nunfamiliar surroundings.\n  The legislation I am introducing today builds upon the fine work of \nmy distinguished colleagues, Representative Goodling of Pennsylvania \nand Senator Jeffords of Vermont, who as chairmen of the authorizing \ncommittees having jurisdiction over higher education, have included \ncampus crime amendments in the legislation reauthorizing the Higher \nEducation Act. However, I believe that their amendments to the 1990 \nCampus Security Act do not go far enough. Accordingly, my legislation \nincludes provisions which are not included in the reauthorization bill \nand are necessary to bring schools into full compliance with the law, \nsuch as a more detailed definition of ``campus'' and new civil \npenalties.\n  Based on my experience as District Attorney of Philadelphia, and my \nfrequent involvement with educators and college students, I know that \nsafety on campuses is a very serious issue. I want to recognize one \nfamily in particular for helping keep me and my colleagues informed on \nthe important issue of campus crime, Howard and Connie Clery, and their \nson Ben, of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania for their continued work on \ncampus security policy. As my colleagues may know, in 1988, the Clerys' \ndaughter, Jeanne, was beaten, raped and murdered by a fellow student in \nher campus dormitory room at Lehigh University. Soon after the tragedy, \nHoward and Connie began to work on getting campus safety laws passed in \nthe States and the U.S. Congress. In fact, the campus security law \nenacted in 1990 is often referred to as the ``Clery Bill.'' The Clerys \nfounded Security on Campus, Inc., which serves as a watchdog of campus \ncrime policies and procedures administered by our nation's colleges and \nuniversities.\n  Based on continued conversations with the Clerys, it became apparent \nto me that there was a critical need for Congressional oversight of how \nthe Department of Education has implemented the 1990 Act and whether \nthe Department's financial resources are adequate for enforcement of \nthe reporting requirements. On the fifth of March of this year, I held \na hearing on security on campus as chairman of the Senate Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, to \nexamine the Department of Education's enforcement of campus crime \nreporting requirements. The Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary \nEducation for the U.S. Department of Education, David Longanecker, \ntestified that: ``Generally the issue of campus is one of the foremost \ndifficult areas that we have found campuses are having a difficult time \nwith, and it is a particular issue for an urban institution.'' \nSecretary Longanecker went on to say that sidewalks and public lands \nare excluded from the Department's current definition of campus. \nFurther, testimony at the hearing showed that buildings which are used \nfor commercial purposes where other parts are used for educational \npurposes do not fall within the Department's interpretation of \n``campus,'' which, my own personal view, is an incorrect one. As one of \nthe authors of the 1990 law, I believe that the omission of such \ninformation violates the spirit of the law and is a disservice to \nparents and students, especially for parents who send their children to \ncollege in urban settings, where commercial property such as food shops \nand retail stores and city streets thread through the entire campus. I \nbelieve it is preposterous to suggest that if a student fell victim to \na crime say on a sidewalk which he or she was using to get to class \nwould go unreported.\n\n  The Campus Crime Disclosure Act of 1998 clarifies the law as to what \nconstitutes a college or university campus. From now on, institutions \nwould have to report to parents, students, and other members of the \ngeneral public a more precise assessment of the criminal activity on \ncampus. Specifically, a campus will be interpreted to mean: any \nbuilding or property owned and controlled by the institution or owned \nby a student organization recognized by the institution, any public \nproperty such as sidewalks, streets, parking facilities, and other \nthoroughfares that provide access to the facilities of the institution, \nand any property owned or\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\ncontrolled by the institution that is not in close proximity to the \ncampus must still be reported on. The bill also makes clear that all \ndormitories and residential facilities, whether on or off-campus, which \nare owned or operated by the institution, fall under the definition of \ncampus.\n  My legislation gives the Secretary of Education stronger enforcement \nauthority. Should an institution fail to report crime data, the \nDepartment of Education can fine that institution up to $25,000. \nAccording to a study conducted by the General Accounting Office, 63 \ninstitutions of higher education were in violation of the Crime \nAwareness and Campus Security Act of 1990. Yet, the Department of \nEducation did not take any punitive action against these institutions. \nThe inclusion of fines will provide the Department with the necessary \ntool to ensure that all schools fulfill the intention of the law.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of the Campus Crime \nDisclosure Act of 1998 to enhance security on campus. The bill is \nurgently needed to steer the U.S. Department of Education in the right \ndirection as it monitors crime on America's college campuses. Quite \nsimply, everyone benefits from clear and accurate reporting of the \nrisks facing college students.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record as well as a section-by-section analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Campus Crime Disclosure Act \n     of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the General Accounting Office, 63 \n     institutions of higher education were in violation of the \n     amendments made by the Crime Awareness and Campus Security \n     Act of 1990 since the enactment of such Act in 1990. The \n     Department of Education has not taken punitive action against \n     these institutions.\n       (2) The Department of Education's interpretation of the \n     statutory definition of campus has enabled institutions of \n     higher education to underreport the instances of crimes \n     committed against students.\n       (3) In order to improve public awareness of crimes \n     committed on college and university campuses, it is essential \n     that Congress act to clarify existing law and to discourage \n     underreporting of offenses covered by the amendments made by \n     the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Definition of Campus.\n       This section responds to the Department of Education's \n     interpretation of the 1990 campus crime reporting law by \n     modifying the definition of campus to include: any building \n     or property owned and controlled by the institution or by a \n     student organization recognized by the institution within the \n     contiguous area of the institution, any public property such \n     as sidewalks, streets, parking facilities, and other \n     thoroughfares that provide access to the facilities of the \n     institution, any building or property owned or controlled by \n     the institution that is not within the contiguous area but \n     used for educational purposes. The bill also makes clear that \n     all dormitories and residential facilities (on or off-campus) \n     which are owned or operated by the institution, fall under \n     the definition of campus.\n       Section 5. Reporting Requirements.\n       Adds three additional reporting requirements: (1) the \n     Secretary of Education must report back to Congress when \n     schools are\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\n     found in noncompliance, (2) the Secretary shall provide \n     technical assistance to schools concerning compliance with \n     reporting requirements and the implementation of campus \n     security procedures, and (3) requires institutions to include \n     in their reported statistics: crimes committed on public \n     property such as streets and sidewalks and student \n     residences.\n       Section 6. Fines.\n       Mandates for the first time that the Secretary of Education \n     shall impose civil penalties of up to $25,000 on institutions \n     which fail to comply with the Act's reporting requirements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 2101. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nresearch and services with respect to lupus; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n             the lupus research and care amendments of 1998\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nLupus Research and Care Amendments of 1998. This legislation would \nauthorize additional funds for lupus research and grants for state and \nlocal governments to support the delivery of essential services to low-\nincome individuals with lupus and their families. The National \nInstitute of Health (NIH) spent about $33 million on lupus research \nlast year. I believe that we need to increase the funds that are \navailable for research of this debilitating disease.\n  Lupus is not a well-known disease, nor is it well understood, yet at \nleast 1,400,000 Americans have been diagnosed with lupus and many more \nare either misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. More Americans have \nlupus than AIDS, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, sickle-cell anemia \nor cystic fibrosis. Lupus is a disease that attacks and weakens the \nimmune system and is often life threatening. Lupus is nine times more \nlikely to affect women than men. African-American women are diagnosed \nwith lupus two to three times more often than Caucasian women. Lupus is \nalso more prevalent among certain minority groups including Latinos, \nNative Americans and Asians.\n  Because lupus is not well understood, it is difficult to diagnose, \nleading to uncertainty on the actual number of patients suffering from \nlupus. The symptoms of lupus make diagnosis difficult because they are \nsporadic and imitate the symptoms of many other illnesses. If diagnosed \nand with proper treatment, the majority of lupus cases can be \ncontrolled. Unfortunately, because of the difficulties in diagnosing \nlupus and inadequate research, many lupus patients suffer debilitating \npain and fatigue. The resulting effects make it difficult, if not \nimpossible, for individuals suffering from lupus to carry on normal \neveryday activities including work. Thousands of these debilitating \ncases needlessly end in death each year.\n  Title I of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1998 authorizes \n$45 million in grants starting in fiscal year 1999 to be earmarked for \nlupus research at NIH. This new authorization would amount to less than \none-half of 1 percent of NIH's total budget but would greatly enhance \nNIH's research.\n  Title II of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1998 authorizes \n$40 million in grants to state and local governments as well as to \nnonprofit organizations starting in fiscal year 1999. These grants \nwould support the delivery of essential services to low-income \nindividuals with lupus and their families.\n  I would urge all my colleagues, Mr. President, to join Senator \nMoseley-Braun, Senator Shelby, and myself in sponsoring this \nlegislation to increase funding available to fight lupus.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n                              Wellstone):\n\n  S. 2102. A bill to promote democracy and good governance in Nigeria, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n          nigeria democracy and civil society empowerment act\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce a sorely needed piece \nof foreign policy legislation, the Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society \nEmpowerment Act of 1998. As the Ranking Democrat of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Africa, I have long been concerned about the collapsing \neconomic and political situation in Nigeria. Nigeria, with its rich \nhistory, abundant natural resources and wonderful cultural diversity, \nhas the potential to be an important regional leader. But, sadly, it \nhas squandered that potential and the good will of the world with \nrepressive policies, human rights abuses and corruption.\n  The legislation I am introducing today provides a clear framework for \nU.S. policy toward that troubled West African nation. The Nigeria \nDemocracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act declares that the United \nStates should encourage the political, economic and legal reforms \nnecessary to ensure the rule of law and respect for human rights in \nNigeria and should aggressively support a timely and effective \ntransition to democratic, civilian government for the people of \nNigeria. I am pleased to have Senators Jeffords, Leahy and Wellstone \njoin me as cosponsors of this legislation.\n  This bill draws heavily from legislation introduced in the 104th \nCongress by the former chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, \nSenator Kassebaum. I joined 21 other Senators as a proud co-sponsor of \nthat bill. A companion measure to my bill was introduced earlier this \nweek in the House by the distinguished chair of the House International \nRelations Committee, Mr. Gilman of New York, and a distinguished member \nof that Committee and of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Payne of \nNew Jersey. I commend both of my House colleagues for their strong \nleadership on this important issue and I appreciate the opportunity to \nwork with them toward passage of this legislation and the broader goal \nof a freer Nigeria.\n  Mr. President, the Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment \nAct provides by law for many of the sanctions that the United States \nhas had in place against Nigeria for a number of years. It includes a \nban on most foreign direct assistance, a ban on the sale of military \ngoods and military assistance to Nigeria, and a ban on visas for top \nNigerian officials. It would allow the President to lift any of these \nsanctions if he is able to certify to the Congress that specific \nconditions, which I will call ``benchmarks,'' regarding the transition \nto democracy have taken place in Nigeria. These benchmarks include free \nand fair democratic elections, the release of political prisoners, \nfreedom of the press, the establishment of a functioning independent \nelectoral commission, access for international human rights monitors \nand the repeal of the many repressive decrees the Abacha regime has \npressed upon the Nigerian people.\n  This legislation also provides for $37 million in development \nassistance over three years to support democracy and governance \nprograms and the activities of the U.S. Information Agency, and \nmandates a larger presence for the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment. I want to emphasize that this bill authorizes no new \nmoney. All of these funds would come out of existing USAID and USIA \nappropriations. At the same time, the bill prohibits any U.S. resources \nfrom being used to support an electoral process in Nigeria until it is \nclear that any planned election will be free and legitimate.\n  Importantly, my bill requires the President to impose additional \nsanctions at the beginning of 1999 if he cannot certify that a free and \nfair election has taken place by the end of 1998. These new sanctions, \nwill include a ban on Nigerian participation in major international \nsporting events, an expansion of visa restrictions on Nigerian \nofficials and the submission of a report that lists the senior \nofficials that fall under such restrictions.\n  Finally, the bill requires the Secretary of State to submit a report \non corruption in Nigeria, including the evidence of corruption by \ngovernment officials in Nigeria and the impact of corruption on the \ndelivery of government services in Nigeria, on U.s. business interests \nin Nigeria, and on Nigeria's foreign policy. It would also require that \nthe Secretary's report include information on the impact on U.S. \ncitizens of advance fee fraud and other fraudulent business schemes \noriginating in Nigeria.\n  The intent of this legislation is two-fold. First, it will send an \nunequivocal message to the ruling military junta in Nigeria that it's \ncontinued disregard for democracy, human rights and the institutions of \ncivil society in Nigeria\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\nis simply unacceptable. Second, the bill is a call to action to the \nClinton Administration which has yet to articulate a coherent policy on \nNigeria that reflects the brutal political realities there.\n  Nigeria has suffered under military rule for most of its nearly 40 \nyears as an independent nation. By virtue of its size, geographic \nlocation, and resource base, it is economically and strategically \nimportant both in regional and international terms. Nigeria is critical \nto American interests. But Nigeria's future is being squandered by the \nmilitary government of General Sani Abacha. Abacha presides over a \nNigeria stunted by rampant corruption, economic mismanagement and the \nbrutal subjugation of its people.\n\n  The abiding calamity in Nigeria occurs in the context of economic and \npolitical collapse. Nigeria has the potential to be the economic \npowerhouse on the African continent, a key regional political leader, \nand an important American trading partner, but it is none of these \nthings. Despite its wealth, economic activity in Nigeria continues to \nstagnate. Even oil revenues are not what they might be, but they remain \nthe only reliable source of economic growth, with the United States \npurchasing an estimated 41 percent of the output.\n  Corruption and criminal activity in this military-controlled economic \nand political system have become common, including reports of drug \ntrafficking and consumer fraud schemes that have originated in Nigeria \nand reached into the United States, including my home state of \nWisconsin.\n  After the military annulled the 1993 election of Moshood Abiola as \nNigeria's president--through what was considered by many observers to \nbe a free and fair election--Chief Abiola was thrown into prison, where \nhe remains, as far as we know, on the pretext of awaiting trial. \nReliable information about his situation and condition is difficult to \nobtain. Chief Abiola's wife, Kudirat, was detained by authorities last \nyear and was later found murdered by the side of a road under \ncircumstances that suggest the military may have been responsible.\n  On October 1, 1995, General Abacha announced a so-called \n``transition'' program whose goal was the return of an elected civilian \ngovernment in Nigeria by October 1998. But virtually none of the \ninstitutions essential to a free and fair election--an independent \nelectoral commission, an open registration process, or open procedures \nfor the participation of independent political parties, for example--\nhas been put into place in Nigeria. Repression continues; political \nprisoners remain in jail; the press remains muzzled; and the fruits of \nNigeria's abundant natural resources remain in the hands of Abacha's \nsupporters and cronies.\n  Even this flawed transition process--which in its best days moved at \na snail's pace--has now been completely destroyed by the recent \nannouncement that the fifth of the five officially sanctioned parties \nhas endorsed Gen. Abacha as their candidate. Now, what was to have been \na competitive presidential election has become a circus referendum on \nAbacha himself. The general will allow an election so long as his name \nis the only one on the ballot. This is little more than a sorry joke on \nthe premise of democracy!\n  Any criticism of this so-called transition process is punishable by \nfive years in a Nigerian prison. Reports from many international human \nrights organizations and our own State Department document years of \nsimilar brutality. Nigerian human rights activists and government \ncritics are commonly whisked away to secret trials before military \ncourts and imprisoned; independent media outlets are silenced; workers' \nrights to organize are restricted; and the infamous State Security \n[Detention of Persons] Decree #2, giving the military sweeping powers \nof arrest and detention, remains in force.\n  Perhaps the most horrific example of repression by the Abacha \ngovernment was the execution of human rights and environmental activist \nKen Saro-Wiwa and eight others in November 1995 on trumped-up charges. \nSince that barbaric spectacle, it appears the Abacha government has \nbeen working even harder to tighten its grip on the country, wasting no \nopportunity to subjugate the people of Nigeria.\n  Late last year, retired Major General Musa Yar'Adua, a former \nNigerian vice president and a prominent opponent of General Abacha, \ndied in state custody under circumstances that remain shrouded in \nmystery. General Yar'Adua was one of 40 people arrested in 1995 during \na government sweep and sentenced to 25 years in prison for an alleged \ncoup plot widely believed to have been a pretext to silence government \ncritics. Just a few weeks ago, we received the disturbing news that \nfive Nigerians had been sentenced to death by a military tribunal amid \nother unproven accusations of coup-plotting.\n  The Clinton Administration response to these events has been an \nearnest muddle at best, and rudderless at worst. I welcome recent \nefforts to complete the policy review process; in fact, I have been \npushing for its completion for quite some time, because I feel the \nperceived ``lack'' of a policy with respect to Nigeria, for the past \ntwo years or so, has been dangerous.\n  But, unfortunately, the long-awaited and oft-postponed principals' \nmeeting on this issue, which finally took place in April, has not \nyielded any firm recommendations to the President. I have long urged \nthe Administration to take the toughest stance possible in support of \ndemocracy in Nigeria, including a clear unequivocal statement that an \nelectoral victory for Abacha would be totally illegitimate and \nunacceptable. The regime in Nigeria must know that anything less than a \ntransparent transition to civilian rule will be met with severe \nconsequences, including new sanctions as is mandated in this bill.\n  So I was particularly disappointed to hear the President remark \nduring his recent trip to Africa that General Abacha would be \nconsidered acceptable by the United States if he chose to run in the \nupcoming election as a civilian. My shock at that remark was tempered \nsomewhat by the efforts of numerous administration officials who \nstruggled to clarify the President's remarks. They insist that the U.S. \nobjective is to support a viable transition to civilian rule in \nNigeria, but my worst fears about that ominous remark by the President \nhave now come true. Abacha and his cronies seem to believe that the \nUnited States would consider an Abacha victory in the upcoming \nelections to be a viable, sustainable outcome. Why else would the plan \nonce touted as the basis for a democratic competitive presidential \nelection be downgraded into a rigged referendum on Abacha himself? As \nplanned now, the referendum will be one in which Abacha cannot lose and \nthe people of Nigeria cannot win.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today represents an \neffort to demonstrate our horror at the continued repression in \nNigeria, to encourage the ruling regime to take meaningful steps at \nreform, to support those Nigerians who have worked tirelessly and \nfearlessly for democracy and civilian rule and to move our own \ngovernment toward a Nigeria policy that vigorously reflects the best \nAmerican values.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I hope that we \nwill be able to consider it soon in the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Nigerian Democracy and \n     Civil Society Empowerment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n         (1) The continued rule of the Nigerian military \n     government, in power since a 1993 coup, harms the lives of \n     the people of Nigeria, undermines confidence in the Nigerian \n     economy, damages relations between Nigeria and the United \n     States, and threatens the political and economic stability of \n     West Africa.\n         (2) The transition plan announced by the Government of \n     Nigeria on October 1, 1995, which includes a commitment to \n     hold free and fair elections, has precluded the development \n     of an environment in which such elections would be considered \n     free and fair, nor was the transition plan itself developed \n     in a free and open manner or with the participation of the \n     Nigerian people.\n         (3) The United States Government would consider a free \n     and fair election in Nigeria\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\n     one that involves a genuinely independent electoral \n     commission and an open and fair process for the registration \n     of political parties and the fielding of candidates and an \n     environment that allows the full unrestricted participation \n     by all sectors of the Nigerian population.\n         (4) In particular, the process of registering voters and \n     political parties has been significantly flawed and subject \n     to such extreme pressure by the military so as to guarantee \n     the uncontested election of the incumbent or his designee to \n     the presidency.\n         (5) The tenure of the ruling military government in \n     Nigeria has been marked by egregious human rights abuses, \n     devastating economic decline, and rampant corruption.\n         (6) Previous and current military regimes have turned \n     Nigeria into a haven for international drug trafficking rings \n     and other criminal organizations.\n         (7) On September 18, 1997, a social function in honor of \n     then-United States Ambassador Walter Carrington was disrupted \n     by Nigerian state security forces. This culminated a campaign \n     of political intimidation and personal harassment against \n     Ambassador Carrington by the ruling regime.\n         (8) Since 1993, the United States and other members of \n     the international community have imposed limited sanctions \n     against Nigeria in response to human rights violations and \n     political repression.\n         (9) According to international and Nigerian human rights \n     groups, at least several hundred democracy and human rights \n     activists and journalists have been arbitrarily detained or \n     imprisoned, without appropriate due process of law.\n         (10)(A) The widely recognized winner of the annulled June \n     6, 1993, presidential election, Chief Moshood K. O. Abiola, \n     remains in detention on charges of treason.\n         (B) General Olusegun Obassanjo (rt.), who is a former \n     head of state and the only military leader to turn over power \n     to a democratically elected civilian government and who has \n     played a prominent role on the international stage as an \n     advocate of peace and reconciliation, remains in prison \n     serving a life sentence following a secret trial that failed \n     to meet international standards of due process over an \n     alleged coup plot that has never been proven to exist.\n         (C) Internationally renowned writer, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and 8 \n     other Ogoni activists were arrested in May 1994 and executed \n     on November 10, 1995, despite the pleas to spare their lives \n     from around the world.\n         (D) Frank O. Kokori, Secretary General of the National \n     Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), who was \n     arrested in August 1994, and has been held incommunicado \n     since, Chief Milton G. Dabibi, Secretary General of Staff \n     Consultative Association of Nigeria (SESCAN) and former \n     Secretary General of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior \n     Staff Association (PENGASSAN), who was arrested in January \n     1996, remains in detention without charge, for leading \n     demonstrations against the canceled elections and against \n     government efforts to control the labor unions.\n         (E) Among those individuals who have been detained under \n     similar circumstances and who remain in prison are Christine \n     Anyanwu, Editor-in-Chief and publisher of The Sunday Magazine \n     (TSM), Kunle Ajibade and George Mbah, editor and assistant \n     editor of the News, Ben Charles Obi, a journalist who was \n     tried, convicted, and jailed by the infamous special military \n     tribunal during the reason trials over the alleged 1995 coup \n     plot, the ``Ogoni 21'' who were arrested on the same charges \n     used to convict and execute the ``Ogoni 9'' and Dr. Beko \n     Ransome-Kuti, a respected human rights activist and leader of \n     the pro-democracy movement and Shehu Sani, the Vice-Chairman \n     of the Campaign for Democracy.\n         (11) Numerous decrees issued by the military government \n     in Nigeria suspend the constitutional protection of \n     fundamental human rights, allow indefinite detention without \n     charge, revoke the jurisdiction of civilian courts, and \n     criminalize peaceful criticism of the transition program.\n         (12) As a party to the International Covenant on Civil \n     and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the African Charter on Human \n     and Peoples' Rights, and a signatory to the Harare \n     Commonwealth Declaration, Nigeria is obligated to grant its \n     citizens the right to fairly conduct elections that guarantee \n     the free expression of the will of the electors.\n         (13) Nigeria has played a major role in restoring \n     elected, civilian governments in Liberia and Sierra Leone as \n     the leading military force within the Economic Community of \n     West African States (ECOWAS) peacekeeping force, yet the \n     military regime has refused to allow the unfettered return of \n     elected, civilian government in Nigeria.\n         (14) Despite organizing and managing the June 12, 1993, \n     elections, successive Nigerian military regimes nullified \n     that election, imprisoned the winner a year later, and \n     continue to fail to provide a coherent explanation for their \n     actions.\n         (15) Nigeria has used its military and economic strength \n     to threaten the land and maritime borders and sovereignty of \n     neighboring countries, which is contrary to numerous \n     international treaties to which it is a signatory.\n         (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that the \n     United States should encourage political, economic, and legal \n     reforms necessary to ensure rule of law and respect for human \n     rights in Nigeria and support a timely and effective \n     transition to democratic, civilian government in Nigeria.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide protection from personal intrusion for \ncommercial purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    Personal Privacy Protection Act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, along with the Chairman of the\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and Senators Boxer and Kerry, I am \nintroducing the Personal Privacy Protection Act. This legislation \nnarrowly targets threatening and endangering harassment and privacy \nabuses undertaken by the stalker press.\n  Freedom of the press is the bedrock of American Democracy. But there \nis something wrong when a person cannot visit a loved one in the \nhospital, walk their child to school, or be secure in the privacy of \ntheir own home without being dangerously chased, provoked, or \ntrespassed upon by photographers trying to capture pictures of them to \nsell to the tabloids.\n  When people find themselves in the public eye due to a personal \ntragedy or circumstances beyond their control, they should not be put \ninto personal fear of bodily injury by tabloid media persistently \nchasing them. And just because a person makes their living on \ntelevision or in the movies should not mean they forfeit all rights to \npersonal privacy. There is a line between legitimate news gathering and \ninvasion of privacy; between snapping a picture of someone in a public \nplace and chasing them to the point where they fear for their safety; \nbetween reporting the news and trespassing on private property. \nUnfortunately, today that line is crossed more and more frequently by \nan increasingly aggressive cadre of fortune-seekers with cameras.\n  I began the process of developing this legislation together with \nSenator Boxer more than a year ago, after meeting with members of the \nScreen Actors Guild and hearing about the abuses people suffer every \nday at the hands of the stalker press--photographers using telephoto \nlenses to peer into private homes, cars chasing them off the road, \nhaving their children stalked and harassed. The tragic death of \nPrincess Diana last August brought the seriousness of the problem home \nwith a blunt force that stunned the world.\n  This legislation is narrowly drafted. It is not aimed at, nor would \nit affect, the overwhelming majority of those in the media, but is \nspecifically aimed at abusive, threatening tactics employed by some who \ndo not respect where the line is between what is public and what is \nprivate.\n  The Personal Privacy Protection Act would do two basic things. First, \nit would make it a crime, punishable by a fine and up to a year in \nprison, to persistently follow or chase someone in order to photograph, \nfilm, or record them for commercial purposes, in a manner that causes a \nreasonable fear of bodily injury. Cases in which the persistent \nfollowing or chasing actually caused serious bodily injury would be \npunishable by up to 5 years in prison, and where the actions caused \ndeath, by up to 20 years in prison. The legislation would also allow \nvictims of such actions to bring a civil suit to recover compensatory \nand punitive damages and for injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n  Second, the legislation would allow civil actions to be brought \nagainst those who trespass on private property in order to photograph, \nfilm, or record someone for commercial purposes. In such cases, the \nbill would allow victims to bring suit in Federal court to recover \ncompensatory and punitive damages and to obtain injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief.\n  Furthermore, in certain specified circumstances, the bill would \nprevent ``technological trespass.'' Specifically, the legislation would \nallow a civil action where a visual or auditory enhancement device is \nused to capture images or recordings that could not otherwise have been \ncaptured without trespassing. This provision would apply only to images \nor recordings of a personal or familial activity, captured for \ncommercial purposes, and only where the subject had a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy. In such cases, the victim would be allowed to \nbring suit in Federal court to recover compensatory and punitive \ndamages and to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief. In the case of \ntrespass or technological trespass, only a civil suit by the victim \nwould be allowed; no criminal penalty would be prescribed.\n  This legislation is needed because existing laws fail to protect \nagainst dangerous and abusive tactics. Although existing laws may cover \nsome instances of abusive harassment or trespass by the stalker press, \nvictims cannot be certain of protection. Existing state laws form at \nbest a patchwork of protection, and courts often make an exception for \nactivity undertaken ostensibly for ``news gathering'' purposes.\n  For example, state and local harassment law are often not codified \nand may require exhaustive litigation to enforce. These vary from state \nto state and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and often do not apply \nin cases involving the media. Some statutes require proof of an intent \nto harass; and courts in some jurisdictions may allow a broad ``news \ngathering'' exception.\n  Similarly, reckless endangerment statutes in some states prohibit \nrecklessly engaging in conduct which creates a substantial risk of \nserious physical injury to another person. However, these laws are not \nuniform and their application is very spotty when it comes to dealing \nwith abusive media practices.\n  Federal, state, and local anti-stalking ordinances often contain \nloopholes and generally do not apply to activities undertaken for \ncommercial purposes. The Federal anti-stalking ordinance and 28 of the \n49 state anti-stalking ordinances--including California's--require \nproof of the criminal intent to cause fear in order to prosecute.\n  Existing state trespass laws may be insufficient to protect an owner \nfrom an invasion of privacy. For example, an Oregon Court of Appeals \nupheld a jury verdict for a TV news crew that filmed a police raid in \nexecuting a warrant to search the owner's home, despite the fact that \nthe TV crew had entered the property without permission, because the \njury found that the intrusion was not ``highly offensive' so as to \ninvade the owner's privacy.\n\n  Furthermore, existing trespass laws fail to protect against \ntechnological trespass using intrusive technology such as telephoto \nlenses and parabolic microphones aimed at bedrooms, living rooms, and \nfenced backyards in which people ought to have an expectation of \nprivacy. Because trespass law requires actual physical invasion, it \ndoes not protect against such invasive tactics.\n  In crafting this legislation, we worked with some of the most \nrenowned Constitutional scholars and First Amendment advocates in the \nnation, including Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern \nCalifornia Law School, Cass Sunstein of the Chicago School of Law, and \nLawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School. At their recommendation, we took \nthe approach of plugging loopholes in existing, long-recognized laws \nprohibiting harassment and trespassing, rather than creating new \nprovisions out of whole cloth, in order to craft a constitutional bill \nthat fully respects First Amendment and other constitutional rights. \nThis bill does so. The Constitutional scholars concurred unanimously \nthat this legislation is narrowly drafted to withstand constitutional \nchallenge on First Amendment, federalism, or any other grounds.\n  Mr. President, finally, I should mention that we worked closely with \nRepresentative Sonny Bono on this legislation prior to his untimely \ndeath, and it was Representative Bono's intention to introduce \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives. I am deeply \nsaddened that he is not alive today to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in order to protect \nagainst invasive, harassing, and endangering behavior that can threaten \nany one of us who, for whatever reason, finds him or herself in the \npublic spotlight. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record, along with the letters mentioned previously.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Personal Privacy \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n         (1) Individuals and their families have been harassed and \n     endangered by being persistently followed or chased in a \n     manner that puts them in reasonable fear of bodily injury, \n     and in danger of serious bodily injury or even death, by \n     photographers, videographers, and audio recorders attempting \n     to capture images or other reproductions of their private \n     lives for commercial purposes.\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\n         (2) The legitimate privacy interests of individuals and \n     their families have been violated by photographers, \n     videographers, and audio recorders who physically trespass in \n     order to capture images or other reproductions of their \n     private lives for commercial purposes, or who do so \n     constructively through intrusive modern visual or auditory \n     enhancement devices, such as powerful telephoto lenses and \n     hyperbolic microphones that enable invasion of private areas \n     that would otherwise be impossible without trespassing.\n         (3) Such harassment and trespass threatens not only \n     professional public persons and their families, but also \n     private persons and their families for whom personal \n     tragedies or circumstances beyond their control create media \n     interest.\n         (4) Federal legislation is necessary to protect \n     individuals and their families from persistent following or \n     chasing for commercial purposes that causes reasonable fear \n     of bodily injury, because such harassment is not directly \n     regulated by applicable Federal, State, and local statutory \n     or common laws, because those laws provide an uneven \n     patchwork of coverage, and because those laws may not cover \n     such activities when undertaken for commercial purposes.\n         (5) Federal legislation is necessary to prohibit and \n     provide proper redress in Federal courts for trespass and \n     constructive trespass using intrusive visual or auditory \n     enhancement devices for commercial purposes, because \n     technological advances such as telephoto lenses and \n     hyperbolic microphones render inadequate existing common law \n     and State and local regulation of such trespass and invasion \n     of privacy.\n         (6) There is no right, under the first amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, to persistently follow or \n     chase another in a manner that creates a reasonable fear of \n     bodily injury, to trespass, or to constructively trespass \n     through the use of intrusive visual or auditory enhancement \n     devices.\n         (7) This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, do not \n     in any way regulate, prohibit, or create liability for \n     publication or broadcast of any image or information, but \n     rather use narrowly tailored means to prohibit and create \n     liability for specific dangerous and intrusive activities \n     that the Federal Government has an important interest in \n     preventing, and ensure a safe and secure private realm for \n     individuals against intrusion, which the Federal Government \n     has an important interest in ensuring.\n         (8) This Act protects against unwarranted harassment, \n     endangerment, invasion of privacy, and trespass in an \n     appropriately narrowly tailored manner without abridging the \n     exercise of any rights guaranteed under the first amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States, or any other \n     provision of law.\n         (9) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n     article I of the Constitution of the United States to enact \n     this Act.\n         (10) Because this Act regulates only conduct undertaken \n     in order to create products intended to be and routinely \n     transmitted, bought, or sold in interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or persons who travel in interstate or foreign \n     commerce in order to engage in regulated conduct, the Act is \n     limited properly to regulation of interstate or foreign \n     commerce.\n         (11) Photographs and other reproductions of the private \n     activities of persons obtained through activities regulated \n     by this Act, and the amendments made by this Act, are \n     routinely reproduced and broadcast in interstate and \n     international commerce.\n         (12) Photographers, videographers, and audio recorders \n     routinely travel in interstate commerce in order to engage in \n     the activities regulated by this Act, and the amendments made \n     by this Act, with the intent, expectation, and routine result \n     of gaining material that is bought and sold in interstate \n     commerce.\n         (13) The activities regulated by this Act, and the \n     amendments made by this Act, occur routinely in the channels \n     of interstate commerce, such as the persistent following or \n     chasing of subjects in an inappropriate manner on public \n     streets and thoroughfares or in airports, and the use of \n     public streets and thoroughfares, interstate and \n     international airports, and travel in interstate and \n     international waters in order to physically or constructively \n     trespass for commercial purposes.\n         (14) The activities regulated by this Act, and the \n     amendments made by this Act, substantially affect interstate \n     commerce by threatening the careers, livelihoods, and rights \n     to publicity of professional public persons in the national \n     and international media, and by thrusting private persons \n     into the national and international media.\n         (15) The activities regulated by this Act, and the \n     amendments made by this Act, substantially affect interstate \n     commerce by restricting the movement of persons who are \n     targeted by such activities and their families, often forcing \n     them to curtail travel or appearances in public spaces, or, \n     conversely, forcing them to travel in interstate commerce in \n     order to escape from abuses regulated by this Act, and the \n     amendments made by this Act.\n         (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n         (1) to protect individuals and their families against \n     reasonable fear of bodily injury, endangerment, trespass, and \n     intrusions on their privacy due to activities undertaken in \n     connection with interstate and international commerce in \n     reproduction and broadcast of their private activities;\n         (2) to protect interstate commerce affected by such \n     activities, including the interstate commerce of individuals \n     who are the subject of such activities; and\n         (3) to establish the right of private parties injured by \n     such activities, as well as the Attorney General of the \n     United States and State attorneys general in appropriate \n     cases, to bring actions for appropriate relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SEVERABILITY.\n\n         If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             University of Chicago Law School,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 30, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Technology, Terrorism, and \n         Government Information Subcommittee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This is in response to a request \n     for my views on issues of federalism raised by the current \n     effort to prevent harassment and invasion of privacy by \n     certain photographers and journalists. In brief: From the \n     standpoint of the constitutional structure, I believe that \n     these efforts reflect an entirely legitimate exercise of \n     national power. I spell out those reasons in short compass \n     here.\n       There can be no doubt that in its current form, the \n     proposal is constitutional under the commerce clause. Each of \n     the provisions is carefully drafted to apply if and only if \n     there is a clear nexus with interstate commerce. Thus under \n     existing law, the constitutional question is a simple one, \n     and there is no plausible basis for legal objection.\n       The more plausible objection is not about technical law but \n     about the spirit of the federal structure. A critic might \n     claim that state law already protects against certain \n     harassing and invasive behavior, and that state law, \n     statutory or common, can easily be adapted to provide \n     stronger protections. Since the several states are generally \n     in the business of preventing against trespass and \n     threatening behavior, why should the federal government \n     intervene? Isn't this the kind of problem best handled at the \n     state level?\n       These questions would be good ones if they are taken to \n     suggest that state law could, in theory, take care of many of \n     the underlying problems. But the questions are not good ones \n     if they are taken to suggest that in practice, state law \n     does, or will do, all that should be done. There are three \n     important points here.\n       First, state law is both highly variable and in many places \n     ill-defined--a complex mixture of statutory and common law, a \n     mixture that does not, in many places, give a clear signal \n     against the kind of conduct that the proposed legislation \n     would ban. For example, the standards for reckless \n     endangerment are extremely variable. Nor is it at all clear \n     that most state trespass law prohibits the use of high-\n     technology methods to get access to people's private \n     enclaves. In state court, the common law of trespass is in a \n     notorious and continuing state of flux. So long as the \n     commerce clause is satisfied, there is an entirely legitimate \n     national interest in giving a clear signal that certain \n     behavior is not to be tolerated amidst uncertain and \n     divergent state practices.\n       Second, the national government often supplements or builds \n     on state law in order to give stronger deterrence. In many \n     states, for example, there are special laws protecting \n     against racial discrimination, environmental harm, or \n     uncompensated invasions of private property. But by itself, \n     this is not an argument that the national government should \n     not provide such measures as well. Congress often acts in \n     order to provide the kind of deterrence that national law--\n     with the availability of federal prosecutors and federal \n     courts--is uniquely in a position to provide. The simple \n     truth is that harassing and invasive practices have not been \n     adequately deterred by state law and the national government \n     can provide further protection. So long as the commerce \n     clause is satisfied, this is a perfectly ordinary and \n     entirely acceptable exercise of national power.\n       Third, it is important to see that the commercial \n     incentives for engaging in harassing or invasive behavior are \n     emphatically national incentives. If a photographer employed \n     by the National Enquirer chases a movie star or an ordinary \n     person in California, the potential profits are national, and \n     it is the national nature of the profits that makes such \n     behavior so likely. In addition, the nature of the harm tends \n     to involve interstate activity, with movement of people and \n     products across state lines to procure the relevant \n     photograph (when a photograph is involved). If both profits \n     and harms were limited to a single state, it might make more \n     sense to say that each state can handle the problem on its \n     own. But since both profits and harms are national in \n     character, it is far less likely that states are able to do \n     so, as actual practice has tended to show.\n       I conclude that there is no legal objection to the bill \n     from the standpoint of federalism. I also conclude that the \n     bill fits well within proper practice from the standpoint of \n     maintaining Congress' limited place in the federal structure. \n     In short, this is a national problem calling for a national \n     response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cass R. Sunstein.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                  Cambridge, MA, December 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I have reviewed the draft \n     legislation entitled ``The Protection From Personal Intrusion \n     for Commercial Purposes Act,'' and wanted to write to express \n     my support for legislation. In my view, the legislation \n     represents a balanced and constitutional approach to an \n     increasingly important problem. It has been drafted, I \n     believe, to avoid jeopardizing First Amendment values, and \n     has a firm constitutional foundation in the Commerce Power, \n     and also, in my view, in Congress' Section Five power under \n     the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       The draft bill proposes three changes to strengthen privacy \n     protections nationally. First, the statute establishes a \n     criminal penalty for harassing conduct engaged in for \n     commercial purposes. Second, the statute establishes a civil \n     penalty for trespass for commercial purposes. And third, the \n     statute establishes a civil penalty for invasions of \n     legitimate interests in privacy for commercial purposes. I \n     consider each provision briefly below.\n     1. Harassment for commercial purposes\n       The aim of this provision is to target the repeated and \n     intentional chasing or following of a person in order to \n     record impressions of that person for commercial purpose. The \n     statute would make such conduct criminal, and prescribes \n     enhanced penalties if death or serious bodily harm is \n     proximately caused by such conduct.\n       A number of points about this provision are important to \n     consider.\n       (1) The statute is targeting traditionally prohibited \n     conduct, though more narrowly than might ordinarily be \n     expected. The statute is more narrow first because it \n     addresses conduct engaged in for commercial purposes only, \n     and second because it targets chasing or following only for \n     purposes of recording visual and auditory impressions. Both \n     limitations might be said to raise problems of \n     underinclusiveness. In both cases, however, no constitutional \n     problem is presented.\n       The first narrowing (to commercial purposes) is \n     jurisdictionally required, as the conduct aimed at here is \n     only that affecting interstate commerce. Even it Congress \n     could regulate more broadly, the choice to narrow the scope \n     of its regulation does not reveal any illegitimate content \n     based purpose in selectively proscribing speech conduct. See \n     generally Elena Kagan, The Changing Faces of First Amendment \n     Neutrality: R.A.V. v. St.\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\n     Paul, Rust v. Sullivan, and the Problem of Content-Based \n     Underinclusion, 1992 Sup. Ct. Rev. 29. For the same reason, I \n     do not believe the second narrowing (to visual and auditory \n     impressions) raises any significant First Amendment concern.\n       (2) This is a criminal statute, so one should expect the \n     courts to read the scope of proscribed conduct narrowly. That \n     means that the statute is likely to be applied only to people \n     who intentionally engage in this form of conduct. I believe \n     the statute makes that clear, since in the definition of \n     ``harasses,'' ``persistently'' modifies ``follows or \n     chases.'' That modifier will give courts adequate room to \n     narrow the statute to conduct that is properly within its \n     scope.\n       (3) Finally, because the statute only punishes conduct \n     which proximately causes serious harm, the statute will not \n     penalize conduct which results in serious harm, but is \n     actually, or legally, ``caused'' by something else. By using \n     the term ``proximately,'' the statute again invites courts to \n     narrow the application of the statute to cases where the \n     legally relevant cause of the harm is the conduct being \n     regulated.\n     2. Trespass for commercial purposes\n       The second protection for privacy added by this bill is a \n     protection against trespass for commercial purposes. While \n     the protection of property has traditionally been a function \n     for state regulation, the proposed statute limits the \n     protection to trespasses engaged in for commercial purposes, \n     and by definition, commercial purposes affecting interstate \n     commerce.\n       There is a long history of support for a provision such as \n     this, especially in the context of civil rights statutes. \n     Congress can well take note of a weakness in the patchwork of \n     state protection against trespass, and supplement such \n     protections with a federal statute. In my view, this statute \n     would fit that form.\n     3. Invasions of legitimate interests in privacy for \n         commercial purposes\n       The final section of this proposed bill protects against \n     the invasion of ``legitimate interests in privacy'' for \n     commercial purposes. While I believe this provision is \n     constitutional, it is the most innovative of the three, and \n     deserves special attention.\n       The interesting aspect of this statute is its method for \n     specifying the type of invasion that is not permitted. The \n     baseline for the statute's protection is the common law \n     protection against trespass. Historically, trespass law was \n     the foundation of our privacy jurisprudence, and this statute \n     is faithful to that tradition.\n       The innovation in the statute is to extend trespass law to \n     protect interests that are invaded simply because of \n     technological advances--advances that make it possible to \n     capture visual and auditory impressions that would not have \n     been capturable with older technologies. The statute protects \n     traditional interests against these new technologies.\n       In a sense, the statute aims at translating our traditional \n     protections of privacy into a context where technology has \n     given eavesdroppers a power that they would not originally \n     have had.\n       In my view, such an effort by Congress is important, and \n     laudable. It is important because we should not allow \n     constitutional rights to be hostage to technology. If \n     technology advances, jeopardizing our constitutional \n     protections, then it is appropriate to adjust rights to \n     compensate for changes in technology. See Lawrence Lessig, \n     Reading the Constitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L. J. 869, \n     871-75 (1996).\n       More importantly, it is laudable that Congress take the \n     lead in this process. Of course historically, the Supreme \n     Court has also taken part in keeping the constitution up to \n     date, translating old provisions to take account of current \n     problems. But it has always done so with hesitation, since \n     the act of updating often requires political judgments that \n     it doesn't feel well positioned to make.\n       Far better if those judgments are made by Congress. And in \n     my view, this proposed statute does just that. It represents \n     an effort by Congress to take the lead in the protection of \n     privacy against the threats that changing technology \n     presents. Whatever one's view about the Court doing the same, \n     it is emphatically the role of Congress to support this \n     tradition of translation.\n       If there are other questions, I can answer, please don't \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           With kind regards,\n     Lawrence Lessig.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                              USC,\n\n\n                                               The Law School,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, Nov. 26, 1997.\n     Senator Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: At the request of Mr. Richard Pfohl \n     of your staff, I have reviewed the proposed bill to prohibit \n     harassment for commercial purposes and to create a cause of \n     action for personal intrusion for commercial purposes. The \n     bill is narrowly written and does not violate the First \n     Amendment. Moreover, even in light of the Supreme Court's \n     decisions restricting the scope of Congress' commerce power, \n     the bill is likely to be upheld as within the scope of \n     congressional authority.\n       At the outset, it is important to note that the bill does \n     not prohibit anything from being published or broadcast. Nor \n     does it create any liability for the publication or broadcast \n     of any image or information. Both parts of the bill expressly \n     state: ``Nothing in this section may be construed to make the \n     sale, transmission, publication, broadcast, or use of any \n     image or recording of the type or under the circumstances \n     described in this section in any otherwise lawful manner by \n     any person subject to criminal charge or civil liability.''\n       These provisions are reinforced by sections in both parts \n     of the bill that limit liability to those ``physically \n     present at the time of, and engaging or assisting another in \n     engaging in violation of this section.'' No liability is \n     allowed ``because images or recordings captured in violation \n     of this section were solicited, bought, used, or sold by that \n     person.''\n       I emphasize these provisions because they make it clear \n     that the bill does not restrict speech or create liability \n     for any publication or broadcast. Rather, the bill prohibits \n     and creates liability for specific dangerous and intrusive \n     activity. At most, the effect on the press is indirect in \n     limiting certain conduct in the gathering of information.\n       In general, the Supreme Court has held that content-neutral \n     laws that have the effect of restricting speech must meet \n     intermediate scrutiny; that is, they must be shown to be \n     substantially related to an important government purpose. \n     Turner Broadcast System v. Federal Communication Commission, \n     114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994). Although I think that there is a \n     strong argument that the bill does not restrict speech at \n     all, even if a court found that it did, intermediate scrutiny \n     would be met. The government has an important interest in \n     stopping persistently physically following or chasing a \n     person ``in a manner that causes the person to have a \n     reasonable fear of bodily injury.'' This is simply an \n     extension of the prohibition of assaults; there is no First \n     Amendment right for the media to engage in an assault in \n     gathering information. Similarly, there is an important \n     interest in preventing trespass or intrusion on to private \n     property, physically or with technology. There is no First \n     Amendment right for the media to trespass in gathering \n     information.\n       Although the Supreme Court has recognized that ``without \n     some protection for seeking out the news, freedom of the \n     press could be eviscerated,'' Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. \n     665, 681 (1972), the Court also consistently has refused to \n     find that the First Amendment provides the press any right to \n     violate the law in gathering information. The Court has \n     explained that ``the First Amendment does not guarantee the \n     press a constitutional right of special access to information \n     not available to the public generally.'' Id. at 684. No \n     member of the public has a right to commit an assault or a \n     trespass; nor can the press in gathering information. As the \n     Court declared in Associated Press v. NLRB, 301 U.S. 103, \n     132-33 (1937): ``The business of the Associated Press is not \n     immune from regulation because it is an agency of the press. \n     The publisher of a newspaper has no special immunity from the \n     application of general laws. He has no special privilege to \n     invade the rights and liberties of others. He must answer for \n     libel. He may be punished for contempt of court. He is \n     subject to the anti-trust laws. Like others he must pay \n     equitable and nondiscriminatory taxes on his business. The \n     regulation here in question has no relation whatever to the \n     impartial distribution of news.''\n       The Supreme Court expressly held that the press is not \n     exempt from general laws in Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., 501 \n     U.S. 663 (1991). A newspaper published the identity of a \n     source who had been promised that his name would not be \n     disclosed. The Court rejected the argument that holding the \n     newspaper liable for breach of contract would violate the \n     First Amendment. The Court stressed that the case involved \n     the application of a general law that in no way was motivated \n     by a desire to interfere with the press. The Court said: \n     ``Generally applicable laws do not offend the First Amendment \n     simply because their enforcement against the press has \n     incidental effects on its ability to gather and report the \n     news. [E]nforcement of such general laws against the press is \n     not subject to stricter scrutiny than would be applied to \n     enforcement against other persons or organizations.'' Id. at \n     669-70.\n       The bill prohibits anyone from persistently following \n     another in a manner that reasonably creates fear of bodily \n     injury or committing a trespass for purposes of capturing a \n     visual or auditory recording. There is no First Amendment \n     right to engage in such activity and no First Amendment basis \n     for an exemption to such a narrowly tailored law.\n       The other possible constitutional challenge to the bill \n     would be on the ground that it exceeds the scope of Congress' \n     commerce clause authority. From 1936 until April 26, 1995, \n     the Supreme Court did not find one federal law \n     unconstitutional as exceeding the scope of Congress' commerce \n     power. Then in United States v. Lopez, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (1995), \n     the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the Gun-Free \n     School Zones Act of 1990 which made it a federal crime to \n     have a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. After reviewing the \n     history of decisions under the commerce clause, the Court \n     identified three types of activities that Congress can \n     regulate under this power. First, Congress can ``regulate the \n     use of the channels of interstate commerce.'' Id. at 1629. \n     Second, the Court said that Congress may regulate persons or \n     things in interstate commerce and ``to protect the \n     instrumentalities of interstate commerce.'' 115 S.Ct. at \n     1629. Finally, the Court said that\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\n     Congress may ``regulate those activities having a substantial \n     relation to interstate commerce.'' Id. at 1629-30.\n       The bill is limiting to regulating commercial activity in \n     that it prohibits and creates liability for ``harrassment for \n     commercial purposes'' and ``trespass and invasion of \n     legitimate interest in privacy for commercial purposes.'' \n     Commercial purposes is defined as activity ``with the \n     expectation of sale, financial gain, or other \n     consideration.'' In Lopez, the Court emphasized the absence \n     of commercial activity in the law or its application.\n       Moreover, the bill fits within the categories articulated \n     in Lopez. Through fact-finding, Congress should be able to \n     document that those who engaged in such activity are engaged \n     in interstate commerce. This, too, is different from Lopez, \n     where the Court stress the lack of any evidence linking the \n     prohibited conduct to interstate commerce.\n       Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Erwin Chemerinsky.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             University of Chicago Law School,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, Nov. 24, 1997.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information \n         Subcommittee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This letter is in response to your \n     request for my views on the constitutionally of the proposed \n     statute designed to protect against harassment and invasion \n     of privacy by exploitative photographers, sound recorders, \n     and film crews. The bill would create a new federal criminal \n     and civil offense and two additional grounds for federal \n     civil liability. I believe that the bill is constitutional as \n     drafted. Here is a brief analysis of the legal issues.\n       The first question is whether the federal government has \n     the authority to enact a measure of this kind. The most \n     likely candidate is the commerce clause. Under the commerce \n     clause, the federal government does have this authority, \n     especially in light of the fact that the bill, as written, \n     requires a clear connection between the interstate commerce \n     and the harassing and invasive action. See the rules of \n     construction in sections 2 and 4. In fact this connection is \n     stronger than that in several of the cases in which the Court \n     has upheld congressional action under the commerce clause. \n     See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942); United States v. \n     Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941). United States v. Lopez, 115 S. \n     Ct. 1624 (1995), is not to the contrary, for in that case, \n     Congress did not require any connection between interstate \n     commerce and the prohibited possession of firearms on or near \n     school property. It is conceivable that the bill might be \n     challenged in some cases in which a photographer did not move \n     in interstate commerce and did not sell anything in \n     interstate commerce but intended to do so (see the rules of \n     construction). But under the cases cited above, its probably \n     constitutional even under such circumstances, because the \n     photographer would be part of a ``class'' of participants in \n     interstate commerce.\n       The second question is whether the bill violates the first \n     amendment. Here it is important to distinguish between a \n     constitutional challenge to the bill ``on its face'' and a \n     challenge to the bill ``as applied.'' I believe that a facial \n     challenge would fail. The bill is content neutral, see Turner \n     Broadcasting Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994); its \n     prohibitions apply regardless of the particular content of \n     the underlying material. This is especially important, since \n     the Court treats content-neutral restrictions more hospitably \n     than content-based restrictions. See id. Moreover, the bill \n     is directed at action, not at speech itself; speech itself is \n     left unregulated by the bill. In a way the constitutional \n     attack on the bill amounts to a claimed first amendment right \n     of access to private arenas and to information a right that \n     the Court has generally denied. See Pell v. Procunier, 417 \n     U.S. 817 (1974); Houchins v. KQED, 438 U.S. 1 (1978); \n     Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980).\n       To be sure, this is not the end of the matter: A content-\n     neutral restriction on action may create constitutional \n     problems if the action would result in restrictions on the \n     production of speech, as this bill would undoubtedly do. \n     Imagine, for example, a law that defined ``trespass'' to \n     include any effort to take photographs near the White House \n     or the Supreme Court. Cf. United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. \n     720 (1990). In assessing the validity of such a restriction, \n     some relevant questions are whether the restriction is \n     justified by sufficient government interests, whether there \n     are less restrictive alternatives for protecting those \n     interests, and whether the restriction on the production of \n     speech is small or large. See id. In most cases covered by \n     the bill, the restriction would be amply justified. If a \n     photographer has chased someone in such a way as to produce a \n     reasonable fear of bodily injury, the government has a strong \n     reason to provide protection, and the bill is a narrow \n     tailored means of doing so. Thus section 2, adding the new \n     criminal offense, seems on firm ground.\n       Section 4 is designed to ensure that photographers do not \n     engage in trespasses, or the equivalent of trespasses, in \n     order to invade people's privacy without their consent. This \n     section is also supported by the strong government interest \n     in ensuring that people have a secure private realm, one into \n     which those using the channels of interstate commerce do not \n     enter without consent. In most of its applications, section 4 \n     is also likely to be constitutional. Assume, for example, \n     that a photographer has trespassed into the private property \n     of a movie star in order to take pictures of a dinner or a \n     romantic encounter. Since the images are themselves \n     unregulated (see section 4(d)), the government almost \n     certainly has sufficient grounds to forbid this kind of \n     behavior, a trespass at common law. Although the Supreme \n     Court has subjected some common law rules to first amendment \n     limitations, it has never held that the law of trespass, even \n     though it restricts activity that would produce speech, \n     generally raises constitutional questions. Thus I conclude \n     that section 4 is constitutional in most of its likely \n     applications.\n       There are some contexts in which harder questions might be \n     raised. Assume, for example, that a presidential candidate is \n     engaged in unlawful activity on private property, and that a \n     journalist and a photographer have used technological devices \n     in order to obtain a record of that activity. Under section \n     4(b)(2), there has been a kind of federal tort, giving rise \n     of compensatory and punitive damages. It is possible that the \n     special first amendment liability in such cases. Cf. New York \n     Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). Thus a series of \n     cases might be imagined in which section 4, and conceivably \n     even section 2, would give rise to a reasonable \n     constitutional challenge as applied. This is true, however, \n     of a large range of generally permissible statutes; the \n     question for present purposes is whether the bill would be \n     constitutional on its face. I conclude that it would be.\n       I hope that these brief remarks are helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cass R.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an \nissue that concerns many Americans, religious intolerance in Europe. As \nChairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I \nchaired a hearing on September 18, 1997, on ``Religious Intolerance in \nEurope Today.'' We heard compelling testimony on the rise of religious \nintolerance in Europe from representatives of the Muslim and Jewish \nfaiths, Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, an evangelical \nProtestant church, the Church of the Latter Day Saints, Jehovah's \nWitness, and the Church of Scientology.\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\n  The testimony indicated the following:\n  Muslims in Europe have been subjected to genocide, mass killings, \nforced migration and torture, including rape, in the former Yugoslavia; \nharassment, including police brutality and attacks and other hate \ncrimes by extremist groups against Muslims have been reported \nthroughout Europe, particularly in Germany, France and the United \nKingdom; Muslims have been denied permits to build or repair mosques in \nthe Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and elsewhere in Europe; Muslim women are \nfrequently the subject of attacks, discrimination and other forms of \nabuse and harassment because they choose to wear a head covering;\n  Struggling Jewish communities in Eastern Europe are often made the \nscapegoats for the pain of the transition from centrally planned \neconomies to market capitalism; the desecration of Jewish cemeteries \nand memorials has been on the rise; and anti-Semitic publications, such \nas The Protocols of Zion, and neo-Nazi computer games have received \nwider distribution accompanied by the rise of skinhead gangs and \nhatemongers throughout Europe;\n  The Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate has been subject to \nrecurring acts of violence, and faces serious obstacles imposed by the \nGovernment of Turkey, including the closing of the Theological School \nof Halki, which have a detrimental impact on the activities of the \nPatriarchate and Orthodox believers in Turkey;\n  Catholic believers face harassment and violence in parts of Bosnia-\nHerzegovina and Croatia as well as Northern Ireland, and they face \nserious impediments to the practice of their faith elsewhere in Europe, \nincluding in Belarus, Russia, Greece, Turkey, and Romania;\n  Some evangelical and charismatic Christian churches have been denied \nregistration by the Governments of Bulgaria, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, \nand Greece and have been harassed, as well as have reportedly had \nreligious materials confiscated; at least one charismatic church in \nGermany has come under intense scrutiny by the local officials and the \nGerman Bundestag's Commission of Inquiry on So-called Sects and Psycho-\nGroups, faced other forms of harassment, and been the target of \nvandalism and threats of violence;\n  Jehovah's Witnesses have been denied registration in a number of OSCE \nparticipating States, including Armenia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, and \nLatvia; have been subjected to various forms of harassment, including \nthe prohibition on importation of religious literature and denial of \nthe freedom to assemble for worship services; France's Parliamentary \nCommission on Sects has categorized Jehovah's Witnesses as a ``criminal \nsect'' for its prohibition against blood transfusions; Germany's \nFederal Administrative Court has denied legal status to the Jehovah's \nWitnesses;\n  Mormons have been subjected to continued acts of harassment, \nincluding confiscation of religious materials, and assault, in \nBulgaria; and are prevented from freely sharing their beliefs in \nseveral OSCE participating States, including Greece and Turkey; and\n  Scientologists, including U.S. citizens, have been subjected to \npervasive civil, political and economic discrimination, harassment, \nsurveillance, and orchestrated boycotts in Germany.\n  In the months following this hearing, the Helsinki Commission has \nnoted a chilling effect on religious liberty from actions taken by \nnational parliaments. A law passed on December 10, 1997 by the Austrian \nParliament requires that a religious group prove a 20-year existence, \nhave a creed distinct from previously registered groups, and have a \nmembership of at least 0.02% of the population or 16,000 members before \nthey are granted full rights under law. Concerns over this law were \nraised in Vienna by a Helsinki Commission delegation this past January. \nA similar law was passed in 1997 in Macedonia. In January 1998, a \nHelsinki Commission delegation, lead by Co-Chairman Christopher Smith, \ntraveled to Moscow to discuss concerns with the 1997 Russian religion \nlaw with Russian government officials, minority religious groups, and \nthe Russian Orthodox Church.\n  Some governments have passed laws creating government information \ncenters to alert the public to ``dangerous'' groups. The Austrian and \nBelgian governments have set up hotlines for the public and, through \ngovernment sponsored advisory centers, distribute information on groups \ndeemed ``dangerous.'' In official Austrian literature, Jehovah's \nWitnesses are labeled ``dangerous'' and members of this group report \nthat the stigma associated with this government label is difficult to \novercome in Austrian society. These information centers directly \nviolate the commitments that Austria and Belgium have made as \nparticipating States of the OSCE to ``foster a climate of mutual \ntolerance and respect,'' in paragraph 16 of the Vienna Concluding \nDocument, and represent excessive governmental intrusion into the \npublic discussion on religious matters.\n\n  Several western European Parliaments have or are currently \ninvestigating and reporting on the activities of minority religious \ngroups. These parliamentary investigations have also had a chilling \neffect on religious liberty and appear to cause a public backlash \nagainst groups being investigated or labeled ``dangerous.'' For \ninstance, the German Parliament is currently conducting its \ninvestigation into ``dangerous sects'' and ``psycho-groups'' and issued \nan interim report in January 1998. At the Helsinki Commission's \nSeptember 18 hearing, at least one independent evangelical church \nreported a direct correlation between the harassment, vandalism and \nthreats of violence they experience and the investigation by the German \nParliament's commission. The French Parliament's report contained a \nlist of ``dangerous'' groups in order to warn the public against them \nand the Belgian Parliament's report had an informal appendix which was \nwidely circulated, which included allegations against many mainline \nCatholic groups, Quakers, Hasidic Jews, Buddhists, and the YWCA \n(although not the YMCA).\n  On Wednesday, May 20, 1998, a coalition of religious groups, \nincluding Hasidic Jews, Hindu, Bahia, Seventh Day Adventist, \nevangelical Protestant and charismatic Catholic communities, Plan to \nhold a press conference in Brussels to announce that they are about to \nlaunch a court challenge to the Belgian Parliamentary Report and the \nBelgian Government's Advice and Information Center. The premise of the \nlegal challenge is that these actions by the Belgian government violate \nBelgium's international commitments to religious liberty. I am pleased \nto see these and other groups such as Human Rights Without Frontiers \nstanding up for this fundamental freedom, and acting to highlight and \nchallenge the actions by European governments that violate the Helsinki \nAccords and other international commitments on religious liberty.\n  Mr. President, the recent action by the House adopting the Freedom \nFrom Religious Persecution Act, and pending consideration of that bill \nand parallel measures in the Senate, clearly show that this issue is \none that concerns Americans. Many Americans have family or friends who \nare citizens in countries that have solemnly promised to protect \nreligious liberty, but then restrict it or deny it. Many Americans, \nthrough their own religious affiliations, make donations to support the \nwork of their denominations outside this country, or take part in that \nwork themselves as a personal expression of their beliefs. Actions \ntaken by foreign governments that have promised to protect religious \nliberty and then violate these promises can and do directly affect \nAmerican citizens during their travels for business or pleasure, when \nthey support the overseas religious efforts of their faiths by \ndonations or personal participation, or through negative effects on \ntheir relatives and friends who reside in these countries.\n  Accordingly, I call upon my colleagues to remain vigilant on this \nsubject, and assure them and all Americans that the Commission will \nremain active and engaged as we seek to document violations and protect \nthe rights of affected persons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5240-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5241-S5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RABBI MOSHE SHERER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I regret to inform my colleagues \nin the Senate of the death on Sunday, May 17 of Rabbi Moshe Sherer, \nPresident of Agudath Israel of America, a vibrant\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\norganization of Orthodox Jews in our country.\n  I was privileged to have known Rabbi Sherer for many years and to \nbenefit from his wise counsel. He lived an extraordinarily righteous \nand productive life, and was a kindly but driving force in the \nunprecedented growth of his organization and its perspective within \nAmerica. Rabbi Sherer was also a very successful bridgebuilder to other \nfaith communities in his effort to spread the light of religious truth \nthroughout our country.\n  I shall miss Rabbi Sherer, and wish to extend to his wife, Deborah, \nand his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren my condolences \nand best wishes.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of two articles from the New \nYork Times of May 19, 1998 be printed in the Record. The first \ndescribes Rabbi Sherer's remarkable life, and the second the effect of \nhis death on the more than 20,000 people who came to his funeral in New \nYork two days ago.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 19, 1998]\n\n Rabbi Moshe Sherer, 76, Who Contributed to Rise of Orthodoxy's Right \n                              Wing in U.S.\n\n                          (By Gustav Niebuhr)\n\n       Rabbi Moshe Sherer, who built a relatively small Orthodox \n     Jewish organization, Agudath Israel of America, into a \n     politically and religiously influential force among American \n     Jewish groups, died Sunday afternoon in Manhattan. He was 76 \n     and lived in Brooklyn.\n       He died after an illness of several months, a spokesman for \n     the group said.\n       Rabbi Sherer had served since 1963 as president of Agudath \n     Israel of America, an educational and social service \n     organization that also represents hundreds of Orthodox \n     religious schools, or yeshivas in the United States and \n     Canada.\n       Through his work at Agudath Israel, Rabbi Sherer played a \n     leading role in the rise of Orthodox Judaism's right wing, \n     which has gained in influence and self-confidence since the \n     1960's, at the expense of Orthodoxy's more moderate wing.\n       That shift seemed unlikely when Rabbi Sherer joined Agudath \n     Israel as its executive vice president in 1941, when it was a \n     small group with few employees. In an interview last year, he \n     said some people warned him that Agudath Israel's rigorously \n     traditional Orthodox approach had little future in America. \n     But, he said, ``it's a growth stock today.''\n       Sociologists say that Orthodoxy's strict traditionalists \n     have benefited from charismatic leadership, a high birthrate \n     and anxiety among many Orthodox Jews over signs of moral \n     turmoil in society.\n       Today, Agudath Israel, with headquarters at 84 William St., \n     Manhattan, has branches throughout the country and a \n     Washington office that lobbies the government on religious \n     issues. It belongs to the Agudath Israel World Organization, \n     of which Rabbi Sherer was appointed chairman in 1980. In \n     Israel, it is associated with the strictly Orthodox United \n     Torah Judaism Party, a member of the governing coalition.\n       Among Agudath Israel's earliest projects under Rabbi \n     Sherer's leadership was sending food shipments to Jews in \n     Nazi-dominated Eastern Europe and producing affidavits to \n     help refugees immigrate to the United States. After World War \n     II, the organization shipped food and religious articles to \n     Jews in displaced persons camps and assisted those who wanted \n     to immigrate.\n       With Agudath Israel's constituency of religious schools, \n     Rabbi Sherer served a world that prizes scholarship. Born in \n     Brooklyn on June 8, 1921, he was educated at Torah Vodath, a \n     Brooklyn yeshiva, and Ner Israel rabbinical college in \n     Baltimore. He told associates that his main mentor was the \n     late Rabbi Aharon Kotler, who founded a highly  regarded \n     yeshiva in Lakewood, N.J.\n       Yet Rabbi Sherer was known as an organizer rather than an \n     intellectual, with diplomatic and political skills that \n     enabled him to forge coalitions within the decentralized and \n     contentious world of Orthodox Judaism, and with other \n     religious groups.\n       ``He was able to take disparate groups, bring them together \n     and get them to cooperate in the areas where they would \n     agree,'' said Rabbi Nosson Scherman, general editor of \n     Artscroll, a major publisher of Jewish texts.\n       Rabbi Steven M. Dworken, executive vice president of the \n     Rabbinical Council of America, which represents about 1,000 \n     Orthodox rabbis, said Rabbi Sherer ``was responsible in many, \n     many ways for placing Agudath Israel on the map.''\n       As the most strictly observant of the Orthodox community \n     became more visible and organized politicians took note. In \n     January 1994, Rabbi Sherer delivered the invocation at the \n     first inauguration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuilani of New York. \n     Vice President Al Gore was the speaker at the organization's \n     76th annual dinner, held in New York the day Rabbi Sherer \n     died.\n       But the organization was also considered important earlier. \n     When The New York Times described the growing influence of \n     local religious groups in a 1974 article, it quoted Rabbi \n     Sherer as saying about Agudath Israel, ``There is hardly a \n     legislator from any Jewish neighborhood in the city who does \n     not know how we stand on issues that concern us and how \n     thorough we are about informing our constituents about \n     positions the legislators take on these issues.''\n       Still, he did not have the visibility of some of his \n     counterparts at other Jewish organizations. ``He wasn't a \n     headline-maker.'' said Samuel C. Heilman, professor of Jewish \n     studies and sociology at the Graduate School of the City \n     University of New York. Instead, Professor Heilman said, \n     Rabbi Sherer worked quietly ``to keep the channels of \n     communication open'' between Agudath Israel and other Jewish \n     organizations.\n       What helped is that Agudath Israel reached out to the \n     entire Jewish community with its programs promoting Jewish \n     identity and learning. Last September, for example, the \n     organization sponsored a celebration for men who had \n     completed a seven-year program of reading the entire Talmud, \n     the Jewish civil and religious law, at the rate of a page a \n     day. An estimated 70,000 people participated, filling Madison \n     Square Garden and other arenas.\n       Rabbi Sherer sometimes took positions at odds with non-\n     Orthodox organizations. He supported aid by Federal and state \n     governments to religious schools, a stand that placed his \n     organization on the same side of that issue as the Roman \n     Catholic Church but nettled some Jewish groups that supported \n     a strict separation of church and state.\n       Testifying before Congress on this issue in 1961, he said, \n     ``Classical Judaism has, from the very inception of the \n     Jewish people, placed religious education in sharp focus as \n     the centrality of life itself.''\n       More recently, he helped lead an effort to counter attempts \n     by Reform and Conservative Jews to gain official recognition \n     of non-Orthodox rabbis in Israel. Last November, he announced \n     that Agudath Israel would spend $2 million for newspaper \n     advertisements to promote the view that within Israel, \n     conversions and other rites should remain under Orthodox \n     control.\n       Agudath Israel's spokesman, Rabbi Avi Shafran, said Rabbi \n     Sherer's stand stemmed from the conviction that ``the only \n     unifying force for the Jewish people is the Jewish religious \n     heritage.''\n       Rabbi Sherer is survived by his wife, the former Deborah \n     Portman; two daughters, Rochel Langer of Monsey, N.Y., and \n     Elky Goldschmidt of Brooklyn; a son, Rabbi Shimshon Sherer of \n     Brooklyn, and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Borough Park Mourns Jewish Luminary\n\n                        (By Garry Pierre-Pierre)\n\n       The armada of yellow buses that usually clog the narrow \n     streets of Borough Park, Brooklyn, shuttling students from \n     yeshivas to their homes, was nowhere in sight yesterday. \n     Instead, the streets were filled with thousands of people \n     mourning the death of Rabbi Moshe Sherer, whom many \n     considered the elder statesman of the American Orthodox \n     Jewish community.\n       The mourners crowded the streets, stood on rooftops and sat \n     in their living rooms to listen to eulogies, broadcast \n     throughout the neighborhood by loudspeaker, for a man known \n     for his tireless efforts to unite Jewish sects and to reach \n     out to the secular world.\n       Within hours of his death on Sunday afternoon, his \n     followers had begun gathering on the streets around the \n     modest brick building of Congregation Agudath Israel of \n     Borough Park. By late yesterday, more than 20,000 had lined \n     up to pay their respects.\n       When Rabbi Sherer's white coffin, draped with a black \n     velvet cloth, was carried from the hearse into a sun-soaked \n     street, a huge cry of grief rose from the crowd. The coffin \n     was supported by about 20 men and seemed in danger of \n     toppling as the men jostled for position.\n       ``He had the power and charisma to bring the secular and \n     religious groups together,'' said Joseph Rappaport, an \n     officer with Congregation Agudath Israel. ``He was able to \n     create bridges.''\n       Rabbi Sherer, who died at age 78, had for more than 30 \n     years headed Agudath Israel of America, an advocacy \n     organization that he helped transform from a small group into \n     a formidable movement that claims 100,000 members and has \n     branches around the country.\n       Among those paying respects yesterday were Gov. George E. \n     Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani and other politicians and \n     dignitaries. The crowds grew so big that the police blocked \n     car traffic from 13th through 16th Avenues and 43d through \n     50th Streets.\n       One mourner, Morton M. Avigdor, leaned against a police \n     barricade in front of the congregation building and explained \n     how Rabbi Sherer had fought for government benefits and \n     services for children in nonpublic schools by allying himself \n     with Catholic school advocates.\n       ``He felt that people of all faith should be entitled to \n     education,'' said Mr. Avigdor, a lawyer. ``It is truly a \n     great loss.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5241-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5242-S5243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS ``NICK'' LEIST\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, across our great nation there are \nthousands of teachers dedicated to the development of young minds. In \nMissouri, as a former Governor and U.S. Senator, I have had the \nopportunity to meet many educators and have a great deal\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\nof admiration for their commitment to our youth.\n  I have found, however, some teachers are special and go beyond the \ncall of duty to lead their students toward a rewarding and productive \nlife. Today, I rise to speak about one such teacher who is retiring \nthis year, Nicholas ``Nick'' Leist.\n  For thirty-six years Mr. Leist has dedicated his life teaching music \nto young people in Missouri. Mr. Leist has not only been an educator, \nhe has been a friend and inspiration to literally thousands of \nstudents. Over the last thirty years, he has taught more than 9,000 \nstudents at Jackson High School, and his musicians have had a \nphenomenal record, having achieved twenty-seven consecutive number one \nratings at district music contests. More than eight dozen students have \ngone on to become teachers themselves, following in the steps of their \nmentor.\n  On May 5, 1998, Mr. Leist conducted his last Jackson High School band \nconcert which brought tears to the eyes of students and their Mr. \nLeist. They will miss Nick Leist at Jackson High School next year; \nhowever, the impact he had on students will live on for generations \nthrough the people he inspired to greater personal heights. I join the \nmany who wish Mr. Leist happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5242-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING TIMOTHY CORDES\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of Members of Congress and the country a young constituent of \nmine.\n  Some of you may have read about Timothy Cordes in Monday's Washington \nPost. For those of you who didn't, Tim--who is from Eldridge, Iowa--\njust received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Notre Dame, with \na 3.99 grade point average. Tim was the valedictorian of his class and \nwill begin medical school at the University of Wisconsin this summer. \nThese would be outstanding accomplishments for any young person. They \nare especially remarkable in this case, because Tim is blind--only the \nsecond blind person ever admitted to a U.S. medical school.\n  Tim has a genetic condition that gradually diminished his vision \nuntil he was blind when he was 14. Doctors diagnosed him with the \ndisease when he was two. They talked about how blindness would limit \nTim's life. But his parents wouldn't accept that for their son. His \nmother said that after talking with the doctors, ``I went home and just \nignored everything they said.'' Thank goodness for that!\n  I have spent much of my time in the Senate working toward a society \nin which all Americans, those with disabilities and those without, have \nthe same opportunities to succeed.That's what all people with \ndisabilities want--an equal opportunity to succeed. Some will succeed \nand some won't, but it will be because of their abilities, not their \ndisabilities. Tim personifies the fact that when society accommodates \npeople with disabilities to allow them to reach their full potential, \nwe all benefit.\n  At Notre Dame, Tim overcame his blindness by asking fellow students \nto describe the molecular structures they were studying and by using \nhis computer to re-create the images in three-dimensional forms on a \nspecial monitor he could touch. In addition to his academic \nachievements, Tim earned a black belt in tae kwon do and jujitsu, went \nto football games and debated with this friends whether the old or new \n``Star Trek'' is better.\n  Tim's biochemistry professor called him a remarkable young man and \nthe most brilliant student he's ever had. One of Tim's roommates said \nthat he was ``simply amazing to be around.''\n  Tim doesn't mind being an inspiration to others, but he doesn't think \nof himself that way. In his words, ``[i]t was just hard work.'' Well, \nthat's for sure!\n  For my part, I am honored to represent Tim and his parents and to be \nable to take this time to congratulate him and his parents for all \ntheir great work. Congratulations!\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the Washington Post \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 18, 1998]\n\nBlind Valedictorian Is Headed to Med School; Notre Dame Student Credits \n                   ``Just Hard Work'' for His Success\n\n                             (By Jon Jeter)\n\n       South Bend, IN.--Sure but sightless, Timothy Cordes arrived \n     on the University of Notre Dame' campus four years ago, an \n     18-year-old freshman from Eldridge, Iowa, who wanted to \n     enroll in the biochemistry program. Faculty members tried, \n     politely, to dissuade him. Just how, they wondered aloud, \n     could a blind student keep up with the rigorous courses and \n     demanding laboratory work of biochemistry?\n       Cordes graduated today from Notre Dame with a degree in \n     biochemistry and a 3.991 grade-point average. He was the last \n     of Notre Dame's 2,000 seniors to enter the crowded auditorium \n     for commencement. His German shepherd, Electra, led him to \n     the lectern to deliver the valedictory speech as his \n     classmates rose, cheered, applauded and yelled his name \n     affectionately.\n       Cordes starts medical school in two months, only the second \n     blind person ever admitted to a U.S. medical school. He does \n     not plan to practice medicine. His interest is in research, \n     he said: ``I've just always loved science.''\n       His life has been both an act of open, mannerly defiance \n     and unshakable faith. And this unassuming, slightly built \n     young man with a choirboy's face awes acquaintances and \n     friends.\n       Armed with Electra, a high-powered personal computer and a \n     quick wit, Cordes managed a near-perfect academic record, an \n     A-minus in a Spanish class the only blemish. Two weeks ago, \n     he earned a black belt in the martial arts tae kwon do and \n     jujitsu.\n       ``He is really a remarkable young man,'' said Paul \n     Helquist, a Notre Dame biochemistry professor. Helquist at \n     first had doubts but ultimately recommended Cordes for \n     medical school. ``He is by far the most brilliant student \n     I've ever come across in my 24 years of teaching,'' the \n     professor said.\n       If others find some noble lessons in this life, Cordes \n     perceives it more prosaically: He's merely shown up for life \n     and done what was necessary to reach his goals.\n       ``If people are inspired by what I've done, that's great, \n     but the truth is that I did it all for me. It was just hard \n     work. It's like getting the black belt. It's not like I just \n     took one long lesson. It was showing up every day, and \n     sweating and learning and practicing. You have your bad days \n     and you just keep going.''\n       Despite his academic accomplishments, Cordes led a fairly \n     ordinary life in college, debating, for example, the merits \n     of the old and new ``Star Trek'' series with Patrick \n     Murowsky, a 22-year-old psychology major from Cleveland who \n     roomed with Cordes their sophomore year.\n       ``The thing about Tim is that he's fearless and he just \n     seems to have this faith. Once we were late for a football \n     game and we had to run to the stadium. He had no qualms about \n     running at top speed while I yelled `jump,' or I would yell \n     `duck' and he would duck. And we made it. He is simply \n     amazing to be around sometimes,'' said Murowsky.\n       Cordes has Leber's disease, a genetic condition that \n     gradually diminished his vision until he was blind at age 14.\n       When doctors at the University of Iowa first diagnosed the \n     disease when he was 2, ``it was the saddest moment of my \n     life,'' said his mother, Therese, 50.\n       ``The doctors . . . told us: `He won't be able to do this, \n     and don't expect him to be able to do this,' '' Therese \n     Hordes recalled. ``So I went home and just ignored everything \n     they said.''\n       The ability to conceptualize images has greatly helped \n     Hordes in his studies, Helquist said. The study of \n     biochemistry relies heavily on graphics and diagrams to \n     illustrate complicated molecular structures. Hordes \n     compensated for his inability to see by asking other students \n     to describe the visual sides or by using his computer to re-\n     create the images in three-dimensional forms on a special \n     screen he could touch.\n       Cordes applied to eight medical schools. Only the \n     University of Wisconsin accepted him. (The first blind \n     medical student was David Hartman, who graduated from Temple \n     University in 1976 and is a psychiatrist in Roanoke, Va.)\n       ``Tim has always exceeded people's expectations of him,'' \n     said Teresa Cordes, who, with her husband, Tom, watched Tim \n     graduate. ``He really does inspire me.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5243-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5243-S5244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Since then he has expanded this \ngroup to provide annual missions to Nicaragua, the Philippines, \nVietnam, Liberia, Kenya and other third world countries. Locally, \nOperation Smile provides free care for school children in the \nPhiladelphia area. Working with philanthropic organizations, the group \nbrings physicians from other countries to Philadelphia for advanced \ntraining in techniques used to reconstruct child deformities.\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\n  Operation Smile consists of reconstructive surgeons, professional \nnurses and concerned citizens who have dedicated themselves to \nproviding relief for children suffering from congenital and acquired \ndeformities.\n  Through a spirit of selflessness, Dr. Moore has given both this heart \nand time to Operation Smile. He has served as the President of the \nchapter's local board and is currently its medical director.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Moore's dedication is a great source of pride, not \nonly for Pennsylvania, but for the United States. I hope my colleagues \nwill join with me in honoring Dr. Moore for his spirit of community and \nfaithful service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5243-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMTRAK BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter of \nAmtrak, recognizing the tremendous potential that advanced rail-\npassenger technology can play in developing our nation's 21st Century \neconomy.\n  Amtrak has a distinct and important relationship with the state of \nIllinois. Chicago is the headquarters of one of Amtrak's three \nStrategic Business Units and the Intercity Business Unit, which manages \nall passenger trains in America with the exception of the Northeast \nCorridor and West Coast services. Downtown Chicago is also home to one \nof the three nationwide Reservation Call Centers. Amtrak also operates \nover forty trains per day in Illinois, with a total ridership in excess \nof 2.5 million passengers. Illinois has first-hand experience with \nAmtrak's current services and recognizes its future potential.\n  The Congress has also understood Amtrak's potential. In last year's \nTaxpayer Relief Act, the Senate and House provided $2.3 billion in \nAmtrak capital investment to make our federally owned rail passenger \ncarrier a strong contributor to our nation's mobility. Congress also \nworked diligently to enact the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of \n1997. With the authority conferred on it by this legislation, Amtrak \nnow has the ability to undertake the organizational restructuring and \noperational fine-tuning necessary to realize the full benefits promised \nby the $2.3 billion in capital funding.\n  An integral component of the reform envisioned by this legislation \nwas the timely selection and seating of an ``Amtrak Reform Board'' \ncomprised of directors with fresh ideas and experience in dealing with \nthe business world. We must ensure that the Administration moves \nswiftly enough to avoid the consequences of failing to appoint a new \nAmtrak Reform Board by the statutory deadline, July 1, 1998. Quick \naction on this matter will allow Amtrak to maintain the authorization \nmandated in the law signed last December.\n  I am hopeful that the President will move quickly to appoint the \nseven directors required under the new law. These appointments should \ninclude professionals experienced in the leasing and financing of \nhundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment and people familiar \nwith debt rescheduling and refinancing, which are among tasks tailored \nto Amtrak's business needs.\n  I would also encourage the Administration to make certain that these \nappointments fairly represent the various regions of the country, and \nIllinois is certainly deserving of such representation. Amtrak provides \nservice to over thirty cities in Illinois. In addition, Amtrak employs \nsome 2,200 Illinois residents, with earnings totaling over $50 million \nper year. Regional representation will also ensure that the diverse \ninterests of our regional economies can be brought to the table for \nequitable decision making in the Amtrak Boardroom.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues who support Amtrak will join me \nin encouraging the Administration to submit qualified candidates, women \nand men with the knowledge and experience required to strengthen our \nnational system of passenger transportation, to the Senate as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5244-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNITION OF THE LEADERSHIP TRAINING INSTITUTE FOR YOUTH\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an exemplary \nprogram in Missouri, the Leadership Training Institute for Youth (LTI). \nEvery year at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri this \nleadership camp is held for youth from all over America. This camp \ninspires youth to work toward their goals and to achieve personal \nexcellence.\n  With the leadership of Dr. Pat Briney, the attendees learn leadership \nskills through Christian values. LTI helps to guide youth through their \nmost confusing years and teaches them coping mechanisms for future \nproblems.\n  LTI represents the kind of spirit, honor and integrity that belong \nwith today's youth leaders.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Frank Caprio \nof Providence, Rhode Island, who will be honored at the 37th Annual \nVerrazzano Day Banquet this Saturday.\n  A respected and admired Rhode Islander, Frank Caprio was born in \nProvidence in 1936, the son of immigrants. His father peddled produce \nand delivered milk in the Federal Hill neighborhood, while his beloved \nmother cared for Frank, his two brothers, Antonio Jr. and Joseph, and \ndedicated herself to her Church and community.\n  Frank Caprio epitomizes the American dream. From his humble \nbeginnings, he is today a respected lawyer, successful businessman, and \nChief Judge of the Providence Municipal Court. At Central High School \nhe was an all-state wrestler who was encouraged to learn a trade, but \nhe aspired to attain a college education. And he did. He worked his way \nthrough Providence College, earning his Bachelor of Arts. He later \nearned his education certificate from Rhode Island College.\n  Frank taught American government by day and attended Suffolk Law \nSchool at night. Inspired by President Kennedy, he ran for Providence \nCity Council in 1962 and served for eight years. He was a delegate to \nthe Rhode Island Constitutional Convention in 1973, and he has been \nelected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention five times.\n  Frank Caprio has practiced law for more than 30 years and has a \nremarkably diverse practice. He has served as special counsel to \nCookson America, a fortune 500 corporation, and as legal counsel to the \nProvidence Redevelopment Agency and the Rhode Island Department of \nTransportation. But perhaps Frank's most revered clients are neighbors \nand friends, many of humble means, who seek out Frank as their \ndefender, advocate, and voice. They cherish his friendship and offer \ntrust in return, which is a wonderful tribute to Frank and a testament \nto the way he has led his life.\n  Through initiative, hard work and tireless energy, Frank has attained \nmuch success in business. He is a principal owner of the Coast Guard \nHouse, a historic waterfront restaurant in Narragansett and another \npopular restaurant, Casey's, in Wakefield. In addition to his success \nas a restaurateur, Frank is a principal owner of Cherry Hill Housing in \nJohnston.\n  Despite all of his success in law, government, and business, Frank \nhas always understood the importance of community and public service. \nHe serves on the board of Federal Hill House and as a volunteer at \nNickerson House. He is a fellow of the Rhode Island Community Food \nBank, and is a member of both the Bishop's Council and the State Board \nof Governors for Higher Education.\n  In honor of his own father, he established the Antonio ``Tup'' Caprio \nScholarship at Suffolk University, and is the 1997-1998 Chairman of the \nProvidence College Alumni Fund. He holds an Honorary Doctor of Law \nDegree from Suffolk and has been recognized by countless organizations \nfor his spirit of community and his humanitarian efforts.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased today to salute Frank Caprio on receiving \nthe prestigious Annual Verrazzano Day award, and I extend best wishes \nto Frank, his wife, Joyce, and their wonderful family on this momentous \noccasion.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5244-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n          CHILD SUPPORT PERFORMANCE AND INCENTIVE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

It is the \nchairman's intention to move to table the Gregg-Leahy amendment at \napproximately 11 a.m. I add at this point, it could be later than that \nbecause we have had numerous requests to speak on this amendment. So it \ncould be later than that.\n\n  Following that vote, it is hoped that the Democrats would be prepared \nto offer an amendment under a short time agreement. Following \ndisposition of the Democrat amendment, it is hoped the Senate could \nthen consider the farmers' protection issue. At the conclusion of \ndebate on the protection issue, the Senate would proceed to a vote on a \nmotion to strike the Ford language, followed by a vote to strike the \nMcConnell-Lugar language. Therefore, the first vote of Thursday's \nsession is expected at approximately 11 a.m. or later, and Members \nshould expect rollcall votes throughout Thursday's session in order to \nmake good progress on this important tobacco legislation.\n  Once again, the cooperation of all Senators would be necessary for \nthe Senate to complete its work prior to the Memorial Day recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5245-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for allowing time for me to make a few concluding remarks here, \nbecause I want to discuss an amendment that is one of those offered and \npending. It is the Gregg-Leahy amendment. I want to express my opinion \non this because I think this is a cornerstone issue in terms of this \npiece of legislation, the tobacco bill altogether. I simply do not \nbelieve that we should provide special legal protection to the tobacco \nindustry.\n  This isn't a vote about holding together a coalition, as is often \ndescribed, or some other purpose other than determination as to how \nthis country conducts itself vis-a-vis its tobacco policy. This is \ngoing to be a straight vote, up or down, about providing this industry \nwith unprecedented legal protections.\n  Now, I described it before as kind of a cornerstone issue, because if \nthese special protections that are being talked about in this bill, \neliminating immunity for this industry that certainly doesn't deserve \nimmunities in my eyes, tobacco companies, if the bill stands \nunmodified, unamended, tobacco companies will get special legal \nprotection for having such things as arsenic in its products. But \nanother industry that might use arsenic in its products would not enjoy \nsuch protection. They would have to list their product, be very \nspecific, get permission to use it, et cetera. Why in the world would \nwe want to do that--because arsenic is a very dangerous material among \nthe many materials, 500 items, that are included typically in a \ncigarette.\n  Why, of all the industries that we have in the United States, would \nwe want to provide special legal protection to the tobacco industry? We \nare talking about an industry that has continuously lied to Congress, \nlied to the American people, deceived them about what might happen if \nthey picked up, started smoking cigarettes. The average person wouldn't \nhave the foggiest idea--warnings could be dangerous to health. It \ndoesn't say it is almost guaranteed to make you an addict. It doesn't \nsay if you took these ingredients apart, there are many that are quite \ntoxic. If the labels on the package said you might die if you do this, \nyou might die early, you might die at a prime time in your life when \nyou would like to be with your family and your friends, when you would \nlike to be able to enjoy life, be able to do the things that you do \nathletically or functionally or vocationally, it doesn't say on there, \nhey, listen, if you start this, first of all, you will be spending \nthousands of dollars a year to support this habit.\n  Having been a smoker, I am somewhat of an expert on the subject. I am \nnot a zealot. I don't say that just because I took the cure, so to \nspeak, that other people have to take it. But I know what it is that \ngot me around to ceasing my smoking habit, and it was the love of a \nchild. It was when my youngest daughter of three children, who was \nabout 7 or 8 years old, came up to me one night when I lit a cigarette \nafter a meal and said ``Daddy, why do you smoke?'' And I said, ``Well, \nI enjoy it. It is restful, makes me feel good.'' And she said--this is \na child in first or second grade--and she said, ``Today we learned if \nyou smoke you get a black box in your throat.'' She said, ``Daddy, I \nlove you. I don't want you to have a black box in your throat.'' This \nis after I had been smoking some 20 years.\n  I smoked before I went in the Army and I made sure I smoked when I \nwas in the Army. When I was overseas during the war, I was used to \ntrading butts with my friends. I would take a puff, they would take a \npuff. Smoking was part of your life--not only part of your life, it was \npart of your resources. It was a currency. You could trade it for some \nfresh fruit. You could trade it for a bottle of water--we didn't drink \nmuch bottled water in those days, but whatever you chose to have. It \nwas currency. It was more valuable than the French franc or the Dutch \nguilder--places I was stationed--or the Belgium franc, or the mark, for \nsure.\n  So here I smoked and this child brought me to my senses, my daughter. \nI tried to stop, I would say at least a dozen times. She convinced me \nin that little message--``I love you. I don't want you to have a black \nbox in your throat.'' All I could think about were those beautiful big \neyes looking at me the next couple of days and that was the end of my \nsmoking. Thank goodness that child did me an enormous favor.\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\n  But the industry didn't let me know that. The industry didn't let me \nknow at the time that I might develop an illness, emphysema, some other \nrespiratory problem, maybe a fatal heart attack that couldn't be \npredicted because of smoking. They never told me anything about those \nthings. They said life is more beautiful, life is glamorous. You could \nbe a cowboy on a horse or a great skier. I happen to be, it has nothing \nto do with my smoking, but the fact of the matter is that all of those \nthings give you images that are deceitful, dishonest, and shouldn't be \nallowed to be out there with impunity, because if someone falls for \nthat story, someone falls for that image, they wind up in deep, deep \ntrouble, killing 400,000 people a year in this country. That is not a \nvery credible industry, I must tell you. They don't tell you that.\n  So this industry knew that its products caused cancer. They wouldn't \nacknowledge it. I sat at hearings galore. I was part of one hearing \nwhere we had the scientist in front of us from one of the tobacco \ncompanies, a man with incredible credentials if you looked at his \ncurriculum vitae. He had gone to great schools and he had done \nwonderful things. I asked him what happened when they tested the \nproducts on humans, and he said, ``We didn't do human research.'' I \nalmost fell off the chair. I said, ``You didn't?'' All of these \nstudies, by then 60,000 reports on the dangers of smoking had come \nout. But this company, one of the biggest, said scientists representing \nhim said, ``Oh, no, we didn't.'' I said, ``What did you do in your \nresearch?'' He said, ``We did some research on animals.'' I didn't \npursue that because I am sure those animals didn't fare very well.\n\n  This is an industry that deliberately targeted our children, not for \na good purpose, not for better health, for worse health, to try to \naddict them. If it was an illegal drug, we would be after these guys \nand they would be thrown in jail for long, long sentences. But they \ntargeted our kids. They went to your children and my children and said: \n``Smoke and you are going to be a hero among your peers. Smoke and you \nwill be beautiful. Smoke and you will be desirable.'' All deceit, all \nlies, all determined, at no matter what cost, to grab that child, get \nhim or her smoking. They knew they could put money in the bank. They \ncould probably take it to the bank as collateral for loans very easily, \nbecause that person, with rare exception, was hooked.\n  That is why we have over 45 million people today who can't quit. I \nsay they can't quit because I never met a smoker yet of any duration--\nnot once--and I meet people all the time, but not once have I met a \nsmoker who didn't say they would like to quit smoking. They tried. They \nhave gone to clinics, wore patches, and they have done this and that. \nBut every time they stop for a while, something else comes up, some \nsituation comes up, and they start all over again.\n  That is what they want our kids to do. They want our children to be \ntheir marker. In all kinds of testimony given--some of it willingly and \nsome unwillingly--by edict of the courts, especially in Minnesota, \ninformation has come out that they new bloody well they were targeting \nkids, and they new doggone well that they alter the nicotine content \nand make that addiction even firmer. They knew very well that people \ngot cancer and they knew very well that people got sick. They didn't \ngive a darn. They had one thing in their eyes: Cash. And they went \nafter it, and they were willing to seduce children to do it.\n  In many other cases, if anybody touches a hair on a child's head, \nthey go off to jail. If they dare say something improper to a child, \nthey get punished. These guys wanted to seduce 3,000 kids a day, a \nmillion a year, to start smoking because they knew that they made that \ncash register ring. This industry, that purposely pushed its product on \nto all American children, focused often on African Americans, or \nminority children, who seemed to be a little susceptible. Now they find \nout it is not just the minority children, it is all children that are \nsusceptible.\n  This industry is being investigated by the Justice Department. What \nkind of precedent does that set? Because what we are talking about in \nthis bill is immunity from lawsuits for damage created by the smoking \nhabit which they were fooled into beginning. So with all of that, and \nbeing investigated by the Justice Department, we say we want to protect \nthem in the event of a lawsuit? We don't want to protect anybody else, \nlike car manufacturers, food manufacturers, or house builders. Food \nmanufacturers have to list everything. They are all subject to redress \nof their rights through the courts. That is the way it ought to be.\n  But here we want to do something different. So if this is a \ncondition, why shouldn't we give all white-collar criminals special \nprotection? We could extend it to drug dealers as well.\n\n  The Gregg-Leahy amendment will keep the legal system right side up. \nIt will prevent Congress from rewarding the corporate outlaws who are \nthe tobacco industry. Unless we pass this amendment, we are going to \nundermine the rights of Americans who have been harmed by the tobacco \nindustry's deliberate conduct. These people are dying of lung cancer, \nheart disease, and they are often debilitated in wheelchairs or in \nhospitals. They become sick because they were nicotine addicts, which \nhas the same pharmacological qualities as cocaine and heroin. Mr. \nPresident, these people should not have their rights abridged, and the \ntobacco industry should not get unprecedented legal protection.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Gregg-Leahy amendment. Don't let \nthe tobacco industry get away with this, because, again, I think this \ntalks about the value of having this legislation. If they are free of \ntheir appropriate responsibility under the law, if they are free by \nvirtue of a limitation on immunity, they are going to have a bonanza \nhere, and we ought not to permit it. This amendment is not a deal-\nbreaker, but it breaks a sweetheart deal for the tobacco industry. I \nhope that when the votes are counted here, the American people will be \nwatching to see what the favorite industry of this body is.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/20/senate-section/article/S5245-5", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
