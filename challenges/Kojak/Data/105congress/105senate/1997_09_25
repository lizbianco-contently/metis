Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House of Representatives on (S. 871) to establish the \nOklahoma City National Memorial as a unit of the National Park System; \nto designate the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust, and for other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 871) entitled \n     ``An Act to establish the Oklahoma City National Memorial as \n     a unit of the National Park System; to designate the Oklahoma \n     City Memorial Trust, and for other purposes.'', do pass with \n     the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Oklahoma City National \n     Memorial Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) few events in the past quarter-century have rocked \n     Americans' perception of themselves and their institutions, \n     and brought together the people of our Nation with greater \n     intensity than the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. \n     Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City;\n       (2) the resulting deaths of 168 people, some of whom were \n     children, immediately touched thousands of family members \n     whose lives will forever bear scars of having those precious \n     to them taken away so brutally;\n       (3) suffering with such families are countless survivors, \n     including children, who struggle not only with the suffering \n     around them, but their own physical and emotional injuries \n     and with shaping a life beyond April 19;\n       (4) such losses and struggles are personal and, since they \n     resulted from so public an attack, they are also shared with \n     a community, a Nation, and the world;\n       (5) the story of the bombing does not stop with the attack \n     itself or with the many losses it caused. The responses of \n     Oklahoma's public servants and private citizens, and those \n     from throughout the Nation, remain as a testament to the \n     sense of unity, compassion, even heroism, that characterized \n     the rescue and recovery following the bombing;\n       (6) during the days immediately following the Oklahoma City \n     bombing, Americans and people from around the world of all \n     races, political philosophies, religions and walks of life \n     responded with unprecedented solidarity and selflessness; and\n       (7) given the national and international impact and \n     reaction, the Federal character of the site of the bombing, \n     and the significant percentage of the victims and survivors \n     who were Federal employees the Oklahoma City Memorial will be \n     established, designed, managed and maintained to educate \n     present and future generations, through a public/private \n     partnership, to work together efficiently and respectfully in \n     developing a National Memorial relating to all aspects of the \n     April 19, 1995, bombing in Oklahoma City.\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the amendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the cosponsor of \nthis legislation, Senator Inhofe, the legislation we passed today, S. \n871, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997, will create a \npermanent Memorial to commemorate the national tragedy ingrained in all \nof our minds that occurred in downtown Oklahoma City at 9:02 a.m. on \nApril 19, 1995, in which 168 Americans lost their lives and countless \nthousands more lost family members and friends.\n  The Oklahoma City memorial, established as a unit of the National \nPark Service, will serve as a monument to those whose lives were taken \nand those who will bear the physical and mental scars for the rest of \ntheir days. The memorial will stand as a symbol to the hope, \ngenerosity, and courage shown by Oklahomans and fellow Americans across \nthe country following the Oklahoma City bombing. This will be a place \nof remembrance, peace, spirituality, comfort and learning.\n  The National Park Service memorial site will encompass the footprint \nof the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, 5th Street between Robinson \nand Harvey, the site of the Water Resources Building and the Journal \nRecord Building. An international competition was held to determine the \ndesign of the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and I commend the \nOklahoma City Memorial Foundation for an excellent selection of the \nwinning design.\n  In addition to designating the memorial site as a unit of the \nNational Park Service, this bill also establishes a wholly owned \nGovernment corporation to be known as the Oklahoma City National \nMemorial Trust. The trust, in cooperation with the National Park \nService, will be charged with administering the operation, maintenance, \nmanagement and interpretation of the memorial site.\n  Further, the legislation authorizes a one-time $5 million Federal \ndonation for construction and maintenance of the memorial. I commend \nthe hard work of my colleagues, Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, for \ntheir help in securing a $5 million Federal appropriation in this \nyear's appropriations bill. The $5 million Federal commitment will be \nmatched by $5 million from the Oklahoma State Legislature and $14 \nmillion in private donations.\n  While the thousands of family members and friends of those killed in \nthe bombing will forever bear scars of having their loved ones taken \naway, the Oklahoma City National Memorial will revere the memory of the \nsurvivors and those lost and venerate the bonds that drew us all closer \ntogether as a result.\n  Mr. President, while it is impossible to recognize everyone whose \nhard work and effort made this memorial possible, I submit for the \nRecord a list of individuals who formed the core of the Memorial Design \nFoundation. In addition, I would commend and extend particular \nappreciation to Gov. Frank Keating; his wife, Kathy Keating; Oklahoma \nCity mayor Ron Norick; Mr. Bob Johnson, director of the Oklahoma City \nMemorial Foundation, charged with selecting the design for the \nmemorial; vice chairman Karen Luke; Mr. Tom McDaniel; Mr. Zach Taylor; \nMr. Bud Welch; Oklahoma City Fire Chief Gary Marrs; Mrs. Polly Nichols; \nMr. Don Ferrell; Mr. Don Rogers; Mr. Richard Williams; and all others \nwho worked hard to make this memorial possible. Our country is, indeed, \nproud of you, and I am very confident that our country will be proud of \nthe Oklahoma City National Memorial.\n  I also compliment and thank my colleague, Representative Frank Lucas, \nfor his leadership in passing this in the House of Representatives, as \nwell as my colleague, Jim Inhofe, who worked with me in putting this \nlegislation together.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the Oklahoma \nCity Memorial Board of Directors be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               Oklahoma City Memorial Board of Directors\n\n       Ann Alspaugh, Anita Arnold, Clark Bailey, Dr. Edward \n     Brandt, Ron Bradshaw, Terry Childers, John Cole, Richard \n     Denman, Tiana Douglas, Jeanette Gamba, Gerald L.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has seen fit \nto pass the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997 (S. 871). I \nbelieve this was an important piece of legislation and one deserving \nimmediate enactment. Once again, I would like to thank my colleague, \nSenator Nickles, for being the originating and driving force behind \nthis piece of legislation in the Senate and Representative Lucas for \nshepherding through similar legislation in the House.\n  Earlier, when we considered this bill, we were given the opportunity \nand the responsibility of remembering a unique group of American \nheroes. To most, these individuals are nameless, faceless victims of a \nsavage terrorist attack. However, to friends and family of the victims \nthey are remembered as far more. They are remembered as husbands, \nwives, and children. It was important for the rest of us to recognize \nthe lives of these men, women, and children in their proper context.\n  The 168 individuals who were killed during this cowardly attack, as \nwell as those who were fortunate to survive, deserve our honor and \nutmost respect. It is fitting that the memorial was designed to honor \nthem both in an appropriate and visible way. The victims of the bombing \nrepresent the true backbone of America. Their lives serve as a\n\n[[Page S9914]]\n\ntestament to what this country is, what it can be, and what will be. As \nheroes, they will be honored. As individuals, they will be missed, \nmourned, and remembered as the true embodiment of our great American \nspirit.\n  In addition to the immediate victims of the bombing, we have also \nrecognized the law enforcement officials, the emergency rescue \npersonnel, and the countless volunteers who rushed to our aid in our \nmoment of crisis. The proposed memorial's acknowledgment of not only \nthe victims, but the others involved in the rescue process, was \nartfully done to remind all of us that we are part of a nation that \ncares and responds to those in need.\n  The establishment of the memorial is not only appropriate but an \nimportant tool for teaching future generations of Americans what we are \nall about--coming together. It is also a reminder to us that the price \nof our freedom is eternal vigilance against those who would rob us of \nour sense of security through acts of terrorism.\n  Throughout the entire legislative process, I was pleased to note the \nextent of involvement by the survivors and the families of those who \ntragically lost their lives, as well as the larger community. This type \nof cooperation is not only indicative of how Oklahomans get things \ndone, but will result in a Memorial that is aesthetically designed and \ntruly meaningful to all those who will visit the site for generations \nto come.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues for recognizing the \nimportance of this legislation and giving it their immediate attention. \nWe can all be proud we will now have a suitable memorial to honor the \nlives of the men, women, and children killed in the bombing.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator withhold for a moment?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Excuse me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold. The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to make sure we have taken \nfinal action on S. 871.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have taken final action.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from North Carolina for his \npatience, as well as my colleague from Indiana for setting aside some \ntime to pass this legislation. This is very important legislation to \nthe people of Oklahoma and I think to our country as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

Mr. President, I wanted to come to the Senate \nfloor this morning and talk about a development in Russia that is of \nconcern to this body because of the action we took earlier this summer.\n  Earlier in the year the Russian Duma passed a law which would \nreintegrate a Stalinist system when it comes to freedom of conscience, \nfreedom of religion. Four religions: Judaism, Buddhism, the Russian \nOrthodox Church, and Islam were identified as sanctioned by the Russian \nFederation, but left out all Protestant religions, the Catholic \nreligion, and any other minority faith that is currently operating \nthere according to international treaty and according to Russian law, \nprevious Russian law and the Russian Constitution.\n  These new groups would be treated in minority fashion, in that they \ncould not own property, they could not operate schools, have \nmissionaries there, publish Bibles or distribute them or employ people. \nThey would be required to get rid of bank accounts and to register with \nthe state. What I am describing is a huge setback for Russia, back into \nStalinist times. And so, this body took very courageous action. It \nvoted 95 to 4 to withhold foreign aid to Russia, should this be \nenacted. I was delighted after we did that, that President Boris \nYeltsin was good to his word and vetoed that legislation. After that, \nhowever, he participated in a compromise bill, which an honest reading \nwould tell a person is of no difference.\n  The upper house of the Duma, yesterday, passed compromise \nlegislation. The President is expected to sign it, and unfortunately, \nthe worst things that could happen to religion in Russia could still \nhappen. There is reason to believe that the Russian Government will \nimplement this law differently than it is actually written. It is for \nthis reason that I have worked with Senator Mitch McConnell, and other \nmembers of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, to modify our bill in a \nsmall, but significant way. The word ``enact'' will be changed in \nconference to ``implement'' in order to give the Russian leaders some \nlatitude in interpreting this legislation. The foreign operations bill \nlanguage will now allow the Russian Government 6 months to enact the \nnew legislation in a manner that will not discriminate against minority \nreligions before a decision is made to withhold foreign aid.\n\n  I come to the floor today to plead with my colleagues to support this \nlanguage. I would tell you that the people we represent would not be \namused by our inaction or our unwillingness to do something. This isn't \nabout trade, this isn't about freedom of contract, this is about taking \ntax dollars from the American people and giving them to a government \nthat is reimposing Stalinist restrictions. Imagine going to a townhall \nin your State, or mine in Oregon, and talking to Catholics who are \nwatching the spectacle of their church being removed from Russia--and \nthen trying to explain why Russia should get American tax dollars as \nforeign aid.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. I thank my colleague again from \nIndiana. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9914-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9914-S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1156, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1156) making appropriations for the government \n     of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \n     in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Coats amendment No. 1249, to provide scholarship assistance \n     for District of Columbia elementary and secondary school \n     students.\n       Wyden amendment No. 1250, to establish that it is the \n     standing order of the Senate that a Senator who objects to a \n     motion or matter shall disclose the objection in the \n     Congressional Record.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1249\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of amendment No. 1249 with the time until \n5 p.m. equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we will now for about the next 5 hours be \ndiscussing an issue that I believe is important to every Member of the \nU.S. Senate and important to this country and important to the future \nof education.\n  The amendment is titled the ``District of Columbia Student \nOpportunity Scholarship'' amendment. It is being offered by myself and \nSenator Lieberman from Connecticut. We will be presenting the case for \nthis amendment to our colleagues who we trust they will be listening \ncarefully to what is said, and I think the important debate that will \nensue as a result of our offering this amendment.\n  The amendment is fairly basic. It provides opportunity scholarships \nfor children in grades K through 12 for District of Columbia residents \nwhose family incomes are below 185 percent of the\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\npoverty level. Scholarships may be used to pay tuition costs at a \npublic or private school in the District of Columbia and in adjacent \ncounties in Maryland and Virginia.\n  Scholarships are also available under this amendment for tutoring \nassistance for students who attend public schools within the District.\n  We establish a District of Columbia scholarship corporation that will \ndetermine how the money is distributed.\n  Student eligibility goes to those, as I said, whose family incomes \nare 185 percent or below of the poverty line. For those at or below the \npoverty line, these scholarships can total $3,200. For those who are \nbetween the poverty line and 185 percent of that, they can receive the \nlesser of 75 percent of the cost of tuition and monetary funds and \ntransportation to attend an eligible institution of up to $2,400. The \ntuition scholarship is also available for tutoring in amounts up to \n$500 for students who stay in D.C. public schools.\n  The election process is designed to not discriminate in any way. All \neligible applicants will be considered. If there are more applicants \nthan scholarships available selection will be on a random basis.\n  The funding in no way takes one penny out of funds available for D.C. \npublic schools. In fact, the $7 million in spending for fiscal year \n1998 comes out of the Federal contribution to the District of Columbia \nthat is earmarked for deficit reduction. That total contribution--$30 \nmillion more than the President requested--we will deduct $7 million \nout of that. So no, the District is not denied any funds, schools are \nnot denied any funds. This is taken out of a fund that was added by \nCongress in addition to the President's budget.\n  Mr. President, there is one unavoidable fact at the center of the \nschool choice debate. When education collapses, it is generally not the \nmiddle-class children who suffer the most. Their parents, in response \nto that collapse, have already chosen other private schools, other \npublic schools or moved to the suburbs or away from that particular \nschool, leaving only the low-income, often minority children, in these \ndysfunctional, often drug- and crime-infested institutions, with little \npretense of learning or educational opportunity.\n  We have seen this happen in large cities across our country--in \nPhiladelphia, New York, Detroit, and others. We have seen it happen \naround us. Every day as we meet here in the Capitol, every day \nsurrounding us in the District of Columbia, our Capital City, we see \nthis happening with tragic results.\n  The D.C. public school system spends more money per pupil than any \nother district in America. I am going to be repeating that phrase. The \nDistrict of Columbia public school system spends more money per pupil \nthan any other school district in America.\n  In 1996, 12 percent of the classrooms in the District of Columbia did \nnot have textbooks at the beginning of the year and 20 percent lacked \nadequate supplies. The D.C. public school system spends more money per \npupil than any other district in America, and yet 65 percent of all \nD.C. public schoolchildren test below their grade level. And 56 percent \nwho take the Armed Forces qualification test--one of the few ways out \nof poverty in America for low-income students--56 percent who take the \nArmed Forces qualification test fail.\n  The D.C. public school system spends more money per pupil than any \nother district in America, yet only about 50 percent of education \nspending--that money that is available in the District of Columbia--\ngoes toward instruction.\n  The system has 1 administrator for every 16 teachers while the \nnational average is 1 administrator for every 42 teachers. That fact \nalone gives us an explanation as to one of the primary reasons for the \nfailure of D.C. students, mostly minority students, to learn in the \nD.C. school system--a bureaucracy which consumes an extraordinary \namount of money, over 50 percent of education funding in the District.\n  The D.C. public school system spends more money per pupil than any \nother district in America, and two-thirds of the teachers report that \nviolent student behavior is a serious obstacle to teaching. And 16 \npercent of students report carrying a weapon to school. Over 1 in 10 \navoid school because they fear for their safety.\n  It is safe to say, Mr. President, that if these results were found in \nsuburban schools, the education reform movement would more closely \nresemble the French Revolution. But because these children are \npowerless and distant from our experience, because of the color of \ntheir skin and the size of their parents' bank accounts, we seem \ncontent to debate and delay help for those students.\n  We are content to promise reforms that never arrive. There is a price \nfor our patience, a cost to our inertia, measured in squandered \npotential and stolen hope, measured by the advance of rage or retreat \ninto apathy.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to offer a UC that I \nomitted to offer earlier. I ask unanimous consent that Brent Orrell, my \nlegislative director, who has been very instrumental in putting all \nthis together be granted floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Gen. Julius Becton has been charged with \nreforming education in the District. He deserves our support. But by \nhis own estimates, it will take 5 or 10 years to test his approaches. \nSimilar changes have been promised by five new superintendents in the \nlast 15 years.\n  I suspect that many District parents are skeptical. I believe they \nhave every right to be. Put yourself for a moment into their shoes. \nWhat good does it do a parent who fears for the current safety and \nfuture prospects of their 13-year-old child to wait 10 more years for \nthe results of public school reform? By admitting that public school \nreform in the District will be accomplished in decades, we are saying \nthat the sacrifice of a generation of students is unavoidable.\n  But what if that child were our child? What if that child was the \nchild or the grandchild of a Member of this body who was assigned to a \nschool where physical attacks and robberies and drug sales are rampant, \nwhere education is failing, where the one opportunity they have to \nescape the poverty that they are living in, a decent education, is \nunavailable to them? Would we be content to sit back and let the \nbureaucrats tell us it will take a decade to reform these schools? \nWould those of us who have a 10- or 12- or 13-year-old be content for \none moment to allow that situation to exist if there was anything we \ncould do about it?\n  We are asking poor inner-city children and their parents to tolerate \ncircumstances for years that most middle-class and affluent Americans \nwould not tolerate for a moment. And we expect them to be satisfied and \ngratified with tinkering changes and symbolic votes on funding which \nhave shown no history of results at all--nothing but failure, endlessly \nrepeated, mindlessly accepted.\n\n  This city should be ashamed of its incompetence. And we in Congress \nshould be ashamed of our failure to deliver some hope, some measure of \nimprovement for these children. This is not an issue of whether or not \nlocal or State governments have a right to control education.\n  We in the Federal Government have the responsibility for this Federal \ncity. We have a responsibility for the conduct of affairs in this city \nand in particular for the educational system in this city. That \neducational system has failed. It is time we offered some remedies.\n  With this bill we have set out to turn this justified embarrassment \nand shame into something productive, something immediately helpful, \nsomething hopeful, not something 10 years down the line, but something \nthat can be hopeful immediately to children caught in this tragic \nsituation.\n  The argument in favor of low-income school choice comes down to a \nsingle question which I hope every Member of this body will seriously \nponder. Is it just, is it fair, is it compassionate to insist on the \ncoercive assignment of poor children to failed schools?\n  It is a question which answers itself. No, it is not just, it is not \nfair, it is not compassionate, if there are alternatives that work, \nthat can provide hope to these students, that can provide opportunity \nfor these students to escape the failed education system that they \ncurrently are forced to comply with, alternatives that teach care and \ndiscipline.\n  Right now in the District of Columbia these alternatives exist but \nthey\n\n[[Page S9916]]\n\nare rationed by cost, distributed by wealth. And that is not just, that \nis not fair, and that is not compassionate. Yet we can do something \nabout it, at least in the District for at least some of the District's \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I am entirely confident about two things in this \ndebate, two facts that I think are beyond dispute. First of all, the \nchildren of our cities, even from broken homes in desolate \nneighborhoods, are capable of educational achievement. This should not \nbe necessary to say because it is obvious to so many of us, but it is \nnot obvious to the educational establishment.\n  The educational establishment argues exactly the opposite. They claim \nthat schools fail because parents and students are failures themselves, \ncomplicating the work of educators with personal problems. I am sure \nyou have heard this excuse that the jobs of teachers are impossible \nbecause families and communities refuse to help.\n  But, Mr. President, we know this is not true. We know that \ndisadvantaged children are not educational failures by birth or \ncircumstance or destiny. We know this as a matter of hard social \nscience. We know this because of the success of nonpublic schools, \nprimarily Catholic schools, that admit the same pool of urban students.\n  The late James Coleman of the University of Chicago found lower \ndropout rates and higher test scores among disadvantaged Catholic \nschool students than their public school peers. William Evans and \nRobert Schwab, of the University of Maryland, came to similar \nconclusions, recording disproportionate gains by disadvantaged kids in \nCatholic schools. Other studies reveal that Catholic schools are more \nracially integrated than their public counterparts and succeed at about \nhalf the cost.\n\n  I want to repeat, studies have indicated that the Catholic schools \nare more racially integrated than urban public schools and they succeed \nwhere public schools fail, at half the cost of public schools.\n  These efforts succeed--with the same group of at-risk children--\nbecause Catholic education begins with an entirely different premise \nthan the educational establishment: that every student can succeed if \nproperly guided, and that 8 hours a day is a significant, even \ndecisive, intervention in a child's life. This is not skimming. This is \nnot creaming. This is faith and tenacity.\n  I pointed to Catholic urban schools because they have done such a \nremarkable job in our inner cities. There are other non-Catholic but \nreligious schools and private schools that are secular schools that \nhave demonstrated an ability to take the same students from the same \nareas, at half the cost or less, and do a better job in preparing those \nstudents for educational opportunities for the future or for employment \nopportunities for the future--an astoundingly better job.\n  So this argument that what can you do with these kids, ``After all, \nlook at the families they are from, look at the disadvantages that they \nhave, there is nothing that we can do except provide some kind of a \nbaby-sitting service during daylight hours,'' that is untrue. We have \nside by side with these failing public schools in our urban areas, side \nby side, schools that are accomplishing success and not reaping \nfailure, that are taking the same students and providing that success \nat less than half the cost of our public schools.\n  The second fact I am sure about is that low-income, inner city \nparents support school choice in growing and overwhelming numbers--75 \npercent in Philadelphia, 95 percent in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee and \nCleveland school choice programs, the only ones of their kind, were not \nstarted by Republicans. They were started by parents fed up with their \nschools that their children were compelled to attend. They were \nsponsored and supported by an emerging element of African American \nleadership. Councilwoman Fannie Lewis of Cleveland, Annette ``Polly'' \nWilliams of Milwaukee, Anyam Palmer of Los Angeles, State \nRepresentative Glenn Lewis of Ft. Worth, State Representative Dwight \nEvans of Philadelphia--these are not black Republican conservatives; \nthey are activist Democrats who view school choice as a matter of \nequity. They are men and women who have come to resent a nanny state in \nwhich the nanny has grown surly and arrogant and abusive and \nunresponsive.\n  Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King, Jr., in this Capitol just 2 \nweeks ago, referred to school choice as a matter of civil rights. She \nsays:\n\n       In the name of civil rights, some oppose relief for \n     religious parents who want their children to attend a \n     religious school. In the name of helping poor and minority \n     children, opponents of ``opportunity scholarships'' want to \n     continue business as usual in the Washington schools. . . . \n     U.S. citizenship guarantees all parents an education for \n     their children. This is a true civil right. Yet some children \n     receive a better education than others, due to their parents' \n     abilities to pay for benefits that are often missing in \n     public schools. This inequity is a violation of the civil \n     rights of the parents and children who are so afflicted by \n     lack of income and by the mismanagement endemic to so many of \n     the country's public school systems.\n\n  Ms. King concludes:\n\n       The District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship \n     Act was designed specifically to alleviate this inequality--\n     to restore parents' and children's civil rights.\n\n  To Alveda King and to many African-Americans today, this is a civil \nright, the opportunity for equality of opportunity in the education of \ntheir children.\n\n  In July of this year, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, on \nwhich I proudly serve, held a hearing on the school choice issue. It \nwas particularly instructive. One witness was Howard Fuller, former \nsuperintendent of Milwaukee public schools--former superintendent of \nMilwaukee public schools, an outside-the-box thinker on education. He \nbegan by asking a fundamental question: What makes a school public? \nThis is the answer he gave:\n\n       What makes a school public is that it functions in the \n     public interest.\n\n  That interest involves high standards, consistently met--not the \nprovision of services by one group or another. The public interest is \nto ensure that this happens, through whatever mix of public policies \nwhich make it happen.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Although there must continue to be strong support for \n     public education, it is, in the final analysis, not the \n     system that is important; it is the students and their \n     families who must be primary. We must ask the question, what \n     is the best interests of the children, not in the best \n     interests of the system. And in my professional opinion, the \n     interests of poor students are best served if they are truly \n     given choice which permits them to pursue a variety of \n     successful options, public and private.\n\n  Fuller testified that the most basic problem with the current system \nis a structure of power relationships that leads to inertia:\n\n       If you do not somehow change the existing power \n     relationships, the existing configurations, no matter how \n     deeply you might feel about making change, it is not going to \n     occur, because the dynamics of the system are a curb to the \n     kind of change you want to make. If you leave it intact, and \n     you operate under its current form, we are not going to make \n     the difference that we want to make for all of the children. \n     But this need not be the end of public education.\n\n  I want to repeat that for my colleagues, the former superintendent of \nthe Milwaukee Public School System, who is talking about the need to \nchange the structure of public education so that it truly can begin the \nreal process of reform, this man says that it need not mean the end of \nthe public school system.\n  Opponents of this opportunity scholarship program say, ``You really \nwant to do away with the public school system.'' Not at all. We \nabsolutely need a public school system in this country to begin to \ntouch and educate the millions of children who live in this country, \nbut we need a system that will provide them with equal opportunities \nfor education, and they are not getting that now, particularly in many \nurban areas, and particularly among our minority children.\n  As Howard Fuller says:\n\n       This need not be the end of public education. It is \n     redefining what is a public educational system in 1997--not \n     what it was in 1960, but what it should look like in 1997, \n     1998, the year 2000--[and beyond].\n\n  This shift in power and philosophy that Dr. Fuller describes involves \na mix of approaches: strengthened public schools, low-income \nscholarships and charter schools. I am a supporter of all of those \nthings. They are not mutually exclusive. Senator Lieberman and I are \nnot here today to say undo the public system and replace it with \nchoice. We are saying we support a mix of things. They are not mutually \nexclusive. In fact, they are necessary to one another.\n\n[[Page S9917]]\n\n  Dr. Fuller concludes:\n\n       I think you have to have a series of options for parents. I \n     support charter schools. I support site-based management. I \n     support anything that changes the options for parents. But I \n     am here to say that if one of those options is not choice \n     that gives poor parents a way to leave, the kind of pressure \n     that you need internally is simply not going to occur.\n\n  Dr. Fuller, who supports a range of choice for parents, says if one \nof those options is not choice then poor parents have no way to leave \nthe system and apply the kind of pressure that has to be applied \ninternally if any major change is going to occur.\n\n  His points were buttressed by several inner-city parents who \ntelephoned. Listen to Pam Ballard of Cleveland:\n\n       After being in the Cleveland public schools and having a \n     child who attended Cleveland public schools, my daughter was \n     listed a behavior problem. She was listed a ``D'' or ``F'' \n     student in all subjects. She did not want to go to school. \n     She had no interest in school. The students would hit her, \n     kick her, mistreat her.\n\n  But Pam Ballard got a scholarship for her child at Hope Central \nAcademy:\n\n       It made a difference. I see that difference every time I \n     watch my daughters at play, studying, reading, learning. . . \n     Please keep the scholarship and tutoring programs alive. It \n     is a beginning, and we all need new beginnings. It has helped \n     keep me and my daughters alive.\n\n  Listen to Barbara Lewis from Indianapolis, who got similar help for \nher child:\n\n       My son began to struggle in school. He was not getting the \n     attention he needed. At no time did a teacher ever try to set \n     up a parent-teacher conference to see what we could come up \n     with to help my child. I requested extra credit work, and I \n     tried to set up meetings with the teacher, to no avail. I \n     began to lose hope. I felt that my child's gifts were being \n     wasted.\n\n  Then an individual provided Ms. Lewis with a scholarship that the \nIndiana State Legislature failed to provide:\n\n       The values I was teaching him at home were finally \n     reinforced at school. My son blossomed into an honor roll \n     student, a student council leader, and a football standout.\n       School choice is not a new issue. People of financial means \n     have always had this choice of where they would send their \n     children, to what school. They could afford to move where \n     they wanted, and they could afford the tuition for private \n     schools, while lower-income families with the same hopes and \n     dreams for their children and their children's futures are \n     denied the choice, and they should not be.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the Senate will listen to these \nquiet voices rather than the strident voices of the education unions--\nvoices of hyperbole and hypocrisy. The hyperbole comes in the \naccusation that we are destroying public education in the District with \nthis measure. On the contrary, we are not even touching it. These \nscholarships are not deducted from District education funds. They \nrepresent entirely new money. The only challenge to public education in \nthe District that they provide is the challenge of example--the example \nof at-risk students succeeding and private and religious schools where \nthey have not succeed in public schools.\n  The hypocrisy is equally clear. While education unions oppose school \nchoice, many inner-city public school teachers send their children to \nschools other than those which they teach. They are, in fact, two to \nthree times more likely than other parents to send their children to \nprivate schools. In Milwaukee and Cleveland, for example, more than 50 \npercent of public school teachers send their own children to private \nschools. In the District, that figure is 28 percent, still twice the \nnational average. I don't blame them. They are doing what is in the \nbest interests of their own child. But I do blame education unions for \nactively denying that choice to others. The hypocrisy of the \neducational unions and the hypocrisy of those who say we must maintain \nthe public school system and not allow opportunities for low-income \npeople when they, themselves, send their children away from the public \nschools that they teach in so that they can get a better education at a \nprivate school.\n  We are not talking about sending children to St. Alban's or Sidwell-\nFriends. We are talking about sending young, fragile kids to schools \nwith a little order, a little sanity, a little discipline, a little \nindividual attention, a little love--schools like St. Thomas More in \nAnacostia, or the Nanny Hellen Burroughs School in Northeast, islands \nof nurture and learning.\n\n  I visited those schools. Senator Lieberman and I have taken the \nopportunity to visit those schools. What a remarkable, remarkable \ndifference at a fraction of the cost of the public schools. We cannot \neven begin to imagine the fears of a mother in the District who is \nforced to send her child through barbed wire and metal detectors, into \na combat zone masquerading as an education institution. If we do not \ntake the side of that mother with immediate, practical help, we will \nbetray her yet again. I, for one, intend to take the side of these \nparents without hesitation or without apology and without delay. I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very important debate. Yesterday \nwhen we opened debate on the D.C. appropriations, I urged colleagues on \nboth sides not to come forward with controversial amendments because I \nfeel, particularly in light of the situation in the District of \nColumbia, we need to move on with this bill. But such is not the case \nand every Senator has every right to bring an issue to the floor at any \ntime, and that is what has happened here. We do have a long, extensive \ndebate on the issue of vouchers.\n  Mr. President, as I said yesterday, I don't think this is about \nanything but our children. I don't think it is about strong voices. I \ndon't think it is about quiet voices.\n  I don't think it is about passionate voices. I think it is about our \nchildren. How can we help our children? I think there is complete \nagreement that one way to help our children is to make sure they have \nthe best education in the world. I don't think that is the question. So \nwhat I think it is about is not about us, it is about the children. It \nis about how we help them get the best education possible. As someone \nwho believes in a free public education, as someone who attended public \nschools all the way from kindergarten to college, and as someone who \nsent my children to public schools, and as someone who represents a \nState that has rejected private school vouchers with taxpayer funds \ntwice overwhelmingly, I think I stand here with some credibility on the \nsubject.\n  It really amazes me, in a year when the District of Columbia students \nstarted their school year late because many of their school buildings \nwere not safe, that we are voting on amendments that essentially gives \nmoney to private schools. What I said yesterday when I alluded to this \namendment is that it would be very hard for many of us to support an \namendment that helps 3 percent of the students--or purports to help 3 \npercent of the students, while leaving 97 percent without any \nadditional help.\n  I want to make the point with a chart that I am going to just leave \nup here. I think that what we need is a 100-percent solution, which is \nquality public schools for all the children. That is what we need. As I \ngo around my State, I have an ``Excellence in Education'' award that I \ngive out to parents, to teachers, to principals, to business leaders, \nwho are all helping get to quality public schools for all. Yes, we have \nproblem public schools in our State. We also have some great public \nschools in our State. I think what we need to do, rather than give \nmoney to the private schools when we know we don't have extra funding, \nis to ensure that we taxpayers don't divert the money into private \nschools, but instead, make sure that it is diverted where it belongs, \nto all the children. So we are faced here with private school vouchers \nfor a few--for 3 percent, a couple thousand of the kids in the District \nof Columbia while there are 78,000 who absolutely are going to lose by \nthis. And so I hope people will support the 100 percent solution that \nmany of us are supporting, rather than a 3-percent solution.\n  Now, what do I mean by a 100-percent solution? I mean that we should \ndo things that help all of our children. What are some of those things? \nWe know that our colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, has pointed \nout that many of our schools are crumbling, that there are serious \nproblems with them. It certainly was brought home not only here in the \nDistrict of Columbia, but in other parts of the country, as other \nschools also opened late because they were dealing with\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\nthese repairs. So here we go, some want to give $7 million--$7 \nmillion--to private schools. By the way, allowing a lot off the top for \nadministration--and I will get into that--and that whole new \nbureaucracy that is set up in this amendment is extraordinary. I am \ngoing to read you the amendment, about the bureaucracy it sets up. The \nschools need help in terms of the facilities. We could have mentoring \nprograms for these children, academic assistance, bringing in the \nbusiness community, recreational activities, technology training. As \nthe President has said, every child should know how to log onto a \ncomputer in our schools.\n  There are other viable school activities, drug, alcohol and gang \nprevention, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills \npreparation. Mr. President, if you look at the rate of crime committed \nby juveniles, it would amaze you to see the spike-up between the hours \nof 3 and 6 p.m. It seems to me that since we do have a great desire \nhere to help the kids of the District of Columbia, we ought to be \nhelping all of them from a menu of things that we could do for the $7 \nmillion that, if this amendment passes, will be diverted away from all \nthe children.\n  Now, I want to point out that, under this amendment, the District of \nColumbia would be used as a guinea pig. It is a scheme that many States \nhave rejected. I talked about my own State of California. Recent \nvoucher proposals in Washington State and Colorado and California have \nlost by over 2-to-1 margins. A recent Gallup poll said that 71 percent \nof Americans believe the focus of improvement efforts should be on \nreforming the existing public school system rather than on finding an \nalternative system. Congress should not enact what the American people \nreject.\n\n  Funds should not go to private schools when the District of Columbia \nhas such stark needs. Their needs are $2.1 billion to repair the \nschools, and 41 percent don't have enough power outlets and electrical \nwiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. So we are \ntaking $7 million and giving it to the private schools, many of which \nhave endowments. And 66 percent of D.C. schools have inadequate \nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning. So we are taking 3 percent \nof the kids out of there and leaving 97 percent of the kids in a \nsituation where they don't even have basic heating and air \nconditioning. Public dollars should not be routed to private schools \nbefore public school students in the District of Columbia get what they \nneed.\n  Now, I want to point this out because the Senator from Indiana quoted \na number of people from the District of Columbia and called them the \n``quiet voices.'' Let me add to some of the voices from a press \nconference that was held on September 17, with 11 ministers and the \nD.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton. Representative Eleanor Holmes \nNorton, who worked so very hard on this underlying bill, so very hard \nwith Republicans and Democrats alike, talks about this proposal that \nwould divert $7 million to private schools and leave 97 percent of the \nkids without any improvement. She says: ``Virtually the entire city is \nspeaking out against vouchers. The voucher movement is trying to use \nthe children of the District of Columbia as stepping-stones. We know \nwhat we want, and it's not vouchers. Hear the people: We can't waste \nmoney in this District.''\n  The Reverend Graylan Ellis-Hagler from the Plymouth Congregational \nUCC Church says: ``[Sterling] Tucker's letter sent to D.C. clergy was \ndeceptive at best--it never even used the word 'voucher'. The voice of \nthe people has been ignored. We are having vouchers rammed down our \nthroats.''\n  The Reverend Vernor Clay, Lincoln United Methodist Church: ``We have \nvoted down vouchers in the past. Our voice will not be undermined. Put \nmoney into the infrastructure of our schools if you're going to put it \nanywhere. [Put it] into our public students.'' He said, ``I'm ashamed I \nsigned my name to Tucker's letter. I was misled my him and his hired \nlobbyist.''\n  Reverend Dr. Earl Trent from the Florida Avenue Baptist Church: ``I \nam outraged that Congress has stepped on our rights. We want nothing to \ndo with vouchers. It is going to harm a majority of our schools. Let \nthe Congressmen try vouchers in their own States.''\n  Well, of course, in my State, it was voted down twice.\n  Rev. Anthony Moore, Carolina Missionary Baptist Church: ``We all [the \nministers] stand united against vouchers. If you want to help our \nschools, give them money for repairs and supplies, not foolish \nprograms.''\n  Rev. Willie Wilson, Union Temple Baptist Church: ``This has been a \nvery undemocratic process. The Government should be by and for the \npeople. As a community, we voted vouchers out, but now they're being \nforced on us. I was lied to by Rep. Tucker and his lobbyist. The letter \nwas designed to rob the District of Columbia.''\n  Rev. Jennifer Knutson, Foundry United Methodist Church: ``Vouchers \nare not the answer. Public money should be spent on our public \nschools.''\n  So here are some religious voices that are speaking out pretty \nunified. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who is a tremendous representative of \nthe people here and works so hard on these bills, is adamant on this \npoint because she represents all the children, not just 3 percent of \nthe children. She doesn't want a 3 percent solution, she wants a 100 \npercent solution. It is such an abandonment of the children to go this \nroute. That is why voters in California, which is on the cutting edge \nof change, rejected this idea. We should not give up on our children.\n\n  Now, here is an interesting point. The Senator from Indiana has very \neloquent, heartfelt remarks and, believe me, I greatly respect them. He \ntalked a lot about the bureaucracy of the D.C. schools. He took \nprobably several moments of his introduction to go after them. I don't \ndefend any bureaucracy. I never have and I never will. But I have to \ntell you, he talked about the ``nanny'' State. If ever there was an \nexample of bureaucracy, it is the way this program is going to be \nadministered. I am not going to put my own spin on it, I say to my \ncolleagues, I am going to read the bill. I am going to read the bill, \nstarting on page 7 and ending--I have to get the right page number \nhere--on page 34. That is how long it takes to explain how this thing \nis going to work.\n\n     DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SCHOLARSHIP CORPORATION.\n\n       General requirements.--\n\n  This is the bill, folks, this is the amendment we are being asked to \nvote on that will address 3 percent of the kids. This is the \nbureaucracy that is going to address a couple of thousand kids. This is \nthe bureaucracy that is going to be created that is political when you \nhear how the appointments are made. It sticks politics right in the \nmiddle of these children. This is the bureaucracy that is the answer to \nwhat my colleague calls the ``nanny State.''\n  Let me read it to you:\n\n       There is authorized to be established a private, nonprofit \n     corporation, to be known as the ``District of Columbia \n     Scholarship Corporation,'' which is neither an agency nor \n     establishment of the United States Government or the District \n     of Columbia government.\n       (2) Duties.--The Corporation shall have the responsibility \n     and authority to administer, publicize, and evaluate the \n     scholarship program in accordance with this title, and to \n     determine student and school eligibility for participation in \n     such program.\n       (3) Consultation.--The Corporation shall exercise its \n     authority--\n       (A) in a manner consistent with maximizing educational \n     opportunities for the maximum number of interested families; \n     and\n       (B) in consultation with the District of Columbia Board of \n     Education or entity exercising administrative jurisdiction \n     over the District of Columbia Public Schools, the \n     Superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools, \n     and other school scholarship programs in the District of \n     Columbia.\n       (4) Application of provisions.--The Corporation shall be \n     subject to the provisions of this title, and, to the extent \n     consistent with this title, to the District of Columbia \n     Nonprofit Corporation Act (D.C. Code, sec. 29-501 et seq.).\n       (5) Residence.--The Corporation shall have its place of \n     business in the District of Columbia and shall be considered, \n     for purposes of venue in civil actions, to be a resident of \n     the District of Columbia.\n       (6) Fund.--There is established in the Treasury a fund that \n     shall be known as the District of Columbia Scholarship Fund, \n     to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n       (7) Disbursement.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall make \n     available and disburse to the Corporation, before October 15 \n     of each fiscal year or not later than 15 days after the date \n     of enactment of an Act making appropriations for the District \n     of Columbia for such year, whichever occurs later, such funds \n     as have been appropriated to the District of Columbia \n     Scholarship Fund for the fiscal year in which such \n     disbursement is made.\n       (8) Availability.--Funds authorized to be appropriated \n     under this title shall remain available until expended.\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\n       (9) Uses.--Funds authorized to be appropriated under this \n     title shall be used by the Corporation in a prudent and \n     financially responsible manner, solely for scholarships, \n     contracts, and administrative costs.\n       (10) Authorization.--\n       (A) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the District of Columbia Scholarship Fund--\n       (i) $7,000,000 for fiscal year 1998;\n       (ii) $8,000,000 for fiscal year 1999; and\n       (iii) $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2000 through \n     2002.\n       (B) Limitation.--Not more than 7.5 percent of the amount \n     appropriated to carry out this title for any fiscal year may \n     be used by the Corporation for salaries and administrative \n     costs.\n       (b) Organization and Management; Board of Directors.--\n       (1) Board of directors; membership.--\n       (A) In general.--The Corporation shall have a Board of \n     Directors (referred to in this title as the ``Board''), \n     comprised of 7 members with 6 members of the Board appointed \n     by the President not later than 30 days after receipt of \n     nominations from the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the Majority Leader of the Senate.\n\n  So Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott will recommend these to the \nPresident.\n\n       (B) House nominations.--The President shall appoint 3 of \n     the members from a list of 9 individuals nominated by the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives in consultation with \n     the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\n       (C) Senate nominations.--The President shall appoint 3 \n     members from a list of 9 individuals nominated by the \n     Majority Leader of the Senate in consultation with the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate.\n       (D) Deadline.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and Majority Leader of the Senate shall submit their \n     nominations to the President not later than 30 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (E) Appointee of mayor.--The Mayor shall appoint 1 member \n     of the Board not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (F) Possible interim members.--If the President does not \n     appoint the 6 members of the Board in the 30-day period \n     described in subparagraph (A), then the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the Senate \n     shall each appoint 2 members of the Board, and the Minority \n     Leader of the House of Representatives and the Minority \n     Leader of the Senate shall each appoint 1 member of the \n     Board, from among the individuals nominated pursuant to \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B), as the case may be. The appointees \n     under the preceding sentence together with the appointee of \n     the Mayor, shall serve as an interim Board with all the \n     powers and other duties of the Board described in this title, \n     until the President makes the appointments as described in \n     this subsection.\n       (2) Powers.--All powers of the Corporation shall vest in \n     and be exercised under the authority of the Board.\n       (3) Elections.--Members of the Board annually shall elect 1 \n     of the members of the Board to be the Chairperson of the \n     Board.\n       (4) Residency.--All members appointed to the Board shall be \n     residents of the District of Columbia at the time of \n     appointment and while serving on the Board.\n       (5) Nonemployee.--No member of the Board may be an employee \n     of the United States Government or the District of Columbia \n     Government when appointed to or during tenure on the Board, \n     unless the individual is on a leave of absence from such a \n     position while serving on the Board.\n\n  My colleagues know that this is not one of the most inspiring \nspeeches that I have ever made. But I think it is important that we \nread this entire amendment because it deals with setting up a whole \nother bureaucracy for 2,000 children in the District of Columbia--just \n3 percent of the children--and enables this bureaucracy to take 7.5 \npercent off the top of the $7 million. I think it is important that we \nsee what we are creating here.\n       (6) Incorporation.--The members of the initial Board shall \n     serve as incorporators and shall take whatever steps are \n     necessary to establish the Corporation under the District of \n     Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act (D.C. Code, sec. 29-501 et \n     seq.).\n       (7) General term.--The term of office of each member of the \n     Board shall be 5 years, except that any member appointed to \n     fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term \n     for which the predecessor was appointed shall be appointed \n     for the remainder of such term.\n       (8) Consecutive term.--No member of the Board shall be \n     eligible to serve in excess of 2 consecutive terms of 5 years \n     each. A partial term shall be considered as 1 full term. Any \n     vacancy on the Board shall not affect the Board's power, but \n     shall be filled in a manner consistent with this title.\n       (9) No benefit.--No part of the income or assets of the \n     Corporation shall inure to the benefit of any Director, \n     officer, or employee of the Corporation, except as salary or \n     reasonable compensation for services.\n       (10) Political activity.--The Corporation may not \n     contribute to or otherwise support any political party or \n     candidate for elective public office.\n       (11) No officers or employees.--The members of the Board \n     shall not, by reason of such membership, be considered to be \n     officers or employees of the United States Government or of \n     the District of Columbia Government.\n       (12) Stipends.--The members of the Board, while attending \n     meetings of the Board or while engaged in duties related to \n     such meetings or other activities of the Board pursuant to \n     this title, shall be provided a stipend. Such stipend shall \n     be at the rate of $150 per day for which the member of the \n     Board is officially recorded as having worked, except that no \n     member may be paid a total stipend amount in any calendar \n     year in excess of $5,000.\n       (c) Officers and Staff.--\n\n  So members of the board can be paid $5,000 and they are helping 3 \npercent of the kids in the District of Columbia.\n\n       (1) Executive Director.--The Corporation shall have an \n     Executive Director, and such other staff, as may be appointed \n     by the Board for terms and at rates of compensation, not to \n     exceed level EG-16 of the Educational Service of the District \n     of Columbia, to be fixed by the Board.\n       (2) Staff.--With the approval of the Board, the Executive \n     Director may appoint and fix the salary of such additional \n     personnel as the Executive Director considers appropriate.\n  So we have a board where members can have a stipend not to exceed \n$5,000. We have an executive director, and he or she can appoint and \nfix the salary of such additional personnel as the executive director \nconsiders appropriate, all to help 3 percent of the kids while 97 \npercent of the kids get no benefit from this.\n       (3) Annual rate.--No staff of the Corporation may be \n     compensated by the Corporation at an annual rate of pay \n     greater than the annual rate of pay of the Executive \n     Director.\n       (4) Service.--All officers and employees of the Corporation \n     shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.\n       (5) Qualification.--No political test or qualification may \n     be used in selecting, appointing, promoting, or taking other \n     personnel actions with respect to officers, agents, or \n     employees of the Corporation.\n       (d) Powers of the Corporation.--\n       (1) Generally.--The Corporation is authorized to obtain \n     grants from, and make contracts with, individuals and with \n     private, State, and Federal agencies, organizations, and \n     institutions.\n       (2) Hiring authority.--The Corporation may hire, or accept \n     the voluntary services of, consultants, experts, advisory \n     boards, and panels to aid the Corporation in carrying out \n     this title.\n       (e) Financial Management and Records.--\n       (1) Audits.--The financial statements of the Corporation \n     shall be--\n       (A) maintained in accordance with generally accepted \n     accounting principles for nonprofit corporations; and\n       (B) audited annually by independent certified public \n     accountants.\n       (2) Report.--The report for each such audit shall be \n     included in the annual report to Congress required by section \n       11(c).\n\n  We are only on page 16 and we have to go to page 32. But I think we \nare learning by reading this what a bureaucracy we are about to embark \nupon.\n\n       (f) Administrative Responsibilities.--\n       (1) Scholarship application schedule and procedures.--Not \n     later than 30 days after the initial Board is appointed and \n     the first Executive Director of the Corporation is hired \n     under this title, the Corporation shall implement a schedule \n     and procedures for processing applications for, and awarding, \n     student scholarships under this title. The schedule and \n     procedures shall include establishing a list of certified \n     eligible institutions, distributing scholarship information \n     to parents and the general public (including through a \n     newspaper of general circulation), and establishing deadlines \n     for steps in the scholarship application and award process.\n       (2) Institutional applications and eligibility.--\n       (A) In general.--An eligible institution that desires to \n     participate in the scholarship program under this title shall \n     file an application with the Corporation for certification \n     for participation in the scholarship program under this title \n     that shall--\n       (i) demonstrate that the eligible institution has operated \n     with not less than 25 students during the 3 years preceding \n     the year for which the determination is made unless the \n     eligible institution is applying for certification as a new \n     eligible institution under subparagraph (C);\n  So, if you hear that, schools can be created that have no track \nrecord and pop up and get this taxpayer dollar. There it is on page 17.\n  Two, contain insurance that the eligible institution will comply with \nall of the applicable requirements, three contain an annual statement \nof the eligible institutions budget, four, describe the eligible \ninstitutions proposed program including personnel qualifications and \nfees.\n\n       (ii) contain an assurance that the eligible institution \n     will comply with all applicable requirements of this title;\n       (iii) contain an annual statement of the eligible \n     institution's budget; and\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\n       (iv) describe the eligible institution's proposed program, \n     including personnel qualifications and fees.\n\n  So, it is possible under this bill to create a brandnew institution \njust to get this publicized.\n\n       (B) Certification.--\n       (i) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (C), \n     not later than 60 days after receipt of an application in \n     accordance with subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall \n     certify an eligible institution to participate in the \n     scholarship program under this title.\n       (ii) Continuation.--An eligible institution's certification \n     to participate in the scholarship program shall continue \n     unless such eligible institution's certification is revoked \n     in accordance with subparagraph (D).\n       (C) New eligible institutions.--\n       (i) In general.--An eligible institution that did not \n     operate with at least 25 students in the 3 years preceding \n     the year for which the determination is made may apply for a \n     1-year provisional certification to participate in the \n     scholarship program under this title for a single year by \n     providing to the Corporation not later than July 1 of the \n     year preceding the year for which the determination is made--\n       (I) a list of the eligible institution's board of \n     directors;\n       (II) letters of support from not less than 10 members of \n     the community served by such eligible institution;\n       (III) a business plan;\n       (IV) an intended course of study;\n       (V) assurances that the eligible institution will begin \n     operations with not less than 25 students;\n       (VI) assurances that the eligible institution will comply \n     with all applicable requirements of this title; and\n       (VII) a statement that satisfies the requirements of \n     clauses (ii) and (iv) of subparagraph (A).\n       (ii) Certification.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of receipt of an application described in clause (i), the \n     Corporation shall certify in writing the eligible \n     institution's provisional certification to participate in the \n     scholarship program under this title unless the Corporation \n     determines that good cause exists to deny certification.\n\n  So, here we have it, folks. The Senator from Indiana talked about the \ngreat private schools, and, yet, under this you can just spring up with \na new one, and bring in those tax dollars for 2,000 kids, and you leave \nbehind 97 percent of the children. There are 78,000 children in D.C. \nschools. You are setting up in this amendment and a bureaucracy that is \nextraordinary allowing new schools to pop up, and scholarships are \ngoing to be made available to 2,000 children. And the stipend that goes \nto the board of directors exceeds the amount of the scholarship, and \nthe executive director can hire anyone he or she wants. They have a cap \non overall administration, but do whatever he or she wants as long as \nthey are not paid more than he gets paid or she gets paid. But I am \nonly on page 20.\n  There I pause.\n\n       (iii) Renewal of provisional certification.--After receipt \n     of an application under clause (i) from an eligible \n     institution that includes a statement of the eligible \n     institution's budget completed not earlier than 12 months \n     before the date such application is filed, the Corporation \n     shall renew an eligible institution's provisional \n     certification for the second and third years of the school's \n     participation in the scholarship program under this title \n     unless the Corporation finds--\n       (I) good cause to deny the renewal, including a finding of \n     a pattern of violation of requirements described in paragraph \n     (3)(A); or\n       (II) consistent failure of 25 percent or more of the \n     students receiving scholarships under this title and \n     attending such school to make appropriate progress (as \n     determined by the Corporation) in academic achievement.\n       (iv) Denial of certification.--If provisional certification \n     or renewal of provisional certification under this subsection \n     is denied, then the Corporation shall provide a written \n     explanation to the eligible institution of the reasons for \n     such denial.\n       (D) Revocation of eligibility.--\n       (i) In general.--The Corporation, after notice and hearing, \n     may revoke an eligible institution's certification to \n     participate in the scholarship program under this title for a \n     year succeeding the year for which the determination is made \n     for--\n       (I) good cause, including a finding of a pattern of \n     violation of program requirements described in paragraph \n     (3)(A); or\n       (II) consistent failure of 25 percent or more of the \n     students receiving scholarships under this title and \n     attending such school to make appropriate progress (as \n     determined by the Corporation) in academic achievement.\n       (ii) Explanation.--If the certification of an eligible \n     institution is revoked, the Corporation shall provide a \n     written explanation of the Corporation's decision to such \n     eligible institution and require a pro rata refund of the \n     proceeds of the scholarship funds received under this title.\n       (3) Participation requirements for eligible institutions.--\n       (A) Requirements.--Each eligible institution participating \n     in the scholarship program under this title shall--\n       (i) provide to the Corporation not later than June 30 of \n     each year the most recent annual statement of the eligible \n     institution's budget; and\n       (ii) charge a student that receives a scholarship under \n     this title not more than the cost of tuition and mandatory \n     fees for, and transportation to attend, such eligible \n     institution as other students who are residents of the \n     District of Columbia and enrolled in such eligible \n     institution.\n       (B) Compliance.--The Corporation may require documentation \n     of compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (A), but \n     neither the Corporation nor any governmental entity may \n     impose requirements upon an eligible institution as a \n     condition for participation in the scholarship program under \n     this title, other than requirements established under this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. ____04. SCHOLARSHIPS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Eligible Students.--The Corporation is authorized to \n     award tuition scholarships under subsection (c)(1) and \n     enhanced achievement scholarships under subsection (c)(2) to \n     students in kindergarten through grade 12----\n       (1) who are residents of the District of Columbia; and\n       (2) whose family income does not exceed 185 percent of the \n     poverty line.\n       (b) Scholarship Priority.--\n       (1) First.--The Corporation first shall award scholarships \n     to students described in subsection (a) who----\n       (A) are enrolled in a District of Columbia public school or \n     preparing to enter a District of Columbia public \n     kindergarten, except that this subparagraph shall apply only \n     for academic years 1997-1998, 1998-1999, and 1999-2000; or\n       (B) have received a scholarship from the Corporation for \n     the academic year preceding the academic year for which the \n     scholarship is awarded.\n\n  I see the Senator from Rhode Island is here. I know the Senator from \nConnecticut is waiting to be heard. But I think it is very important \nthat we read this amendment because one of the criticisms about schools \nin general is that they are bureaucratic and you can't get more \nbureaucratic in my mind than this.\n  I want to point out that 7.5 percent of $7 million for administration \nand reimbursement to this board of directors is $525,000. That is over \nhalf a million dollars for a brand new bureaucracy--just what we do not \nneed, frankly, at this point.\n  Now, I am going to skip some of this in the interest of time, but I \nam going to read some of it.\n\n       (3) Lottery selection.--The Corporation shall award \n     scholarships to students under this subsection using a \n     lottery selection process whenever the amount made available \n     to carry out this title for a fiscal year is insufficient to \n     award a scholarship to each student who is eligible to \n     receive a scholarship under this title for the fiscal year.\n\n  So we are helping 3 percent of the kids, and sometimes it will be a \nlottery.\n  And so as to save time, I am going to go to a very interesting part \nhere. It goes on and on and on. There is a subsection on civil rights \nand a very important part in here.\n\n       An eligible institution participating in the scholarship \n     program under this title shall not discriminate on the basis \n     of race, color, national origin, or sex in carrying out the \n     provisions of this title.\n\n  It is very important that that be in here.\n\n       Applicability and Construction with respect to \n     Discrimination on the Basis of Sex.--\n       With respect to discrimination on the basis of sex, \n     subsection (a) shall not apply to an eligible institution \n     that is controlled by a religious organization if the \n     application of subsection (a) is inconsistent with the \n     religious tenets of the eligible institution.\n\n  Now, this goes on and talks about single-sex schools, classes or \nactivities, revocations, and then there is actually a part in this \namendment that I saw that deals with abortion.\n  OK, on page 29 of this bill that sets up scholarships for children, \nwe say here:\n\n       With respect to discrimination on the basis of sex nothing \n     in subsection (a) shall be construed to require any person, \n     or public or private entity to provide or pay, or to prohibit \n     any such person or entity from providing or paying, for any \n     benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related \n     to an abortion.\n\n  Now, I just have to say we are talking about a scholarship program \nfor kids aged from kindergarten until about age 12, and we have a \nsection in here on abortion.\n  I say to anybody reading this--and I have slowed it down in deference \nto my colleagues who are on the other side of the issue who want to be \nheard on this--I say that anybody reading this would have to agree, how \nyou can stand up here and fight against bureaucracy and the nanny state \nand then defend an\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\namendment like this which sets up an entire new bureaucracy, which sets \nup a board of directors that can be paid as much as $5,000 a year, more \nthan the scholarships you are giving, which sets up a situation that a \nbrand new school can pop up, I suppose as long as they get through the \nboard of directors. Maybe they have some clout because who is \nappointing the board of directors? Politicians--politicians--the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the minority leader, the Speaker \nin consultation with the Democratic leader over there.\n  What is this? For a scholarship program that at best will serve 2,000 \nstudents and leaving 76,000 students with nothing, and a half-million \ndollars off the top for administrative costs, and that is just now.\n  I was on the board of directors once of a preschool center when my \nkids were little. It was wonderful. It was nonsectarian, but it \nactually happened to be a community that used a church facility. We had \na tremendous scholarship program. And I have to tell you, it was a \ngreat scholarship program--a private institution, nonprofit--and we did \nnot need to have all of this. If the private sector wants to help the \nkids, they can put forward some scholarships on their own. We do not \nneed to set up a new, massive bureaucracy. That is what I call it. \nBecause you read this--I am sure everyone who might have been listening \nto it fell asleep--going through pages and pages of regulations, you \nfind out that in fact members of the board can be paid more than an \nindividual gets who gets the scholarship; you find out in fact it is \nthe Speaker of the House and majority leader, and in this case the \nDemocratic minority, who have input into who sits on this board of \ndirectors. The President gets to appoint them on recommendation from at \nthis point Trent Lott and Newt Gingrich after consultation with their \ncounterparts.\n  This is not the end of the nanny state. This is the beginning of the \npolitical state in the middle of our children's lives.\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to putting forward something that is going to help 100 percent of \nthe kids. We know after-school programs are needed by these children. \nWe know that after-school programs work. I say to my colleagues who are \nfor this, let me show you LA's Best, an after-school program for LA's \nkids. Boy, those kids are so successful. They are doing 75 percent \nbetter than the kids that do not go to that after-school program.\n  Let's get new textbooks. This amendment provides $7 million. For $1 \nmillion, we can get new textbooks for every third, fourth and fifth \ngrader in the D.C. schools. I remember when I was a kid opening the \nbooks and smelling the new school books. We all remember those days. \nAnd today our kids get textbooks that are falling apart. For $1 million \nof the $7 million we can do this. For $3.5 million we can have 70 \nafter-school programs so our kids are not home alone and they have \nsomebody to say ``yes'' to. We could get new boilers for the schools. \nIt costs $19,000 per boiler to keep those kids warm. We could fix many \nof the problems in our D.C. schools for 100-percent of the children.\n  I hope as Members consider how to vote on this they will go for a 100 \npercent solution, not the 3 percent solution which is so unfair to the \nchildren and sets up a bureaucracy that steals money right off the \ntop--a half-million dollars to go to boards of directors and executive \ndirectors and all of those things I read to you. And so I thank my \ncolleagues for their patience and I yield the floor but retain the \nremainder of our time on this side.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to yield as much time as the \nSenator from Connecticut, coauthor of this provision and partner with \nme in this effort, may consume. I appreciate his support and help in \nthis effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Indiana. I thank him particularly for his consistent leadership in \nthis effort. I am proud to be his cosponsor along with Senator \nBrownback, a Republican Senator, colleague, and friend from Kansas, \nand--and I mention this with some pleasure--Senator Landrieu, our new \ncolleague, Democratic Senator from Louisiana, is also a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, before I get to laying out the reasons why I am for \nthis measure, I just want to respond to something our colleague from \nCalifornia said.\n  The Senator from California kept stressing over and over again this \nfoundation, this nonprofit board that we are setting up to administer \nthese scholarships and talked about the enormous amount of money that \nit was going to spend--bureaucracy, overhead. In the amendment, which \nwe are putting in to create this program, the noninstructional, the \nadministrative costs are capped to 7.5 percent. It does come to a \nlittle bit over a half-million dollars. But take a look at the budget \nof the District of Columbia Public School System. Noninstructional \ncentral administration and overhead, 33 percent. Only two-thirds of the \nmoney we give--and we give well over half a billion of public money to \nthe District of Columbia--two-thirds of that gets spent on instruction, \none-third on central administration.\n  The amendment Senator Coats and I are putting in caps central \nadministration for this scholarship program at 7.5 percent. So I do not \nthink that is a very good argument to oppose our amendment. In fact, \nour amendment is pretty tightly drawn where 92.5 percent of the money \nwe give will go to the kids and the parents. Let them decide where they \nwant it to go for their education.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. There is a certain \nway in which a lot of us--and I am guilty of this some myself--are kind \nof predisposed. We go by momentum. We judge, well, which group of my \nfriends, which interest is on which side, which interest group is on \nthe other side. I appeal to people, our colleagues here and, frankly, \nparticularly directly to those in my own party, to take a look at this \namendment. Senator Boxer read from the amendment.\n  After you read the amendment, read this: ``Children in Crisis, a \nReport on the Failure of D.C.'s Public Schools, November 1996,'' \nwritten on behalf of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility \nand Management Assistance Authority, the control board we created.\n  What is the conclusion? It is documented in painful--if I had a child \nin this system I would say infuriating, heartbreaking--detail. I quote:\n\n       The deplorable record of the District's public schools by \n     every important educational and management measure has left \n     one of the city's most important public responsibilities in a \n     state of crisis, creating an emergency which can no longer be \n     ignored or excused. The District of Columbia Public School \n     [System] is failing in its mission to educate the children of \n     the District of Columbia. In virtually every area and for \n     every grade level, the system has failed to provide our \n     children with a quality education and a safe environment in \n     which to learn.\n\n  I stress the word ``emergency'' because I am going to come back to \nthat word. There is an emergency in the District of Columbia Public \nSchool System and we are devoting a lot of effort--as I said before, \nover $500 million, $564 million in this bill, going from the Federal \ntaxpayers to the District of Columbia Public School System. We are \ndoing everything we can to try to make it better. What is wrong with \ntaking $7 million, compared to the $564 million, and saying in this \nstate of emergency, good God, let's give 2,000 kids and their parents a \nchance to get out of the emergency and better their own lives, better \ntheir education so they can provide for themselves?\n  That is what this is about. It would do nothing more than offer 2,000 \nchildren from low-income homes the opportunity to attend a better \nschool. Incidentally, we often don't mention it, but there is another \npart of it. It would offer 2,000 additional disadvantaged children of \nthe District of Columbia, who go to the public schools and want to stay \nthere, the opportunity for a $500 scholarship to use for exactly the \nkind of program Senator Boxer talked about: After-school tutoring, \nenrichment, the kind of program that will help that child have a better \nprospect of doing better, even within the tough circumstances in the \nDistrict of Columbia system. That is all this is about.\n  People talk about this as if, I don't know, it is un-American. It is \nactually\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\nfundamentally American, because it deals with equal opportunity, making \nit real for kids who are trapped in a school system in which, no matter \nhow much most of them work, and their parents hope for them, they are \nnot going to have an equal opportunity. They are not going to have the \nsame opportunity that those many in the District of Columbia, the \nricher ones, who send their kids to private schools and other schools, \nare going to have.\n  Listen to some of the critics of this amendment and you would think \nwe were going to cause the sky to fall down on public education. Just \nover the last week a number of organizations that I consider to be \nwell-intentioned have flooded the Hill with shrill letters proclaiming \nthat this bill is discriminatory, that it is unconstitutional; \npossibly, from what you read, the single greatest threat to American \neducation since I don't know what. Even Secretary of Education Richard \nRiley, a man I admire so much, went so far as to suggest this week that \nour bill would ``undermine a 200-year American commitment to the common \nschool.''\n  Mr. Secretary, respectfully, that is just not so. Those of us \nsponsoring this amendment are having a hard time reconciling the \nexaggerated rhetoric of our critics with the actual details of our \nplan. Let me repeat. We are talking about spending $7 million next year \nto fund this program, compared to the $564 million we are giving to the \npublic schools in the District. That is about two-tenths of 1 percent \nfor this test, for this pilot program, for this lifeline to a couple of \nthousand disadvantaged kids in the District. We don't take one dime \naway from the D.C. public schools with this amendment. And this small, \nexperimental program is purely voluntary. No people who are satisfied \nwith their current public school will be forced to make any other \nchoice.\n  The only explanation I can come up with, after the years of listening \nto the wild allegations that have accompanied the school choice debate, \nis, if I may put it this way, that love is blind, even in public policy \ncircles. Our critics are so committed to the noble mission of public \neducation that they have shut their eyes to the egregious failures in \nso many of our public schools and insisted on defending the \nindefensible; insisted on blocking children in a situation that the \nD.C. control board describes as an emergency from getting out of that \nemergency. So they are conditioned to believe that any departure from \ntheir orthodoxy is tantamount to the death of their cause. They refuse \nto even concede the possibility that offering children this kind of \nchoice would give them a chance at a better life while we are investing \nso much and working so hard nationally and here in the District to \nrepair and reform our public schools.\n  Of course our public schools will always be our priority concern when \nit comes to educating our children. But what about the ones who are--\nthis is as if a child was in the middle of a fire and somebody was \noffering a lifeline out and somebody says, ``Oh, no, no, no, the \nbuilding they are in is a historic building. That is not fair to the \nchild.''\n  Listen to the complaints of some of the critics and you will see, I \nam afraid, that they have concocted a flexible fiction that allows them \nto believe this fight, their fight, is right, no matter what the facts \nsay. In the alternative universe of the critics, money is the solution \nto problems that, in fact, are often created by wasteful bureaucracies. \nPrivate schools to which many choice critics themselves send their kids \nare not right, somehow, for children of the poor, seems to be the \nimplication in the criticism, and giving a poor parent the same choices \nthat heretofore have been reserved for those who can afford them \namounts, somehow, to an act of discrimination instead of what it is, an \nact of empowerment.\n  Nowhere have the myths been stretched further than in the case of \nthis D.C. scholarship amendment. I just want to spend a few moments to \nrecite for my colleagues some of the more spurious charges that have \nbeen made, and to respond to them. I think it is important to do so \nbecause I want to make every effort I can to make sure that Members of \nthe Senate have accurate information about this amendment before they \nmake up their minds on how to vote. I also hope to demonstrate the \nextraordinary lengths to which our critics have gone to attack this \nplan and uphold what I feel is a failed dogma, which is irrelevant to \nand insensitive to the trap in which thousands of D.C. students and \ntheir parents find themselves today: Unsafe schools--unsafe \nstructurally and unsafe in terms of crime--where too many teachers are \nnot actually educating the children.\n  I am going to talk about some myths.\n  Myth No. 1: This amendment would drain desperately needed resources \nfrom D.C. public schools. I think I have talked a bit about that, but, \nvery briefly, the funding for our program comes from the Federal \npayment to the city. It would have no impact on the D.C. school budget. \nPut it another way, if this amendment fails, the D.C. schools will not \nget one additional penny. This criticism is based on the misguided \nnotion that throwing more money at the D.C. public schools will solve \nthe crisis they are experiencing. The truth is that the Washington Post \ndid not label the D.C. public school system a well-financed failure for \nnothing.\n  The Senator from California said, ``Why not take the $7 million and \ngive it to 100 percent of the children? Give it to the school system.'' \nFor what? To better finance the failure that too many of them are \nstruggling to get an education and build a life for themselves under?\n  I refer my colleagues briefly to this chart which was taken directly \nfrom that D.C. control board study that I referenced earlier. The \nDistrict of Columbia Public School System in fact has one of the \nhighest per-pupil expenditures in the country, spending an average of \n$1,100 more per child than cities of comparable size. Here is the \nDistrict of Columbia. It spends $7,655. These are per-pupil, from 1994 \nand 1995--$7,655. The national average is $6,084. And look at \nneighboring districts, districts around the District of Columbia: \n$6,552. They spend slightly more than $1,000 less than the D.C. school \nsystems spend. You can go on. The chart speaks for itself. Only Newark \nspends more than the District of Columbia per child.\n  So it is not money here, it is the way the money is being spent. Put \n$7 million to 100 percent of the kids, what are you going to get? If I \nmay build on the Washington Post conclusion, a better financed failure. \nTake the $7 million, give it to these 2,000--4,000 students, you are \ngoing to give them a chance at a better education and a better life. I \nwill readily concede that the $7 million could be tacked onto the \npublic school budget. But we have to ask ourselves, will that really \nhelp the kids who are there now, spreading the money on top of a \nbureaucracy that is still having trouble counting how many students it \nhas--which is what this Control Board report tells us? Or putting it \ndirectly into the hands of 2,000 families so they can attend a school \nthey are confident can educate their child. If we are asking what is \nbest for the students and not what is best for the system, there is no \nquestion what will do more good right away, in this coming year, and \nthat is the scholarship program.\n  Myth No. 2, often heard about school choice and heard about this \nprogram. The scholarship is too low to pay for private school and there \nis no space at private schools for these kids, so it is kind of a sham. \nWrong. Our critics seem to have a dated image of the universe of \nprivate and faith-based schools, one that assumes that every school is \nSaint Alban's or Sidwell Friends. There are 88 private and parochial \nschools inside the beltway that cost less than $4,000 per student, \nincluding 60 that cost less than the $3,200 scholarship our amendment \nwould provide. There are at least 2,200 spots now open in schools with \ntuition less than $4,000, and that is according to just a partial \nsurvey of the schools inside the beltway.\n  A related complaint we hear is the scholarships will not do much good \nbecause private and religious schools can and do discriminate. \nCertainly not discrimination based on race. This charge ignores what is \nhappening today at private and parochial schools here and in other \nurban areas around this country. Studies show that Catholic schools, as \nan example, in New York and Chicago and in my own capital city of \nHartford, are serving overwhelmingly minority populations. And that is \nmore than true here in the District. This chart, I\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\nthink, is a startling one. The student population of the District's 16 \ncenter-city Catholic schools is 93 percent African American. Center-\ncity Catholic, 93 percent African-American, actually 5 percent higher \nthan the 88 percent African-American enrollment in the public schools \nof the District of Columbia. Catholic schools are hardly an exception. \nFor example, Senator Coats and I have been to visit the Nannie Helen \nBurroughs School, an elementary school run by the National Baptist \nConvention here in Washington. It is in an area in the northeast \nsection. It has 100-percent African-American school population. We \ntalked to the principal. She said literally they have an open-door \npolicy. She said to Senator Coats and me, ``We will accept anyone who \ncomes to the door--anyone who comes to the door.'' So much for the \ncharge of discrimination.\n  Members of the Senate should also know that this amendment contains \nexplicit civil rights protections that would prohibit schools \nparticipating in this program from discrimination based on race, color, \ngender, national origin, and it references the District of Columbia \nHuman Rights Act, which actually has a broader series of \nantidiscrimination protections.\n\n  Myth No. 3: The voters of the District have already rejected choice. \nThat is what the critics say. They will continue to cite the results of \na referendum held--when?--17 years ago on a tuition tax credit plan \ntotally different from the scholarship amendment Senators Coats, \nBrownback, Landrieu, and I are proposing here.\n  A much more recent, May 1997, poll and a more relevant poll, found \nthat 62 percent of low-income parents in the District, the people this \nprogram is designed to serve, thought a scholarship plan was an \nexcellent or good idea.\n  Mr. President, the fascinating part of that poll--I don't have the \nexact number in front of me--is that the more white and higher income \nthe group polled, the more likely they were to oppose this proposal, \nthe more likely also that their children were in private or faith-based \nschools. The people that this scholarship program is aimed at helping \ndesperately want this kind of lifeline.\n  Later in the debate I will cite a study done among African-Americans \nnationally that a joint center, distinguished think tank, in town shows \nremarkable rising support for school choice programs, vouchers, \nparticularly among younger African-Americans. I wonder why, sadly, too \nmany African American children are suffering from a lack of real \nopportunity in school systems like the one in the District of Columbia.\n  Myth No. 4: There is no evidence, the critics say, that scholarships \nwill improve academic performance. Well, just a few days ago, a \nresearch team from Harvard released a study showing that students \nparticipating in the Cleveland choice program made significant gains in \ntheir first year. Math test scores rose an average 15 percent in 1 year \nfor kids involved in the choice program there; reading tests 5 \npercent--just 1 year after leaving public schools.\n  That data builds on several convincing studies demonstrating that \nlow-income students attending center-city Catholic schools have \nachieved far higher scores than their peer groups in the local public \nschools. Comparable populations in each case, two different settings, \nkids in the center-city Catholic schools doing much better.\n  A 1990 Rand Corp. comparison of schools in New York City, for \ninstance, found that the Catholic schools graduated 95 percent of their \nstudents annually, while the comparable public schools graduated \nslightly more than 50 percent. These are numbers, but behind these \nnumbers are thousands of children--thousands of children--who, when \nthey don't finish school, are generally confined to a life without real \nopportunity.\n  Look at the difference: 95 percent of the kids in the Catholic \nschools graduate; slightly more than 50 percent in the comparable \npublic schools.\n  The Rand Corp. report also showed that the Catholic school students \noutperformed their counterparts in the public schools and--again, this \nis in New York City--on the SAT exam by an average of 160 points.\n  A study released earlier this year by Derek Neal of the University of \nChicago found that low-income Catholic school students were twice as \nlikely to graduate from college as their public school counterparts. \nWhat a story. It shows what we all know; it shows it so powerfully.\n  The problem here is not the kids. Put the kids in an environment \nwhere they have a real chance to learn, where they are going to be \ntaught in a way that is focused on them, and they will blossom, they \nwill rise, they will soar, with twice as many graduating from college. \nNot surprising, then, that Paul Vallas, the man charged with rebuilding \nthe decrepit Chicago Public School System, and doing a great job from \nall reports, is working closely with educators in the schools of the \nCatholic Archdiocese of Chicago to learn what has made these faith-\nbased schools succeed where the public schools have failed. It is \nsurprising, though, that few other urban administrators have been \nwilling to do the same thing.\n  Myth No. 5, another false allegation: This amendment is part of a \nRepublican-only agenda. It is a sad fact that most of the choice \nproponents in Congress are members of the Republican Party, although I \nam proud to say that Senator Landrieu and I are cosponsors of this \namendment, and in the House, Congressman Floyd Flake of New York and \nCongressman Bill Lipinski of Chicago have joined in cosponsoring this \nbill.\n  But you have to go beyond that. To write this effort off as a \npartisan effort is to ignore the growing demand for programs that give \nparents greater educational choice, a demand that cuts across partisan, \nracial, class, and ideological lines.\n  Take a look at who is driving the choice movement at the grassroots \nlevel around the country. Mothers like Zakiya Courtney in Milwaukee and \nBarbara Lewis in Indianapolis. Educators like Howard Fuller, the former \nMilwaukee superintendent of schools. Legislators like Glenn Lewis from \nTexas. Civil rights leaders like Alveda King from Atlanta, Dolores \nFridge, the Minnesota Commissioner of Human Rights. All happen to be \nAfrican-Americans. To the best of my knowledge, most of them are \nDemocrats.\n\n  They are not moved by politics. What moves them is love for their \nchildren and frustration and anger that their children are being denied \na chance at the American dream because they are being forced, for \nreasons of income, to attend chronically dysfunctional public schools.\n  These activists have been joined by thoughtful thinkers, independents \nlike Bill Raspberry and Democrats like Bill Galston, former domestic \npolicy adviser to President Clinton, who have both endorsed the program \nthat we are proposing in this amendment today.\n  Consider the fact that polls routinely show that support for just the \nkind of program we are proposing is growing into a majority. For \nexample, just this week, the Center for Education Reform released a \nsurvey showing that 82 percent of American adults favored giving \nparents greater educational choice, and 72 percent approve of using \ntaxpayer funds to allow poor parents to choose a better school for \ntheir child--72 percent on a poll released just this week.\n  This is not partisan. Unfortunately, the vote in Congress too often \nhas been divided along party lines, but that is not the reality out \nacross America. Why? Because the American people are fair, they are \nrealistic, they are practical. They see what is happening to too many \nof the children in too many of our public school systems. While we are \nworking feverishly to repair those school systems, they think some of \nthe kids are trapped in them, not because they are less able, but only \nbecause their parents don't have the money to take them out of those \nschool systems that aren't working for them.\n  The parents and activists and local political leaders who are \ndemanding choices are not out to destroy the public schools, as so \noften is alleged. Senator Coats and I, Senator Brownback, Senator \nLandrieu--none of us are out to destroy the public schools. I am the \nproud product of a public school. I received a great education. I know \nthe role that the public school has played in America as a blender, a \nmeeting ground for people of all kinds who come to the public schools. \nBut the reality is, in too many of our schools today, that is not \nhappening.\n  Mr. President, I can't think of a public school education support \nproposal\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\nthat I haven't supported in the 8\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate \nof the United States. IDEA, special education funding, School to Work \nAct, the President's national testing initiative, charter school \nprograms, funding, more and more funding for the public schools. What \nthe critics fail to realize is that you can support this scholarship \nprogram and support public education. This is not an either/or \nequation.\n  In fact, Senator Brownback and I, particularly as the Chair and \nranking member of the Senate D.C. oversight committee, are working \nconstantly with General Becton, now the head of the D.C. Public School \nSystem, to give him real support in meeting the overwhelming challenge \nhe has of resuscitating the D.C. school system.\n  I repeat, again, the very bill on which we are aiming to attach this \namendment provides $564 million, over one-half billion dollars of money \nfrom the taxpayers of the United States for the D.C. Public School \nSystem. General Becton himself concedes that the D.C. public schools--\nhe said this before our committee--will not get better really to where \nhe wants them to be for at least 5 or 10 years. They are going to get \nbetter along the way. He said, ``Don't expect an overnight miracle \nhere. I am not going to reach what you want to make of the school \nsystem for another 5 or 10 years.''\n  What do we tell the children who are in the school system in the \nmeantime, and what do we tell their parents? That in the name of some \nideology, for some reason of history, to protect the ideal of the \npublic school system as some of us experienced it that doesn't have any \nrealistic relationship to what is happening every day for thousands of \nkids in the District of Columbia, in the name of preserving public \neducation, that we as adults are willing to sacrifice children's \nfutures, the kids who are there now, in a system described by the \ncontrol board as in a state of emergency? We are willing to sacrifice \nthem for the sake of a process, an idea that is not real in their \nlives? Go into the District school system, go into the schools and see \nwhat kids face. It is not acceptable, and that is why we are pushing so \nhard to establish this scholarship program.\n  Senator Coats and I and the other cosponsors are not suggesting that \nthis is the cure-all for the city's educational woes, but it will give \n4,000 kids from disadvantaged families, not kids who are not able, kids \nwho have the same God-given ability as any other group of kids, it will \ngive them the opportunity to realize that ability and a better life. It \nwill make a statement that we are not going to tolerate the \nunacceptable status quo any longer.\n  In the long run, it will, hopefully, increase the positive pressure \non the public schools to become more accountable, to raise their \nstandards, to win back the public's confidence. Mr. President, later in \nthe debate, if there is time, I am going to read from an affidavit \nfiled by a member of the Milwaukee school system in a school choice \ncase where that member testified to the positive competitive effect \nthat the school choice program in Milwaukee had on the public schools.\n  For all this, Senator Coats and the other cosponsors and I are \naccused of leaving behind or abandoning the 76,000 children who would \nnot have access to the scholarship program. The irony, of course, is \nthat just the opposite is true. Too many of these children have already \nbeen abandoned by a school system that has been driven into the ground \nby too much incompetence, too much indifference to the best interests \nof the city's families, a system that is so bad that the control board \nreport that I mentioned earlier concludes something that I had to look \nat two or three times to understand:\n\n       The longer students stay in the District's Public School \n     System, the less likely they are to succeed educationally.\n\n  I couldn't believe that. ``The longer students stay in the District's \nPublic School System, the less likely they are to succeed \neducationally.'' I went back. What does that mean? It means as the \ngrade levels go up, the District school kids fall further and further \nbelow the national average on standardized tests. To continue to do \nnothing, other than to call for more money, while these children suffer \nis unfair to these children.\n\n  That is why the onus should not be on us to defend our plan or \nalternative, our scholarships, but on those who oppose doing anything \nthat does not fit inside the box of status quo public education which \nis failing thousands of children here in the District of Columbia.\n  We have to ask, what are you willing to do to change things right \nnow? What are we willing to do to rescue these kids who must go to \nschools that have more metal detectors than computers? To continue to \ndo nothing out of fear of being divisive or offending one or another \ngroup is irresponsible. And, you know, that is a major argument against \nthis amendment, that it is divisive. Those who opposed the civil rights \nlaws when they were first proposed also liked to complain that those \nbeing proposed were going to be divisive and thereby damaging to the \ncountry. It was an unconvincing argument then just as it is now.\n  Mr. President, it is a remarkable twist of fate that we stand \ndebating this amendment, as I am sure my colleagues have seen in the \nnews today, on the 40th anniversary of the desegregation of a Little \nRock high school, Central High School. President Clinton will be down \nthere this weekend to commemorate that historic event. Of course, that \nschool was desegregated and other schools were saved from legal \nsegregation.\n  But what is the reality today? Too many schools are still effectively \nsegregated, but really more fundamentally to the point, too many \nchildren are being denied the equal opportunity for an education that \nthe desegregation movement, that Brown versus Board of Education, that \nall the tumult that followed it was all about.\n  The kids in the District school system do not have a real equal \nopportunity to an education. And that is what our amendment is all \nabout.\n  Mr. President, finally, I want to make a plea to the Members of my \nown party. If I may be partisan in this sense, this Democratic Party of \nours in its modern expression was built on a central principle, equal \nopportunity, building on the bedrock insight that the Declaration of \nIndependence and the Constitution have, that everybody is created \nequal, and that these are inalienable rights that we have, incidentally \nnot given to us by the founders of the country or by Congress or any \nother group but given to us by our Creator.\n  The Democratic Party in the modern history of this country has \nfocused on making this ideal of equal opportunity real. At our best we \nhave been the party of upward mobility, we have been the party that \nwelcomed people to this country, immigrants to this country. We have \nstood for giving everybody a fair chance to go up. Getting a decent \neducation was at the heart of that.\n  That ultimately is what is at the heart of this debate--basic \nfairness, equal opportunity. The reality is that we already have de \nfacto educational choice in this country. It is just limited to those \nwho can pay for it. The question we now face is, whether we make that \nkind of choice available to the children who really need it most or \nwhether we continue to deny them the opportunity out of some fear of \nupsetting the status quo or some interest groups who support the status \nquo.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to think about why they became \nDemocrats, what the party is all about, and how, when we think about \nthat, how they can oppose scholarships for 4,000 poor children. Nothing \nmandatory. Parents have the right to apply for this. Where have we come \nwhen we end up in that position that we are denying a lifeline to 4,000 \npoor children in the District of Columbia?\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the final chart I am going to \nshow, which is this one. Ward 3 in the District, the upper northwest \npart of the District; 65 percent of the families send their children to \nprivate schools. So 65 percent of the families send their children to \nprivate schools; the poverty rate is 6 percent. Well, look. That is the \nmost, of course, of any ward in the city.\n  Look at Ward 1, a poverty rate of 17 percent; only 11 percent can \nsend their kids to private school. Ward 7, the poverty rate is 18 \npercent; only 7 percent can send their kids to private school. It is \nclear what is going on here. And 65 percent of the families from Ward 3 \nsending their kids to private school is\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\nsix times the national average. Probably some Members of this Senate \nare in that statistic in Ward 3.\n  We have to ask ourselves, is it fair, given the factual indictment of \nthe status quo of the D.C. public schools--which, as I said, over and \nover again today, we are spending a half a billion dollars and working \nwith General Becton in all sorts of ways to fix it--is it fair for us \nto force the disenfranchised, not by reason of law, not by reason of \nthe God-given potential of each and every one of their children, are we \ngoing to force them to go to schools that we ourselves, and in fact \nthat statistics show that most D.C. public schoolteachers, will not \nrisk sending their own children to?\n  I say to my colleagues, as you wrestle with that question, I want to \nleave you with the wisdom of a Nigerian proverb that I saw on the wall \nof a D.C. school that I visited recently. It said, ``To not know is \nbad; to not want to know is worse.'' We can no longer profess not to \nknow about what is happening to thousands of children in the D.C. \npublic school system today who the superintendent of the school system \nsays are in a school system that will not be what we want it to be for \n5 or 10 years.\n\n  We cannot profess any longer not to know this reality. Therefore, for \nus not to act now, frankly, is not to want to know. And the terror of \nthat is that for that willful ignorance, it is these children who are \ngoing to pay the price. So I have spoken strongly here today because I \nfeel strongly about this.\n  Mr. President, this is about kids, this is about their future, this \nis about the reality of the American dream for those who have the \nhardest time of reaching for it. This is a small program--$7 million--\nto try it out.\n  Hey, can anybody say that things are so good in the District of \nColumbia Public School System that it is not worth experimenting with \nan alternative for a couple of years? No. I hope my colleagues will \nthink about this and will face the reality and will give this \nscholarship program a chance, which is to say, that they will give \n4,000 children in the District of Columbia a chance that they will \notherwise not have.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the last item, which has already been \napproved, apparently has not been checked by staff. What was the last \nunanimous consent, if you would not mind? You already have gotten it \napproved, but out of courtesy. Apparently, the Democrats have not had a \nchance to look at it.\n  Mr. COATS. I thought it was cleared. It is a printing error, a \ndescriptive--I tell you what. We will talk to them about it. If there \nis any problem, we will reset that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That will be fine.\n  Mr. President, I first of all want to start out with some praise for \nmy colleague, Senator Coats, from Indiana and for that matter, Senator \nLieberman. I think they speak with a great deal of conviction and \neloquence on this matter. I think both of them are very committed to \nthe idea of equal opportunity for every child in America. There is no \nquestion about that in my mind.\n  Mr. President, I too think that there has to be a way that we \nreinvigorate or renew our national vow of equal opportunity for every \nchild. And I think that education is key to that.\n  But, Mr. President, let me just say at the beginning that there are a \nwhole lot of things that we can and should be doing that we are not \ndoing if we are serious about it. And that is sort of the context that \nI look at this proposal for the District of Columbia, which I will get \nto in a few minutes. But let me start out, if you will, with a kind of \nnationwide focus.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I have been traveling the country and I \nhave been spending time in communities where people are struggling \neconomically. I spent time with quite a few poor people around our \ncountry.\n  I am struck by the fact--and I have said this on the floor of the \nSenate before--that in all too many cases you walk into schools and the \nceilings are caving in and the toilets do not work, the buildings are \ndilapidated, the lab facilities are not up to par, there are not enough \ntextbooks. And with all due respect, quite frankly, until we make the \ninvestment in this area, just in infrastructure so schools are inviting \nplaces for children, we are not doing that much for kids. A voucher \nplan, be it a demonstration project in the District of Columbia for $7 \nmillion or anything else is just a great leap sideways or backward.\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\n  Mr. President, Senators and Representatives have had the opportunity \nto put some investment in rebuilding crumbling schools in America, and \nwe voted against it. If we are serious about equal opportunity for \nevery child--my colleague from Connecticut spoke about this with a \ngreat deal of eloquence--then we ought to just follow the direction of \nall of the studies that are coming out about early childhood \ndevelopment. It is not surprising that kids are not doing well in these \ndifferent tests, in the way in which we measure how children are doing \nin our schools.\n  I try to be in a school every 2 weeks in Minnesota. There are so many \nchildren that come to schools that have never been read to. There are \nso many children that come to school that don't know the alphabet, \ndon't know how to spell their name, don't know colors, shapes, and \nsizes, and we are doing precious little by way of investing in early \nchildhood development.\n  Now, I don't know how in the world my colleagues believe that the \nchildren we say we care a great deal about, and they do, are going to \ndo well unless we make a commitment here. The answer to the problem is \nnot a voucher plan. The answer is to make the commitment to early \nchildhood development.\n  Deborah Meyer, a great urban educator from New York, said, ``We can \nhave a debate about tests, we can have a debate about standards, we can \nhave a debate about how we measure this, but there is no debate about \nthe need for you all to get busy investing in the dilapidated \nschools.'' We tell children we care next to nothing about them when the \nschools look the way they are.\n  The judge's court order in Washington, DC, which dealt with getting \nthe asbestos out of our schools, there could be judges issuing these \norders in just about every major city in the United States of America, \nand we haven't invested the resources in this, and we are now saying \nthat the answer is vouchers?\n  Mr. President, if we are going to talk about equal opportunity for \nevery child, maybe we ought to take a look at what happens to children \nbefore they go to school and what happens to them when they go home. \nSome of the cuts we have made in nutrition programs--and we have made \nrather deep cuts in nutrition programs; we are going to cut the major \nfood safety program, the major safety net, which is the Food Stamp \nProgram, by 20 percent by the year 2002 all in the name of welfare \nreform.\n  Or, Mr. President, the cuts we have made in affordable housing. Has \nanybody looked at some of the homes, some of the apartments, some of \nthe housing that these young children live in? And we are cutting \nfunding for affordable housing. We have a lot of kids that are living \nin shacks. We have a lot of kids that are living in rat-infested \napartments. We have a lot of children that go cold during the winter.\n  My colleagues are trying to make the argument that the voucher plan \nis the way we are going to make sure that these children do well. We do \nhardly anything to change the concerns and circumstances of their lives \noutside of the schools. We do hardly anything by way of early childhood \ndevelopment. We do next to nothing when it comes to rebuilding these \ncrumbling schools. And then we turn around and say what we want to do \nis have a voucher plan.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Connecticut said that he had been in \nsome schools. I have been in some of the schools. I know Senator Coats \nhas. I don't know anybody that has done more travel around the country \nthan Jonathan Kozol who wrote ``Savage Inequalities: Children in \nAmerica's schools.''\n  I read from page 83: ``In a country where there is no distinction of \nclass,'' written of the United States 130 years ago, ``a child is not \nborn to the station of his parents but with an infinite claim to all of \nthe prizes that could be won by thought and labor. It is in conformity \nwith the theory of equality as near as possible to give to every youth \nan equal state of life. Americans are unwilling that any be deprived in \nchildhood the means of competition.''\n  It is hard to read these words today without a sense of irony and \nsadness, denial. Means of competition is perhaps the single most \nconsistent outcome of the education offered to poor children in the \nschools of our large cities, and nowhere is this pattern of denial more \nexplicit or more absolute than public schools in New York City. Average \nexpenditures per pupil in the city of New York were under $5,500, and \nin the suburbs you have funding levels that are above $11,000 a year, \nand some cases up to $15,000 a year.\n  All across the country, too much of the education the children get by \nway of teacher recruitment and teacher salaries, by way of facilities, \nby way of teacher training, by way of support services, is dependent on \nthe property tax--huge inequalities--and we think that the voucher plan \nis the way to deal with this problem?\n  My good friend Jonathan Kozol wrote another book called ``Amazing \nGrace,'' poor children and the conscience of America. It is a difficult \nbook to read. It is devastating. It is about children in New York City \nin the Bronx. Mr. President, the thesis of the book is that no country \nthat really loved children would ever let any group of children grow up \nunder these conditions.\n\n  Looking at the housing in the neighborhoods, the rat-infested \nhousing, looking at the pollution, looking at the number of children \nsuffering from asthma, looking at the lead content still in the paints \nin the apartments, looking at families without jobs, without jobs that \npay a decent wage, looking at children that are malnourished, looking \nat a school that doesn't get its fair shake of resources, why don't we \nmake those commitments if we want to make sure that every child has the \nsame chance? The voucher plan nationally and this voucher plan in the \nDistrict of Columbia is not the answer. It is not a step forward. It is \na great leap backward from the kind of commitment we ought to make to \nchildren in our country.\n  Mr. President, I said to my colleague from Indiana and I meant it \nsincerely, we don't need to be starting to put public money into \nprivate schools. We have some of the best public schools in the world. \nWe have some of the best public schools in the world. Go out to some of \nour suburbs and look at those schools. They are great schools with \ngreat teachers with great facilities. What we should be doing is making \nall the public schools that good. That is the commitment we ought to \nmake.\n  One-third of America's schools, serving 14 million of America's 52 \nmillion students, are considered deteriorating, according to the \nDepartment of Education. Ten million students don't have access to \ncomputers; 50 percent of the teachers have no experience with \ntechnology in the classroom; 50,000 teachers enter school annually on \nemergency basis, without a proper teaching license; and within the next \ndecade, thanks to a retirement in the baby boom, we will need 2 million \nnew teachers, and we are now on the floor of the Senate discussing an \namendment that would provide resources to private schools.\n  Mr. President, Horace Mann said it best in 1830, 170 years ago:\n\n       Choice is not a new idea . . . the newness is who pays for \n     it. As a nation, we are rightly absorbed with improving \n     education. We cannot do it by isolating its problems, and \n     pretending to leave those problems behind to be dealt with by \n     those least able to solve them. The problems of our public \n     schools lie deep in the American experience--poverty, racism, \n     decades of public apathy, drugs, and growing inability of the \n     family, the church, and the neighborhood to nurture many of \n     our children. These problems--and not the attractively \n     sounding solution of private school choice--need to be \n     addressed.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly the argument that I just made. Horace \nMann just happens to be someone of quite a bit more stature. He was \nright in 1830 and the same argument applies today, nearly 170 years \nlater.\n  You can't take public funds, you can't take public funds, and my \ncolleague Eleanor Holmes Norton informs me that indeed this $7 million \ncomes out of the D.C. budget, you can't take public funds, precious \nfunds, and funnel them to private schools. You have fewer dollars \nhelping kids in math and science, you have fewer dollars in terms of \nraising the standards of achievement, you have fewer dollars for \nteacher training, and you have less prevention of drugs and violence in \nthe schools. This is not the time to be making such a decision.\n  Mr. President, I want to also point out that there is a Senator from \nthe District of Columbia, a shadow Senator, Paul Strauss, and it is a \nshame\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\nthat he doesn't get a chance to be more directly involved in this \ndebate. He has been by my office a lot. He cares about this. I think \nthis has some problem to do with the whole question of lack of \nrepresentation.\n  I think we ought to remember that people in D.C, and my colleague \nfrom Connecticut said it was 1981, but by a ratio of 8 to 1 vote \nagainst the voucher initiative. If you want to argue that was a long \ntime ago, take a look at the D.C. Board of Education which unanimously \nopposes the provision. ``Private school vouchers is not where the \nvoters of this city want to put their money,'' D.C. School Board member \nKaren Shook reminds us. ``To have Congress impose this on us after we \nsoundly voted against it runs counter to democracy.''\n  These are elected members to the school board. They voted unanimously \none way, and we come to the floor of the Senate and impose a whole \ndifferent other view. I thought we were interested in local initiative. \nI thought we wanted local communities to have more decisionmaking power \nover their children's lives and what happened in their communities.\n  Mr. President, I think that if we are going to be talking about \nimproving education, the answer is right before us. We have great \nschools in our suburbs. We have some great schools in some of our \ncities. Make all the public schools that way. Make sure that we have a \nsystem of financing of schools so that not one school in America, not \none school in America, is dilapidated, not one school in America has a \nroof that is caving in, not one school in America is ladened with \nasbestos, not one school in America has teachers that have to take \nmoney out of their pockets and buy textbooks for their students because \nthere isn't enough resource to do so, not one school in America is a \nschool without heat or without air-conditioning during the hot summers. \nLet's make that commitment. Let's make the commitment to early \nchildhood development. Let's make the commitment to support services \nfor students. Those are the kind of commitments we make, and then we \ncan have all of the public schools being great schools. The voucher \ndoesn't do that.\n\n  Karen Shook, the vice president of the D.C. Board of Education and \nformer Chair of the D.C. Finance Committee said, ``Students in the \nDistrict of Columbia go to school in 100-year-old buildings that have \nnever been renovated.'' Why don't we renovate the buildings? The city \nhas a $600 million need to repair schools, yet it has no capital \nbudget. As for social services for troubled youth, ``only one counselor \nis available for every 400 students'' in the D.C. public schools.\n  As D.C. parent and PTA leader Alieze Stallworth points out: ``The \nmajority of children are going to remain in the public school system. \nWhat happens to them?''\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. There are other colleagues who \nwant to speak. But let me be clear about this, take the $7 million, and \nfor $7 million we could establish ``Success for All,'' a proven \nresearch-based reading program for disadvantaged students, for every \nelementary school in the District of Columbia. Put the $7 million into \nthat.\n  We could link 116 public schools in the District of Columbia to \nimprove reform efforts such as New American Schools. Put the $7 million \nin that.\n  We could put in place 140 after-school programs based in public \nschools to help 14,000 children otherwise home alone after schooldays, \nafter school ends each day. Put the $7 million into that.\n  We could provide brandnew textbooks for every elementary and \nsecondary school student in every single the District of Columbia \nschool. Put the $7 million into that.\n  We could buy 66,000 new hardcover books for the District of \nColumbia's public libraries, or we could buy 368 new boilers for D.C. \nschools and protect all the students who go cold during the winter. Put \nthe $7 million into that.\n  I am going to be very clear about it. I will try to end on another \nnote. I think that my colleagues are onto something important. I think \nthis amendment is a huge mistake. I think it actually represents a \nretreat from living up to our national vow of equal opportunity for \nevery child. I think the focus ought to be on all of our schools and \nall of our children. We ought to make sure that every school in this \ncountry, including the schools in the District of Columbia and a lot of \nother cities in the country, and rural areas as well, are as good as \nthe very best school in some of our wealthy suburbs that have all the \nresources and teachers that they can hire and all the teachers they can \nretain and all of the support services and all of the rest. That is the \ndirection we ought to be going in.\n  The voucher plan represents a retreat from that. But I want to say to \nmy colleagues on the floor of the Senate, these Senators, with this \namendment, are operating in good faith. They are not operating in bad \nfaith. I probably should not end this way because I am so strongly \nopposed to the amendment. But I really do want to sort of talk about \ntwo points that I think they are making that are important. One of them \nis that, although, again, the per pupil expenditure in the District of \nColumbia, as I look at these figures, which has been declining now, is \nnow down to $5,923 for fiscal year 1998, that is not nearly as much as \nthe surrounding suburbs. So I don't think we should go overboard on \nthese figures, given the concerns and circumstances of children's lives \nand, in many ways, a bigger challenge to educate some of the children \nin the D.C. school system. Nevertheless, I think it is quite \nappropriate to say, when are we going to cut through this bureaucracy \nand when are we going to make sure that these dollars that are out \nthere really connect to the education of children?\n  I think what my colleagues are trying to say is that they have grown \nvery impatient, they are getting tired of waiting. I share that \nimpatience. I just would do it a whole different way. I would put a lot \nmore investment than I think they want to in what happens to kids in \nthe early years, investment in good programs for kids when they get out \nof school in the middle of the day when not such good things happen. I \nwould put a whole lot more investment in teacher training and a whole \nlot more investment in making sure that the best facilities and \nresources and the schools are inviting places. That is where I would \ngo. I would figure out ways--and I think the District of Columbia is \nstarting to do it--of really making this bureaucracy accountable. I \nwould not be condemning the public school teachers--and they are not \ndoing that. I get angry because I think some of the harshest critics of \nthe public school teachers could not last 1 hour in the classrooms they \ncondemn.\n  I spoke the other night at Howard University. In the audience was a \npublic school teacher, and she said it is really hard to go on. They \nfeel so beaten down from all of the bashing. I think these public \nschool teachers do a marvelous job. I understand my colleagues' \nimpatience.\n  Second, I think it is true that some of the private schools, and some \nof the Catholic schools in particular, in some of our innercity \ncommunities are schools where, when children come to school every day, \nthey know they are loved and some very important things are happening. \nThey are doing some things in their schools that we are not doing \nnearly as well as we should do in some of our public schools. It can't \nbe said that children in our public schools, or in near enough public \nschools, feel as if every day they are loved and they are supported. \nThere are some important things going on in the Catholic schools. There \nare important things going on in some of these other schools that I \nthink make a huge difference.\n  But, Mr. President, this voucher plan, in the context of what is \nhappening nationally, and even in the context of what is happening in \nthe District of Columbia, however well-intentioned it is, I think does \nnot represent a step forward. I think it represents a great leap \nbackward from equity. It represents a great leap backward from the idea \nof truly equal opportunity for every child, and it represents the \nbeginning of a great leap backward from a commitment to public schools, \nwhere all of the schools and all of the children represent the best of \nAmerica, which is opportunity, which is good education, education that \nfires up young people, that gives them hope that they can do well in \ntheir lives. That is the direction we ought to go. This voucher \nproposal, in the District of Columbia or anywhere else, doesn't take us \nin that direction.\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 3 minutes to \nbriefly respond to the Senator. I know the Senator from Rhode Island \nhas been waiting patiently. I don't want to take away from his \nopportunity. We have speakers on our side, too. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland is next in line.\n  I want to respond to some comments made by the Senator from \nMinnesota, to whom I want to return the compliment. The Senator from \nMinnesota has been passionate in his efforts to reach out to the \ndisadvantaged in this country and address many of their concerns. I \nknow he comes at this issue--even though it is different from where I \ncome in terms of the solution, I think the goals are the same for both \nof us. I know he comes at it from a different perspective, but with \ngreat sincerity, and he matches his sincerity and his rhetoric with his \nactions. I noted that the Senator came and paid rapt attention to \nparticularly the comments by the Senator from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman. Senator Wellstone and I have discussed this and have \nexchanged our views. I just appreciate the Senator's commitment to this \nand his sincerity about that commitment.\n  I would like to comment on a couple of things briefly. There have \nbeen different figures thrown around here about per pupil spending in \nthe District of Columbia. We have tried mightily to find out the exact \nfigures. Estimates range from $10,000 to $5,000, as the Senator has \nmentioned. It is probably somewhere in between. One of the sad things \nabout the D.C. Public School System is that they can't tell us. The \naccounting is so bad in the District of Columbia--whether it is on \nroads, housing, police salaries, or public schools--they can't tell us \nhow much they spend per pupil. They can't even tell us the number of \npupils. We said, ``We know how much we give you; tell us the number of \npupils you are educating, and we will divide that into how much we give \nyou.'' They say, ``We don't know exactly. We can't tell you the number \nof pupils.'' That is kind of a sorry comment on the inefficiency and \nreally incompetence of the D.C. Public School System as it currently \nexists.\n  Just two other things, real quickly. I want to make sure my \ncolleagues know that the money--the $7 million for this program --does \nnot take one penny out of the money allocated to the D.C. public \nschools for education. In fact, it will increase the money per pupil \nbecause they will have 2,000 less students to divide the pot of money \nthey get to educate those students. The money comes from an extra \nappropriation over and above the President's request, and that money is \nspecifically designated for debt reduction and doesn't go to any \noperating expenses. So Delegate Norton is wrong when she says this \ncomes out of textbooks, teacher salaries, and operating expenses. It \ndoesn't come out of operating expenses; not one penny less will go to \nD.C. schools.\n  Finally, let me just say the Senator seems to imply that if we can't \nfix it all, we should not fix anything. We acknowledge that there are a \nlot of things that need to be fixed in the District of Columbia and \naround this country. Housing is in deplorable shape, roads are in \ndeplorable shape, early childhood education probably could use funds, \nfood stamps and, as he said, fix the buildings, and so forth. Well, we \nare not able to do everything, but we are able to do something, \nsomething that is focused not on fixing roofs, not on collateral \nproblems--and they are problems that need to be addressed--but we are \nable to funnel funds directly to parents and students who can improve \ntheir educational opportunities. As important as it is to fix roofs, \nbuildings, infrastructure, and so forth, more important and the highest \npriority ought to be to provide education to those children so that \nthey then can become part of the solution.\n\n  Maybe this 3 percent will become part of the 100 percent solution, if \nthey can get an education that would allow them to participate in this. \nIf we were talking about public housing, which is in a disastrous state \nin this country, particularly in this city, and someone came along with \nan alternative that was tried elsewhere and would really improve the \nhousing situation, and we said, can we test it here to see if it works \nhere and it will improve housing for those 2,000 people? would you say, \nno, if we can't do the whole thing, we are not going to do it for \nanybody?\n  All we are asking for is a test that will help 2,000 kids get a \nbetter education, but will prove, right or wrong, whether or not school \nchoice is a viable opportunity and viable program to do two things: \nFirst, give kids a chance and, second, put pressure on the public \nschool system to reform and change. They have had decades to do this. \nWe keep talking about these alternate solutions, but it doesn't happen. \nIn the meantime, generations of children are being condemned to an \ninadequate education.\n  Mr. President, how much time is available on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 64 minutes. The \nopposition has 74 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we had said Senator Reed, who was waiting, \nis next. We are not exactly alternating because we didn't have people \navailable on both sides. If we can get back to the alternating system, \nwe would be happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I yield myself such time, under the control of Senator \nKennedy, as I may consume.\n  I rise this afternoon in opposition to the Coats-Lieberman amendment. \nI have sensed from the comments of the Senator from Indiana and the \nSenator from Connecticut that they, too, share our mutual frustration \nwith the status of public schools in the United States and particularly \nin the District of Columbia. That frustration is forcing us to look at \nways in which we can improve education because we believe it is so \nvitally important to the future of the young people of America and \nindeed to the very success of America in the future.\n  I don't think this frustration should cloud our vision as to what we \nare doing if we would adopt an amendment such as is proposed today. I \nbelieve it would represent an abandonment of public education, not a \nreform of public education. I feel very strongly that our first \ncommitment should be to a strong system of public education throughout \nthis Nation, that we should be seeking to make school reform and \nexcellent schools the right of every child and not just those who may \nbe fortunate enough to receive some type of voucher to leave the \nsystem.\n  Indeed, we can ask ourselves, even if this measure should pass and \n2,000 children would leave the public education system in the District \nof Columbia, what about the thousands of children remaining? What have \nwe done to make their lives better and their education better? I don't \nthink we can save a few and sacrifice the many. I think what we have to \ndo is sit down, conscientiously and cooperatively, and reform public \neducation, not abandon it.\n  Now, the District of Columbia, as we all know, has stark educational \nneeds. Their class year was delayed for days and days and days, not \nbecause of anything more complicated than the fact that the buildings \nwere in disrepair. Yet, rather than investing in roofs or boilers or \nthose items that would actually put children literally into the \nclassroom, we are now debating a voucher bill that would take some of \nthose resources that could be available for these activities and \ndisburse them to private education. Indeed, I believe we have a special \nobligation here in the Nation's Capital to ensure that the schools are \nthe best in the country. However, we are not talking about that today. \nInstead, we are talking about allowing 2,000 students to leave that \nsystem, rather than talking about how we can make every school in the \nDistrict of Columbia the best in this country and in the world, and how \nwe can give every child in the District of Columbia the chance to \nsucceed educationally so that they can succeed in life.\n  The amendment offered by Senators Coats and Lieberman brings the \nissue of the quality of education, particularly education in many of \nour urban areas, clearly into focus. For that, we thank them. It is a \ncrisis we must address, but a crisis that I believe is not solved by \nvouchers. Vouchers would take the limited resources necessary to \nimprove, reform, and reinvigorate public education and, instead, allow \nsome students to leave the system.\n\n[[Page S9929]]\n\n  Indeed, as part of this amendment which is being debated today there \nis absolutely no requirement that schools accepting the vouchers would \nalso have to accept the great task of public education, which is to \neducate all students regardless of their abilities, regardless of their \nproficiency in the English language, regardless of discipline problems \nor troubles they may have. This is the task we set for public \neducation. That is not the task that is frequently embraced or \nsupported by private education.\n  In Cleveland, which has a voucher program, no students with \ndisabilities are served. 1,460 students, nearly half of those that were \ngiven the vouchers, could not even find a private school that would \naccept them. The essence of a private school very clearly is they get \nto reject students, and they get to reject them on very subjective \ngrounds. That is the nature of private education. That does not apply, \nobviously, to public education. Public education not only must accept \nevery child but has a moral and legal requirement to serve those \nchildren as best they can. And that is a significant difference.\n  Private education works very, very well. It has provided good \neducation to many Americans. I was a student in parochial schools in \nRhode Island. But one thing that was true then and is true now when I \ntalk to parents is that, if your child has a particular difficulty or \ndisability, if your child needs enhanced care, specialized attention, \nthe first choice is specifically the public schools because the public \nschool not only has the obligation but will make available those \nresources as best they can. And, once again, in the arena of private \nschools it is not because of any ill-will but simply because of the \nfact that they just do not have to do that.\n  So we are talking about a system in which there is not equality, not \nequality admission, and in many cases not equality of resources either.\n  We have to support the mission of public education in the United \nStates, and it is not just about training workers for the world \neconomy. It is not just preparing young people to engage in the \ntechnologically challenging world of the next century. It is also about \nAmericans, because one of the hallmarks of our country has always been \nthat we have a system of public education that is a common ground for \nthe American people--that children of all races, children of different \nnational heritage, children of different religious convictions can come \nand be educated in a place that emphasizes not their differences but \ntheir common status as citizens of this great Republic.\n  We are in danger perhaps of losing that. We are in danger because \nthere is a great deal of skepticism about the effectiveness of public \neducation in the United States. And, looking at the record, one should \nbe skeptical. But we should not respond to that skepticism and that \nfrustration today by turning our back on public education. Rather, we \nshould look at the way we can make public education better for all \nstudents. What we should be thinking about and talking about and \nenacting is tough academic standards in public education.\n  How do we involve parents and the community more deeply and more \nintimately in the lives and schools in the neighborhood? How do we make \nschools safe and drug free? How do we bring technology into every \nclassroom? And how do we ensure that every classroom is a place that is \nstructurally sound, clean, and creates an environment where young \npeople want to learn and want to strive to get ahead?\n  The notion of school choice in the public education system is a good \none. Parents should have some flexibility within the public system to \npick out charter schools, magnet schools, or special schools. Those \ntypes of schools help stimulate innovation and improvement in the \npublic system.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island we are fortunate to have several \ndifferent schools, particularly at the secondary level which draw on \nthe special talents and special skills of the students and which give \nparents and students a choice. But when we start moving away from that \nsystem of public education into funded private education, funded now by \nthese vouchers, we are stepping across a boundary which I think we will \nregret because inevitably we will be pulling resources away from the \nneeded improvements and reforms in public education, and we will see \nour schools deteriorate even further.\n\n  There is a better way to reform education.\n  If you look at schools which have the same basic demographic \ncharacteristics, one of the most persuasive comments that I have seen \nis that the difference in performance between a good school and a bad \nschool is most accounted for by the qualifications of their teachers. \nWe are not talking about dealing with that issue of teacher preparation \nhere today. We are skirting it, where, in fact, I think if we have \nscarce Federal dollars, and, indeed, we do have scarce Federal dollars \nin every category of expenditures, we have to look at where we can get \nour best value. And it is not balanced. It would be better spent, I \nfeel, in improving the quality of teaching in our public schools.\n  I introduced legislation--the Teacher Excellence in America Challenge \nAct, the TEACH Act--which would turn around the model of professional \ndevelopment and training in the United States to provide for better \nteachers. This legislation is based upon an extensive study by the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future, which contains \nsome disheartening statistics about the quality and preparation of \nteachers in America.\n  Over 12 percent of newly hired teachers have no training; 23 percent \nof all secondary teachers do not have even a minor in their main \nteaching field; and in schools with the highest minority enrollment, \nstudents have less than a 50 percent chance of getting a science or \nmathematics teacher who holds a license and degree in his or her field \nof teaching.\n  These are the real problems of public education. These problems have \nto be addressed. And we can address them, and we must address them. If \nwe do that we will be on much firmer ground in improving public \neducation.\n  What is the price tag, as estimated by the National Commission on \nTeaching and America's Future, for improving the quality of teachers \nthroughout this country? It is over $4 billion. It may seem \ninconsequential today. We are debating a very small program with \nrespect to the District of Columbia.\n  But we need all the resources we can to meet the greater challenge of \npreparing our teachers and the greater challenge of simply ensuring \nthat school buildings are suitable and safe for children.\n  To turn away from these challenges and to adopt this amendment is, I \nbelieve, the wrong approach.\n  I believe we have a lot to do to improve public education. We have \nthe necessary task ahead of us to improve teaching, to improve the \nschool environment, and to challenge schools with demanding standards.\n  I also hope that this body will adopt a national evaluation system so \nthat schools know where they stand, and so that when we talk about how \nwell a school is doing it is not just anecdotal, but we will actually \nknow how well they are doing.\n  In fact, I hope that the national evaluations would be participated \nin by both public and private schools so we can make a judgment about \nhow well the public schools are doing versus private schools. I think \nwe would be a bit surprised. I think we would find despite the \ndisparagement, despite the criticism, despite the constant bombardment \nagainst public education, that it would stand up very well. But we all \ncan do better, and we all must do better.\n  The dollars that we are talking about today are important. They \nshould be applied to provide every student in the District of Columbia \nwith a chance--not 2,000 lucky students--but every student in the \nDistrict of Columbia. They should be focused not on retreating from our \ncommitment to public education but to reaffirming it by assuring every \nchild in this District, and we hope in this country, will have a good, \nsafe school building; they will have well-prepared and motivated \nteachers; they will have textbooks that are current; and, they will \nhave the chance to use all their talents not only for their own success \nbut ultimately for the great success of this Nation.\n\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S9930]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his \nhaving made it possible for me to stand and speak in favor of this very \nimportant opportunity to demonstrate what can happen when we offer \nindividuals the chance to have competition, or the chance to have an \ninfluence on where our children are educated.\n  It is one of the agreed upon successes of the United States of \nAmerica that our university and college system is second to none. \nStudents from all over the world stream into American colleges and \nuniversities, and they come here in spite of the fact that they test \nvery, very well in elementary and secondary systems in their own lands. \nThey come here because there is something special about the collegiate \nand university level in the United States.\n  If I were asked why our collegiate system is tops, I would say, in my \njudgment, that it is because it is a pluralistic system; that it is \ndiverse. There is no singularity with it. No one is scheduled to go to \none school or another. Rather, people have an opportunity to make a \nselection. And students compete to get into the best schools and the \nbest schools compete for faculty. There is lots of competition in the \nsystem. It drives the system forward. It provides a basis for not only \neducation and learning on the part of students but it really develops \nthe energy which provides the basis for research which is expanding the \nfrontiers of knowledge all the time.\n  This concept of diversity, this concept of pluralism, this concept of \nnot being forced to be in one setting, this concept of the energy and \ncreativity, spontaneity and quality that comes when an institution \nknows it has to do its best for its students because those students \naren't forced to go there. They are not locked in. They have the \nopportunity to be involved in educational experiences elsewhere. That \nis what drives quality. It is what has carried American higher \neducation to the very top of the educational mountain. There is no \ndispute. There is no challenger. Second place isn't even close. The \nUnited States of America is the clear dominant force in higher \neducation because we are pluralistic, because we are diverse, and no \none has a monopoly.\n  On the contrary, if you are a student and you have one choice and one \nchoice alone, the word ``one'' and the word ``choice'' Is an oxymoron; \nthat phrase together. One choice isn't a choice. It is a direction. \nStudents that are locked into a single school don't have the capacity \nto say I am going to do better, I will go elsewhere. They don't have \nthe capacity to say if you do not shape this place up, I will go \nelsewhere. They don't have the capacity to energize the system. A \nparent doesn't have the ability to go into the school and say you must \ndo better. The school says we are the only school. You have one choice. \nOne choice is no choice.\n  What we are really offering to individuals who have been locked into \na school system which has failed--I think it is time for us to confess, \nthe school system in Washington, DC, is a failure--is a plan to help \nenergize this school system. It will help the public sector. It will \nhelp the private sector. But, most importantly, it will help students \nand parents.\n  When I had the privilege of being the Governor of my State, I was \nchairman of the Education Commission of the States. I followed in that \nresponsibility one William Jefferson Clinton, who presided over the \nEducation Commission of the States 1 year; I the next. And one of the \nthings that became apparent in studies conducted from sea to shining \nsea in this country is that the single most important thing about a \nstudent's performance is whether the parents are involved in the \neducation process. How do you get parents involved? You make them \nmeaningful. How can you make parents meaningful in Washington, DC? You \ncan give them the opportunity together with the student to make a \nchoice to go to a school where their needs can be met instead of \nlocking them into a situation where their needs aren't being met and \nhave not been met. And it is a demonstrated fact--the studies tell it, \nthe audits tell it, the school facilities tell it--that the needs \naren't being met.\n\n  Unfortunately, our Secretary of Education has come out to oppose this \nprogram providing scholarships so that students could move from one \nschool to another and get good training somewhere if they are not \ngetting it where they are. And he indicated he was opposing it because \nhe felt like it was reducing the funding.\n  Let me just repeat. This particular measure reduces funding not 1 \ncent. It adds funding to just introduce the concept of scholarships and \nto put into the hands of parents and students the ability to say we \nwill go where our needs are met. Will this help the District of \nColumbia schools? It definitely will because they will understand they \nare no longer the exclusive provider of whatever it is they want to \nprovide. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of what \nit is that students need. Will it help the students? Obviously, it will \nhelp the students. It will get their parents involved. It will get them \ninvolved. It will meet their needs. And we will establish a model here \nin the District of Columbia, in the Nation's Capital, which in my \njudgment would well serve the entire country.\n  It is true that pluralism and diversity are the strength of this \ngreat land. They have carried our collegiate system and our research \nuniversities to the very top in education around the globe. It would be \nno accident if we were to allow this to happen at the elementary and \nsecondary level. And it could happen if we were to simply embrace the \nopportunity of letting parents make meaningful choices. One choice is \nan oxymoron. One choice is no choice at all. It is a trap. It is time \nto free students and parents to have an opportunity to select schools \nthat can meet their needs and do so without impairing the financial \nviability and capacity of the District of Columbia school system in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the voucher amendment to the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill. Although we all want to help the \nDistrict's children get a good education, this is not the way to do it. \nPublic funds should be used for public schools, not to pay for students \nto attend private and religious schools.\n  The current debate involves the schools in the District of Columbia. \nThe use of Federal funds for private schools is a national issue that \nCongress has addressed and rejected many times before, and so have many \nStates. Now the voucher proponents are attempting to make the D.C. \npublic schools a guinea pig for a scheme that voters in the District of \nColumbia have soundly rejected, and so have voters across the country.\n  The recent voucher proposals in the States of Washington and Colorado \nand California lost by over 2 to 1 margins, and in 1981 voters defeated \na voucher initiative by a ratio of 8 to 1 here in the District. The \nconcept has never been brought up on the ballot again because it has so \nlittle support. So clearly Congress should not impose on the District \nof Columbia what the people of the District of Columbia and voters \nacross the country reject.\n  D.C. parents and ministers and local leaders have made it clear that \nthey do not want vouchers. Last week, a group of ministers from the \nDistrict of Columbia publicly announced their opposition to vouchers. \nRev. Eart Trent, Jr., of the Florida Avenue Baptist Church, said, ``We \nwant nothing to do with vouchers. It is going to harm a majority of our \nschools.'' Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton opposes vouchers for \nthe District.\n  The question is, who wants these vouchers? The Republicans in \nCongress cannot get to first base with this issue in their own States \nand want to impose it on the people of the District of Columbia.\n  Vouchers would erode local control in the District of Columbia and \nundermine D.C. school reforms already underway. Last year, Congress \ncreated a control board and all but eliminated the locally elected \nschool board.\n  This bill would create another bureaucracy in the form of a federally \nappointed corporation to use Federal funds to run the voucher program. \nSix out of the seven corporation members would be nominated by the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S9931]]\n\nGovernment, and those nominations are controlled by the Republican \nleaders of Congress. Only one representative of D.C. would serve on the \ncorporation.\n  I understand Senator Boxer did an excellent job earlier in the debate \nof going through the administrative process and machinery that would be \nset up and the weaknesses of that particular recommendation or \ninclusion in the amendment.\n  Congress created the D.C. control board less than a year ago. The \nboard appointed as chief executive officer of the schools Gen. Julius \nBecton, Jr., with Congress' endorsement. His mission is to improve the \npublic schools. Now this bill would pull the rug out from under him.\n  I noted, Mr. President, that in an earlier debate one of our \ncolleagues who is supporting the amendment was talking about the $500 \nmillion that is coming from taxpayers all over the country. That money \nis coming from the taxpayers here in the District of Columbia.\n  I haven't looked at the D.C. population recently, but generally it is \nlarger than six or seven of our States. They pay in taxes, but they do \nnot have representation in the House, with all respect to Eleanor \nHolmes Norton. They are not reflected in the Senate of the United \nStates. They are not given the full representation that they should \nhave even in the District.\n  So General Becton, Mr. President, local leaders and D.C. parents are \nworking hard to improve all D.C. public schools for all children. We \nshould support them, not undermine them. The public funds should not go \nto private schools when D.C. public schools have such urgent needs. The \nopening of D.C. public schools for the 1997-1998 academic year was \ndelayed because in 67 percent of the schools the roofs were crumbling. \nThey were able to repair the most severe problems and open up the \nschools this week, but much more needs to be done.\n\n  In addition to completing the roof repairs, 65 percent of them have \nfaulty plumbing; 41 percent of the schools do not have enough power \noutlets and electric wiring to accommodate computers and other needed \ntechnology; and 66 percent of the schools have inadequate heating, \nventilation and air conditioning. Funding these repairs should be our \ntop priority, not conducting a foolish ideological experiment on school \nvouchers.\n  Another serious problem with the private school voucher is the \nexclusionary policy of the private schools. Scarce Federal dollars \nshould not go to schools that can exclude children. There is no \nrequirement in the bill that schools receiving vouchers accept students \nwith limited English proficiency, students with disabilities, homeless \nstudents or students with disciplinary problems.\n  Scarce funds should be targeted to public schools which do not have \nthe luxury of closing their doors to students who pose such challenges. \nAs District of Columbia parent Alieze Stallworth says, ``A lot of \npeople think the poor kids will be able to go to the best private \nschools. They are fooling themselves.''\n  The voucher proponents argue that vouchers increase the choice for \nparents. But parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply \ndifferent rules than public schools, and unlike the public schools, \nwhich must accept all children, the private schools decide whether to \naccept a child or not. The real choice goes to the schools, not the \nparents. The better the private school, the more parents and students \nare turned away. In Cleveland, nearly half of the public school \nstudents who received the vouchers could not find a private school that \nwould accept them.\n  Vouchers will not help most children who need help. This voucher \nscheme will send 2,000 children to private and parochial schools, but \nof the 78,000 children who attend D.C. public schools, 50,000 of the \nchildren, or 65 percent, come from low-income families. Thus, this \nproposal would provide vouchers for 3 percent of D.C.'s children and do \nnothing for the other 97 percent.\n  Again, a point that has been well made by my friend and colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer.\n  This is no way to spend Federal dollars. We should invest in \nstrategies that help all children, not just a few.\n  Another serious objection to this voucher scheme is its \nunconstitutionality. A vast majority of private schools that charge \ntuition below $3,200 are religious schools. Providing vouchers to \nreligious schools is unconstitutional. It violates the establishment \nclause of the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution by providing a \nFederal subsidy for sectarian schools. In many States, the voucher \nschemes would violate the State constitution, too.\n  In January 1997, a Wisconsin trial court held that the expansion of \nthe Milwaukee voucher program to include religious schools was \nunconstitutional and violated the Wisconsin constitution. The court \nstated, ``We do not object to the existence of parochial schools or \nthat they attempt to spread their beliefs through the schools. They \njust cannot do it with State dollars.''\n  On August 22, the Wisconsin State Court of Appeals affirmed by a 2 to \n1 vote that the expansion of the State voucher program to include \nreligious schools was unconstitutional under the Wisconsin \nconstitution.\n  On May 1, 1997, the Ohio Tenth Appellate Court unanimously reversed \nthe trial court's decision to allow public money to be paid to \nreligious schools. The appellate court held that the voucher program \nviolated the separation of church and state under both the United \nStates and Ohio Constitutions. And the court ruled that the voucher \nprogram ``steers aid to sectarian schools, resulting in what amounts to \na direct Government subsidy.''\n\n  On June 27, 1997, a Vermont State superior court held that the use of \nvouchers to pay tuition at private religious schools violates both the \nU.S. and Vermont constitutions. The courts are clear on the \nunconstitutionality of vouchers for religious schools, and Congress \nshould abide by their rules, too.\n  These are all judgments that have been made within the last year \nunder State constitutions and the Federal Constitution in terms of how \nthis particular proposal would be unconstitutional.\n  Instead of subsidizing private schools, we need to support ways to \nimprove and reform the public schools. That is the basic point, Mr. \nPresident. Instead of subsidizing private schools, we need to support \nways to improve and reform the public schools--not in a few schools but \nin all schools, not for a few students but for all students. That is \nthe challenge.\n  Supporting a few children at the expense of the many divides \ncommunities. The Federal Government should help rebuild communities, \nnot undermine them. We should make investments that help all children \nin all the neighborhood schools to get a good, safe education. I think \nthat is the heart of the argument against this amendment.\n  So far, Mr. President, in this debate, we have been focusing on this \nparticular chart. Hopefully, we as a body could agree that we do not \nwant to abandon our public schools; we do not want to undermine the \ncommunities. As we mentioned, this particular proposal only funds a few \nat the expense of many--about 3 percent of the total students. It gives \nscarce Federal dollars to schools that can exclude children. Unlike the \npublic school system, private schools can exclude children. The choice \nis not made by the parents or the children; it is made by the schools. \nAnd we have given examples of how that is being done. We ignore the \nvoter will. When vouchers were put to a vote here in the District of \nColumbia, they were rejected 8 to 1. The issue has not come up on the \nballot again since then. All the public commentary by religious and \nother elected officials reflects that same position even today. And \nvouchers raise the constitutional problems which have been addressed, \nMr. President, not just academically but in several States which have \ntried to adopt similar kinds of programs.\n  Many of us feel that the use of vouchers to subsidize parents who \nsend their children to private schools is a serious mistake because it \nis a statement that encourages parents to abandon the public schools, \nnot to work to improve them.\n  Vouchers are a bad idea for school reform, but they are far from the \nonly idea, and what I want to do, Mr. President, is review briefly a \nnumber of the ideas that have been working here in the District of \nColumbia to improve the academic achievement of many\n\n[[Page S9932]]\n\nstudents. These ideas serve as an alternative to the unwise proposal to \nprovide vouchers.\n  There are many worthwhile ideas for reform that deserve broad support \nin Congress. I have listened to the debate, and people are just \nthrowing up their hands and saying, ``We have problems in these \nschools. Let's just try vouchers,'' rather than being serious and \nlooking at what is being attempted in many of these schools and what \nresults they are achieving, evaluating where this additional money \ncould go to benefit the most children. That is the test, I would think, \nthat this voucher amendment fails.\n  So we know what works, Mr. President, in school reform. We know what \nteachers need to do to do their jobs well. We need higher standards, \nbetter trained teachers, up-to-date classrooms, safe facilities. These \nare commonsense, doable solutions, and we ought to be doing much more \nto implement them.\n  For example, Milwaukee taxpayers have spent $7 million on the voucher \nprogram. The program shows no academic gains for the 1,600 students \ninvolved. But for that same amount they could have put what they call a \nSuccess For All Program in place, which has a solid track record of \nhelping poor children learn more. And it would have benefited every \nelementary school in that city.\n  Instead of spending $7 million in the District of Columbia on a \nprivate school subsidy that has no proven track record of improving \nacademic achievement and could help at most 2,000 children, we should \ninvestigate the strategies that work for all children. The conclusion \nis obvious. We should choose the 100-percent solution, not the 3-\npercent solution.\n  Some D.C. schools have already restructured their facilities, \nimproved teacher training, extended the school day, and enhanced \nfamily-centered learning. And they are getting results. We should make \nsure that every school and community has the resources to put into \npractice what works, so that no child is left out or left behind.\n  There are serious problems in the Nation's public schools--especially \nin urban areas. We can do much more to turn troubled schools around, \nand undertake a wide range of proven reforms to create and sustain safe \nand high-performing schools. There are no panaceas to improve schools \nand improve student learning. There is no blank check. That is why we \nneed to use our limited resources wisely, to get the most benefit for \nour tax dollars.\n  Improving student performance starts with a focus on the basics--\nsafety, discipline, high standards, and parent involvement. Sustained \nimprovement must be based on what works, and what is supported by \nparents, educators, and the larger community. Research shows that \nstudent achievement can best be improved by supporting a comprehensive \nset of district-level and school-level reforms. General Becton's plan \nsupports these reforms, and we should too.\n  I refer up here to restructuring the whole school. Let me just \ndevelop that.\n  Greater school autonomy, when coupled with performance \naccountability, can contribute to conditions that make better learning \npossible. School leaders and teachers can exercise greater control over \ntheir school and have a greater sense of personal responsibility for \nits success. If teachers are to act as professionals and not as robots, \nthey need to be given responsibility for making professional decisions \nregarding classroom practice and school policy. Holding students to \nhigher standards requires that adults accept higher responsibility for \nimproving student performance.\n  The Walker Jones Elementary School in northwest Washington is working \nwith the Laboratory for Student Success using Community for Learning, a \nresearch-based reform model--and it's working. The concept is called \nwhole school reform. With increased and more intensive teacher training \nin proven methods and materials geared toward better student learning, \nstudent test scores have improved. After 6 months in the program, the \nschool raised its ranking in the District on reading scores from 99th \nin 1996, to 36th in 1997. In math, the school climbed from 81st in the \nDistrict to 18th--dramatic, significant academic achievement and \nperformance.\n  Another result of this reform will be increased accountability \nthroughout the D.C. school system, with better performance measures and \nclear incentives and consequences for administrators, teachers, and \nstudents. Evaluations of teachers and principals will be tied to \nachievement, and schools that fail to demonstrate improvement will be \nput on probation.\n  The principles of Success for All have now been introduced into 475 \nschools in 31 States. Evaluations show that students in this program \ntend to perform about 3 months ahead of control students by the end of \nfirst grade and by more than a year ahead by the end of fifth grade.\n  What we are finding out in 475 schools across the country is that the \nimpact that this approach is having in improving academic performance \nis not just on one or two children in a class, but on all the children. \nThis is the kind of thing we should give attention to and give support \nto.\n  A second basic principle of school reform involves organizing schools \naround a clearer focus on educational excellence for all students, and \nan academic orientation that challenges all students to master basic \nand advanced skills in reading, math, and other core subjects.\n  The voucher program flunks this test. Five years of evaluations by \nProf. John F. Witte of the University of Wisconsin-Madison show no \nachievement difference between voucher students and comparable \nMilwaukee public school students.\n  By contrast, in the D.C. public schools, under a new promotion policy \nbeginning this school year, students in grades three and eight must \nhave at least basic reading skills before advancing to a higher grade. \nThis requirement reflects a new commitment by the District to ensure \nthat all children master their basic studies. The District has mandated \na 90 minute literacy period for direct instruction each day and \nsuggested additional silent reading times each day. That is giving \nemphasis, giving priority in local schools to the area that is basic to \nlearning any other possible subject matter, and that is reading. With \nall respect to computer--reading.\n  In addition to mastering basic skills, children need to be challenged \nwith a rigorous curriculum. One of the most effective choices that \nparents and students can make is to choose to take more challenging \nacademic courses.\n  It works. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that public school \nreform efforts that include high standards and rigorous courses can \nimprove achievement for the majority of students in the public schools. \nStates and local communities that have set more challenging standards \nare seeing substantial gains in student achievement.\n  New York City's College preparatory initiative, mandating more \nrigorous science and mathematics courses, has resulted in the best-\nprepared class to enter the City University of New York since 1970. \nElementary schools in the city are showing a 4-year rise in test \nscores. The number of Hispanic and black students who pass the science \ntest more than doubled between 1993 and 1994. There are the result. The \nwhole class is moving up. The whole entry class for the City College of \nNew York is moving up in academic achievement, based on this particular \nNew York College preparatory initiative.\n  A great deal of attention has been paid this fall to the problem of \nroof repairs in the D.C. public schools. Far less attention has been \npaid to the fact that beginning this fall all public schools in the \nDistrict will have new content and higher performance standards to \ndefine what every child in expected to learn and do. D.C. public \nschools are committed to helping all children meet these standards.\n  The second point is foster world-class instruction. In addition, in \norder for students' performance to improve, teachers must be able to \nteach to higher standards. They must know the content of the curriculum \nand the best teaching methods for helping students to learn in \ngenuinely challenging courses.\n  Teachers today, however, are not getting the training they need. One \nof the best programs we have, the Eisenhower Math-Science Training \nProgram--a hands-on program to upgrade the skills of teachers in our \nhigh schools--has\n\n[[Page S9933]]\n\njust been block granted under the Gorton amendment, just been wiped off \nthe books. We don't know what they are going to do with that money when \nit is distributed all over the country, but we know what a difference \nthat funding makes to every one of those math and science teachers in \nevery one of those communities that have benefited from this valuable \nteacher training program.\n  Math and science students in inner-city schools have only a 50-\npercent chance of being taught by a teacher qualified to teach these \nsubjects.\n  Seven years ago, 53 percent of D.C. teachers were not certified. By \nlast year, the number had dropped to 33 percent. In 1997, all new \nteachers are certified, and existing teachers must be certified by \nJanuary 1998 or risk dismissal.\n  Extending the school day can also be effective. In addition to \nhelping in education, it can also help to create safe havens for \nstudents in unsafe neighborhoods.\n  A recent report by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention shows that while violent youth crime is rising rapidly, \nchildren are safer in schools than anywhere else. To create a safer, \nmore disciplined, and drug-free environment for children, we need to \nplace more emphasis on hours spent outside school. After school \nprograms that keep children off the street are a powerful and \nconstructive answer to the serious problems of delinquency that plague \nso many communities. I would say even with regard to unwanted teenage \npregnancies, the Centers for Disease Control's study shows that about \n65 or 70 percent of these incidents take place in the after-school \nhours.\n  This step can work effectively even in individual schools. At the \nSpingarn School in northeast Washington, the principal made student \nsafety the first priority. Mr. President, 740 students attend the \nafter-school day program and 500 students attend the night program. The \nschool was a safe haven for students.\n  Drug and violence prevention programs also keep students focused on \nlearning. Students who break school rules are not dumped on the street \nwhere they are likely to become perpetrators or victims of violence. \nInstead, they are placed in separate programs in the school where their \neducation is not interrupted.\n  We also know that the more time children spend learning, the more \nthey will learn. Programs that extend the school day or the school week \ncan enhance academic achievement. The District of Columbia has created \nso-called Saturday academies for students who read below grade level. \nThe Saturday curriculum reinforces the weekday instruction, and \nbenefits from a reduced student-teacher ratio.\n  I can remember when those Saturday programs were first suggested and \nthe uniform impression was: Why bother with it? People won't show up. \nParents won't bother. They would rather take the children, if they are \nnot working, to do something else.\n  That is just hogwash. When those classrooms opened, on Saturday \nespecially, parents made sure their children took advantage of it. And \nthat has been the case overwhelmingly.\n  In the programs that developed with the Saturday curriculum, we have \nseen a much better student-teacher ratio and we have seen extremely \nimportant progress made.\n  Schools in Massachusetts are benefiting from these ideas. The Timilty \nMiddle School in Roxbury, MA was long known for its low test scores and \nhigh rates for suspending students. Project Promise was established, \nincluding an extended school day program to increase the amount of time \nthat students spend in class. School attendance rose, math and reading \nskills improved, and suspension rates dropped significantly. As a \nresult, the Timilty Middle School was recently cited as an exemplary \nschool by the U.S. Department of Education. It was a dramatic change in \nthe turning around of that school.\n  Finally, school reform must include greater family involvement. \nThirty years of research shows that family involvement in children's \nlearning is a critical link in achieving a high quality education and \nsafe, disciplined learning for every student. Schools can reach out to \nparents and community members. Together they can develop a shared \ncommitment to excellence for all students, and work in partnership to \nreach their goals. Family-centered services can be provided that \ninclude literacy training for parents, and teaching parents how to help \ntheir children with their homework. When teachers and parents work \nclosely together, children can learn more effectively.\n  The Nalle School in the District of Columbia and the Freddie Mack \nFoundation are working together to create the District's first full \nservice community school to address the wide range of family needs. \nWorking with service organizations, parents and educators, and \ncommunity leaders, the school is becoming a major hub of community \nactivity, bringing the parents in, finding out what needs the parents \nhave, and providing them with the instruments to help and assist the \nchildren move to higher academic achievement and accomplishment. And it \nis working. It is working if schools and communities have the \nresources.\n  Can we have a chance to go through each of these different proposals \nat greater length at another time?\n  I know others want to speak to this, and we have limited time this \nafternoon, but we will have a chance to go through this in greater \ndetail, I am sure, at some time, Mr. President.\n  If schools and communities have the resources to choose effective \nways, such as these, to ensure all children have an opportunity to \nreach higher academic standards, schools will be able to offer real \nalternatives to students and parents while maintaining the kind of \naccountability that is fundamental to ensure a good education.\n  Congress can be part of these efforts, too. Instead of debating \ndivisive ideological schemes like vouchers, that undermine the public \nschools and ignore 97 percent of the children, we can invest in what \nworks and make school reform work for 100 percent of the children in \nthe District of Columbia and in every community.\n  Good education begins with decent places to learn. Yet, too many of \nour public schools across the Nation are falling apart, and that is \nwrong.\n  I have a chart that reflects exactly what the situation is for the \nDistrict of Columbia. D.C. schools have more hazardous conditions than \nthe national average. This chart shows that District of Columbia \nschools' exterior walls and windows fail to meet the minimum standards \nin terms of safety and quality.\n  Roof conditions are also much worse than the national average, \nalthough this number has improved somewhat because of the action that \nhas taken place in the past 2 to 3 weeks.\n  Heating and ventilation systems in D.C. schools have twice the \nproblems that we have for the national average.\n  Plumbing, twice the problems.\n  Electric lighting, twice the problems that they have.\n  Life-safety codes, two and a half, three times the problems that they \nhave.\n  Power for technology, again, well behind the curve, Mr. President.\n  So these problems are severe in the District schools. Sixty-seven \npercent of the public schools have crumbling roofs--although as I \nmentioned, there has been some change in the recent weeks--but only 27 \npercent of the schools across the country suffer from the problem.\n  I daresay, if you want to look at the national standards, they are \nnot all that great. In Boston, there are a number of schools in the \nwintertime, anywhere from 15 to 18 schools, that do not open because of \nvarious heating problems every day.\n  The situation in Boston has improved somewhat under Mayor Menino and \nTom Payzant. But go to the older towns of New Bedford, Fall River, \nLowell, Lawrence, Holyoke, Springfield, North Adams, and many of the \nother smaller communities also on the north shore, and you find \nproblems similar to those of the D.C. schools.\n  So the national average is not a very positive test. Senator Moseley-\nBraun has been the leader in the U.S. Senate in recognizing that unless \nfacilities are suitable for learning purposes, we disadvantage children \nto such an extraordinary degree. Not just because there are no \ntextbooks available or because it is colder in the wintertime, but the \npoint that she has made, and I think so powerfully and effectively, is \nwhat it does to a child who goes into a classroom that is in such a \nstate of deterioration. We say education is important.\n\n[[Page S9934]]\n\n People in the communities say education is important. The children \nevery single day go into these dilapidated conditions where they are \nnot able to get the school books they need, where the roofs are \nleaking, windows won't close, where they don't have adequate heating, \nwhere they don't have the electrical outlets for computers. Mr. \nPresident, what kind of message is it sending to those children when we \nare out there putting increasing demands on those children? That is \nsomething for which I think we as a society pay a very heavy price. But \nthat is another issue for another time.\n  The point is, we tried to mention the places the $7 million could be \nused that would enhance the academic achievement and accomplishments of \na great number of the students.\n  The school facilities, as I mentioned, across the country are in poor \ncondition. It is a national problem. Water damage from an old boiler \nhas caused so much wall deterioration in one D.C. junior high school \nthat the entire wing has been condemned. Leaking roofs have been \ncausing ceilings to crumble on teachers' and students' desks. Fire \ndoors are warped shut. Some schools are sweltering in hot weather \nbecause they lack air-conditioning. Others are so poorly insulated that \nstudents must wear coats indoors in the winter.\n  According to D.C. public schools, $87 million was needed to make the \ncritical repairs necessary to ensure all schools would be ready to open \nfor the 1997-98 period. Yet, only $50 million was appropriated to \nrepair the schools. Requests for additional funding were initially \ndenied by Congress and only made available at the last minute. So \nCongress deserves part of the responsibility for the crisis that was \ncaused by the recent 3-week delay in the opening of the schools.\n  Isn't that wonderful? Here we are trying to tell the District of \nColumbia what they ought to do with scarce resources, and we were late \nin putting the money up so they could open in the first place, \ndisadvantaging all of those children. Mr. President, we do not have a \ngood enough record to dictate to the District of Columbia on education \nor on most other items.\n  D.C. schools need much more repair. Any funding that we invest should \nbe spent on improving the public schools for students. We should not be \ndiverting the Federal dollars to pay subsidies for the private schools \nwhen public schools have such pressing, urgent needs. It is \npreposterous to pretend that we can prepare for the 21st century in \ndilapidated 19th century classrooms.\n  Improving educational opportunities for all children deserves the \nhighest priority at every level of Government and in every community \nacross the Nation. Educating our youth is one of our Nation's most \nimportant responsibilities. If we fail to make sound investments in \neducation, few other investments will make much difference for our \ncountry and its role in the world in the years ahead.\n  In meeting the educational needs of children, we must allocate scarce \nresources wisely. We know what works. We must make sure that every \nchild has access to it. We should not give public funds to schools that \ncan exclude children. We should invest in public schools so that all \nchildren have the opportunity for a good education. We should rebuild \ncommunities, not divide them. Communities across the country are \nworking hard to improve their public schools, and Congress should help \nthem to do more as well, not make their current troubles worse. We \nshould create improved conditions in all schools for all children, and \nwe should start with safe buildings, decent roofs, good plumbing, and \nclassrooms equipped for the 21st century of learning.\n  Mr. President, what could we do with the $7 million? We can improve \nthe infrastructure with that $7 million. It could buy 368 new boilers \nfor D.C. schools. There are 157 schools, and at least with regard to \ntrying to make sure that they have hot water and heating systems, we \ncould do much for the D.C. schools.\n  We could rewire 65 schools that don't have the capacity to \naccommodate computers and multimedia equipment. We have in the budget \nabout $300 million a year for new technology, technology grants to try \nto help assist local communities with new computers. Why don't we go \nahead and wire some of the schools so at least they will be able to \nparticipate in these new kinds of technologies? Why don't we train the \nteachers to be able to use those technologies in a way that can \nintegrate computers into the curriculum and give these children an \nopportunity so that they are going to be able to compete in the future? \nWe could rewire 65 schools.\n  We could upgrade the plumbing in 102 schools with substandard \nfacilities. We see the problem here, the challenge. We have double the \nproblems in just basic fundamental plumbing in the schools. We could \nupgrade the plumbing in over 100 of those schools so that we can make \nsome difference, again in terms of infrastructure. That $7 million can \ndo a lot for infrastructure.\n\n  What could $7 million do to support other programs that are \ndemonstrating enhanced academic achievement? The few that I mentioned--\nand at another opportunity, I will go into more detail on some others--\n$1 million would buy 66,000 new hard-cover books for the D.C. school \nlibraries. That is very important. If you look at what is available in \nthose D.C. libraries and compare them to libraries in schools all over \nthe country, you will find them dramatically shortchanged. We have a \nreal opportunity to make a difference in the libraries of schools all \nover the District, and we could have an important impact in making sure \nthat each student is going to have the textbooks which they require in \nthe classroom. They don't have those today.\n  Here we are talking about spending $7 million to give vouchers to \n2,000 students when the other students who are left back in the \nclassroom don't even have the textbooks to be able to follow what is \ngoing on in the classroom. Maybe we will hear other testimony, I am \nsure we will, about the miracles of vouchers in improving academic \nachievement for students, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments \nmade in the course of this debate. To the contrary; we can take \nadditional time and demonstrate where the various reviews have failed.\n  Mr. President, $1 million would fully fund after-school programs in \n25 schools; $7 million would fund after-school programs in every one of \nthe District of Columbia schools and benefit every child--every child--\nnot just 3 percent; every child.\n  In any fair evaluation about what is happening in these after-school \nprograms, we must note what a difference these programs have meant, \nwhen we tie them in to academic help and assistance, in advancing \nstudents' academic achievements and accomplishments and in improving \ninterest in school and attendance rates. The programs are reducing \nabsenteeism and keeping children safe and secure and beginning to \nchallenge and open up new opportunities of learning for children. You \nwould be able to do this with the $7 million for every school in the \nDistrict of Columbia. But, no, we are going to take 3 percent of those \nchildren and give them a voucher with which they may or may not be able \nto get into some school, not which their parents are going to be able \nto get them into, or not that the child is going to be able to get \ninto, but the school is going to make that judgment and decision.\n  Mr. President, $3.5 million would link 58 more schools to research, \nimproving designs and improving day-to-day instructions. Those are the \nother kinds of programs that I referred to earlier in my comments.\n  I certainly hope that this amendment will not be accepted. We too \noften around here look for easy answers to tough, complicated problems. \nRecently, if we find out we have a problem, more often than not we \npropose a constitutional amendment to deal with it. We have more \nconstitutional amendments pending in the Judiciary Committee in this \nCongress than in the history of the country. We have gotten to where we \nthink if we just pass a constitutional amendment, all of these problems \nare going to be resolved.\n  We are not going to be able to deal with all of the problems that all \nof us understand are out there in the public school system on the \ncheap. It is going to be tough, difficult work. Money in and of itself \nis not the only answer. In many instances, you can probably get a much \nbetter and higher grade education with the amount of resources\n\n[[Page S9935]]\n\nthat are being expended. We understand that. We know that. But, \nnonetheless, what we are talking about here with this particular \namendment is a reflection of our priorities--of our priorities.\n\n  How are we going to spend that $7 million? Are we going to prioritize \n3 percent of those children with a program that I believe is \nunconstitutional? And perhaps those that defend it are going to be able \nto make a case to respond to what is happening up in Wisconsin and what \nhas happened in Vermont and other States that have struck down vouchers \nover the last year--maybe they will be able to sustain it. Perhaps they \nwill be able to make the case with those 3 percent of children going to \nthese private schools, that they are demonstrating what a breakthrough \nkind of academic brilliance that they are able to achieve and \naccomplish, and we are going to find the whole country is going to be \nshaken by this experience and we are going to do something dramatic \nabout it.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, those that have demonstrated over the \ncourse of their lives--some with more success than others--know that \nthis is hard, tough work, that it is a combination of elements.\n  Children are not going to learn if there is disruption in those \nclassrooms, if the classrooms are not safe. Children are not going to \nlearn if they go to school hungry during the course of the day. \nChildren are not going to learn if they do not have the textbooks. \nChildren are not going to learn if they have an inadequately trained \nteacher. Children are not going to learn if they know that their walls \nare crumbling down and they do not have light.\n  Just like the children are not going to learn if they have hearing \nproblems or if they have vision problems or if they have some asthmatic \nproblems--they are sick.\n  One of the benefits that we have taken care of, hopefully, in the \nrecent action here, is to try and make sure that children are going to \nget the preventative health care so that when they go in there at least \nthey are going to be healthy children when they go to those classrooms.\n  We know some of the things that inhibit children from learning. We do \nnot know all the things that enhance their academic achievement, but we \nknow some. And we know some of the ones that have a proven record, \ndemonstrable record, with solid results.\n  The question that the Senate is going to have to ask is, are we going \nto try this kind of a program here for $7 million when we can invest \nthat $7 million in some of the programs here in the District, \nreplicating the ones here in the districts that the parents want, that \nthe teachers know have been successful, that have been carefully \nevaluated, that will benefit the greatest number of children? Or are we \ngoing to reach down from Olympus and say, ``OK, we here in the Senate \nare deciding for you, even though you don't want it. We're going to \nexperiment here. We can't pass this kind of legislation back in our own \nStates where it's been defeated at times that it has gone before the \nelectorate, but we're going to try it on you here. We have $7 million. \nAnd in spite of the fact that your religious leaders, your business \nleaders, your elected leaders do not want that, and want it invested in \nthese other programs, that's too bad. That's too bad on this. We're \njust going to say, `You're going to have to have it because we want to \nexperiment with it.' We want to try and find some silver bullet to \nsolve this problem''?\n  I hope, Mr. President, that this amendment is not accepted.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 14 \nminutes, the Senator from Indiana 57 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I very much want to respond--and so does \nSenator Lieberman--to some of Senator Kennedy's remarks. But our \ncolleague, Senator Craig, has been very patiently waiting. I yield to \nhim up to 7 minutes or as much time as he consumes short of that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my colleague \nfrom Indiana for yielding.\n  I have been sitting here for the last 35 or 40 minutes listening to \nwhat is a truly sincere statement by the Senator from Massachusetts as \nit relates to the state and the condition of the D.C. school system.\n  He has left up a chart that recognizes seven categories of \ndilapidation that have resulted in the D.C. schools not opening on time \nthis year. If you were to look at that chart, and all of the statistics \nof the D.C. school system separate from the rest of the country, you \nwould say, ``My goodness, what happened? Why didn't we give them the \nmoney to fix the doors, the windows, the electrical, the plumbing, the \nphysical structures of the school system? What happened?''\n  Mr. President, they had the money. They were given the money. I do \nnot know what happened other than to say, they blew the money, they \nfailed. By every measurement, the D.C. public school system is at the \nbottom. And that is a tragedy.\n  You can defend the status quo and argue you have to pour more money \nin. But even the Senator from Massachusetts agrees, it isn't \nnecessarily a money issue.\n  Well, then for goodness sakes, what is it? Is it a new program, a \nspecial program, a great idea, an infusion of a new concept that will \nturn this public school system around?\n  Many examples have been cited in one school system or another across \nthis country by the Senator from Massachusetts over the last 40 \nminutes; and yet he condemns a program or an idea that is embodied in \nthis amendment. It tries to do something very important to a failed \nsystem--inject it with a competitive idea that forces a new thinking \nthat must be allowed to happen.\n  I must tell you, if the schools of Idaho had the kind of money that \nthe schools of the District of Columbia have, because we provide--and I \ndo not say this with any pride--nearly $2,500 less per student than the \nDistrict schools get here, and if we had the measurement of the \nstandards and the failures of this school system, the Idaho system \nwould have been changed dramatically years ago. You have heard the \ncomparisons I am referencing.\n  Last year, 72 percent of D.C.'s eighth graders in public school \nscored below the basic proficiencies in math, and 29 percent failed to \nmeet basic proficiencies in reading; and yet they got $2,500 more per \nstudent than the Idaho students, and our scores are among the top in \nthe country.\n  I do not mean to be pounding my chest about Idaho schools. I want to \nsee our educators get more money and I want to see more money put into \nIdaho schools. But it is fair and it is important that we compare a \nfailed system with a performing system and the dollars and cents \ninvolved, and to argue, as we must, that it is not a money issue. And \nit isn't. And we know that.\n  And this voucher amendment isn't to do with money. It is to do with \nthe ability of parents to be able to decide what is best for their \nchildren and to have the flexibility to move on that decision.\n  Why has education, Mr. President, been nearly every person in this \ncountry's No. 1 choice in the public polling of our country over the \nlast decade when asked, ``What's the most important issue on your \nmind?'' Not because it is so good--we are oftentimes reminded of quite \nthe opposite. It is because the public school systems of our country \nare in trouble. Parents are concerned about the quality of education \nour children get, their children get and their futures.\n  When you can't guarantee safety--and the District schools can't; when \nyou can't guarantee discipline--and the District schools can't; when \nyou can't guarantee high standards--and the District schools can't; you \nfail. If there were an opportunity for the children of the District to \ngo somewhere else, there would be one of the greatest educational \nexoduses in the history of this country. That is not going to happen.\n\n  But what this voucher amendment offers is some reasonable \nunderstanding that we ought to try to make a difference. It isn't some \ngrand experiment, not at all. It is, without question, an idea whose \ntime has come, an\n\n[[Page S9936]]\n\nidea to inject a competitive environment into a monopolistic system \nthat at the very best creates the lowest common denominator. That is \nnot good enough for the young people of this District, and it is not \ngood enough for any young person anywhere in this country.\n  The good side about the District schools not opening happened in my \noffice over the last 3 weeks. A young lady who is a junior at Eastern \nHigh School here in the District came to intern in my office, Kimberly, \na delightful young lady. We learned a lot from her; and I think she \nlearned a lot from us.\n  But she did say this to me as she left to go back to school. \n``Senator Craig, I think I've learned more here in 3 weeks than I'll \nlearn in a full semester in my school.'' She was being kind, but the \nproblem is, I look at the statistics of the school she attends and \nshe's right, she's accurate. This young lady deserves every opportunity \npossible that the public school system should offer her and yet it does \nnot.\n  She said, ``Can I come back to your office? Can I be a part of your \noffice, because I know that I can learn a great deal? And I'll do extra \ntime so I can do that.'' And we are going to see if we can make that \nhappen.\n  School choice--that is what we are talking about today--transfers \npower over basic education away from the bureaucrat and to the parent. \nI suggest that the failures of the District system are a clear \nreflection of the bureaucrats having had that opportunity.\n  Nobody dare defend a school system where 40 percent of ninth graders \ndrop out or leave before graduation or where only 50 percent of \neducation expenditures go toward instruction, compared to 62 percent \nnationally.\n  Mr. President, we wouldn't tolerate failures such as this in my \nState, and we shouldn't except them in the Nation's capital.\n  Allowing for school choice is a viable solution to the woes of the \nDistrict's schools. This amendment is a reasonable and appropriate \nanswer to this crisis. This measure would provide scholarships to over \n2,000 public school students, the poorest of the city's poor. These \nscholarships could be spent to attend any private or public school in \nthe District or the neighboring counties of Maryland and Virginia. Most \nimportantly, scholarships would be targeted to the poorest students, \nthose living below or near the poverty line.\n  Opponents of the measure make one argument: school choice diverts \nmoney away from public schools for the benefit of a few students. \nHowever, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  This measure would not cost the public school system anything--not $1 \nwould leave the public school system. The funding is entirely new \nmoney--taken from an increase in the Federal Government's contribution \nto the city's debt.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is being asked to make a choice \nbetween the status quo and real reform. I thank Senator Coats, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Brownback, Senator Landrieu for offering us this \nopportunity to debate school choice.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is all about kids and a failing \nsystem and the responsibility of this country and its policymakers to \nmake the difference, because it is a public educational school system. \nWe are not going to worry about the private system. It competes. It has \nto be good or it will not get the kids.\n  But the public school system does not have to be good because the \nkids that cannot afford to get out of it have to go to it. We should \nnot sit here and pound our chests and talk about all the good things \nbecause we need to correct the bad things. And that way a very \nimportant public education system will be better. It is good in a lot \nof places around the country. It is bad here in the District of \nColumbia, and we ought not hold anybody prisoner to that idea.\n\n  Let's give parents and students a fighting chance--let's give them a \nchoice and a future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. I yield such time as she may consume to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized,\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words. I will be brief \nbecause I know a number of people have opinions on this subject. But, \nMr. President, I think we are talking about the future of public \neducation. I have heard people say, why not just improve public \neducation? That is what we are trying to do. That is the bottom line of \nwhat this amendment is trying to do--introduce some new idea, introduce \na new way of trying to improve public education by having competition \nin our system.\n  Mr. President, what makes America America, what makes America \ndifferent from other countries in the world has always been our \ncommitment to quality public education so that every child in our \ncountry would have the opportunity, with a full range of public \neducation, to fulfill his or her potential.\n  I am a product of public education. I think it is important that we \nhave the quality so that a person like me can stand on the floor with a \nperson like Senator Kennedy who has had quality private education. In \norder to do that, I think it is important that we have new ideas \nbecause, as they say in my home State, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.''\n  This is broken. The District of Columbia schools spend more money per \nstudent than any school in America, and yet steadily we have seen the \ndecline of the quality of education as judged by the scores on tests.\n  So more money is clearly not the answer. Maybe some competition, \nmaybe letting the mother of a 10-year-old boy who is going to a school \nthat may or may not be open because of fire codes, that may not be able \nto educate this child because he is being offered drugs on the school \ngrounds, give that mother a chance to do something different for her \nchild, and that is to give her child a chance with a voucher to go \nsomewhere else for competition. And then perhaps, if this works as a \ntest, it might be something that we can do in low- and moderate-income \nareas all over our country. Maybe that is a new idea that might work.\n\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that is a field test for another \nway to try to improve our public education system, which I think \neveryone in the U.S. Senate wants to do. But why are we not open to a \nnew idea? Why wouldn't we say if any place deserves a try, it is this \ncommunity, the District of Columbia, where we see the test scores go \ndown in relation to the Federal money that has gone in. Let's try \nsomething new. This is the perfect place to do it.\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana, the Senator from Connecticut, and \nall those who are cosponsoring this innovative idea so we can have a \ntest market to give every child a chance to have a great public \neducation by introducing a choice. With that competition, encouraging \nevery public school to come up in standards to attract those vouchers \nthat would provide that quality public education that we have \nguaranteed to our people for the last 221 years in this country, and \nwhich if we are going to remain the greatest country on Earth, must be \nthe hallmark of our freedom--a quality public education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take one moment to ask \nSenator Hutchison--I understand this issue about vouchers was actually \nconsidered by the Texas legislature this year and was actually \nrejected. That is part of the problem that many of us have.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I say perhaps, for once, maybe Washington could teach \nus a lesson.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Touche.\n  I mention to my friend from Idaho before he leaves, we acknowledge \nthe previous failure that he had outlined here very eloquently this \nafternoon when we established the control board. The D.C. school chief \nexecutive officer, General Becton, has had 10 months to enact changes. \nIn that short time, they have consolidated and closed 12 school \nbuildings, hired only certified teachers, established annual testing \nfor all students, and set standards for teachers and principals.\n  They have only been in effect for 10 months and here we already are \nchanging and interfering with their priority. I think for the reasons \nthat the Senator has pointed out--there has been this dramatic change \nin terms of the leadership, those that are trying to\n\n[[Page S9937]]\n\nprovide new leadership, and here we are in the Congress trying to \nsecond-guess.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate what the Senator from Massachusetts said. I \nthink all of us are extremely excited about what we hope will happen \nhere in the District. And, of course, you and I have both used the \nfigures that demonstrate the failure of this system.\n  What I think we offer today is an enhancement and an accelerated \nopportunity to assist in what is underway. I appreciate what the \nSenator is saying.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his leadership, for his consistency, and for his \noutstanding advocacy on behalf of children in this country. I think it \nis fair to say, and everyone who hears my voice will recognize, there \nis no one that Ted Kennedy takes second place to when it comes to \nfighting for children. He has been a leader and continues to be.\n  I am so pleased to have this opportunity to join him in strong \nopposition to this voucher proposal. Let me touch for a moment on what \nI see as the central flaw with this voucher proposal--whether it is for \nthe District of Columbia or any other school system. Voucher programs \nfor elementary and secondary education presume that a market-based \nsolution will solve problems that exist within our public education \nsystem.\n  We have heard a lot about competition in the system. That suggests \nthat there will be a meeting in the marketplace and that quality will \nrise out of that competition, out of that meeting of forces in the \nmarketplace. I point out to anyone listening, if you think about it for \na moment, markets by definition have winners and losers. The question \nthen becomes whether or not we can afford to impose a market-based \nsolution where the welfare of all of our children is involved. We \ncannot afford in this country any losers in a game of educational \nroulette, or, as much to the point, in an approach to what for all \nintents and purposes is an educational triage in which only those \nyoungsters who have the family structure, who have the ability, can \nretreat from the public school system, leaving whatever else is behind.\n  It is very interesting, by the way, that a lot of the discussion goes \nto providing poor children with options. The fact of the matter is that \npublic education in this country excelled precisely because it wasn't \njust about poor children. It was about providing quality education to \nany child of whatever wealth, from whatever communities, whether their \nparents were engaged with their education or whether their parents were \nfound lying in a gutter somewhere. A child who had more talents than \nmeans could access quality education because our system supported \nquality public education.\n  Education is about more than an individual's ability to get trained \nfor a good job, although certainly that is one of the benefits of it. \nWe are very clear, without education individuals are handicapped when \nit comes to the job market.\n  The point has to be made, and made over and over again, that it is \nmore than about just individuals. Education is a public good as well. \nIt is a private benefit, to be sure, but it is also a public good. It \nis something that affects our entire community. It affects the quality \nof life in our community. It affects everything from health status to \nvoter behavior, to whether or not individuals, or whether or not \ncommunities, will support our democracy and appreciate the higher \nvalues of our community.\n  Quality public education has shaped our democracy. It created a \nstrong middle class. It propelled our country to the top of the world's \neconomic pyramid. The rungs of the ladder of opportunity in our country \nhave historically been crafted in the classroom. I think our generation \nhas an obligation to see to it that the legacy of quality public \neducation is not abandoned and, as much to the point, is not diluted by \nefforts, such as this one, to divert resources and divert support away \nfrom the public education system.\n  The reason that we have compulsory education in this country is not \nso that every child can access the best education that his or her \nparents can afford or find, but so that every child can receive a \nquality education. If our public schools are not meeting that \nchallenge, then it is our responsibility to fix those schools. A \nfederally funded voucher program would not fix a single public \nschool. In fact, if anything, this effort represents a retreat from the \nchallenge of making our schools work for every child, making our \nschools rise to the level of excellence that as a community we have \nevery right to expect.\n\n  Vouchers represent putting individuals over the interests of the \nwhole community. Vouchers necessarily will benefit only a small \npercentage, a small number of students. Consider for a moment there are \nroughly 46 million public school students and 6 million private school \nstudents. Any large-scale voucher program would obviously overwhelm the \nprivate schools. Advocates claim that entrepreneurs would start up \nhigh-quality schools to meet the demand. Just look at the potential for \nabuse and ask yourself the question, what do we do when we look up and \ndiscover a whole slew of less-than-quality school facilities in which \npeople's only objective is to make money? There is no reason to think \nthat by providing this spinoff of resources from public education that \nwe would wind up with a system that was any better.\n  Supporters of the voucher proposals claim they would help the \nneediest children the most. I submit that both research, experience, \nand common sense suggest otherwise. Researchers have concluded that \nacademically and socially disadvantaged students are less likely to \nbenefit from school voucher programs. It is amazing to me that the \nacademic research on this subject has not gotten more attention. \nVoucher programs in other countries where they have had such programs \nconfirm this research, that, indeed, the voucher approach, spinning off \nfrom the public school system, has led to economic as well as social \nsegregation of students. Instead of narrowing the gap between wealthy \nand poor, instead of narrowing the gap between communities of students, \nthe voucher proposals when implemented had the effect of widening the \ngap. I don't think we want in our time to be responsible for widening \nthe inequalities among students. If anything, we should be endeavoring \nto narrow that.\n  As a matter of fact, in one study that took place in Chile, \nperformance actually declined for low-income students. That is not \nsurprising because any use of public funds for private schools requires \nthat fewer resources be devoted to the public schools. Since the vast \nmajority of low-income students will remain in the public schools and \nthe worst of the schools are, for the most part, already sorely \nunderfunded, it is just evident that private school vouchers would \nfurther weaken public education.\n  Right now, the Federal Government--it is ironic that we are having \nthis debate--the Federal Government right now currently only meets \nabout 6 percent of the costs of elementary and secondary public \neducation in this country. We don't even provide the funding--and I \nknow the Presiding Officer will recognize this issue--we don't even \ncover the costs of unfunded mandates in education. To further divert \nresources from what we are already not doing makes absolutely no sense \nat all.\n  Transferring funds from public schools to private schools will not \nbuy new textbooks for public school students or encourage better \nteachers to move to the public schools nor fix a single leaking roof on \na public school. All it does is divert resources, precious resources to \nbegin with, away from the system that is already underfunded and that \nneeds it the most.\n  Supporters of private school vouchers claim that those schools are \nbetter managed, they perform better, and cost less than public schools. \nAgain, the facts suggest otherwise.\n  It is absolutely true that some public schools are inefficient. \nAgain, vouchers don't solve those inefficiencies. What solves those \nproblems are good managers. In Chicago, in my hometown of Chicago, IL, \ninnovative leadership and a ``no excuses'' attitude totally reshaped \nthe system there in the space of about 2 years. Under the leadership \nthat is now in place, our school system is improving itself to the \nbenefit of all\n\n[[Page S9938]]\n\nof the 425,000 students in that system, not just the select few who \nmight have been spun off with a voucher plan.\n  Every school system calls upon the people, the leadership of that \ncommunity, to focus in on management issues, to address the \nlongstanding issues of neglect and of finance that have hamstrung our \nability to provide quality public education to all children.\n\n  The evidence also disproves the claims that vouchers improve student \nachievement. Annual evaluations of the program in the city of Milwaukee \nconcluded that vouchers have not done so. Again, I call my colleagues' \nattention to all of the research that has been done in this area. There \nis no scientific evidence to support the notion that somehow by taking \naway from public education you improve it.\n  As for cost, again, the private schools can cost less in some \ninstances because only 17 percent of them provide special education, \nwhich, of course, is a high ticket item. It costs twice as much to \neducate disabled children. Again, the point ought to be made that the \npublic schools take everyone. They are schools in which all \nconsistencies, all kinds of students, whether they are rich, disabled, \npoor or whether their parents have problems, or whether they are \ntroubled, all students come. With compulsory education they have to. By \nsetting up a system that spins off a part of the student body, all we \nare doing, again, is creating a situation in which those who are the \nmost able and the most capable and have the most family support will \nleave the school system and leave behind those who are least capable of \ndoing well for themselves.\n  Here in the District of Columbia--and, again, this is once again the \nDistrict of Columbia being made into a guinea pig, for all intents and \npurposes, for ideas that are floating around without addressing the \nreal challenges of the District of Columbia--I, too, had interns in my \noffice, students from the District of Columbia, who interned in my \noffice precisely because the schools were closed here.\n  Why were they closed? Because the court had decreed that the school \nenvironment, the facilities were crumbling so badly that it was unsafe \nand hazardous for children to go to school there. It would be more \nappropriate for us to devote the money being proposed to be taken out \nhere to rebuilding the crumbling schools in the District of Columbia, \nto making sure the roofs don't leak and the windows aren't broken and \nthe electrical systems work, to fix the schools that we have, to meet \nthe challenge of supporting public education instead of coming up with \nyet another excuse not to support the schools we have in place already.\n  This approach, in my opinion, represents, in the final analysis, a \nretreat, a pessimistic capitulation to a winnable challenge. We can fix \nthese schools. We can do at least as much as the previous generation \ndid, our parents. The generation before us left us a legacy of a system \nof quality public education in which every child, no matter what the \ncircumstances, can get an education consistent with their talent \nwithout regard to their means. We have an obligation to do no less for \nthe next generation of Americans. Coming up with an approach that will \nspend away resources from our system of public education does not keep \nfaith with that legacy of support for quality public education as an \nintegral and central part of the American dream.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in the strongest support of the \nDistrict of Columbia student opportunity scholarship amendment offered \nby Senators Coats and Lieberman to the D.C. appropriations bill. I have \nlong been convinced of the value of school choice programs. I think the \ndebate this afternoon has been very healthy for our country.\n  Earlier this year, the Washington Post ran a five-part series on the \nD.C. schools, detailing the mounting problems of the physical \ndeterioration of its school buildings, violence in the classrooms, and \nthe falling academic success among students. Eighty-five percent of \nD.C. public school students who go on to college at the University of \nthe District of Columbia [UDC] need 2 years of remedial education \nbefore beginning course work toward a degree at all. While this \nstatistic is alarming and should not be tolerated, it is a prime \nexample of how the D.C. public schools are failing the very children \nthat they are supposed to be serving. It is the children who are the \nlosers.\n  Some argue, as my colleague just argued, that if only more money were \navailable to mend the crumbling school buildings, or to better train \nthe teachers or to hire more teachers, then everything would be fine. \nMr. President, more money is not really the answer. Despite spending \nmore than $7,300 per student in 1996, which is among the Nation's \nhighest spending rates, 65 percent of all D.C. public schoolchildren, \ntwo-thirds of them, test below their grade levels; 72 percent of fourth \ngraders in the D.C. public schools tested below basic proficiency on \nthe NAEP test--worse than any other school system in the Nation.\n  More money is not the answer. What about the increased violence? The \nNational Education Goals Panel reported last year that both students \nand teachers in D.C. schools are subjected to levels of violence that \nare twice the national average.\n  So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, isn't this bill \nthe perfect place to give us the opportunity to show what vouchers can \ndo? They do help real families. Some of my staff members are privileged \nto work with one D.C. family who was fortunate to have received $4,000 \nof scholarship money this fall to enroll six of their children in Our \nLady of Perpetual Help Catholic School here in the District of \nColumbia. I had the honor of meeting one of those children, Shannon, \nwhen she visited my office in the spring to interview me as part of a \nschool project on Arkansas. It was little Shannon who, 1 year ago, told \nher tutor that she wanted to go to a Catholic school. When asked why, \nshe emphatically answered, ``because I want to learn much.''\n  Mr. President, even though Shannon had never been to a Catholic \nschool, nor did she know anybody enrolled in a Catholic school, she \nknew that if she went to a Catholic school, she would learn. She wanted \nto learn much. Shannon's mother knew that, for her children to progress \nin their studies and graduate from high school, she desperately needed \nto get them out of the failing D.C. schools and into a place where the \nteachers would spend time with her children and teach them.\n  Under this amendment, nearly 2,000 of the District of Columbia's \npoorest children--not the wealthy kids, those from the rich side of \ntown whose parents can afford to send them to elite schools--but the \npoorest children would receive scholarships for tuition costs at a \nprivate school in the District of Columbia, or in adjacent counties in \nMaryland and Virginia. Mothers like Shannon's are eyewitnesses to their \nchildren's improvement when their children are enrolled in a safe, \nstable, and thriving school environment.\n  The Coats-Lieberman plan is a lifeline of hope for thousands of D.C. \nparents, like Shannon's mom, who have waited and are still waiting for \nan opportunity to give their children a solid education and a chance to \nsucceed.\n\n  This amendment makes so much common sense. The question is, will \nvouchers work? Let's give vouchers a chance right here in one of the \nworst school districts in the Nation. Let's not continue to put good \nmoney after bad by simply pouring it into a system that is broken. \nLet's give the children of this city hope. Let's give the parents of \nthe poorest children in this city an opportunity to give their children \nthe best educational opportunity.\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, and Senator \nLieberman for their leadership and for the opportunity to conduct this \ndebate and to cast this important vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the patient Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, who has been waiting a long time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was in the chair when I heard the very \neloquent speech, of course, as always, by Senator Lieberman. One thing \nhe said at the very last surprised me a little bit. I think kind of out \nof desperation he said, ``We are only talking about $7 million. We try \na lot of things that cost a lot more than that.''\n\n[[Page S9939]]\n\n  I am here to inform Senator Lieberman--and I believe he knows it \nalready--that it has been tried. I started with our mutual friend, Tony \nCoelho, in 1993, who established an organization called the Washington \nScholarship Fund. There were many Democrats and Republicans involved. \nSenator Kerrey, at that time, was an honorary chairman, and Bill \nBennett was one of the honorary chairmen, also. Directors and advisors \nincluded Boyden Gray and Doreen Gentzler, a local Channel 4 TV news \nanchor.\n  Our goal was to help needy or low-income families send their children \nto private school--the very thing we are talking about here. We were \ntrying it through the private sector to see if it would work. What we \ndid was not pay the entire scholarship, as we are talking about here, \nfor a number of students, but to pay half of it. I think the average \ntuition is around $3,000 a year. Now, what we did was, we would offer a \nscholarship of $1,500 a year, so that the parents would have to pay \nhalf of it, so they would have to have an interest in that. To be \neligible, they had to be residents of the District of Columbia. Ours \nwas K through 8, as opposed to K through 12. I think K through 12 is \nprobably better. They must be low-income by Federal standards.\n  Anyway, we went ahead with this program on the half tuition. We had \npeople lined up in the school year of 1993 and 1994, and we had 57 \nstudents. That is about $75,000 that we raised privately for these one-\nhalf scholarships. Last year, we were up to 250 students that we \nhelped. That is a substantial increase. But the interesting thing is \nthat we have over 800 now on a waiting list. I am sure that there are \nprobably more out there waiting that are not familiar with the program. \nBut it is overwhelmingly successful. In the schools, they concentrate \non strong values, basic reading and writing and math skills, and we \nhave a lot of parental involvement.\n  A lot of people are not aware that in Washington, DC, there are at \nleast 25 private schools with tuitions less than $2,500 a school year. \nThey average about $3,000. Most of the private schools in the District \nof Columbia operate way below capacity, or their average tuition \nprobably could come down, they would estimate.\n  The Washington Scholarship Fund is one of 32 private school \nscholarship programs nationwide in cities like Milwaukee, Los Angeles, \nNew York, and, in fact, there is one in the home State of Senator \nCoats, in Indianapolis. They are currently helping approximately 12,000 \nneedy children, and they have 40,000 on a waiting list.\n  Well, when I heard the Senator from Connecticut say he didn't know \nexactly how much it was costing the public school system in Washington, \nDC, I think he is right because the accounting system, as he points \nout, is very poor. However, I have heard the range to be somewhere \nbetween $7,700 and $10,000. So here we are talking about being able to \ngive a better education at approximately one-third of the cost--in \nother words, for the same cost, reaching three times the number of \nchildren.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Not on my time. On your time, I will.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. There is no time left.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am sorry, I have to use my time. The dropout rate is a \nproblem. I will read a couple of things that I think are significant.\n  One of the mothers, named Voni Eason, said:\n\n       My son loves the school. He even likes the uniform. He \n     feels like he's a grown man. Without an education--and a \n     good, strong education--he's not going to have a job. Without \n     the Washington Scholarship Fund, he wouldn't be able to go to \n     his school.\n\n  That is a mother making a testimonial.\n  Tanya Odemns' son actually tried the public schools system in \nWashington, DC. She said:\n\n       My son wasn't learning anything. He didn't know his ABCs, \n     didn't know how to spell his name . . . public school didn't \n     give him any homework. I know my son is very intelligent and \n     wants to learn. When I heard about the Washington Scholarship \n     Fund, I just hopped on it real quick. [Now] he's excited when \n     he comes home, wants to do homework.\n\n  Mr. President, it has been tried and it is successful. It works.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, at 4:30, the Senate is to proceed to debate \non the defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I promised the Senator from New York he \ncould get a statement in.\n  I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nthe Senate to consider the defense appropriations bill be extended for \n3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the managers of the bill. Mr. President, let me \nsay this. I strongly, strongly support this amendment. I want to \ncommend Senator Lieberman and Senator Coats for fighting to give the \nfamilies, the parents, the youngsters in the Washington, DC, public \nschool system a chance. Too many are trapped. We are talking about \nworking families who don't have the ability to move to areas with \nbetter schools. They don't have the financial wherewithal to send their \nchildren to better schools, including private schools, that are safer \nand may give a stronger educational opportunity. Al Smith, a great \nGovernor from our State, used to say, ``Let's look at the record.'' \nWell, look at the record. How can we be defending the status quo of an \neducation system in the District of Columbia that has been a failure--a \nfailure. Forty percent of these youngsters never graduate from high \nschool; 40% of D.C. public school students leave the school system \nbetween ninth grade and graduation.\n  In terms of scores, it's incredible: during the 1996-97 school year, \n72 percent of the eighth graders score below basic in math--72 percent; \n78 percent of the D.C. public school fourth graders rank below basic \nreading achievement levels in 1994; 80 percent of the D.C. fourth \ngraders in 1996 achieved below the basic math achievement levels.\n  Do we want to save these youngsters? Or are we so interested in \nprotecting the status of the unions, because that is what this is \nabout. We are talking about the status quo, where you have a system \nthat cares more about tenure for teachers that can't teach, more about \nseeing that the perks and privileges of the unions are protected--as \nopposed to providing students and their parents an opportunity to have \na choice for real opportunity and to break out of this mediocrity.\n  The fact is, we once had great and vibrant public educational \ninstitutions. That was before the days when the union perks and \nprerequisites came first.\n  I support merit pay for good teachers. Let's reward them and get rid \nof the tenure system that is guaranteed to provide mediocrity and less \nfor students. Let's have renewable tenure.\n  Parents should be empowered to make choices, letting them have the \nopportunity to send their kids to the best schools.\n  Who is trapped in the sea of mediocrity? I will tell you. The poorest \nof the poor; the working families; the families that can't move to \nanother area to give their kids a good educational opportunity.\n  I have to tell you something. I look to Congressman Floyd Flake. The \nReverend Flake is resigning his position. He is elected with 90-some-\nodd-plus percent when he runs. He truly is the servant of the people. \nThis is not intended to be a testimonial to him. I will give that \nbefore October 15 when he retires. But let me tell you about one of the \nthings that the Congressman is going to do. He is going to go back and \nfight in New York to empower parents and to give children and their \nparents choice and an educational opportunity that now is all but put \naside.\n  We can make a difference. I don't care if it is 1,000 students that \nit helps, or 1,500 students. That is 1,500 more youngsters who will get \na chance to flourish in an oasis of educational opportunity as opposed \nto a swamp and a sea of mediocrity that are tearing down educational \nopportunities for kids.\n  We have got to try to do something better. And it isn't putting more \nof this money into a system that is broken down.\n  Mr. President, I say this is the least we can do. This is an \ninnovative opportunity to take one of the worst school systems in \nAmerica and to begin to\n\n[[Page S9940]]\n\nempower parents on behalf of their children to give them real \neducational opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9925-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9940-S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport H.R. 2266, the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the H.R. 2266 \n     having met, after full and free conference, have agreed to \n     recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 23, 1997.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Members of the staff of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee be granted the privilege of the floor during consideration \nof the conference report to accompany H.R. 2266: Sid Ashworth, Susan \nHogan, Jay Kimmitt, Gary Reese, Mary Marshall, John Young, Mazie \nMattson, Michelle Randolph, Charlie Houy, Emelie East, and Mike Morris, \na legislative fellow detailed to the committee from the Department of \nDefense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conference report on H.R. 2269, the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1998, closely \nfollows the bill passed by the Senate on July 15.\n  The bill provides $247.5 billion in new budget authority for the \nDepartment, an amount within the levels set in the budget agreement \nwith the White House.\n  As in July, the conference report reflects a bipartisan effort, and I \nam grateful to my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, for \nhis partnership in bringing this bill back to the Senate, and bringing \nit back as a very good bill.\n  The House passed the conference report by a vote of 356 to 65, today.\n  The full text of the conference report, and the accompanying \nstatement of the managers was printed in yesterday's Congressional \nRecord.\n  The print of House Report 105-265 has been available to all Members \ntoday.\n  The tables and descriptive text of the statement of the managers \ndetails the funding levels for all the programs considered by the \nconferees--I will not take the Senate's time to summarize those \nadjustments.\n  I do want to highlight the toughest policy issue we faced--continued \nfunding for operations in and around Bosnia.\n  The House of Representatives in its original bill passed a provision \nwhich was a total prohibition on spending for any operations in Bosnia \nafter June 30, 1998.\n  Personally, I believe we should withdraw our forces from Bosnia.\n  Secretary Cohen and General Ralston met with us, and urged us not to \ntake that unilateral step, at this time.\n  Prior to this conference, several of us traveled to the United \nKingdom, for the periodic United States-United Kingdom \ninterparliamentary meetings.\n  In those talks some of us came to appreciate better the total \ndependence by our European allies on the United States forces in \nBosnia.\n  The compromise we reached retains the position of the House that we \nbring our forces out of Bosnia by June 30, but the President can waive \nthat requirement if he certifies to the Congress the forces must stay \nin the interest of our national security.\n  The President must also inform the Congress on seven points: First, \nthe reasons for the deployment; second, the number of personnel to be \ndeployed; third, the duration of the mission; fourth, the mission and \nobjectives; fifth, the exit strategy for U.S. forces; sixth, the costs \nfor operations past June 30; and seventh, the impact on morale and \nretention.\n  This certification to Congress will constitute the first time this \nPresident has informed the Congress about Bosnia before deploying or \nextending our forces there.\n  I want to recognize the leadership of my good friend from Kansas, \nSenator Pat Roberts, who contributed to our discussions in the United \nKingdom following the visit he made to the continent. And it was his \nideas that he passed on to me that really led to the compromise that we \nhave reached in this conference.\n  The Congress and the American people, Senator Roberts told me, \ndeserve to know why our forces are in Bosnia and how long they must \nstay. The provision in this bill requires such a statement.\n  The President is also expected to submit a supplemental \nappropriations request for additional amounts needed to maintain our \nforces in Bosnia if he decides to keep them there without damaging the \nreadiness or the quality of life of our Armed Forces.\n  Virtually every program funded in this bill when we originally passed \nit the House and the Senate were funded differently. And ultimately we \nhad to find a compromise level between those two bills. We actually had \nto eliminate some $4.5 billion of items that were funded in one bill or \nthe other.\n  Let me point out just some instances.\n  In the case of the Dual Use Applications Program, we sustained the \nfull $125 million that was provided by the Senate. That is $25 million \nmore than the House had provided.\n  On ACTD's, we reached an even split with the House, which provides \n$81 million--nearly a 50 percent increase compared to the level \nappropriated for fiscal year 1997.\n  For overseas humanitarian, disaster, and civic aid, we again split \nthe difference with the House providing $47 million.\n  One program where we sustained the full administration request is in \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, known as the ``Nunn-Lugar'' \ninitiative.\n  Secretary Cohen made the strong plea for the full $382 million sought \nby the President, and we have convinced the conference to accommodate \nthat request.\n  I again want to thank all conferees on both sides, and especially the \nHouse Chairman, Congressman Bill Young, and the ranking member, \nCongressman Jack Murtha.\n  I feel very proud about the work that was done by the conference \nworking as a team.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to vote in favor of approving the \nconference report before the Senate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this moment to express my complete \nsupport for the conference report on the defense appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1998.\n  As Chairman Stevens noted, this bill is within the budget allocation \nprovided by the committee for defense funding.\n  The amounts provided represents an increase of $5.4 billion, 2 \npercent above the amounts available during the current fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that this increase is very modest, and \nis fully justified under the circumstances.\n  The increase is necessary to allow us to continue to modernize our \nforces, to protect readiness, and to fully fund a 2.8-percent cost-of-\nliving increase for our men and women in uniform. And it allows us to \nprotect the priorities of the Members of the Senate.\n  This conference agreement is a compromise which I believe all Members \nshould support.\n  The bill was passed by the House with two controversial matters to \nwhich the administration strongly objected to--the B-2, and Bosnia. \nThis conference report has dealt with those matters to the satisfaction \nof the administration.\n  On the B-2 bomber, the conferees have provided the President with \n$331 million to begin the purchase of additional B-2 bombers. However, \nit is up to the President to determine whether to buy more aircraft, or \nto upgrade the existing fleet of B-2 bombers. Mr. President, I for one \nhope the President chooses to buy more B-2's. But here the choice is \nhis.\n\n  On Bosnia, the conferees agreed that consistent with the current \nplans of\n\n[[Page S9941]]\n\nthe administration all United States troops be removed from Bosnia by \nJune 30th of next year. However, if the President certifies that it is \nin our national interest to maintain our presence in and around Bosnia, \nhe can waive the restriction by consulting with and informing the \nCongress of his decision. And should the President decide to keep the \nforces in Bosnia, as Chairman Stevens noted, he shall submit a \nsupplemental, if additional funds are required to pay for this \ndeployment.\n  Mr. President, this is an agreement which can be supported by both \nthe Congress and the President.\n  We should be grateful to Chairman Stevens and the House conferees for \nnegotiating this very workable compromise.\n  I would like to also mention the hard work of the staff under the \nstaff director, Mr. Steve Cortese, and on the minority side, Mr. \nCharlie Houy.\n  Mr. President, I think it should be noted that the staff worked long \nhours--in one instance throughout the whole night--to ensure that this \nconference report was completed before the end of this fiscal year. I \nbelieve that the Senate owes them its gratitude for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, this is a good conference report. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support its adoption.\n  Once again, may I express to my colleagues my great pleasure in being \nable to serve them, together with Chairman Stevens. We are fortunate to \nhave Chairman Stevens at the helm.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and ranking member. Everyone involved in our \nmilitary and our national security owes Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye a depth of gratitude for their outstanding leadership.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the provisions contained \nin the defense appropriations bill--so kindly referred to by the \nchairman as the Roberts amendment--that will force the Clinton \nadministration to clearly and articulately justify our policy in the \nuse of military forces in Bosnia. Additionally, Mr. President, these \nprovisions will also force Congress to debate the Bosnian dilemma and \nour policy in that shattered region.\n  These provisions are about being honest with the American public.\n  Specifically, these provisions require the President to certify to \nCongress by May 15 of next year that the continued presence of U.S. \nforces in Bosnia is in our national security interests, and why.\n  He must state the reasons for deployment, and the expected duration \nof deployment.\n  He must provide numbers of troops deployed, estimate the dollar costs \ninvolved, and give the effect of such deployment on overall \neffectiveness of our U.S. forces.\n  Most importantly, the President must provide a clear statement of our \nmission, and our objective.\n  And he must provide an exit strategy for bringing our troops home.\n  If these specifics are not provided to the satisfaction of the \nCongress, funding for military deployment in Bosnia will end next May.\n  Let me repeat: We are requiring the administration--and, yes; the \nCongress--to clearly articulate our Bosnia policy, justify use of \nmilitary forces, and tell us when and under what circumstances our \ntroops can come home.\n  That is not asking too much.\n  In my view, events of recent weeks make this an urgent matter. It has \nbecome increasingly clear to me that in the wake of the Dayton accords, \nand after drifting for months, and with elections on the near horizon \nand the crippling winter only weeks away, the United States went from \npeacekeeping to peace enforcement with what I consider to be dubious \ntactics.\n  Troop protection, refugee relocation, democracy building, economic \nrestoration, and, oh, by the way, if we run across a war criminal let's \narrest him. Those goals have been replaced.\n  So today we see increased troop strengths--perhaps up to 16,000--we \nhave picked a U.S. candidate in the election process, we have embarked \nupon an aggressive disarmament and location, and capture and \nprosecution of war criminals.\n  Is this mission creep, or is it long overdue action, Mr. President? \nAnd will these goals accomplish realistic progress?\n  Item: The world was treated to the spectacle of American troops, the \nsymbol of freedom's defenders, taking over a Bosnia television station \nin an effort to muzzle its news. The troops were stoned by angry \ncitizens. We gave the TV station back.\n  Item: In the country where benevolent leaders are scarce, we have \nchosen up sides, supporting the cause of one candidate over another. It \nis a cynical approach, it seems to this Senator, to foreign policy that \nsays to the world, ``Sure, he--or she--is a dictator, but he's our \ndictator.'' At least for the time being.\n  Item: Elections were conducted but to cast ballots--listen up--to \ncast ballots many citizens had to be bussed back to their homes, which \nthey cannot now, or may never, occupy to vote for officials who will \nnever serve unless SFOR stands at the ready.\n  In the Civil War in the United States, Quantrill's Raiders sacked \nLawrence, then fled to Missouri. Should his ruffians have been bussed \nback to Lawrence to vote for city council? That makes about as much \nsense.\n  Item. A United States diplomat overruled a Norwegian judge, whose \ndecision disqualified candidates with ties to indicted war crime \nsuspect Radovan Karadzic. Members of the group overseeing the elections \nthreatened to resign. Posters of Elmer Fudd--I am not making this up. \nThat's right, the cartoon character Elmer Fudd sprouted up as a protest \nto ``free'' elections by one faction.\n  NATO forces, which include U.S. troops, have been cast into the role \nof cops on the beat chasing war crimes suspects. Just arrest Mr. \nKaradzic, we are told, try him for war crimes, and our problems will be \nsolved.\n  Mr. President, as the New York Times pointed out recently, much as we \ndo not like it, ``Mr. Karadzic reflects widely held views in Serbian \nsociety.'' Those views are real.\n  Do these events reflect a sound, defensible Bosnian policy that is in \nour national interest? Or do they sound an ominous alarm as America is \ndragged down into a Byzantine nightmare straight out of a Kafka novel?\n  I visited Bosnia, like many of my colleagues. I talked with the \ntroops in August, met with the officers, met with intelligence \nofficials. They are outstanding individuals. They deserve our support, \nour respect, our gratitude. They are doing an outstanding job, Mr. \nPresident, even though they have not been given a coherent mission.\n  Just this past week, Gen. Hugh Shelton, our outstanding nominee for \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked at his confirmation \nhearing by Senator McCain of Arizona whether there is a strategy to \nremove United States troops from Bosnia, and the general was stumped. \nLet me repeat that. The general admitted he was aware of no exit \nstrategy by the administration. That awareness is repeated in Tazar, \nMr. President, which is our staging base in southern Hungary, 7 days in \nfor our troops and 7 days out. We have no clear idea of how to extract \nthem.\n  If the provisions of this bill do nothing else, they should force a \nmajor reexamination of our Bosnian involvement from top to bottom.\n  Now, our former Secretary of Defense, Casper Weinberger, articulated \nsix conditions for military intervention, Mr. President. I repeat them \nhere today just to show how much our Bosnian policy is lacking. He said \ntroops should be committed only when the following things happen: No. \n1. Vital national interests are threatened. I do not think that is the \ncase in Bosnia. The United States clearly intends to win. We did win. \nWe stopped the fighting. But the political settlement is contrary to \nthe means by which we stopped the fighting. We separated the ethnic \ngroups. Now we are trying to put them back together again. The \nintervention has precisely defined political and military objectives. \nAs the former Secretary of Defense said, there is reasonable assurance \nthat intervention will be supported by the American people and the \nCongress. The commitment of American forces and their objectives can be\n\n[[Page S9942]]\n\nreassessed and adjusted, if necessary. And, finally, Secretary \nWeinberger said this: The commitment of forces to combat is undertaken \nas a last resort.\n  As Chairman Stevens will tell you, our involvement in Bosnia has come \nat a large price. There are approximately 10,000 troops. I personally \nthink it is closer to 16,000. That is nearly one-third of the 35,000 \nNATO troops involved. From 1996 to 1998, costs are estimated to be $7.8 \nbillion--almost $8 billion. That figure, too, may escalate.\n  In justifying our policy in Bosnia, the administration must include a \nplan to fund the costs. Do they intend to take these rising costs out \nof the current defense budget, money we need for modernization and \nprocurement and quality of life for the armed services to protect our \nvital national security interests? Or is the administration prepared to \ncome clean and ask for the money up front?\n  Finally, I offer these thoughts. All of us in this body, and I know \nPresident Clinton, Secretary of State Albright, Secretary of Defense \nCohen, all of us, desperately want lasting peace in Bosnia--all of our \nallies as well. We want the killing to stop. We have stopped the \nkilling. We want stability in that part of the world, permanent peace \nand permanent stability. But wishing it does not make it so.\n  Richard Grenier, writing for the Washington Times put it this way:\n\n       Generally speaking, Serbs didn't love Croats, Croats didn't \n     love Serbs, nor do either of them love Muslims. Reciprocally, \n     Muslims love neither the Croats or Serbs. What happened to \n     the lessons we are supposed to have learned in Beirut and \n     Somalia? What happened to our swearing off mission creep?\n       But here we go again in Bosnia. Once again, our goal was at \n     first laudably humanitarian: to stop the killing. But it \n     expanded as we thought how wonderful it would be if we could \n     build a beautiful, tolerant, multiethnic Bosnia on the model \n     of American multiculturalism.\n\n  I respond. The Bosnian situation is complex. It is shrouded by \ncenturies--centuries--of conflict that only a few understand. What we \nhave seen in recent months is a lull in the fighting, not the end. It \nis a fragile ``peace,'' held together only by a continued presence of \nmilitary force. How long can that continue? Are we prepared to pay the \nprice?\n  This week, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the United \nStates must remain engaged in Bosnia beyond June of this year but that \ncontinued American troop presence has not yet been decided. It is time \nto decide.\n  Now, compare that statement with the advice of former Secretary of \nState, Dr. Henry Kissinger, who wrote just this week:\n\n       America has no national interest for which to risk lives to \n     produce a multiethnic state in Bosnia.\n\n  Mr. President, no more drift. No more drift. It is time for candor, \nfor honesty and clear purpose. Let the debate begin.\n  I urge acceptance of these provisions. We owe them as a debt of \nhonesty to the American people. We owe them to our military men and \nwomen with their lives on the line.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from Kansas \nhas expired.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 5 minutes of \nhis own already.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to express my support for the defense appropriations \nconference agreement, and I commend my colleagues, particularly Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye, for their great work on this measure.\n  I am particularly pleased that an important provision in the \nconference report is language which will allow Newport News and \nElectric Boat, this country's only two manufacturers of submarines, to \nteam together to design and build the next generation of attack \nsubmarines. Without this language, these shipyards and our submarine \nprogram could be endangered. With this language, however, we will \ncontinue to build the Navy's most valuable weapon, a silent and very \neffective submarine. Work will commence on the new attack submarines, \nwhich will boast great stealth and great strength with advanced war-\nfighting capabilities, yet will be smaller, more flexible and more cost \neffective.\n  This teaming agreement will preserve America's vital submarine \nindustry base, which encompasses over 3,000 high-technology companies \nin 44 States. This conference report brings us one step closer to \nensuring that the United States continues to maintain the finest \nsubmarine force in the world.\n  Since the first day I arrived in Congress, there has been a strong \ndebate over the future of the U.S. naval submarine program. There are \nthose who believe that the era of the submarine ended with the end of \nthe cold war. But a majority of my colleagues and I believe that our \nsubmarine fleet needs to be maintained and modernized and that it will \nserve us as well in the future as it has in the past.\n  In a time when the mission of our armed services is constantly \nchanging and a threat could emerge anywhere in the world, we need such \nflexibility. I think it is fitting to note the comments of our \nrespected Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John \nShalikashvili, on the eve of his retirement. General Shalikashvili \nsaid, ``Submarines are an integral part of U.S. global influence and \npresence. Their stealth and endurance provide the unified commander \nenormous capabilities across the full spectrum of conflict.''\n  I believe that the provisions in this defense appropriations \nagreement indicate that the submarine has proven itself. This \nlegislation allocates scarce defense dollars to build up the submarine \nindustrial base, to procure new torpedoes, to procure new submarine \nperiscopes, and to assure excellent training programs for our submarine \ncrews. This agreement will provide funding for the completion of the \nSeawolf program and for the first new attack submarine.\n  This report shows support for the submarine procurement program as \nwell as a logical and cost-effective way to harness the expertise and \nskill of our Nation's submarine builders.\n  I would like particularly to again thank Chairman Stevens and Senator \nInouye for their continued support, Senator Warner for his efforts on \nthe committee, and all of those who have played a critical role in \nensuring that our submarine fleet will continue to be the finest in the \nworld, that our sailors will go forth with the best ships in the world \nand that with their service and these ships we will continue to protect \nAmerica and defend our principles.\n  I thank the Senator for the time. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think under the previous order I am to be \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 15 minutes under \nthe previous order and is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to address this question of the \ndefense appropriations bill with some degree of disappointment.\n  First of all, I am disappointed that an appropriations bill is going \nto be passed out of this Congress ahead of the authorization. That is \nnot the way it is supposed to work. It renders much of the work done by \nthe authorization committee this year of no effect in some of the \ncritical areas. I do not blame the Appropriations Committee, however. \nThere are 4 days remaining before the end of the fiscal year. The clock \nis ticking. Senate Armed Services and the House didn't get the job done \nin time, and the Appropriations Committee was patient in giving us that \ntime. I regret that we were not able to get our authorization act \ntogether. So I am not here to condemn the Appropriations Committee.\n  I do, however, want to express my disappointment, sincere \ndisappointment, that as chairman of the Air and Land Subcommittee the \nactions that we have taken in the Senate Armed Services Committee to \naddress the question of TACAIR and where we are going in the future \nwere forfeited in the negotiations with the House; that the Senate \ndeferred to the House position particularly on the issue of F-22 \nfunding, and I want to discuss that because there are consequences, I \nbelieve, to that decision.\n  First, a little bit of history.\n  Our committee withheld approximately $500 million in development and\n\n[[Page S9943]]\n\nadvanced procurement funds, and I want to state the reasons why we did \nso. It was not done on a whim. It was not done on a number picked out \nof the air. It was done as a result of a process of our methodical \noversight of the F-22 program that dates back at least to the 103d \nCongress.\n\n  Here are the facts. The F-22 program as we speak today is \napproximately $2.2 billion over budget for development alone. There is \nspeculation that F-22 production could also run several billion dollars \nover program estimates. In fact, in just the last 2 years, the Air \nForce has cut the number of aircraft to be bought in the next 6 years \nfrom 128 to only 70, and yet there has been no decrease in program \ncosts to the taxpayer or money freed up for Department of Defense \nexpenditures in other areas. Yet we have not been told by the Air Force \nor the contractors how the F-22 program got to be in this situation.\n  Those of us on the Armed Services Committee felt it was time to \ndefinitively put this program on notice, and that is what we attempted \nto do.\n  Now, Mr. President, I say that as a supporter of the F-22. I think it \nis fair to say our committee is a strong supporter of the F-22. I have \nvisited production facilities and engine facilities for the F-22. It is \na leap ahead in technology. It lays the basis for our crucial joint \nstrike fighter program. It will give us air dominance in the future. \nHad I thought that the actions we had taken in any way jeopardized \nfurther development of the F-22, I would not have considered them.\n  But to those who have argued that we must fully support the F-22 air \ndominance fighter because it is the No. 1 procurement priority of the \nDepartment of the Air Force without any questions, without any \nreservations, without any reports, without any event-based \ndecisionmaking, I think those people are missing the point. They are \nmissing the point of the consequences of doing so and the consequences \nto other systems.\n  Let me also say that I, in addition to supporting F-22, I support the \nimportance of air dominance as a joint warfighting capability. But, we \nhave to remember that the F-22 is just one piece of the Department of \nDefense TACAIR recapitalization strategy. We are acting like it is the \nwhole thing.\n  As a matter of fact, the Navy's F/A-18EF is the Navy's No. 1 \npriority, and the Marine Corps has placed its priority on the joint \nstrike fighter yet to be developed. So we are looking to balance our \napproach in joint warfighting capability across the full spectrum of \nmilitary operations. If the F-22 program is not brought under control, \nit will severely jeopardize a prudent balance in TACAIR \nrecapitalization.\n  So the issue before us is not support for the relative priority of \nthe F-22 program. The issue before us is, does that support imply that \nwe should blindly throw billions of dollars at the program without some \naccountability? The issue is the viability of the F-22 program, and it \nis exactly because of the high priority of the F-22 that we need to \nsend a powerful message to the Air Force and to the contractors that \nthe Senate is watching, that we are watching the restructuring, and we \nare watching for schedule slippage, and we are watching for cost \noverruns. It is time to hold F-22 to a realistic level of \naccountability. It is time to end the promises of performance and cost \ncontrol and instead focus on results. We do so because we want to \nprotect the F-22. We want it to be a viable program, and we do not want \nit to go the way of other programs that have not been held accountable.\n  So, therefore, I regret deeply that the Senate yielded to the House, \nthat we were not able to get the authorization approved, that we \nyielded to the House in the appropriations process and we are simply \ngiving the Air Force and giving the contractor exactly what they asked \nfor without any explanations, without any details, and without any \naccountability features built in.\n  Let me explain a little bit about why the Armed Services Committee's \nactions on the F-22 are good policy.\n  In the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, the \nSenate requested the Department of Defense and the General Accounting \nOffice assess and provide us a report on the degree of concurrency--\nthat is the testing-while-you-are-buying process that goes on sometimes \nin these programs; you are buying the planes at the same time you are \ntesting them; many of us would argue that you need to test first and \nmake sure that what you are buying is what you think you are buying--\nand we asked them for this report on risk, also. In April 1995, we \nreceived those reports and the Department of Defense report concluded, \njust a little over 2 years ago, ``there is no reason, based upon risk/\nconcurrency considerations to introduce a program stretch at this \ntime.'' So we thought, fine, everything is on track.\n  At the same time the GAO conclude that the F-22 program involved \nconsiderable risk and that there may be adverse consequences from \nconcurrent development and production. Furthermore, they felt the need \nfor the F-22 program ``is not urgent,'' it quoted, based on the threat \nand viability of the F-15 program.\n  Then we went into 1996. We held hearings. In those hearings surfaced \nadditional concerns about the level of concurrent production and \ndevelopment, projected F-22 weight and specific fuel consumption. We \ncame back in the National Defense Authorization Act for 1996 to, once \nagain, require the Department of Defense to respond to 21 specific \nquestions. And they did respond and indicated, again, that the level of \nconcurrency in the program was acceptable using departmental risk \ncriteria.\n  In short, less than 2 years ago, the Senate was being told the \nprogram was on track, no problems. Now in 1997, we held hearings and \nsurfaced still yet other concerns about the F-22's transition from this \nengineering, manufacturing and development phase to production, based \non what one witness calls an ``event driven program that ensures that \nkey production criteria are met as a prerequisite for production \ndecisions.'' That gave us some assurance. Correspondingly, the Senate \nthen included in the 1997 National Defense Authorization bill a \nrequirement that the Department of Defense undertake a cost analysis \nand report on their events-based decisionmaking criteria.\n  We took them at their word. We said fine, give us a report. Within \nthe last year, the Air Force commissioned a Joint Evaluation Team which \nconcluded that the F-22 development program was $2.2 billion over cost, \nand that much more time would be needed for testing. This was the first \ntime that we had been notified that the F-22 was in trouble, despite \nnumerous years of hearings and reports back from the Air Force. So, \nbased on this information the committee held--I chaired--two additional \nhearings in 1997, on tactical aviation. And we learned then that the \nAir Force canceled four preproduction vehicles that it previously \nindicated were a key to the program going forward. And then it took \nthat money, $700 million, and put it back into development. This \naction, to infuse hundreds of millions of dollars into development, was \ntaken by the Air Force again without specifying how the program had \nbeen changed, identifying cost-control measures, and describing the \nlevel of risk that remains. They have not told us how the program got \nin this shape. They have only told us that they have found the funds to \nfix it. They found the funds to fix it by canceling four preproduction \naircraft, thereby jeopardizing a necessary step testing for most \ndevelopment programs, which they say now is not necessary, and taking \nthat money and pumping it into engineering and manufacturing \ndevelopment.\n  They also promised that event-based decisionmaking would keep the F-\n22 program on track. We asked them to report on this aspect of the \nprogram. The Air Force said it would give us a report on it. They did. \nThat report, 6 months late: 18 words. Here is the Air Force report. \nSpecific exit criteria:\n\n       First EMD aircraft first flight complete.\n       Complete engine initial flight release.\n       Air vehicle interim production readiness review complete.\n\n  What does that tell us? This is the report that it took them 6 months \nto put together to respond to what we asked for, what we thought was \nlegitimate?\n  Furthermore, each of these three events were supposed to have been \ncompleted before the fiscal year even started. What kind of confidence \ndoes that provide, for a program with nearly $20 billion in development \nand well\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\nover $40 billion in procurement? We are talking about $60 billion here. \nConsequently, the Senate Armed Services Committee came to the \nconclusion that, if tactical air modernization is going to be viable in \nthe future from both a technical perspective and the perspective of \naffordability, that we had to take some action now in the F-22 program \nto achieve and ensure performance and cost-control goals. Therefore, I \nrecommended to the Senate, and the Senate agreed, that we not permit \nthe infusion of an additional $420 million into F-22 research and \ndevelopment until we understand how this program came to be in this \npresent condition.\n  Some people are going to argue that these actions are too severe. But \nI think it is just the opposite. We believe the actions that we have \ntaken help to ensure the program's success. Remember, this is just the \ndevelopment phase and it is more than $2 billion over budget. It was \nnot that long ago that then Secretary of Defense Cheney canceled the \nNavy A-12 program because it was $1 billion over cost. Now we have a \nplane more than $2 billion over cost.\n  I have deep concern over whether we can maintain continuing support \npolitically for the F-22 program here in Congress, and with the \nAmerican people, if we cannot adequately address these cost overruns \nand explain to the American people that we are taking prudent steps to \nmake sure that this does not continue. The steps that we have taken are \nnot designed to put the program in jeopardy. They are designed to save \nthe program. They are designed to demonstrate that we recognize there \nare problems and we must hold the contractors accountable.\n  We are told the Air Force and the contractors have this agreement. \nThey don't have an agreement. All they have said is that they have \nagreed to agree; they have agreed to agree that there will not be any \nmore cost overruns, that they will deliver on time. And I pray and \nhope--and maybe have some confidence--that they can do that. But the \nagreement has not been negotiated. It is not in print. It does not have \nsignatures on the bottom line. And until it does, I think it is \nreasonable to withhold some funds so we know that those agreements are \ngoing to be guaranteed and performed.\n  What is in jeopardy if the F-22 does not get on track? I suggest four \nvery important things. We may end up treating the F-22 like we did the \nB-2, producing far fewer than we need but only what we can afford, and \nthen we have an inadequate tactical air program for the future. Also, \nwe could lose support for the next aircraft carrier, the CVN-77. In \nfact, I believe it's the advanced procurement for the smart-buy \ninitiative that was to save taxpayers $600 million on this carrier that \nwas taken by the appropriators to fund the F-22. We may not get that \ncarrier. Third, we may lose the Joint Strike Fighter. We cannot \nconsider throwing more money at three TACAIR programs, given the low \nlevels of procurement for land and sea systems. F-22 cost growth cannot \nbe permitted to eat the lion's share of the funding pie. The Navy is \nabsolutely counting on the Joint Strike Fighter to complement the F/A-\n18E/F. The Marine Corps has put their entire TACAIR future solely in \nthe hands of the Joint Strike Fighter. If the Joint Strike Fighter does \nnot come through on time, then we are going to have to radically \nrethink whether or not there will even be Marine Corps TACAIR in the \nfuture.\n\n  We all know that from a political standpoint there will not be a \nJoint Strike Fighter if we cannot control the F-22 cost. This places \nthe Navy and the Marine Corps in deep jeopardy.\n  Finally, continued F-22 cost growth could rob funds from other key \nAir Force modernization initiatives, whether they be TACAIR, strategic \nairlift, or the communications and intelligence programs which the \nentire joint force will have to rely on for information superiority in \nthe 21st century.\n  In short, we need to be confident and ensure ourselves that the F-22 \nprogram is under control. We don't know how else to get their \nattention. I found that the best way is to say: No performance, no \nmoney.\n  No, Mr. President, we did that some time back. We were confronted \nwith a very similar cost and performance problem with the development \nof the C-17--a marvelous airplane, but they could not get their act \ntogether. So we told the manufacturer you either come in at cost or you \nare not going to building more planes. As a result, there was a huge \nbanner erected in the production plant, which said, ``Build 40 at cost, \nor no more.'' Guess what, they built 40 at cost and now we have a \nmultiyear procurement of 120 C-17's. This is a success story because \nCongress held the line, and I am disappointed that we have lost that \nopportunity with this action.\n  We should all ask ourselves whether the F-22 program would benefit \nfrom a similar policy from this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending conference report \naccompanying H.R. 2266, the Department of Defense appropriations bill, \nprovides $247.7 billion in new budget authority and $164.7 billion in \nnew outlays for Department of Defense programs for fiscal year 1998.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the final bill totals $247.7 billion in \nbudget authority and $244.4 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998\n  This legislation provides for military pay, procurement, research and \ndevelopment, operations and maintenance, and various other important \nactivities of the Department of Defense and the U.S. military services \nthroughout the world. This bill provides for the readiness, current, \nand future weapons systems, and all the other necessities of our \nnational defenses--except for military construction and Department of \nEnergy atomic energy defense activities--that enable our Armed Forces \nto protect U.S. national interests at home and abroad. It is certainly \none of the most important pieces of legislation that Congress passes \neach year.\n  The spending in this conference report falls within the revised \nsection 302(b) allocation for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. \nI commend the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Alaska, for \nbringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's revised \nallocation.\n  The bill provides important increases over the President's request \nfor 1998. It is fully consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement \nthat the President and Congress concluded earlier this year. I urge the \nadoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the conference report be placed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                H.R. 2266, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT                \n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]                                   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Defense     Nondefense     Crime      Mandatory      Total   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................      247,485           27  ...........          197      247,709\n    Outlays....................................      244,167           31          197  ...........      244,395\nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority...........................      247,485           27          197  ...........      247,709\n    Outlays....................................      244,232           31  ...........          197      244,460\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority...........................      243,700           27  ...........          197      243,924\n    Outlays....................................      243,874           31  ...........          197      244,102\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................      248,111           27  ...........          197      248,335\n    Outlays....................................      244,527           31  ...........          197      244,755\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n    Budget authority...........................      246,988  ...........  ...........          197      247,185\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\n                                                                                                                \n    Outlays....................................      244,185            7  ...........          197      244,389\nConference Report compared to:                                                                                  \n    Senate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                   \n        Budget authority.......................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\n        Outlays................................          -65  ...........  ...........  ...........          -65\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n        Budget authority.......................        3,785  ...........  ...........  ...........        3,785\n        Outlays................................          293  ...........  ...........  ...........          293\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n        Budget authority.......................         -626  ...........  ...........  ...........         -626\n        Outlays................................         -360  ...........  ...........  ...........         -360\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n        Budget authority.......................          497           27  ...........  ...........          524\n        Outlays................................          -18           24  ...........  ...........           6 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to total due to rounding. Totals adjusted for consistency with current scorekeeping   \n  conventions.                                                                                                  \n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \nDefense appropriations conference report, which the Senate is now \nconsidering.\n  The distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member, \nSenators Stevens and Inouye, working with our House counterparts, have \ndone a remarkable job in fashioning a truly balanced bill that will \nmeet our Nation's security needs for the 21st century. I would like to \nsalute Senators Stevens and Inouye for their leadership and skill in \nbalancing the competing needs of our Nation's military.\n  I also would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for \nworking with me to address some Defense issues that are of a very high \npriority to North Dakota. Let me just highlight some of these matters.\n\n\n                              B-52 BOMBERS\n\n  First, this Defense spending bill provides an additional $57.3 \nmillion above the administration's budget request to fully fund our \nNation's fleet of B-52 bombers. My colleagues will recall that we \ndeployed 66 B-52's during Operation Desert Storm, and that these planes \ndropped 40 percent of the ordnance dropped by allied forces during the \nPersian Gulf war. Yet the administration has consistently recommended \nsending 23 of these valuable planes to the boneyard. I am pleased that \nthe bill now before us specifically rejects that suggestion.\n  As those who fly B-52's out of Minot Air Force Base know, the B-52 is \na highly capable bomber, one that can continue to contribute to our \nnational defense through at least 2030. Nearly every part of the B-52 \nhas been replaced or modernized, and we have spent over $4 billion in \nrecent years to upgrade and update these planes. The B-52's that \nentered service in the 1960's still have only about one-third of the \nflight hours of the average 747 now in commercial service.\n  If we were left with 71 B-52's, only about 44 of the aircraft would \nbe combat-coded, making it impossible for us to repeat the B-52's gulf \nwar performance in any future regional conflict, much less hold some in \nreserve for a second regional conflict or a nuclear role.\n  Lastly, to retire strategic bombers would reduce Russia's incentives \nto ratify the START II Treaty. This major arms control agreement will \nhelp us achieve greater strategic stability. But we should not throw \naway bargaining chips before the Duma acts to approve START II.\n\n\n                           AIR BATTLE CAPTAIN\n\n  In another area of interest to my State, this bill provides $450,000 \nfor the Air Battle Captain Program at the University of North Dakota's \nCenter for Aerospace Sciences. Most importantly, report language \naccompanying the bill also directs that the program continue to accept \nnew students. The Air Battle Captain Program trains helicopter pilots \nfor the Army efficiently and cost effectively, and most of its \ngraduates have gone on to become Army aviators. When the graduates \nreach Fort Rucker, they arrive as commissioned second lieutenants and \nare able to forego the primary flight training, thus enabling the Army \nto assign them to combat units 8 months ahead of their contemporaries.\n\n\n                              FLOOD RELIEF\n\n  As my colleagues will recall, this spring the Red River Valley \nsuffered its worst flooding in recorded history. When the water finally \nwon, a 500-year flood emptied Grand Forks, ND, a city of 50,000 people, \nand sent 4,000 residents to the Grand Forks Air Force Base for shelter. \nMany of the base personnel who fought the flood for weeks, and who \nhosted evacuees when the flood water breached the dikes, were \nthemselves flood victims. Over 700 military personnel were forced to \nevacuate during this disaster. And 406 service members have suffered \nlosses to personal property, including 95 families whose homes were \nextensively damaged.\n  This Defense appropriations bill ensures that these personnel will \nnot be victims of unintended discrimination as well as flooding.\n  If these service members had lived on base, they would be eligible to \nfile a claim with the Department of Defense for losses incident to \nservice. The Air Force pays such claims pursuant to section 3721 of \ntitle 31 of the United States Code. But as the law now stands, military \npersonnel living off base are not eligible to file such claims, even \nthough they are stationed at Grand Forks Air Force Base as a result of \ntheir military service.\n  Section 8120 of the bill would simply permit the Air Force to \nreimburse these service members for their losses despite the fact that \nthey lived off base. The bill makes available up to $4.5 million of the \nfunds already available to the Department of Defense for paying claims.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that section 8120 supplements private \ninsurance and benefits provided by the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency. Air Force practices and FEMA regulations prohibit duplication. \nService members with private insurance will have to file claims against \nthat insurance before the Air Force will pay claims under this \nprovision.\n\n\n                        LEADERSHIP AND HARD WORK\n\n  Mr. President, none of these aspects of the bill would have been \napproved by the Senate or would have survived conference with the House \nwere it not for the support and leadership provided by the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Inouye. I would like to \nacknowledge their willingness to help in these areas and to thank them \nfor their assistance.\n  Let me also take this opportunity to put in a good word for the hard-\nworking staff of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. My thanks and \ncongratulations go in particular to Senator Stevens's able lieutenant, \nstaff director Steve Cortese, and to Charlie Huoy, who handles these \nissues for Senator Inouye. And I am also grateful for the skilled \nefforts of Susan Hogan, John Young, Mazie Mattson, and Emelie East.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report. Thank you, \nMr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             bosnia policy\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the President's National Security Advisor, \nMr. Sandy Berger, two days ago made an important statement on U.S. \npolicy toward Bosnia, in particular the question of keeping United \nStates' ground forces in the region beyond June of 1998, in order to \nkeep the peace in an area where political reconciliation has lagged \nbehind the actual military separation of the opposing forces. It is not \nsurprising that political, economic and social reconciliation would \nproceed at a pace commensurate with the levels of extensive brutality \nand violence which characterized the Bosnia conflict prior\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\nto the introduction of U.S.-led NATO forces two years ago. In what \nmight be characterized as a trial balloon, Mr. Berger stated, according \nto the New York Times of yesterday, September 24, 1997, that the \n``international community'' will be required to ``stay engaged in \nBosnia in some fashion for a good while to come.''\n  The question is for how long should the United States remain while \nexpending billions of defense dollars and risking the erosion of U.S. \nreadiness by tying our forces down in Bosnia? The problem, as I see it, \nis that our European partners have said that they will not remain on \nthe ground in Bosnia unless the United States does, and when we leave, \nthey will. I find this to be a very unreasonable position, in that \nBosnia is not paramount in the vital interests of the U.S., and at some \npoint our European allies should consider taking the responsibility for \nacting as the military security force in that European country. This is \nnot to say that the U.S. could not provide continued logistical, \nintelligence, and other supporting roles while the Europeans take their \nturn at bat in Bosnia.\n  I call the attention of my colleagues to the provision in the \nDepartment of Defense conference report, Section 8132 which requires \nthe President to certify, by May 15, 1998, his intentions regarding \nkeeping our forces in Bosnia on the ground beyond June 30, 1998. The \ncertification must include the reasons for the deployment, the size and \nduration of the deployment, the missions of our military forces, the \nexit strategy for our forces, the costs of the deployment, and the \nimpact of it on the morale, retention, and effectiveness of U.S. \nforces. This is a very good, very complete provision, and it will \ntrigger a debate, as it should, in this body, regarding the future \npolicy of the United States in Bosnia.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense \nAppropriations conference report. First, I'd like to recognize Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye for the fine work they did in working \nthrough the conference issues with their House counterparts. I think \nthat after this vote, it will be clear that the vast majority of this \nbody supports the balance this report strikes between the changing \nneeds of our Armed Forces and the constraints imposed by necessary \nspending reductions.\n  I felt that the conferees made the right decision by endorsing the \nsubmarine teaming agreement. That endorsement ends the costly battle \nbetween our two submarine builders, saves the taxpayers money, and \npreserves competition in the research and development phase of \nsubmarine building. While some oppose this plan, no one argues the \npoint that this agreement will save the Navy hundreds of millions of \ndollars over the building plan contained in last year's bill. \nFurthermore, this plan maintains competition for new ideas on how to \nimprove the new attack submarine. In sum, we have two fine shipyards \nworking together overall to decrease the cost to taxpayers even while \nthey compete on sub-systems to ensure continued technological \nadvancement.\n  On a related matter, I'm heartened to see that this report provides \nfunding to complete the Seawolf submarine program. This building \nprogram has clearly undergone radical changes as a result of the end of \nthe cold war. At one point, this nation expected to build 30 Seawolf-\nclass submarines and now that number has been reduced to just 3 in \nfavor of the less-costly new attack submarine. So this Nation has \nalready throttled back in terms of its submarine plans; now it's time \nto move forward with our new plan.\n  This conference report also increases the number of Blackhawk \nhelicopters to 28, 10 more than the President requested. And it asks \nfor two navy CH-60 helicopters as well as advance procurement money for \nthat Navy version of the Blackhawk. These additional aircraft reveal \nonce again that the Blackhawk is this Nation's most capable helicopter. \nDerivatives of this helicopter are at work for nearly every branch of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces as well as 15 foreign countries. As capable and \nversatile as these helicopters are, however, National Guard adjutant \ngenerals throughout the country remind us year after year that they do \nnot have enough. In fact, a conservative reading of the numbers reveals \nthat the National Guard has a shortfall of over 400 Blackhawks. \nMeanwhile, the production line for these aircraft will shut down in a \ncouple of years. The plan for coping with that shortfall is to rely on \nVietnam-era UH-1 helicopters as we move into the next century. Frankly, \nas the National Guard stands at the front line of defense against \ndevastating natural disasters, they deserve better. I hope the \nPresident's next budget request reflects their requirements.\n  On a brighter note, this committee made the tough decisions between \nmodernizing military equipment and cutting costs. I was glad to see \nthat the committee agreed with the Defense Department's requests for \nthe C-17 cargo aircraft, the F-22 program, and the emerging Comanche \nhelicopter program. These prudent decisions in support of cost-\neffective programs will provide vital support for our military forces \nwell into the 21st century.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me congratulate the conferees on \ncompleting this bill, the largest of the 13 appropriations bills, \nbefore the end of the fiscal year. There was a lot of hard work in \nnegotiations that allowed this bill to move forward and I'm sure that \nthis body and the Nation appreciates their efforts.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have 8 minutes, roughly. I yield 4 \nminutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for up to \n4 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Stevens, \nand Senator Inouye, for producing a defense appropriations bill that \nwill fund the defense needs of our country. It will create a quality of \nlife improvement for those who are serving in our military, and it will \ngive us, to the extent that we can, the equipment that we need for our \nyoung men and women to do this job.\n  I want to point out particularly one part of this bill that I think \nis a major step for this Senate and for our country. That is the part \nthat provides for a cutoff of funds for the Bosnia deployment after \nJune 30, 1998, unless the President comes to Congress 45 days before \nthat time and shows us exactly why he would want to extend the forces, \nhow much it would cost, what it is going to do--what the mission is, \nand what the exit strategy is. This is what we have been asking the \nPresident for, for 2 years.\n  When we started this deployment over the objections of many of us in \nthis Congress, it was for 1 year, from November 1995 to November 1996. \nThen the continuation came with very little consultation from Congress, \ncertainly no previous consultation, and we started in January 1997 \nuntil now; it was set for June 1998. But even today the New York Times \neditorialized, ``Still No Exit Strategy on Bosnia.''\n  Congress is saying to the President, we want to see an exit strategy. \nMany of us are concerned that we are drifting into a potential \ncommitment that we do not understand, that the American people do not \nunderstand. They do not see a need for it because they don't see the \nstrategy. It seems, if you are looking at Bosnia, that the military \nmission is to keep the parties apart. But the political mission is to \nbring them together, perhaps bring them together prematurely.\n  I have been to the Balkans six times. I was there in August. I walked \non the streets of Brcko. I talked to the Serbs. I talked to the Muslim \nresidents. I asked them if they were helping each other move into the \nneighborhoods to bring the refugees back. They acted like the others \nweren't there. They are not helping each other. They are not ready for \nthis move. If we are going to try to continue to force this \nresettlement, is it an inherently peaceful move? Or are we disrupting \nthe peace that we would like to put into Bosnia today?\n  Mr. President, I think what this bill does is say, once and for all, \nwe are going to have consultation. We are not going to allow a mission \ncreep, such as we have seen in Somalia. We are not going to allow a \nmission creep, such as we have seen in Vietnam. We are not going to \nallow our young men and women, who are serving in Bosnia, to give their \nlives before we have a policy in this country about what our mission is \nthere. We are going to do it, I hope, in the light of day, taking into \nconsideration what the U.S. security interest\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\nis, what it is going to cost us, what our relationship is to our \nallies.\n  These are the questions we must address before we put our young men \nand women into a mission that has no end.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend the leaders of the armed services and \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. I am on that subcommittee. Under \nthe leadership of Chairman Stevens and cochairman, Senator Inouye, with \nSenator Pat Roberts, with Senator Russ Feingold, we are trying to \nfashion a policy that the American people will agree is the right \npolicy for our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Still No Exit Strategy on Bosnia\n\n       Having already stretched America's troop commitment in \n     Bosnia from 12 to 30 months, the Clinton Administration has \n     begun an effort to prepare public opinion for the possibility \n     of an even longer stay. That is the way to read Samuel \n     Berger's speech at Georgetown University on Tuesday, when he \n     linked the duration of American involvement to a notably \n     ambitious set of policy goals. Mr. Berger, the President's \n     national security adviser, is too hasty. Instead of managing \n     the public relations of a longer stay, he should be using the \n     time to try to produce a workable exit strategy by the June \n     deadline.\n       Everyone wants to unified, democratic and prospering \n     Bosnia. But Congressional Republicans are right to warn that \n     American soldiers cannot remain deployed until that goal is \n     fully achieved. What was regrettably absent from Mr. Berger's \n     speech was any sense of driving toward departure. It is clear \n     from the speech that Mr. Berger and Secretary of State \n     Madeleine Albright plan to spend the time between now and \n     June urging President Clinton once again to push back the \n     withdrawal deadline.\n       Lack of an exit strategy has been a consistently troubling \n     omission ever since Mr. Clinton first sent American troops \n     into Bosnia at the end of 1995. On Tuesday, Administration \n     officials spoke about the need to begin planning by February \n     for the next phase of military involvement. By our calender \n     it is still September, and such a focus on the hypothetical \n     future is premature. The Administration has nine months to \n     clarify the specific military talks that need to be \n     accomplished before Bosnia is secure enough to allow a full \n     American withdrawal. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison speaks for \n     many Republicans and, no doubt, a number of Democrats when \n     she warns the White House that without such an exit strategy, \n     Congress will fight any extension requests.\n       Common sense argues against igniting a renewed war in \n     Bosnia by precipitously withdrawing NATO troops. We readily \n     concede that withdrawal deadlines cannot be set in cement \n     without regard to protecting the progress that has already \n     been made. Future events could even warrant an extended \n     presence. But the Administration is tilting the wrong way, \n     and the current mindset of Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy team \n     suggests that it will not discover a way out in the absence \n     of a Congressional revolt.\n       When Mr. Clinton first proposed sending American troops to \n     Bosnia, skeptics argued that guaranteeing full respect for \n     the Dayton peace agreements could take decades. The \n     Administration countered that all it meant to do was give the \n     Bosnians a year to build the peace outlined at Dayton. As \n     that one-year deadline approached, the White House gave the \n     original mission a new name and extended if for 18 months. \n     Now, as the Administration seems to be preparing for yet \n     another extension, Congress may have to force it to show that \n     fundamental American interests require a continued military \n     presence in Bosnia.\n       The two strongest arguments for staying are the persistence \n     of deadly hatreds that could spark renewed hostilities once \n     outside troops withdraw and the statements by various \n     European governments that once American troops depart, their \n     troops will be withdrawn as well. But the irresponsibility of \n     Bosnian fractional leaders and European allies should not \n     push Washington into an expanded definition of America's own \n     vital interests.\n       The United States has all along had a limited interest in \n     Bosnia, consisting mainly of preventing the slaughter of \n     civilians and preserving the unity and effectiveness of the \n     NATO alliance. Beyond that there are some desirable goals, \n     like bringing war crimes suspects to trial and allowing \n     refugees to return to their homes. These warrant strong \n     diplomatic exertions, supplemented, at least through June, by \n     carefully planned military actions. There is a lot NATO \n     troops can still do in this regard before their currently \n     scheduled withdrawal date.\n       Building a united and peaceful Bosnia is ultimately up to \n     the people of Bosnia. Policing Europe in the absence of acute \n     threats like shooting wars is primarily the responsibility of \n     European nations themselves. If the Bosnians will not work \n     together and the Europeans will not shoulder greater security \n     responsibilities on their own, the breach cannot be filled \n     indefinitely with American troops.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to join the Senator from \nTexas [Mrs. Hutchison] in highlighting the provisions in Department of \nDefense appropriations bill, as agreed to in conference, concerning the \ndeployment of United States troops in Bosnia.\n  The conferees agreed to include--in legislative language--a provision \nthat stipulates that no funds may be made available for the deployment \nof United States ground forces in Bosnia after June 30, 1998--a date \nthe President himself has specified--unless the President submits to \nthe Congress a certification that the continued presence of our troops \nis necessary to protect our national security interests. In this \ncertification, the President will have to justify for the Congress and \nthe American people the reasons for such determination and specify \ndetails concerning the deployment. These include: the number of \nmilitary personnel to be deployed, the expected duration of the \ndeployment, the mission and objectives of the deployment, and the exit \nstrategy for the U.S. forces who have been deployed.\n  But most importantly, Mr. President, President Clinton will have to \ndetail the costs associated with any deployment after June 30, 1998. \nThis is perhaps the most troubling aspect of our involvement in Bosnia. \nAfter originally being told that the mission would cost the American \npeople some $2 billion, recent estimates indicate that we will soon \nhave spent well over $7 billion to deploy U.S. troops. Mr. President, \nthat is more than a threefold increase. With the language included in \nthe bill before us today, the administration will now have to be much \nmore clear about the potential costs of continuing deployment in the \nregion. I think this is vitally important so that we, the Members of \nthe U.S. Congress, and the American people we represent will have a \nbetter idea of the financial implications of a mission that I feel has \nalready gone on much too long with too little to show for it.\n  Because of my concerns about this mission, concerns which I have \ndetailed on the Senate floor many times before, I have joined with the \nSenator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] in developing a Senate Bosnia \nWorking Group. She and I both feel that it is time to think about what \npolicy alternatives we may have with respect to U.S. involvement in the \nBalkans.\n  The compromise language arrived at by the conferees, while perhaps \nnot as strong as I would have liked, hopefully represents a first step \ntoward the development of a policy that we can all be more comfortable \nwith.\n  So Mr. President, I thank all the conferees for their efforts in this \narea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Virginia 4 \nminutes, but I might say, Mr. President, to the Senator from Arizona, \nwe thought he might proceed first. If he doesn't use all his time, \nthere will be more time for us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye.\n  I have the usual objections. One of them is particularly egregious: \n$250,000 to transfer commercial cruise ship shipbuilding technology to \nU.S. Navy shipyards and to establish a monopoly for a single cruise \nline in the Hawaiian Islands, for which there is a competitor already \nwho wants to compete there. The people who tour the Hawaiian Islands \nand who live there are going to pay for that. I find it regrettable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the effects of over 10 years of cuts in \ndefense spending are being acutely felt by the men and women who serve \nin uniform. Enough has been said on this floor about issues like pilot \nretention, maintenance backlogs and modernization problems all caused \nby the confluence of declining resources and high operational temmpos \nthat I will not dwell on them here today. Suffice to say, I applaud the \ndecision by Congress to add $3.6 billion to the amount allocated for \nnational defense reflected in the legislation before us today. The \ndefense appropriations bill rightfully addresses some of these problems \nwith funds added during congressional budget negotiations earlier this \nyear.\n  The examples of waste, as usual, are many. I'm not sure whether I \nshould be nervous about an imminent threat to our national security \nfrom another\n\n[[Page S9948]]\n\nsolar system or galaxy. What or who is out there that warrants over \n$3.5 million in unrequested funds being added to the defense budget for \nthe Sacramento Peak Observatory and the Southern Observatory for \nAstronomical Research? I am cognizant of the very real risk that Earth \nmay someday be threatened by a comet or asteroid, but this is a problem \nalready receiving ample attention from the scientific community using \nother federal and private dollars. I question whether we should be \nusing defense dollars to fund these observatories.\n  I have to confess to also being concerned about the increasing amount \nof defense dollars being earmarked for medical research programs \ndespite the fact that the National Institutes for Health exists \nprecisely to perform such research. Each area of research, whether \ndiabetes, prostate cancer or HIV, carries with it an entirely \nsympathetic constituency for whom my heart goes out. That does not, \nhowever, justify the cynical use of defense dollars to conduct such \nresearch. To oppose this spending sets one up at as heartless. After \nall, who could oppose medical research. That, however, is precisely why \nMembers of Congress like to use the defense budget: opponents of these \nearmarks risk antagonizing people suffering from serious illness or who \nhave relatives with these afflictions. The point has to be made, \nhowever, that medical research not related to military service belongs \nwith NIH--not DoD.\n  Mr. President, the tortuous process through which Members of Congress \ncontort themselves to conjure up national security rationalizations for \nparochial projects is absurd. It degrades this institution and further \nundermines public confidence in their elected officials. The $8 million \nin this bill for the Pacific Disaster Center is a case in point, as is \nthe $9 million for the Monterey Institute for Counter-Proliferation \nAnalysis. The latter is illustrative of the growing trend toward \nestablishing endless numbers of research institutes irrespective of the \nexistence of other centers and government agencies already performing \nsuch work.\n  It is in this light that I find particularly disturbing the inclusion \nin this bill of $3 million for the establishment of a ``21st Century \nNational Security Study Group.'' Neither House nor Senate bill included \nthis item, but suddenly it finds itself in the Conference Report. Not \nonly is this group wholly unnecessary--after all, how many more such \nstudies do we really need, especially given the number produced without \nfederal dollars--but it was never even brought before either chamber of \nCongress prior to now.\n  This is ridiculous. What possible practical utility can this study \ngroup have? Is Congress so enamored of insinuating itself into the \nprocess of formulating our National Security and Military Strategies \nthat it needs to mandate that some smart people get together and do \nwhat they're already doing in Department of Defense doctrinal and \nwarfighting centers and research institutes all over America? Perhaps \nour counterparts in the House where I understand this program \noriginated have lost sight of why they are here.\n  I do not know why the defense appropriations conference report \nincludes $5 million to expand the North Star Borough Landfill; $20 \nmillion not requested by the Defense Department for an integrated \nfamily of test equipment; $50 million--$50 million--for an Industrial \nModernization program to assist in the commercial reutilization of \ngovernment industrial complexes no longer used by the government. Local \ngovernment and chambers of commerce have been performing this task just \nfine throughout the base closure process. Similarly, why do the \ncommunities surrounding Fort Ord and San Diego get a combined $15 \nmillion in defense conversion money earmarked in this bill? Was it \nnecessary to double the amount requested for the Young Marines program? \nShould Congress really be in the business of legislating monopolies for \nindividual cruise ship lines, as is done in this bill?\n  This body has important business to which it must attend. I believe I \nhave made my point. I won't even dwell on the $100,000 in the bill to \npreserve a Revolutionary War-era gunboat located at the bottom of Lake \nChamplain. There isn't time. Mr. President, the hemorrhaging of defense \ndollars for nondefense and highly questionable purposes is inexcusable \nduring a period when we are struggling with vital questions of long-\nterm military readiness. I hope to live to see the day Members of \nCongress see the light and cease this destructive practice of filling \nappropriations bills with garbage. It just has to stop.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable provisions in \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Objectionable Provisions in H.R. 2266, Conference Agreement on Fiscal \n                 Year 1998 Defense Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n       $35 million earmarked for the Kaho'olawe Island Conveyance, \n     Remediation, and Environmental Restoration Fund.\n       Section 8009 mandates that funding be available for \n     graduate medical education programs at Hawaii-based Army \n     medical facilities.\n       Section 8030 prohibits the use of funds appropriated in the \n     bill to reduce or disestablish the 53rd Weather \n     Reconnaissance Squadron of the Air Force Reserve, based at \n     Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi.\n       Section 8056 sets aside $8 million (unauthorized) for \n     mitigation of environmental impacts on Indian lands.\n       Section 8078 requires the Army to utilize the former George \n     Air Force Base.\n       Section 8097 directs a $13 million grant to the Intrepid \n     Sea-Air-Space Foundation to refurbish the U.S.S.

Mr. President, I would like to continue on this very \nimportant issue. The 19th century Danish philosopher Kierkegaard wrote \nthat ``purity of heart is to will one thing.'' In Bosnia, the \ninternational community has willed many things, and the result has been \na highly tenuous peace among the warring ethnic factions unlikely to \nlong survive the departure of NATO military forces. As we all know, \nwhat was originally a 1-year mission has involved in a multiyear \nengagement of indeterminate duration. It is time to assess where we are \nand where we are going, with an eye toward ending deployment of U.S. \nforces to that war-torn region.\n  When this body debated back in December 1995 the issue of whether to \nsupport the deployment of U.S. forces as part of the Implementation \nForce following the signing of the Dayton peace accords, I stated that, \n``I know that by supporting the deployment, but not the decision [to \nsend the troops], I must accept the blame if something happens.'' \nEvents of the past several weeks have shown disturbing signs of a trend \nthat may entail actions being taken that will result in the death of \nAmerican servicemen. Mr. President, I am a realist. I recognize that \nthe military exists to support national policy and that wearing the \nuniform involves a very real risk of being killed in action. Our \nfailure to ``will one thing,'' however, is leading us down a perilous \npath on which such deaths will have been unnecessary.\n  Congress, the press, scholars, and others have all considered the \nperennial question of mission creep. We can stop debating it, and \naccept that it has happened. Comparisons have been made with the ill-\nfated mission in Somalia to capture the late warlord and tribal leader \nMohammed Farah Aideed. Such comparisons are often inappropriate for a \nnumber of reasons, but in this case it is valid. The multinational \nforce, including the 9,400-strong contingent of U.S. troops, has seen \nits mission grow from that which is very specifically set forth in the \nannex accompanying the Dayton accords to one of extraordinarily \nconfusing incongruity. The recent capture by British special forces of \na Bosnian Serb indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The \nHague and the killing of another certainly sent a signal to Radovan \nKaradzic, Ratko Mladic, and the others on the long list of war \ncriminals that at long last that provision of Dayton would be enforced.\n  As with Farah Aideed in Somalia, however, the signal has raised the \nstakes greatly in terms of the cost we could pay to bring them to \njustice. Lest anyone think I exaggerate, remember the tragedy of \nwatching an entire company of elite American soldiers killed or wounded \nwhile Farah Aideed continued to elude capture. The situation in Bosnia \ncould be incomparably worse.\n  The United States has overtly positioned itself in the middle of a \npower struggle between two Bosnian Serb leaders, President Biljana \nPlavsic and Radovan Karadzic. It is not what I would consider a great \nset of options. In the world of Serbian politics, though, everything is \nrelative. The Clinton Administration has thrown its weight behind \nPresident Plavsic, the properly elected leader despite her abysmal \nrecord during the years following the splintering of the former\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\nYugoslavia into ethnically derived divisions. Not a hard choice when \nthe alternative is Karadzic, whose name should rightfully be placed \nalongside those of other 20th Century butchers. The point I am trying \nto raise, however, is that once we sided with one faction within the \nBosnian-Serb community, we placed our military personnel in the kind of \nposition that faced those in Lebanon in 1983 and Somalia 10 years \nlater.\n  The phenomenon of mission creep was accepted by most when it entailed \nbenign nation-building measures. Indeed, the absence of a viable \nalternative to NATO in terms of competence, discipline, willingness to \nthink innovatively, and absence of the kind of civilian political \noversight that characterized the disastrous and tragic decision making \napparatus under former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and \nhis deputy Yasushi Akashi made it only logical that the military \ncomponent of the operation to end the war and rebuild the country \nshould fall on NATO's shoulders. Logical, but not necessarily right. \nThat extension of the military's original mission of simply keeping the \nwarring factions apart ensured that the deployment would last longer \nthan originally intended.\n  When the President announced that he would keep our forces in Bosnia \nbeyond the original withdrawal date, he was met with widespread \nskepticism. How many of us actually believed that the June 1998 target \ndate would be met? We knew that the deployment would continue \nindefinitely; that the costs would never be properly budgeted; that the \ndiplomatic framework upon which we are operating would never stand on \nits own. But we also knew that a decision by Congress to terminate \nfunding for troops in the field, for men and women sent in harms way at \nthe behest of their Commander-in-Chief, stands as perhaps the most \nmorally and politically difficult we can ever be called upon to make.\n  The absence of an exit strategy has made it easier for the \nAdministration to justify keeping troops there to execute an expanding \nlist of missions with no logical completion date other than the fairly \narbitrary one of June 1998. The appearance of conflict back in the late \nMay-early June timeframe between the Secretaries of State and Defense \nand the more recent contradictory messages conveyed by the National \nSecurity Advisor and the Secretary of Defense regarding the June 1998 \nwithdrawal date illuminates all too well the total lack on the part of \nthe Administration of a clear concept of what we are doing in Bosnia \nand, consequently, how long we should be there.\n  Mr. President, I supported the decision to deploy troops to end the \nwar because President Clinton, in his capacity as Chief Executive and \nwith his constitutional prerogative of conducting this Nation's foreign \npolicy, had committed us to stop the fighting. And let no one doubt \nthat the bitterness involved, the scale of atrocities inflicted, did \nnot warrant some kind of forceful action.\n  It is certainly likely that a peacekeeping force will be needed \nbeyond June 1998. The parties to the conflict in Bosnia have shown \nlittle sign that they are prepared to accept in full the terms of the \nDayton Accord, and key provisions like the return of refugees to their \npre-war homes will require the presence of such a force. There is a \nlegitimate question, though, whether that contingent needs to include \nU.S. ground forces. We should not continue to accept the protestations \nof our allies, such as those that were voiced prior to our deployment \nof ground forces, that the United States is not sharing the risk. This \ncountry has seen too many of its fallen soldiers laid to rest in \nEuropean cemetaries for us to accept that kind of rhetoric. A \npeacekeeping force without United States ground forces can and should \nassume responsibility for Bosnia after June 1998.\n  This does not imply an abandonment of our allies and friends in the \neffort at preventing a return of the fighting that forced the civilized \nworld to once again reflect upon the fragility of global or regional \npeace. On the contrary, the conflagration that enveloped the former \nYugoslavia earlier this decade was all the more shocking for its \noccurrence in Europe, where war was considered least likely to occur \nfollowing the end of the East-West confrontation of the cold war era. \nThe war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a sad reminder that the so-called \nenlightened continent remains vulnerable to the kind of hatred and \nviolence that culminated not long ago in the Holocaust.\n  What is important, to this country, is that we not become the \npermanent caretaker of the region. Our troops must be out by the end of \nJune 1998. We should maintain a rapid reaction force in Hungary, and \nour heavier forces in Germany should remain available if needed. The \nrapid reaction force should include air and ground components capable \nof responding in a timely manner to a resurgence in fighting with \nsufficient strength to quell any such fighting at minimal risk to our \npersonnel. But make no mistake: The peacekeeping force that remains \ninside Bosnia and Herzegovina must be European in content. The \ngovernments of Europe must accept responsibility for maintaining peace \nin their own backyard. Two world wars demonstrated that the United \nStates cannot disengage from Europe, and our own economic well-being \ndemands that we not do so. But the American public should not be \nexpected to see its military personnel kept in harm's way in perpetuity \nin a situation where the parties refuse to take the necessary steps for \nlasting peace.\n  During the cold war, we prided ourselves on our role as leader of the \nfree world. Those of us who know the horror of war first hand, however, \nknow the price such leadership entails. It is not a price that should \nbe paid in Bosnia. We should not send the wrong message to our \npersonnel in the field by cutting off their funding; but we should send \na message to the President that the United States has done all it can \nfor that sad country and withdraw our soldiers from Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona and his remarks and, indeed, those \nof the distinguished Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison]. I have worked \nwith them on this very issue.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Appropriations Committee for the \nlanguage which is contained in their bill, but I would like to urge \nthat this whole analysis be taken a step further.\n  During the course of the confirmation hearings on General Shelton, I \nsaid that it is time for the United States to exercise the leadership \nto reconvene the principles, the very principles that laid down the \nDayton accords, assess what has been done, what has to be done and, \nmost significantly, the realistic chances of the balance being done.\n  Mr. President, I have in my hand, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an op-ed piece by the distinguished former \nNational Security Adviser, Dr. Kissinger, with whom I worked when he \nwas in that position, and likewise excerpts from the statement by the \ncurrent National Security Adviser, showing very clearly different \nviewpoints by distinguished Americans who understand this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 22, 1997]\n\n                Limits to What the U.S. Can Do in Bosnia\n\n                          (By Henry Kissinger)\n\n       Every American foreign policy setback, from Indochina to \n     Somalia, has resulted from the failure to define objectives, \n     to choose means appropriate to these objectives and to create \n     a public opinion prepared to pay the necessary price over the \n     requisite period of time.\n       We are now on the verge of sliding into a similar dilemma \n     in Bosnia: Our goals are unrealistic, the means available do \n     not fit the objectives and the public is unlikely to block \n     the probable consequences of our actions. Policy drifts \n     because three issues await resolution: What are our \n     objectives in Bosnia? How long should our troops stay? What \n     risks should we run for the capture of war criminals?\n       In 1991, when Yugoslavia broke up, the United States joined \n     the other NATO countries in recognizing its various \n     administrative subdivisions as independent states. With\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\n     respect to Croatia and Slovenia, inhabited by a dominant \n     ethnic group, this decision made sense. But in Bosnia, \n     populated by Croats, Serbs and Muslims whose reciprocal \n     hatreds had broken up the much larger Yugoslavia, the attempt \n     to bring about a multiethnic state evoked a murderous civil \n     war.\n       The same flaw that attended the birth of the Bosnian state \n     lies at the heart of the dilemmas of the Dayton accords \n     mediated by the United States that brought about the current \n     Bosnian cease fire. Its military provisions separate the \n     parties substantially along the lines of the ethnic enclaves \n     that emerged as hostilities ceased. But the political \n     provisions do the opposite. They seek to unite these enclaves \n     under the banner of a multiethnic state that caused the \n     explosion in the first place.\n       The American tendency is to treat Bosnian tensions as a \n     political problem to be overcome by constitutional provisions \n     that reconcile the parties and establish procedures for \n     settling conflicts. But for the Bosnians, the overwhelming \n     reality is their historical memory, which has sustained their \n     ineradicable hatreds and unquenchable aspirations for \n     centuries.\n       Throughout their histories, the Serbs and Croats have \n     considered themselves defenders of their religions, first \n     against a Muslim tide, then against each other. The Serbs' \n     identity derives from a series of bloody battles in defense \n     of the Serbian faith and population against Islam. Once Islam \n     was stopped, the Serbs fought to vindicate their independence \n     from Catholic Austria, spear-headed by the Croats.\n       The Croats perception is precisely the reverse--as \n     upholders of Catholicism against Serbian Orthodoxy and Islam. \n     And the Muslims know that they are regarded by the two other \n     ethnic groups as a historical instrument of the hated Turks \n     and therefore--since ethnically they are at one with the \n     Serbs and Croats--as turncoats.\n       The deep-seated hatred of each party for all the others \n     exists because their conflict is more akin to the Thirty \n     Years War over religion than it is to political conflict. And \n     this should serve to caution the United States not to get in \n     between these parties by trying to impose political solutions \n     drawn from our own, largely secular, experience.\n       Once passions were unleashed by the civil war, each group \n     committed unspeakable cruelties in the process of expelling \n     the other groups from the regions that they controlled--the \n     ethnic cleansing. The Serbs started the process, but as the \n     war continued, the other parties also engaged in murderous \n     acts--the Croats in Krajina, the Muslims around Sarajevo. \n     Among the existing leaders, few, if any, innocents are to be \n     found.\n       The NATO allies would have done well to stop the killings \n     six years ago, in its incipient phase. They could have taken \n     the position that they would not tolerate such outrages \n     within reach of NATO forces and on the continent where the \n     political concept of human dignity originated and is now \n     institutionalized. As a result of their failure to do so, \n     each of the ethnic regions of Bosnia has become largely \n     homogeneous; the results of ethnic, cleansing are now the \n     dominant fact of life in Bosnia.\n       The political provisions of the Dayton agreement seek to \n     reverse this state of affairs. They provide for free movement \n     among the ethnic enclaves, for free repatriation of refugees \n     and for elections leading to national reconciliation. This \n     vision has turned out to be a mirage.\n       No free movement among the various ethnic enclaves takes \n     place, and no mail or telephone services exist. Each ethnic \n     group issues its own currency, license plates and passports. \n     Serbs with Cyrillic license plates are at particular risk in \n     other areas, but so are the Muslims and Croats if they leave \n     their enclaves. Not surprisingly, refugees tend to return \n     home only with armed escorts and are frequently obliged to \n     flee as soon as the escorts leave.\n       Nor will elections solve the problem. In Bosnia, elections \n     are not about alternation in office but about dominance \n     determining life, death and religion. They must either ratify \n     the new ethnic composition, or, since refugees vote on the \n     rolls of the towns from which they have been expelled, \n     produce the bizarre situation that absentee voters are in \n     a position to ``win'' and, in effect, gain the right to \n     rule the group that expelled them. In the Krajina region, \n     for example, now occupied by Croatia, the voting rolls of \n     many towns show a majority of Serbs, all of whom have been \n     expelled. Are NATO forces expected to enforce this \n     outcome?\n       Refusing to recognize these realities has twisted American \n     policies into contortions that will guarantee an ultimate \n     breakdown. Exerting considerable economic and political \n     pressure, we engineered the shotgun wedding between Croats \n     and Muslims that goes under the label of the Bosnian \n     Federation. In this technically multiethnic structure, within \n     which no cease-fire line is necessary according to the \n     official mythology, NATO patrols only the line between the \n     so-called Federation and the Serb part of Bosnia.\n       Reality mocks this mythology. The dividing line between \n     Croats and Muslims is as rigid as the one between them and \n     the Serbs. No Croat officials enter Muslim territory, no \n     Muslim official serves in the Croat part of the Federation. \n     Few Croats are to be found in Sarajevo, the purported capital \n     of the Federation that was ethnically cleansed when the \n     Muslims took it over after the Dayton accords were signed. \n     Nor is there free movement of Croat and Muslim groups within \n     the Federation.\n       It is a conceit that this state of affairs is the fault of \n     a few evil bigots who, once removed either to war crimes \n     trials or to exile, will permit the natural preference of the \n     ethnic groups for some sort of unity to assert itself. This \n     misconception has tempted senior American officials to \n     pretend that Croat attitudes are the aberrations of its \n     president, Franjo Tudjman, and has led the American NATO \n     commander to abandon the neutral position of mediator and \n     involve himself in the internal struggles of the Serb part of \n     Bosnia.\n       Neither judgment is correct. In Croatia, the opposition is \n     even less flexible than the president. And while Serb \n     strongman Radovan Karadzic well deserves to be placed before \n     a war crimes tribunal, his adversary, Biljana Plavsic, will \n     not survive politically unless she too advocates nationalist \n     Serb policies without, of course, the war-crime element.\n       A multiethnic state in Bosnia is unlikely to emerge except \n     after another round of fighting, and then only if one of the \n     parties achieves an overwhelming victory. Should NATO \n     military power be used to promote such an outcome? Should \n     American casualties be incurred to force the various ethnic \n     groups into a multiethnic state that the majority of them do \n     not want? Why should we violate our own principle of self-\n     determination in pursuit of such goals?\n       American pressure to implement the political provisions of \n     the Dayton accords may well lead to precisely such an \n     outcome. The cease-fire now holds because of NATO's military \n     preponderance and because the Muslims, the only ethnic group \n     seeking a multiethnic state, are arming for the purpose of \n     imposing what we are urging. Since they are now already the \n     better equipped, they will probably achieve initial successes \n     and thereupon implement another round of ethnic cleansing. At \n     that point, the Croats would almost certainly enter the fray \n     to keep the Muslims from achieving a dominant position. And \n     Russia, the historical protector of the Serbs, is unlikely to \n     remain passive--at least politically.\n       Some favor such risks to punish the evil men who are \n     assumed to have undermined the traditional coexistence \n     between the ethnic groups. But there has never been a Bosnian \n     state on the present territory of Bosnia. Whenever the \n     various ethnic groups have lived together in apparent \n     harmony, it was due to the pressure of some outside force \n     that overwhelmed their passions--the Turks, the Austrians or \n     Tito's dictatorship. The Croats slaughtered the Serbs under \n     Hitler, the Serbs slaughtered the Croats in the early years \n     of Tito; both Croats and Serbs cling to a collective memory \n     of Muslim atrocities under Turkish rule.\n       Another often-cited argument holds that to abandon the \n     political part of the Dayton Agreement is to reward \n     aggression on the model of Hitler's dismemberment of \n     Czechoslovakia. The analogy is mistaken. Hitler violated a \n     recognized sovereign state; Bosnia's civil war was triggered \n     by the West's misconceived attempt to experiment with a \n     multiethnic state among populations divided by religion and \n     whose very reason for existence has been to prevent \n     domination by the other ethnic groups.\n       America has no national interest for which to risk lives to \n     produce a multiethnic state in Bosnia. The creation of a \n     multiethnic state should be left to negotiations among the \n     parties--welcomed by America if it happens but not pursued at \n     the risk of American lives. America does have a political \n     concern to preserve the cease-fire for a reasonable period. \n     We have already extended the deadline for withdrawal which \n     the president promised to Congress. A case can be made to \n     extend it once again with gradually reduced forces for a \n     limited period--but after next June with personnel who have \n     specifically volunteered for this duty, backed up by air \n     power and naval forces stationed nearby. Manning cease-fire \n     lines in Bosnia cannot be a permanent American undertaking.\n       As for the war criminals, there is no doubt that they \n     deserve to be judged before a tribunal constituted for that \n     purpose at The Hague. In the current state of affairs, an \n     American military move would be construed as an effort to \n     break Serb resistance to a multiethnic state and therefore \n     would be opposed bitterly by the Serb population. But if \n     America confined its role in Bosnia to maintaining the cease-\n     fire lines and left the political evolution to the parties, a \n     situation might present itself in which the arrest of war \n     criminals could be dealt with on its merits.\n       America must avoid drifting into a crisis with implications \n     it may not be able to master. The administration deserves \n     much credit for having brought about the end of hostilities. \n     Ending communal hatred is a longer-term challenge. We can \n     facilitate this but we cannot justify military action.\n\n Excerpts From Remarks on Bosnia at Georgetown University, Washington, \n                                   DC\n\n              (By Sandy Berger, National Security Adviser)\n\n       Some argue that we set our sights too high in Dayton, that \n     only an ethnic partition will produce the stability we want \n     and extricate us from Bosnia. I believe the partitionists are \n     wrong. Because accepting partition means ratifying the worst \n     ethnic cleansing in Europe in more than a half century. We \n     should not give up on justice and reward aggression.\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\n       Partition also would be wrong because it would send the \n     message to ethnic fanatics everywhere that the international \n     community will allow redrawing of borders by force, by \n     creating the kinds of ethnically pure states that often \n     harbor a dangerous sense of grievance, entities that would be \n     inherently unstable, ultimately not viable, and inclined to \n     expansionist aggression, partition would lead not to peace, \n     but to war.\n       In short, to advocate partition is to accept defeat.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think it is imperative we take the steps \noutlined in this amendment and add additional steps so that this \ncountry does not drift into a new policy along the very lines that the \nSenator from Arizona has so eloquently stated.\n  I was privileged, on behalf of the Armed Services Committee, to write \nthe committee's report on Somalia, with the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan [Mr. Levin]. I well understood how we got into it, what the \nproblems were. And, once again, we are in the business of nation \nbuilding as we interpose ourself amongst the several political factions \nfighting in that country.\n  I voted consistently against putting ground troops in. Therefore, I \ncan stand here with a clear conscience today and say, once they are in, \nwe have to assess what is that exit strategy. We are going to have $7.3 \nbillion of American taxpayers' money expended if we go through June \n1998. There is no way of assessing the price tag of the risks of our \nmen and women of the Armed Forces of our Nation have taken during that \nperiod of time. Therefore, this policy has to be rethought, and I think \nno less a reconvening of the Dayton principles is a measure we need to \ndo to get to the right result in this situation.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager for my few minutes \nhere.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If there is any time, I reserve it. Does the Senator \nfrom Hawaii have any final statements?\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in strong support of the \n     United States-flag Cruise Ship pilot project included in the \n     Senate's Fiscal Year 1998 Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Bill, S1005, as passed on July 15, 1997. The \n     construction of large, ocean-going cruise ships in United \n     States' shipyards under this project is vital to \n     transitioning U.S. shipyards back into the construction of \n     cruise ships and to sustain this country's shipbuilding \n     industrial base.\n       Military preparedness depends on the maintenance of a \n     robust industrial base for U.S. Navy shipbuilding. With the \n     decline in the number of new construction Navy ships, we have \n     been actively encouraging the producers of our large warships \n     and support ships to explore commercial opportunities. The \n     sophistication involved in cruise ship design and \n     construction makes this commercial project ideal for \n     sustaining critical shipbuilding skills.\n       The MARITECH program authorized by Congress in Fiscal Year \n     1994 has served as an innovative research and development \n     initiative to improve the international competitiveness of \n     our U.S. shipyards, particularly in the construction of \n     large, oceangoing vessels of all types. The technology \n     transfer that accompanies any large ship construction program \n     is essential to the continued viability of the shipyard \n     industrial base in the U.S. The Cruise Ship pilot project \n     contained in Section 8097 of S1005 would provide the means \n     for just such technology transfers. I support the use of \n     $250,000 in Fiscal Year 1998 for the Cruise Ship pilot \n     project.\n       However, I have some concern with the language that \n     prohibits the future use of federal funds under this section. \n     There may be a future need to utilize federal research and \n     development funds for shared ship design applications and \n     this requirement should be left to the determination of the \n     Secretary of Defense. Specifically, the Navy is interested in \n     exploring the potential use of the hull design used for these \n     cruise ships as the hull for future Joint Command and Control \n     ships. Accordingly, the Navy needs the flexibility to spend \n     research and development funds on a common hull design for \n     this mission.\n       Your support for this important project is appreciated. A \n     similar letter has been sent to the other Chairmen of the \n     Congressional Defense Committees.\n           Sincerely.\n     John W. Douglass.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                           Executive Chambers,\n\n                                    Honolulu, HI, August 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: I recently received a briefing on your \n     U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project (S. 1005, Sec. 8097) \n     contained in the FY 1998 Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Bill.\n       Hawaii's domestic cruise ship operation remains a vital \n     component of our state's visitor industry. I am excited about \n     the prospect of revitalizing that business with new passenger \n     cruise ships dedicated solely to interisland cruises.\n       I support your leadership in initiating an innovative \n     program aimed at facilitating a dedicated cruise ship within \n     18 months and the construction of two new cruise ships, the \n     first to be built in U.S. shipyards in over 40 years.\n       Please know that you can count on the full support of the \n     State of Hawaii in your efforts.\n       With warmest personal regards,\n           Aloha,\n     Benjamin J. Cayetano.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 National Security\n\n\n                                            Caucus Foundation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1997.\n     Hon. C.W. (Bill) Young,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on National Security, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is a follow-up to the letter you \n     received from Assistant Secretary of the Navy John Douglass \n     regarding the United States-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project. \n     We are in complete agreement with Secretary Douglass, the \n     U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense, and many prominent \n     national security experts regarding the importance of this \n     initiative.\n       During the August recess Secretary Douglass and Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary Hammes participated in a Congressional \n     Delegation (CODEL) to Asia which was sponsored by the NSC \n     Foundation. This project was a focal point of their meetings \n     with your fellow members of the Appropriations Committee and \n     the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n       They also joined your colleague Duke Cunningham in meetings \n     with the President, Defense Minister and Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Philippines. They all emphasized \n     the importance of American shipbuilding to the national \n     security interests of both of our nations.\n       Furthermore, many of your colleagues participated in a \n     recent National Security Caucus dinner with Navy Secretary \n     John Dalton and Marine Corps Commandant Charles Krulak who \n     both said this program is vital to sustain our nation's \n     shipbuilding industrial base.\n       The bottom line is that the senior leadership of the \n     national security community is supporting this initiative \n     because it is an ideal project to sustain critical \n     shipbuilding skills. Furthermore, as the Assistant Secretary \n     indicated, the Navy is very interested in exploring the \n     potential use of hull designs used for these cruise ships as \n     the hull for future Joint Command and Control Ships.\n       Finally, several flag officers have already testified \n     before your Subcommittee regarding the need for builders of \n     large warships and support ships to explore commercial \n     opportunities. The United States-Flag Cruise Ship Project is \n     a perfect example of an appropriate commercial initiative, \n     and we hope you will join your Senate colleagues in \n     supporting this endeavor.\n       We are enclosing an analysis which describes this project \n     in further detail. If your staff has any questions about this \n     please have them contact Gregg Hilton, the Executive Director \n     of the NSC Foundation, at 479-4580. Many thanks.\n         Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, USN (Ret.), Former Chairman, \n           Joint Chiefs of Staff; Rear Admiral Robert H. Spiro, \n           Jr., USNR (Ret.), Former Under Secretary of the Army, \n           Carter Administration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 National Security\n\n\n                                            Caucus Foundation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.\n\n               The United States-Flag Cruise Ship Project\n\n       The United-States-flag Cruise Ship Project was included in \n     the Fiscal Year 1998 Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Bill (S. 1005) when it was passed by the Senate on July 15. \n     Many prominent national security experts\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\n     believe that the construction of large, oceangoing cruise \n     ships in United States' shipyards under that project is vital \n     to transitioning U.S. shipyards. This will allow them to move \n     from strictly military to commercial vessel construction and \n     the initiative is important for the preservation and \n     modernization of the American shipyard industrial base.\n       Military preparedness depends on the maintenance of a \n     robust industrial base for U.S. navy shipbuilding and repair. \n     In this country, we have six shipyards capable of building \n     large warships and support ships critical to our national \n     defense.\n       The U.S. Navy believes it is essential for these shipyards \n     to remain active, with a skilled and trained work force. The \n     declining number of active U.S. Navy ships and new \n     construction and repair opportunities requires America to \n     look to commercial ship building as the best means by which \n     to maintain that shipbuilding capability. The burgeoning \n     worldwide demand for cruise ships, coupled with their \n     sophisticated construction demands, make cruise ships an \n     ideal commercial project for American shipyards to maintain \n     their heightened state of readiness.\n       The MARITECH program was authorized by Congress in 1994 and \n     according to senior Defense Department officials it has \n     served as an innovative research and development initiative \n     to improve the international competitiveness of U.S. \n     shipyards, particularly in the construction of large, \n     oceangoing vessels of all types. The technology transfer that \n     accompanies any large ship construction program is essential \n     to the modernization of the shipyard industrial base in the \n     United States. The cruise ship pilot project contained in \n     Section 8097 of S. 1005, as amended, would provide the means \n     for just such technology transfers, without requiring \n     obligation of scarce federal shipbuilding funds for either \n     shipyard tooling or the construction of the vessels \n     themselves.\n       This provision, as passed by the Senate will jump start \n     cruise ship construction in the U.S., develop the American \n     flag cruise industry and help reduce U.S. shipyard dependence \n     on Department of Defense construction--all without the use of \n     federal funds. It would result in the construction in the \n     U.S. of two state of the art large ocean-going commercial \n     cruise ships. These ships cost hundreds of millions of \n     dollars each and will be built with private capital. The \n     pilot project will create thousands of jobs in U.S. shipyards \n     during construction and on board the vessels after \n     completion.\n       The provision would be supervised under the Department of \n     Defense's MARITECH program. Under MARITECH auspices two \n     cruise ship design projects have been completed, the pilot \n     project would result in actual construction.\n       An existing operator of U.S.-flag cruise ships in Hawaii \n     and on the inland waterways is ready and willing to build new \n     cruise ships. However, U.S. shipyards have not built a large \n     ocean-going cruise ship in over 40 years and the first \n     operator to do so faces a cost disadvantage.\n       The pilot project would assist U.S. yards by facilitating \n     series construction of the two new cruise ships and the \n     operator would be required to sign a binding contract for \n     delivery of the first vessel by 2005, the second by 2008.\n       The pilot project would also help Hawaii operations by \n     permitting the temporary reflagging of an existing foreign-\n     flag cruise ship for operation under the U.S.-flag with U.S. \n     crews while the new ships are constructed in order to develop \n     market demand and would give preference in the trade for the \n     life expectancy of the vessels built under this program in \n     order to allow an adequate return on the significant \n     investment required to enter and develop this market.\n       U.S. shipyards build the best naval vessels in the world, \n     but without the infusion of commercial shipbuilding \n     technology, as will be made possible under the proposed pilot \n     project, our shipyards will find it increasingly difficult to \n     make the transition to building large commercial vessels that \n     is vital to the future of our shipyard industrial base.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    July 17, 1997.\n       Dear Congressman: We are writing to request your support \n     for the U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project contained in \n     Section 8097 of S. 1005 of the FY '98 DOD Appropriations bill \n     as passed by the Senate under the leadership of Chairman \n     Stevens and Senator Inouye. This provision is critically \n     important to our U.S. flag cruise ship industry and for our \n     U.S. shipbuilding base.\n       Section 8097 would direct the MARITECH program to supervise \n     a pilot project to enhance the shipbuilding industrial base \n     and to develop the U.S.-flag cruise industry. The MARITECH \n     program (authorized by the FY '94 defense authorization bill) \n     has served as an innovative research and development \n     initiative that has produced substantive results in improving \n     the international competitiveness of the shipbuilding \n     industry in the United States.\n       The U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project would result in the \n     construction of two new cruise ships in U.S. yards and allow \n     the temporary reflagging of one foreign cruise ship. The \n     project would be privately funded and constructed (without \n     the use of federal funds) and provide preference in the trade \n     in order to allow for an adequate return on the significant \n     capital investment required to develop this new shipbuilding \n     capability and a broader market for U.S. cruise ships. The \n     U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project means thousands of \n     shipyard jobs over several years and more than two thousand \n     permanent jobs on board the vessels when completed--\n     approximately seven hundred within the first year alone. We \n     urge your support of this important provision.\n           Very truly yours,\n         American Classic Voyages Co., Philip Calian, President; \n           American Shipbuilding Association, Cynthia Brown, \n           President; Transportation Institute, James Henry, \n           President; American Maritime Officers, Michael K. \n           McKay, President; Seafarers International Union, \n           Michael Sacco, President; American Maritime Officers \n           Service, Gordon Spencer, Legis. Director.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I believe the Record should note that up \nuntil the latter part of 1967, America controlled the seas. Most of the \ncruise vessels were American owned, American built. Today, the \nsituation is slightly changed. Last year, over 6.2 million passengers \nworldwide--and 75 percent were Americans. The Caribbean and the Bahamas \nregions, which is the largest North American market, does not have a \nsingle American cruise vessel.\n  Cruises are the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry. They \nbring in over $7.5 billion in revenues. And 113 vessels currently \noperate in the North American market--1 American. Of the 30 companies \noperating in the North American market, 3 companies--foreign companies, \nMr. President--command over 70 percent of the market. These foreign \nships are obviously built in foreign shipyards. They employ very cheap \nforeign labor and operate outside our regulations. They pay no U.S. \ntaxes and are not available for U.S. emergencies.\n  Shipbuilding subsidies in foreign countries in recent years ranged \nfrom 9 percent to 33 percent of the cost of the vessel's construction. \nAt a 9-percent construction subsidy, an operator today could build a \nnew $500 million, 130,000-ton cruise vessel in a foreign yard and \nreduce its cost of capital by an astounding $45 million. The United \nStates, since the early 1980's, has not subsidized the commercial \nconstruction of ships.\n  These foreign companies also take advantage of the lower cost of \nforeign labor. In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently ran an article \nreporting these foreign cruise companies pay workers on board their \nships a paltry $1.50 per day--that's right, $1.50 per day before tips--\nfor 16 to 18 hours of work. We here in the United States have \nundertaken an aggressive campaign to stop the use of sweatshop labor, \nand we should hold these foreign-flag ships operating in the American \nmarket to those same high standards.\n  But perhaps the main reason these vessels fly a foreign flag is to \navoid U.S. tax laws. Although most of these foreign-flag cruise \noperations are located in the United States--and most of their \npassengers are Americans--they are protected by reciprocal \ninternational tax treaties. These reciprocal agreements allow the \nforeign-flag cruise ship companies to avoid the tax laws of the United \nStates. For example, one large foreign-flag cruise operator recently \nreported earnings of approximately $1.8 billion in revenues for its \ncruise operations. While most of these revenues came from American \npassengers, this cruise line, under existing U.S. law, considers this \nforeign source income which is exempt from U.S. tax law. Because of \nthis loophole, this one company did not pay any income tax on its \ncruise ship operations. Based on the companies' net income from cruise \noperations, this can be equated to a $158 million corporate income tax \nloss to the Federal Treasury.\n  An existing operator of U.S.-flag cruise ships in Hawaii and on the \ninland waterways, however, is ready and willing to build new U.S. \ncruise ships and employ American workers. But since U.S. shipyards have \nnot built a large oceangoing cruise ship in over 40 years, the first \noperator to do so faces a significant cost disadvantage. That is why \nthe U.S.-flag cruise ship pilot project is so important.\n  The pilot project will facilitate a series construction for two new \ncruise ships by requiring the operator to sign a binding shipyard \ncontract with delivery of the first new vessel no later than 2005; the \nsecond by 2008. In order to replace a retired ship and develop market \ndemand that operator will temporarily document an existing foreign-flag \ncruise ship for operation under U.S.-\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\nflag with U.S. crews while the new ships are constructed.\n  This project is a milestone for our U.S.-flag cruise ship industry. \nAfter decades of dormancy in the oceangoing U.S. cruise ship arena, we \nnow have a U.S. company that is willing to make a very substantial \ninvestment to try to rebuild our once proud U.S.-flag passenger fleet. \nBecause this existing operator will make a very large investment in the \ndevelopment of new U.S.-flag cruise ships, which otherwise would not \nexist absent this significant investment, section 8109 includes a \npreference to ensure that other operators do not take advantage of this \ncompany incurring such ``first mover'' development costs and unfairly \ncompete against the existing operator. I would note that Congress has \nprovided similar incentives and preferences in other areas. The patent \nsystem is perhaps the most prominent example of such a restriction that \nprotects, and thus encourages, investment in the development of new \nproducts and services that otherwise would not exist--even in highly \ncompetitive markets, such as the computer industry.\n  The patent-like preference contained in section 8109 is for a very \nnarrow segment of the highly competitive Hawaiian tourism market--\ndomestic inter-island cruises. These cruises account for less than 1 \npercent of overall Hawaiian tourism and an even smaller percentage of \nthe North American cruise market. Moreover, Hawaii vacationers will \nhave many competitively priced vacation alternatives to these new \ncruise ships. In addition, foreign-flag cruise ships, with their \nsignificant cost advantages in terms of low capital costs, low foreign \nlabor costs, and freedom from U.S. income tax, will still be free to \ncall in Hawaii, just as they always have. In fact, in 1995 alone 12 \ncompeting foreign-flag cruise ships operated in the Hawaiian market. \nNothing in this provision will change that.\n  I recognize that there is a vibrant small U.S. passenger vessel \nfleet. I want to assure you that they are not affected by this \nprovision. These U.S. operators will be able to enter and compete \nfreely in the Hawaii cruise trade, including inter-island cruises. \nMindful of this segment of the fleet, we were careful to draft section \n8109 to exclude vessels measuring less than 10,000 gross tons and \nhaving berth or stateroom accommodation of fewer than 275 passengers, \nthese thresholds accommodate not only the entire U.S. small passenger \nfleet, but also any new vessels planned. Nothing in section 8109 will \nbar this vessel from entering the inter-island cruise market in Hawaii \nor in anyway inhibits its operation, once the plans are finished and \nconstruction of the vessel is completed.\n  Mr. President, this pilot project will help reverse the dreadful \ndecline of the U.S.-flag cruise industry. It will jump start cruise \nship construction in the United States, develop the U.S.-flag cruise \nindustry, and help reduce U.S. shipyard dependence on DOD \nconstruction--all without Federal funds.\n  The cruise industry is projecting that $7.5 billion will be invested \nin the construction of new vessels over the next 5 years--and not one \ncent of this investment will be spent in U.S. shipyards. This pilot \nproject, however, will result in the construction in the United States \nof two state-of-the-art large oceangoing commercial cruise ships, \nrepresenting a private capital investment in U.S. shipbuilding of \napproximately $1 billion.\n  The pilot project will create thousands of American jobs in U.S. \nshipyards during construction and onboard the vessels upon completion \nand approximately 750 shipboard jobs on board the temporary vessel \nwithin 18 months. It will create some 2,500 shipyard and subcontractor \njobs throughout the construction project. And upon completion of the \nnew ships, over 2,000 permanent onboard and shoreside support jobs will \nbe created.\n  The pilot project will be supervised under DOD's MARITECH Program \nwhich Congress authorized in 1993 and has funded annually to facilitate \nadvanced commercial shipbuilding in U.S. yards and the transition from \ndepending on military construction to the competitive commercial \nmarket. Under MARITECH auspices two cruise ship design projects have \nbeen completed, led by the Ingalls and NASSCO shipyards. The pilot \nproject would result in the actual construction of new cruise vessels \nin U.S. shipyards for the first time in 40 years.\n  In addition to the commercial benefits of the pilot project, it is \nalso of significant value to the Department of Defense. It will reduce \nthe U.S. shipyards dependence on Defense funds needed to maintain an \nadequate industrial base. In fact, a recent letter from the Assistant \nSecretary of the Navy for Research Development and Acquisition, John \nDouglass called\n\n       * * * the construction of large, oceangoing cruise ships \n     vital to transitioning U.S. shipyards back into the \n     construction of cruise ships and to sustain this country's \n     shipbuilding industrial base.\n\n  The Navy is also interested in exploring the potential use of the \nhull design for these cruise ships as the hull design for future Joint \nCommand and Control ships.\n  Mr. President, the Governor from my State of Hawaii has also \nexpressed his support for the provision and the bipartisan National \nSecurity Caucus Foundation called the project ``a perfect example of an \nappropriate commercial initiative.'' Support for the pilot project can \nalso be found within the maritime industry--the American Shipbuilding \nAssociation, Seafarers International Union, American Maritime Officers, \nAmerican Classic Voyages Company, Transportation Institute, and \nAmerican Maritime Officers Service.\n  This project will provide the incentive for U.S. expansion in the \ncruise market, so that once again we can take pride in new U.S.-built \noceangoing, U.S.-flag cruise ships. It will help to employ thousands of \nAmerican workers, put the best shipbuilding technology in the world \ninto commercial use, and help the Nation sustain a viable shipbuilding \nindustrial base--all at no cost to the American taxpayers. It deserves \nour support.\n  The program that we have set forth, supported by DOD and supported by \nthe whole industry, will once again reestablish our cruise industry.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will adopt this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a paper, prepared by \nseveral members of my staff, to alert lawyers on the question of \nmonopoly be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSection 8097 of the DOD Appropriations Bill Creates No ``Monopoly'' or \n               ``Unprecedented Restriction on Commerce''\n\n       Section 8097 of S. 1005, the FY '98 DoD appropriations bill \n     as passed by the Senate, contains a provision critically \n     important to the U.S.-flag cruise ship industry and the U.S. \n     shipbuilding base. It directs the MARITECH program to \n     supervise a pilot project to develop and construct two new \n     cruise ships in U.S. yards, and to allow, until they are \n     built, temporary reflagging to the U.S.-flag of a foreign \n     vessel. The result would be the first new cruise ships built \n     in U.S. yards in over 40 years.\n       To allow for an adequate return on the significant capital \n     investment required for this innovative initiative, the new \n     ships would receive a preference in the trade. An objection \n     has been raised that this would create a ``monopoly'' and a \n     ``legislative restriction on commerce [that] is \n     unprecedented.'' The objection is unfounded.\n\n\n                  section 8097 creates no ``monopoly''\n\n       The cruise ship business is quite competitive. Operators \n     compete with each other for the patronage of vacationers who \n     wish to spend their holidays aboard ship. Operators also \n     compete with other providers of vacation and leisure \n     activities. Passengers considering a cruise in the Hawaiian \n     Islands thus can, and do, consider competing cruise trips in \n     the Caribbean, the South Pacific, Alaska, and even the \n     Mediterranean. They also can, and do, consider alternative \n     vacations in the Hawaiian Islands, or other resort and \n     vacation destinations.\n       There is thus absolutely no basis for the suggestion that a \n     cruise ship operator would enjoy any sort of ``monopoly'' \n     even as the only U.S.-flag company operating in the Hawaiian \n     Islands. Antitrust case law recognizes this fact. In American \n     Ass'n of Cruise Passengers v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., \n     911 F.2d 786, 788 (D.C. Cir. 1990), an antitrust action \n     involving alleged discrimination against certain travel \n     agents, the court defined vacation cruises as including, but \n     not limited to, ``any travel by a person as a passenger on a \n     cruise ship for vacation purposes.'' The court also noted \n     that the cruise business differs from carriage of cargo \n     because the actual ports of destination are often of only \n     secondary importance to cruise passengers:\n       ``The purpose of taking a cruise, after all, is to enjoy a \n     relaxing holiday aboard ship, generally while still visiting \n     an unfamiliar place ashore. The cruise ship assumes \n     responsibility for that transportation, and can substantially \n     discharge its responsibility\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\n     even if circumstances require it to skip, or substitute, a \n     port of call. Getting there, in other words, is half the \n     fun.''--911 F.2d at 790.\n       Thus, analysis of competition on the basis of ``port-to-\n     port'' or ``city-pair'' markets, which might be appropriate \n     in analyzing competition for in the carriage of cargo, or for \n     the carriage of passengers on other modes of transportation \n     such as airlines, is not meaningful in assessing cruise ship \n     competition. Someone shipping a container, or flying on an \n     airplane for business, usually has very specific origin and \n     destination points in mind for the transportation \n     involved. The same is not true, however, for cruise \n     passengers, or even vacation travelers in general, for \n     when one leisure destination often substitutes perfectly \n     well for another.\n       One court has in fact specifically described the \n     competitive situation facing cruise operators and others in \n     Hawaii:\n       ``The pattern of competition within the tourist industry is \n     varied and intense. Hawaii competes for tourists from the \n     mainland United States and foreign countries. In offering a \n     relaxed tropical vacation spot, Hawaii competes with South \n     Pacific and other offshore destinations. It thus operates in \n     a national and international market.''--Waikiki Small \n     Business Ass'n v. Anderson, Civ. No. 83-0806 (D. Hawaii May \n     14, 1984).\n       Consumers of Hawaii cruises can, and do, face a host of \n     substitute choices: (1) cruises to other U.S. and overseas \n     locations; (2) other types of Hawaiian vacations, with \n     shoreside accommodations and other forms of travel between \n     the islands. Well over 95% of all visitors to Hawaii are not \n     cruise passengers at al. Cruises on small seacraft and yachts \n     are available as well as inter-island voyages on larger \n     cruise ships. Over 22,000 passengers a day fly between the \n     islands, and the Honolulu--Kahului, Maui city pair is the 3rd \n     busiest in the United States. Aviation Daily, June 5, 1997, \n     at 403; and (3) other ``relaxed, tropical vacation spots'' \n     around the world.\n       In sum, there is no basis to the allegation that \n     restricting the number of cruise ship operators between or \n     among the Hawaiian Islands through the preference created by \n     Section 8097 would create any ``monopoly,'' as that term may \n     properly be understood. See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, \n     Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp. 79 F. 3d 182, 197-98 (1st \n     Cir. 1996) (seller with 90% share of sales of bunker fuel to \n     ocean going vessels in Puerto Rico has no monopoly power \n     because it competes with sellers throughout the Caribbean and \n     the Southeastern United States).\n\n\n  Congress Often ``Restricts Commerce'' In Order To Achieve Important \n                               Objectives\n\n       There is also no basis to the suggestion that Section 8097 \n     creates some sort of ``unprecedented restriction on \n     commerce.'' There are numerous precedents for the kind of \n     preference created in Section 8097, particularly given its \n     purpose of protecting the substantial investment that will be \n     necessary to develop and construct the first new U.S.-flag \n     cruise ships in almost 40 years.\n       The patent system, established by Congress pursuant to \n     Constitutional direction, provides perhaps the most prominent \n     example of a ``restriction'' of competition to protect, and \n     thus encourage, investment in the development of new products \n     and services that otherwise would not exist. The grant of a \n     patent allows its holder to ``restrict'' competition by those \n     who would seek to sell competing projects that infringe on \n     its claims. Significantly, however, despite this restriction, \n     holders of patents generally compete in highly competitive \n     markets; the grant of the patent does not create itself any \n     ``monopoly.'' See Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America, \n     Inc., 897 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (``When the \n     patented product is merely one of many products that actively \n     compete on the market, few problems arise between the \n     property rights of a patent owner and the antitrust laws. . . \n     . [Even] when the patented product is so successful that \n     creates its own economic market . . . the two bodies of law \n     are actually complementary, as both are aimed at encouraging \n     innovation, industry, and competition.'').\n       Federal procurement law also recognizes a number of \n     circumstances in which competition may be restricted to serve \n     important objectives. Procurements may be conducted without \n     competitive procedures, for example, where necessary ``keep \n     vital facilities or suppliers in business or make them \n     available in the event of a national emergency,'' 48 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 6.302-3(b)(1)(i), to ``train a selected supplier in the \n     furnishing of critical supplies or services,'' id. at \n     (b)(1)(ii), or to ``create or maintain the required domestic \n     capability for production of critical supplies.'' Id. at \n     (b)(1)(v). See generally 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2304(c). Such \n     procurements necessarily give the supplier a leg up on its \n     competitions in the development and sale of the product being \n     supplied, but they do not in any sense grant the seller a \n     ``monopoly.''\n       Finally, Congress has often specifically restricted \n     competition by statute to serve specific policy objectives. \n     See 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2304(c)(5). Examples include small \n     business set-asides, 15 U.S.C. 637, and preferences for local \n     suppliers in disaster relief situations, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5150. \n     Last year's Defense Authorization bill included a statutory \n     direction to enter sole source contracts with certain \n     designated health care providers. Pub. L. 104-201 \n     Sec. 722(b)(2), 110 Stat. 2593. The suggestion that the \n     provisions of Section 8097 are ``unprecedented'' is without \n     any basis, and would be so even if Section 8097 did, in fact, \n     create a ``monopoly,'' which it does not.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       While the operator of newly-built U.S.-flag cruise vessels \n     in the Hawaii trade will receive some protection of its \n     investment through the preference created by Section 8097, no \n     monopoly will be created, and the operator will still face \n     vigorous competition in the markets in which it operates.\n\n\n                      new attack submarine program\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conferees have included a general \nprovision, sec. 8129, within this conference report containing language \nto permit the Navy to enter into a contract for the procurement of four \nsubmarines under the New Attack Submarine Program. I would like to \npoint out that this section does not provide new budget authority, but \nrather is an earmark of the amounts appropriated under the heading \n``Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy'' for the New Attack Submarine \nProgram. The intent of the conferees was not to create new budget \nauthority over and above amounts set forth elsewhere in the bill, but \nrather to clarify the terms and conditions under which the New Attack \nSubmarine contract may be entered into between the Navy and the \ncontractor team.\n\n\n                                  c-17\n\n  Mr. President, the conferees on the Defense spending bill understand \nthat the manufacturer of the C-17 is building two additional aircraft \nin fiscal year 1998 for potential commercial sale. However, the Air \nForce has an agreement with the contractor which may permit DOD to \naccept early delivery of these aircraft within the Defense Department's \nC-17 multiyear contract. This agreement, combined with positive cost \nand schedule performance under the C-17 contract, may permit DOD to \npurchase up to 11 aircraft within the fiscal year 1998 appropriation. \nThus, I believe the Senate's objective of delivering additional C-17 \naircraft in fiscal year 1998 may actually be achieved without the \nappropriation of additional funds at this time.\n\n\n   holloman air force base/gerald champion memorial hospital shared \n                                facility\n\n  Mr. President, during the final session of the conference on Defense \nappropriations an error was made on the amount appropriated for the \nHolloman Air Force Base/Gerald Champion Memorial Hospital Shared \nFacility. It was the intent of the conferees to appropriate $7 million \nfor the shared facility, but the filed report reflects only $5 million. \nThis project was strongly supported by the Secretary of the Air Force \nand the Chief of Staff of the Air Force during hearings conducted by \nthe subcommittee. Senator Domenici worked very hard on this issue and I \nbelieve that it is a great idea.\n  Mr. President, I have contacted the Department of Defense about this \nmatter and they have assured me that they will fully fund the shared \nfacility project at its intended level of $7 million. I will continue \nto work with Senator Domenici to ensure full funding for this important \nproject. I commend Senator Domenici for his efforts in this regard and \nlook forward to seeing his vision of better quality service for our \ntroops at a lower cost become a reality.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his support and \nfor his efforts to correct this mistake. I am very pleased that the \nchairman has received the commitment from the Department of Defense to \nfully fund the shared facility. I believe that in the end we will look \nback on this program and say that it was one of the very best things \nthat we did.\n\n\n                      patriot modification program\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in review of the printed copy of the \n``Statement of the Managers'' that accompanies H.R. 105-265, the fiscal \nyear 1998 Department of Defense conference report, we have found a \ntypographical error in the Patriot modification line of the ``Missile \nProcurement, Army'' account. The President's budget request included \n$20,825,000 for the continued modification of the Patriot missile \nsystem. It was the decision of the conference committee to provide a \ntotal $28,825,000, an increase of $8 million above the budget request \nfor this program in fiscal year 1998. The additional funds provided by \nthe conferees are for the procurement of additional GEM +/- upgrades \nfor the Patriot system. I would note that the tables on page 90 of \nHouse Report 105-265, do not reflect the intent of the conferees.\n  It would be my hope that the Army would execute this program to \nreflect the intent of the conferees and further,\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\nthat the Army use its reprogramming authority to provide the \nrecommended funding level of the conference committee. I intend to work \nwith my ranking member, Senator Inouye and Representatives Young and \nMurtha to insure this program is not inappropriately reduced because of \na administrative error.\n\n\n                            printing errors\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of Members \nthree typographical errors that appear in the statement of the managers \nto accompany H.R. 2266. On page 76, under ``Operation and Maintenance, \nAir Force'', the REMIS program should read as an increase of $8.9 \nmillion and not a decrease. On page 119, ``Research, Development, Test \nand Evaluation, Navy'', under the heading ``Undersea Warfare Weaponry \nTechnology'', the 6.25-inch torpedo project should read as an increase \nof $3 million and not zero. On page 125, ``Research, Development, Test \nand Evaluation, Air Force'', under the heading ``Space and Missile \nRocket Propulsion'', the total amount should read $18,147 and not \n$18,847. All of these programs were listed correctly in the official \nconference papers. The typographical errors appear in the project level \nadjustment tables and do not affect the funding levels in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on our conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in order to notify the leader--it is time \nfor him to make a statement concerning the proceedings--I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed under my \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9940-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9956-S9957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I apologize for the delay in starting the votes that we \nhave scheduled, but we were having some very important discussions that \nwill affect the schedule for the next several days that I wanted to \ndiscuss with the minority leader and with the interested Senators.\n  For the information of all Senators, these next two votes will be the \nlast votes for the week. The next vote will occur at 11 a.m. on \nTuesday, September 30, on a motion to invoke cloture on the Coats \namendment to the D.C. appropriations bill regarding scholarships.\n  Following these votes, I encourage the managers to remain on the \nfloor for any additional amendments Members may want to offer to the \npending D.C. appropriations bill. I believe perhaps there is a Senator \nthat is waiting that will have an amendment that he could offer \ntonight, and have debated, if it is not worked out in the interim.\n  On Friday, tomorrow, beginning at 10 o'clock a.m., the Senate will \nbegin consideration of the campaign finance reform legislation. I \nexpect a full day of debate on that issue. However, no votes will occur \nduring Friday's session of the Senate.\n  On Monday, the Senate will resume consideration of the campaign \nfinance reform bill. Again, however, no votes will occur at that time.\n  On Tuesday, September 30, I expect that following the 11 a.m. cloture \nvote the Senate might be in a position to complete action on the last \nremaining appropriation bill, the D.C. appropriations bill. It will \ndepend on what happens, of course, with the vote on the Coats \namendment, and there are a couple of other key amendments that are \nstill pending. Also, since Tuesday is the end of fiscal year, the \nSenate will consider the continuing resolution. We believe we have a \ncontinuing resolution agreed to that will be clean, and with a date \nthat I discussed with the Democratic leader and with our leadership on \nthe other side of the Capitol. Therefore, votes will occur throughout \nthe day on Tuesday, and of course the pending business at that time \nwill still be campaign finance reform.\n  Wednesday, October 1, is the start of the Jewish holiday. Therefore, \nvotes will not occur past 1 p.m. However, the Senate will be \nconsidering the campaign finance reform bill for debate as long as \nMembers want to remain into the evening. On Thursday, October 2, there \nwill be no rollcall votes in observance of the Jewish holiday.\n  I expect the Senate to resume consideration of the campaign finance \nreform bill on Friday, October 3. However, no votes will occur. Again, \nwith regard to the 3d, we want to talk with all the interested Senators \nto see whether we want to have debate or not. Then we will continue on \ncampaign finance reform the next week but we would like to reserve \nfurther commitments on time or identification of when votes might occur \nuntil we have had time to get started with the debate and see how \nthings go.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation and remind Senators \nfollowing these two back-to-back votes there will be no further votes \ntoday, and the next vote will occur 11 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have some \ndiscussion with the majority leader about this schedule. I have not had \nthe opportunity to discuss this matter at any great length with our \ncolleagues, but I want to thank the majority leader. I think this is a \nschedule that affords a good opportunity to debate campaign finance \nreform. It takes into account the Jewish holiday and the need for our \nJewish colleagues to be away. It does afford the opportunity, as well, \nto take up other issues later on in October. I think it is a very good \nschedule and I look forward to getting into the debate tomorrow and \nworking with the majority leader to schedule the other matters as they \ncome available to us.\n  I hope our colleagues would avail themselves of the opportunity to \nbegin the debate tomorrow. I know I will be on the floor, and I am sure \nmany of my colleagues will, and we will have a good debate. I am sure \nwe will have a number of opportunities to debate amendments and have \nvotes over the course of that time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I might say, Mr. President, continuing with my leader time, \nI met with the committee leaders and discussed legislation on both \nsides of the aisle--for instance, the ISTEA, or the highway \ninfrastructure bill--as to when they would be ready with that \nlegislation to go to the floor and how much time that might take. We \nalso have been looking at fast-track trade legislation, when that might \nbe available.\n  It was obvious to me that we had a window here in the next few days \nthat we could take up the debate on campaign finance reform, but as we \ngot on into October we would need to have time for the highway bill and \nthe fast-track legislation.\n  I do think it is important that we continue our effort to get a 6-\nyear transportation bill that is within the budget. I have been \ndiscussing this with the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember. They agree. So we intend to go forward somewhere around the 7th \nor 8th on the highway infrastructure bill.\n  I just wanted to give that explanation as to why this decision was \nmade.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could ask the majority leader a question, I made an \nassumption about the schedule. It just occurred to me that I had not \nclarified this, but I assume that the majority leader would anticipate \nvotes on campaign finance reform on Tuesday the 30th and Wednesday the \n1st of October; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. I had not anticipated votes at that time. I assume those \ndays, most of the votes will be on the appropriation conference reports \nand the continuing resolution.\n  I had thought we would need more time for debate before we started \nvoting on that. I didn't specify it, but I assumed the votes would not \ncome until the 6th or 7th of October.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I thank the majority leader. It is an \naffirmation of the word he gave last week which all of us here in this \nbody knew was going to happen, and did not need a letter from\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\nthe President of the United States. I do thank the majority leader for \nthe timely consideration of this issue.\n  Let me also just point out I understand that there has to be vigorous \ndebate on this issue. There also has to be votes. It is our intention \nto have votes on various amendments throughout this debate, and we need \nto have everyone on record on this issue. Also, I know I can count on \nthe majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader in trying \nto bring closure to this debate, to this issue, after reasonable \ndebate, in one fashion or another.\n  Again, I want to thank the majority leader. It shows again the \nmajority leader of this Senate, as was the case when the other side was \nthe majority, when the leader gives his word, when the majority leader \ngives his word, it is good. And if it were otherwise, this body does \nnot function.\n  I thank the majority leader and I thank the Democratic leader for all \nof his cooperation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I note that there is an understanding \nbetween us that conference reports coming out of the Appropriations \nCommittee will receive prompt attention, but I wanted to make sure \neveryone understands that means putting aside anything that is here, to \ntry and get these bills to the President before the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, they are privileged, and would be brought up \nas soon as they are available. That is our highest priority as we reach \nthe end of the fiscal year, and we want to move to immediate \nconsideration of a continuing resolution also when it is available, if \nit is necessary, which I presume it will be.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the pending unanimous-consent agreement \nwould provide 8 hours on that. I hope that, too, would be subject to \ntaking up the conference reports as they become available.\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be. I hope we would not take 8 hours on the CR. I \nhope we have an understanding what is in it. It would be clean, I \nbelieve. There are only two amendments in order, one on each side. I \nhope maybe that would not be necessary and we would have short debate \nand go straight to vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sure Senator Byrd and I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9956-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is the 40th anniversary of the \nbeginning of the end of racial segregation in the public schools in \nLittle Rock, AR. As we turn to reflect on Little Rock and the aftermath \nof the Supreme Court's landmark decision on public school segregation, \nwe should consider the important lessons those times still hold for us \ntoday. Little Rock was a testing point in our history when the rule of \nlaw and respect for our courts and Constitution prevailed.\n  Three years earlier, the Supreme Court's unanimous Brown versus Board \nof Education decision prompted a concerted assault on the judiciary. On \nMarch 12, 1956, 81 Members of Congress signed a resolution condemning \nthat ruling as a ``clear abuse of judicial power'' and part of a \n``trend in the Federal judiciary to legislate, in derogation of the \nauthority of Congress, and\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\nto encroach upon the reserved rights of the people.'' Billboards \nsprouted around the country demanding the impeachment of Chief Justice \nEarl Warren. Justice Clarence Thomas recalls that as a young man his \n``most vivid childhood memory of the Supreme Court was the `Impeach \nEarl Warren' signs that lined Highway 17 near Savannah. I didn't \nunderstand who this Earl Warren fellow was, but I knew he was in some \nkind of trouble.''\n  It should concern all of us that a pattern resembling that which \nfollowed the Supreme Court's decision in Brown is being repeated. It \nhas once again become fashionable in some quarters to sloganeer about \nimpeaching Federal judges. This year's continuing attack on the \njudicial branch, the slowdown in the processing of the scores of good \nwomen and men the President has nominated to fill vacancies on the \nFederal courts, and widespread threats of impeachment are all part of a \npartisan, ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary. Extremist \nelements have turned their fire on the branch of Government most \nprotective of our freedoms but the least equipped to protect itself \nfrom political attacks.\n  We are hearing from some Members of Congress a clamor for impeachment \nwhen a judge renders a decision that irritates them. We are hearing \ndemands that Congress destroy the orderly process of appellate court \nand Supreme Court review and, instead, assume the role of a supercourt \nthat would legislatively review and veto individual decisions. We are \nseeing proposals to amend the Constitution, to eliminate the \nindependence and lifetime tenure of judges. Extreme rhetoric and \noutlandish proposals have contributed to a poisonous atmosphere in \nwhich the Federal justice system is overloaded.\n  Last week on the 210th anniversary of the signing of the \nConstitution, a newspaper reported that the majority leader of the \nSenate applauded the idea of Republicans plotting to intimidate the \nFederal judiciary, commenting that ``it sounds like a good idea to \nme.'' For the majority leader of the Senate to join an acknowledged \nattack on the independence and integrity of the Federal judiciary is a \ntroubling and disappointing development that shows how easily political \nleaders can succumb to such political temptations, even at the expense \nof the checks and balances that are needed to protect our rights.\n  It is one thing to criticize the reasoning of an opinion, or the \nresult in a case, or to introduce legislation to change the law. It is \nquite another matter to undercut the separation of powers and the \nindependence that the Founders created to insulate the judiciary from \npolitics. Independent judicial review has been a crucial check on two \npolitical branches of our Government that has served us so well for \nmore than two centuries. This bedrock principle has helped preserve our \nfreedoms and helped make this country the model for emerging \ndemocracies around the world.\n  Something that sets our Nation--the world's oldest continuing \ndemocracy--apart from virtually all others is the independence of our \nFederal judiciary and the respect that the public and that political \nleaders give it. Every fledgling democracy sends observers to the \nUnited States to study and emulate our independent judiciary, the envy \nof the world. The independence of our third, coequal branch of \nGovernment gives it the ability to fairly and impartially arbiter \ndisputes, to prevent overreaching by the other two branches, and to \ndefend our individual rights and freedoms that are so susceptible to \nthe gusting political winds of the moment.\n\n  In the 23 years that I have been privileged to serve in the U.S. \nSenate I have never known a time when the Senate's leadership, \nRepublican or Democratic, would tolerate partisan and ideological \npolitics to so divert the institution from its constitutional \nresponsibilities to the third, coequal branch of Government.\n  The Nation needs to move forward, as we did after President \nEisenhower acted to restore the rule of law. The citizens of Little \nRock and other cities throughout the country accepted the \nconstitutional imperative to end segregated schools. A few years later \nCongress acted to pass the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. In 1997, can anyone say that we are not a \nbetter and stronger nation for having honored the Supreme Court's Brown \ndecision by enforcing it in Little Rock?\n  The American people know that a fair and impartial judiciary is key \nto maintaining our democracy and our rights. The continuing partisan \ncampaign against qualified and fair judicial nominees has to come to an \nend. If the judiciary is to retain its ability to protect our rights \nand freedoms as we move into a new century of American history, if it \nis to serve as a check on the political branches, it must have the \njudges and resources necessary to the task. Vacant courtrooms and empty \nbenches cannot hear criminal trials, enforce our environmental \nprotection laws, resolve legal claims or uphold the Constitution \nagainst encroachment.\n  I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the \nnomination of Judge Katherine Sweeney Hayden to be a U.S. district \njudge for the District of New Jersey. Judge Sweeney Hayden is a well-\nqualified nominee.\n  Since 1991, the nominee has been a judge on the superior court in \nNewark, NJ. The ABA has unanimously found her to be well qualified, its \ntop rating. She has the support of Senators Lautenberg and Torricelli. \nShe had a confirmation hearing on June 25 and was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee on July 10 along with the nomination of Anthony \nIshii to be a district judge in the Eastern District of California, \nwhose nomination remains pending on the Senate Calendar. Her nomination \nhas been held up for the last 2\\1/2\\ months without explanation and I \nam glad to see it finally being brought forward. I congratulate Judge \nSweeney Hayden and her family and look forward to her service on the \nfederal court.\n  I spoke on September 5 and 11 urging that this nomination and the \nothers on the calendar be considered. There are now five other judicial \nnominations ready for Senate consideration. Unfortunately, they are not \nbeing taken up today and I know of no plan for them to be taken up any \ntime soon.\n  With Senate confirmation of these district judges, the Senate will \nstill be a confirmation short of the dismal total of last year. We \nstill have more than 40 nominees among the 68 nominations sent to the \nSenate by the President who are pending before the Judiciary Committee \nand have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress.\n  Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day \nof this session, having been renominated by the President. Several of \nthose pending before the committee had hearings or were reported \nfavorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, \nwhile the vacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago \npersist. The committee has 10 nominees who have been pending for more \nthan a year, including 5 who have been pending since 1995.\n  While I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with the \nnomination of Judge Sweeney Hayden, there is no excuse for the \ncommittee's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding \nindividuals as Prof. William A. Fletcher; Judge James A. Beaty, Jr.; \nJudge Richard A. Paez; Ms. M. Margaret McKeown; Ms. Ann L. Aiken; and \nMs. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees \nwho have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. \nProfessor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably reported \nlast year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have \nbeen passed over so far this year. Nor is there any explanation or \nexcuse for the Senate not immediately proceeding to consider the other \nfive judicial nominations pending on the Senate Calendar.\n  The Senate continues to lag well behind the pace established by \nMajority Leader Dole and Chairman Hatch in the 104th Congress. By this \ntime 2 years ago, the Senate had confirmed 36 Federal judges. With \ntoday's actions, the Senate will have confirmed less than one-half that \nnumber, only 16 judges. We still face almost 100 vacancies and have 50 \npending nominees to consider with more arriving each week.\n\n  For purposes of perspective, let us also recall that by August 1992, \nduring the last year of President Bush's term, a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate had confirmed 53 of the 68 nominees sent to us by a \nRepublican President.\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\n By the end of August this year, this Senate had acted on only 9 out of \n61 nominees. Indeed, by the end of September in President Bush's final \nyear in office, the Senate confirmed 59 of his 72 nominees. This Senate \nis on pace to confirm only 16 out of a comparable number of \nnominations.\n  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of \njustice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot try \nthe cases and incarcerate the guilty if you do not have judges. The \nmounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of \nemergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day. \nNational Public Radio has been running a series of reports all this \nweek on the judicial crises and quoted the chief judge and U.S. \nattorney from San Diego earlier this week to the effect that criminal \nmatters are being affected.\n  I have spoken about the crisis being created by the vacancies that \nare being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At the \nrate that we are going, we are not keeping up with attrition. When we \nadjourned last Congress there were 64 vacancies on the federal bench. \nAfter the confirmation of 16 judges in 9 months, there has been a net \nincrease of 32 vacancies. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has \ncalled the rising number of vacancies ``the most immediate problem we \nface in the Federal judiciary.''\n  The Judiciary Committee has heard testimony from second circuit, \nninth circuit and 11th circuit judges about the adverse impact of \nvacancies on the ability of the Federal courts to do justice. The \neffect is seen in extended delay in the hearing and determination of \ncases and the frustration that litigants are forced to endure. The \ncrushing caseload will force Federal courts to rely more and more on \nsenior judges, visiting judges and court staff.\n  Judges from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals testified, for \nexample, that over 80 percent of its appellate court panels over the \nnext 12 months cannot be filled by members of that court but will have \nto be filled by visiting judges. This is wrong.\n  We ought to proceed without delay to consider the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to the second circuit and move promptly to fill \nvacancies that are plaguing the second and ninth circuits. We need to \nfill the 5-year-old vacancy in the Northern District of New York and \nmove on nominations for over 30 judicial emergency districts.\n  In choosing to proceed on this nominee, the Republican leadership has \nchosen for at least the fourth time this month to skip over the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow. I, again, urge the Senate to consider \nthe long-pending nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a district court \njudge for the Central District of California.\n  Ms. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this year, but May \n1996. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to \nthe Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her nomination was, \nthus, first pending before the Senate more than 15 months ago. This was \none of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown.\n  She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her \nsecond confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the \nJudiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When \nshe was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported \nwith the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar for more three months and has been passed \nover, time and again, without justification or explanation.\n  What is this mystery hold all about? In spite of my repeated attempts \nto find out who is holding up consideration of this outstanding \nnominee, and why, I am at a loss.\n  Ms. Morrow is a qualified nominee to the district court. I have heard \nno one contend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial \nwringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she \nvoted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years.\n  The committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert \nBork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that \nwhat is required to be confirmed to the district court in this \nCongress?\n  With respect to the issue of ``judicial activism,'' we have the \nnominee's views. She told the committee:\n\n       The specific role of a trial judge is to apply the law as \n     enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and \n     courts of appeals. His or her role is not to make law.\n\n  She also noted:\n\n       Given the restrictions of the case and controversy \n     requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies \n     available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the \n     broad problems facing our society, and should not \n     undertake to do so. That is the job of the legislative and \n     executive branches in our constitutional structure.\n\n  Margaret Morrow was the first woman President of the California Bar \nAssociation and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is \ncurrently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. \nShe is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and \nby Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican \nAdministration. Representative James Rogan attended her second \nconfirmation hearing to endorse her.\n  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women \ninvolved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive \nand responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. \nHer public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve \nthis treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away.\n  The President of the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the \nPresident of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the President of the Los \nAngeles County Bar Association, the President of the National \nConference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys \nfrom the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: ``Margaret Morrow is \nwidely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both \nparties'' and she ``is exactly the kind of person who should be \nappointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women \nacross the country.'' I could not agree more.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to consider and \nconfirm Margaret Morrow, along with Anthony Ishii, Richard Lazzara, \nChristina Snyder and Marjorie Rendell.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9957-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this evening, the Senate conducted \ntwo rollcall votes--on the conference report to the Defense Department \nAppropriations bill and on the nomination of Katharine Sweeney Hayden \nto be U.S. District Judge for the District of New Jersey. \nUnfortunately, I was not present for those votes.\n  Tonight, at my daughter's school in Wilmington is what is called mini \nroster night. That is what most people know as open house or parents' \nnight--where the parents go around and meet all of the teachers. \nBecause of the Senate voting schedule, I will either have to miss votes \nor miss mini roster night at my daughter's school.\n  On both matters voted on tonight, my position is already on the \nrecord, and my vote is not expected to change the outcome.\n  With regard to the defense bill, I voted for the bill on July 15 when \nit passed the Senate by the overwhelming margin of 94-4. There have \nbeen no substantial changes in the legislation, and I continue to \nsupport it.\n  On July 10, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the \nnomination of Katharine Sweeney Hayden to be a New Jersey district \njudge. I supported her nomination, and I continue to do so.\n  Again, Mr. President, on both matters, my vote is not expected to \nchange the outcome, and therefore, I have decided to attend parents' \nnight at my daughter's school.

Mr. President, it was my understanding that we would \nimmediately return, after these votes, under the previous unanimous-\nconsent request, to consideration of the pending amendment and that \nthere was a little bit of time remaining. I only say that, not because \nI want to use the time--I know Members want to speak on a number of \nsubjects--but because Senator Brownback had been on the list to speak. \nHe was precluded by the clock when we shifted over under the order. I \nam just inquiring as to whether or not that is the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is a pending \namendment, and the Senator controls 29 minutes. It would take unanimous \nconsent to set it aside.\n  The Senator from Florida was the first Senator to seek recognition \nwhen we returned to the amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, inform my \ncolleagues that I have no intention of using the 29 minutes.\n\n  I do, also, though, want to say that I had promised the Senator from \nKansas he would be first up. He has commitments. I have commitments. He \nwas in line, and the clock precluded him from getting his statement in. \nI would be willing to forgo all but about 1 minute of my remarks if we \ncould go forward with this, and we will get to the other Senators as \nquickly as possible. A lot of people have been waiting all afternoon to \nspeak, but they were not allowed to speak because of the unanimous \nconsent agreement. We had promised them, if they were here right after \nthe votes, they would be first up.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor, having \nbeen recognized.

Mr. President, my purpose, with my colleague, is solely \nto introduce an amendment which we will then ask to be set aside for \nconsideration on Tuesday. We will be, I think, less than 90 seconds in \ncompleting this task. So I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment for the purpose of offering this amendment in hopes \nthat we complete this task, and then we will relinquish the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Mack, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 1252.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

The underlying business is the amendment of \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1249\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I again inform my \ncolleagues that we will be brief. I am just trying to fill some \ncommitments we made earlier. I will dispense with my ringing, \narticulate, persuasive rebuttals to the opponents of this\n\n[[Page S9962]]\n\namendment that I have ready to go here, to Senator Boxer and Senator \nKennedy and others who spoke against the amendment, and save those \nuntil Tuesday. Even though I have the attention of my colleagues who \nare in the Chamber that I might not have on Tuesday, I will have to \ntrust that yielding the time is probably more persuasive in getting \nsupport for my amendment than giving those arguments at this particular \npoint. So, I will defer that. However, I have made a commitment to the \nSenator from Kansas. I think he is going to be relatively brief. I \nyield to him such time as he may consume. Then, if no one else wants to \nspeak on this particular amendment, I will be happy to yield back.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a question to the Senator from \nIndiana. Is there currently a time agreement?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). There is.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. May I ask further how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 25 minutes for the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. COATS. We have no intention, I tell the Senator, of using that \nmuch time. I think the Senator from Kansas has less than 10 minutes and \nI will defer my time until tomorrow.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I can hardly wait, and I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. Brownback. Mr. \nPresident, I thank my colleague from Indiana for yielding this time and \nbringing forward this amendment. I think it is a very important, \nexcellent amendment and I rise in support of it. I chair the Senate \nsubcommittee that has oversight over the District of Columbia. I, and \nSenator Lieberman who is the ranking Democrat on that committee, are \nboth cosponsors of the Coats amendment.\n  I would just like to inform the Members of this body and others that \nwe have had extensive hearings on the D.C. Public School System. We \nhave been out and looked at the schools. We have been in the public \nschools. We have been in the charter schools. We have looked at the \nD.C. Public School System. My conclusion of the D.C. School System is \nthe same as the D.C. Control Board's conclusion, that is that this \nsystem has failed the students.\n\n  The D.C. Control Board, in their own statements regarding the D.C. \nPublic School System, said this: They said that the longer students \nstay in the District of Columbia public schools, the worse they do. \nThat is the Control Board's own assessment of what has happened to the \nD.C. public schools. I think that is a crime to the students, to the \nchildren of the District of Columbia who are in these schools. We \nshould not be putting them in a situation where the school system has \nfailed them. That is wrong. That is wrong of us to allow it to take \nplace.\n  We have also had hearings with General Becton, who has been put in \ncharge of the District of Columbia public schools. He is an admirable \nman. He is a good man who believes he is on the toughest assignment he \nhas ever had. He has been a general in the military and he's a quality \nindividual. The general says to us: Give me 3 years to fix this system \nup. Give me 3 years to be able to get the system back correct. I know \nit is a failed system. I know it's not working for the children in the \nDistrict. I know we have failures in it, that the test scores are not \nwhat they should be, that the schools have not performed, that they are \nnot as safe as they should be, that we are having repair problems to \nthe point that we can't get students in for 3 weeks--but give me 3 \nyears to be able to fix this system up.\n  I sit out, as a parent who has three children, and ask myself, does \nmy child get a second shot at the first grade during those 3 years? Or \nthe second? Or the third grade? Those are formative, key years for \nstudents, for pupils. They don't get 3 years to wait.\n\n  I am saying, and I said this to the general, in hearings, I said: \nGeneral, is it right for us to condemn that student to this system that \nyou admit and state has failed these students? Is that fair to the \nstudent? You are saying give us 3 years to improve the school system, \nand I know he is going to try to do everything he can. But is it fair \nto this poor child? You have to stare in the face of that child and \nsay, ``I am sorry, you are not going to be able to get the quality of \neducation that you need to have because it is going to take us some \ntime to fix these schools or this school system.'' I don't think that \nis fair to these students. It is not fair to these pupils.\n  I think, frankly, if most of us in this body had children and we were \nliving in the District of Columbia, we would not think it would be fair \nto our kids either to put them into the public school system in this \nparticular situation where we have--and listen to these statistics. \nThey are really frightful.\n  Let me say as well, this is about improving public education. We have \nto have better education in this country. We have to have better \neducation for our children. That is what we are after. What I am after, \nchairing this subcommittee, is to make the District of Columbia a \nshining example around the world for everything, and in particular, as \nwell, in education. But we are not there now.\n  Look at some of these statistics. We have fourth graders in the D.C. \npublic school system--78 percent of fourth graders are not at basic \nreading levels, 78 percent. We have violence problems in the D.C. \npublic schools. We have 26 percent of the teachers surveyed in 1995 say \nthat they were threatened, injured, or attacked in the past year--26 \npercent. The national average is too high, it's at 14 percent; but 26 \npercent, 1 of 4 of the teachers. Of the students, 11 percent of the \nstudents were threatened or injured with a weapon during the past \nyear--11 percent of the students. And 11 percent were avoiding school \nfor safety reasons during the past 30 days.\n\n  Then you have the horrendous incidents that happen when you had \nstudents having sexual activity in grade school during the school day. \nThat happened in the District of Columbia. That just touched all of us, \nsaying this cannot be allowed to continue to take place.\n  This amendment is a simple amendment to try to provide a choice, an \nopportunity to some students who do not have it and are not able, \nfinancially. Their parents are not in a position to be able to do what \nmost Members of Congress do. I say that on a basis of surveys that have \nbeen done of Members of Congress. Of those Members of Congress who have \nresponded to a survey, 77 percent of Senators responded and 50 percent \nhad sent or are sending their children to a private school. They had \nthat option because financially we are in a position to be able to do \nit. And unfortunately, too many of our D.C. children are not in a \nfinancial position to be able to do this.\n  We need to look in their eyes and provide them a choice and provide \nthem this option. This amendment is a simple one, to try to do that. I \nthink it also will help us make better public schools in the District \nof Columbia by providing some incentive and some competition into the \nschool system in the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, I have other points I may be making next week on this. \nBut I simply say we cannot wait and imprison a student in a system that \nis a failed system. The people looking over it have already stated this \nis a failed system. It is not fair to the kids.\n  Let's say who we are protecting here. We ought to be looking exactly \nin that child's eye when we vote on this amendment, and say let's give \nthis child a choice and give this child a chance and not put him in a \nsystem which, according its own people, is a failed system.\n  There are some good public schools in the District of Columbia but \noverall this system has failed. That is why I plead with my colleagues \nto look at this amendment and give these kids a chance. With that, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

I speak only for myself, \nand I will speak at length on my reasons next week.\n\n  But I just want to say tonight that by adopting that conference \nreport we are embarking on the building of a fighter plane called the \nF-22, which is going to be twice as expensive as any fighter plane ever \nbuilt. My guess is that it will cost somewhere between $70 and $100 \nbillion when it is finished, for 339. We are embarking on a $4 billion \ncost of retrofitting the Pacific fleet with D-5 missiles on ships which \nare already equipped with C-4's, and the C-4's will outlive the ships \nthey are on. And for a lesser reason, of course, the $331 million in \nthe bill on the B-2 bomber.\n  Mr. President, if you want to spend this for new bombers, be my \nguest. If you don't, put it in spare parts.

LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \nso promptly taken up the nomination of Katharine Sweeney Hayden to \nserve as a Federal district court judge for the District of New Jersey.\n  I had the high honor and privilege of recommending Judge Hayden to \nPresident Clinton this past February. After review, the President \nnominated her for this position on June 5, 1997. Judge Hayden's \nnomination was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee just weeks \nlater, on July 10, and now we have her nomination before the full \nSenate. Judge Hayden's nomination has moved this quickly, I believe, \nbecause she is a superb candidate who will make an outstanding judge.\n  Mr. President, recommending candidates to the President for the \nFederal judiciary is one of the most important aspects of my job as a \nU.S. Senator. In making these recommendations, I know that I am helping \nto place someone on the Federal bench who will hold the law and the \nlives of thousands of Americans in her hands. This is an awesome \nresponsibility and the bedrock on which our Government is founded--a \nsystem of justice based on the law. It is incumbent upon us in \nconfirming a judge to know that she has a deep love, respect, and \nknowledge of the law, an intellect equal to the task, the temperament \nto preside fairly in the courtroom and treat all with the respect they \ndeserve, and the skill to manage her cases and dispense justice with \ndeliberation but also expedition. Judge Hayden meets all these tests \nand more.\n  Mr. President, the respect and admiration for Judge Hayden among \nthose who know her in New Jersey is unanimous. She possesses all of the \nskills and attributes needed to successfully shoulder the \nresponsibilities of a Federal judge. Her experience in the U.S. \nattorney's office in New Jersey, in private legal practice, and as a \nState court judge provide a solid foundation for her upcoming Federal \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I can also tell the Senate that Judge Hayden possesses \na sharp intellect and a keen analytic ability, exceptional courtroom \ndemeanor, and a strong work ethic. She is held in high regard by all \nsegments of the New Jersey legal community, and is strongly supported \nby her peers on the State and Federal bench. This high evaluation is \nshared by the litigants and lawyers whom she has represented, worked \nwith, or have appeared before her.\n  Katharine Sweeney Hayden will bring a breadth of experience--from the \ncourtroom and elsewhere--to the Federal bench. She is currently a judge \nof the Superior Court of New Jersey--Criminal Division, sitting in \nEssex County.\n  Judge Hayden received her undergraduate degree from Marymount College \nin 1963, and attended graduate school at Bowling Green State University \nand Seton Hall University, where she earned a master's degree in \nEnglish literature in 1972 and served as adjunct professor of English.\n  She received her law degree from Seton Hall University School of Law \ncum laude in 1975. Upon graduation, she clerked for the Justice Robert \nClifford of the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n  Upon completing her clerkship, Judge Hayden worked in the U.S. \nattorney's office in New Jersey, before establishing a private \npractice, which she pursued for 13 years. In recognition of her \ncontribution to the legal profession and the esteem in which she is \nheld by her colleagues, Katharine was elected as the first woman \npresident of the Morris County Bar Association. She was appointed to \nthe New Jersey bench in 1991.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to report that Judge Hayden has received \na ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. This is \nthe highest rating for a judicial nominee.\n  In recognition of her talent, organizational skills, and knowledge of \nthe law, Judge Hayden has been selected to undertake special \nassignments by the judiciary and State Bar Association of New Jersey. \nThese assignments include service on professional committees on ethics \nas well as judicial committees on administrative, professional, and \nsubstantive matters. Most recently, she was chosen to develop and \npreside as the first judge of a drug court soon to be established in \nEssex County, NJ.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to report to the Senate that Judge \nHayden has stressed to me her view that a judge has a responsibility to \nbe fair, to cherish the law and our Constitution, and to treat every \nlawyer and litigant before her with respect. She has also expressed to \nme her honor at being nominated for this appointment, and her deep \ncommitment to serving the public and to administering justice fairly \nfor all who appear before her.\n  Mr. President, Katharine Sweeney Hayden has all of the personal \nattributes and professional qualifications one could wish for in a \njudge. And then some.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend Katharine Hayden to the Senate and, \nanticipating her confirmation, congratulate her on her appointment, and \nwish her all the best in her new position. I am very proud to have \nrecommended her to President Clinton. I hope she will serve on our \ndistrict court for many years. I know she will serve with distinction, \ndispensing justice to each person who appears before her with \ncompassion, fairness, and wisdom.\n  Mr. President, I close by saying the country will be well served by \nthe services of Katherine Sweeney Hayden on the bench. We look forward \nto having her on the court in New Jersey, and I am sure we will \ncontinue to hear only the finest about the work she has done and the \ncharacter that she has brought to her decisions as part of the court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nbe permitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9963-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9963-S9965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE IMPORTATION OF SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT RIFLES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, about 2 weeks ago it came to my \nattention that several countries may be exporting semiautomatic assault \nweapons into this country despite the 1968 Gun Control Act, which \nlimits the importation of these weapons.\n  When I asked the ATF to explain why these weapons were granted import \npermits, I learned that ATF, in the last few years, has not applied--or \nat least\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\nhas not been consistent in applying--a standard of review for \nimportation of weapons set by Congress under the 1968 Gun Control Act, \na standard which has been specifically applied to semiautomatic rifles \nand shotguns since 1984.\n  The Gun Control Act of 1968 allows importation of only those types of \nfirearms ``generally recognized as particularly suitable for, or \nreadily adaptable to, sporting purposes.''\n\n\n                    definition of sporting purposes\n\n  In 1984, ATF conducted a comprehensive analysis of the sporting \npurposes of rifles and shotguns. They looked at the legislative \nhistory, studied the available literature, made a technical evaluation \nof the weapons, and conducted a wide-ranging comprehensive survey and \ndetermined that there were clear differences between semiautomatic \nassault rifles and semiautomatic rifles used in traditional sports.\n  The term ``sporting purposes'' refers to traditional sports such as \ntarget shooting, skeet and trap shooting, and hunting.\n  In 1989, with the support of President Bush, ATF announced the import \nban of more than 40 semiautomatic assault weapons. ATF subsequently \nruled most of the weapons not legal for importation, stating that \n``There is nothing in the law to indicate the term `sporting purposes' \nwas intended to recognize every conceivable type of activity or \ncompetition which might employ a firearm.''\n  A June 30 ruling by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal heard that: \n``The Secretary of the Treasury had implied authority under the Gun \nControl Act to order temporary suspension.''\n  Further, the Court's decision stated that arguments against the \nsuspension of these weapons ``places too much emphasis on the rifle's \nstructure for determining whether a firearm falls within the sporting \npurpose exception. While the Bureau must consider the rifle's physical \nstructure, the Act requires the Bureau to equally consider the rifle's \nuse.''\n  I do not believe that ATF is currently applying the sporting purposes \ntest based on their own analysis in approving import permits for \nsemiautomatic assault rifles.\n  As a result of this inconsistency in the standards of review, tens of \nthousands of military-style assault weapons may, in fact, be coming in \nto the country from all over the world.\n  I have spoken directly to President Clinton about this--and I am \njoined so far by 30 of my colleagues in this request--and that is that \nhe temporarily suspend importation of specific semiautomatic weapons \nuntil a determination can be made as to the suitability of these \nweapons for sporting purposes as required by this Federal statute.\n  Let me point out that the 1994 assault weapons legislation was not \nintended, nor do I believe it does, supersede or conflict with the 1968 \nlaw.\n  I have requested from ATF a list of all semiautomatic weapons granted \nimport permits in the last 2 years and the specifications for those \nweapons, where they are going and to whom, and whether the manufacturer \nis state or privately owned. They indicate it will take 4 more weeks to \nprovide it.\n  As of this moment, though, one particular case stands out. It \ninvolves a munitions manufacturer owned by our friend and ally, the \nGovernment of Israel. The reason we know this is because Israel was up \nfront and indicated to the ATF what weapons they were planning to \nexport. The Los Angeles Times reported the pending export as a part of \na recent investigation. That is how I found out, and I now believe and \nam concerned that a flood of weapons may be taking place into this \nNation.\n  Israel Military Industries, a Government-owned munitions \nmanufacturer, has been granted permission to export to the United \nStates for commercial sale tens of thousands of semiautomatic assault \nweapons. The weapons, the Uzi American and the Galil Sporter are \nmodeled after weapons used and created for the Israeli military.\n  The Uzi, because of its reliability and accuracy, has been used by \nthe armed forces of over 20 nations, including the U.S. Secret Service. \nIt features a large pistol grip that extends beneath the center of the \nbody of the weapon. The Uzi is touted as ``lethality in a tiny \npackage'' by a reference book called ``The World's Greatest Small \nArms.'' The author of that manual explains that the Uzi grip ``is \npositioned roughly at the point of balance of the gun which makes the \nweapon much easier to control when firing bursts.''\n  The text goes on to explain that the ammunition feed is through the \nbutt and magazines are inserted from below the grip, ``a system that \nhelps the firer replace magazines quickly, especially in the \ndarkness.''\n  The Uzi American planned for export, according to ATF, is based on \nthe Uzi minicarbine. Except for the shorter length and changes to the \nstock, again according to the reference book, ``is virtually, in all \nother respects, identical to the Uzi carbine'' which was barred from \nimportation in 1989 by the ATF under President Bush's order.\n  The Galil was created in Israel subsequent to the Six Day War in \n1967. The Israeli military, looking for a lighter, more convenient \nweapon, enlisted a design team to combine the best features of the AK-\n47 and the M-16 rifle. The weapon was finished in 1972 and was used in \nthe 1973 Yom Kippur war.\n  The modified version of the Galil now planned for export, as it has \nbeen described to me, in addition to being designed for semiautomatic \nfire, is modified as follows:\n  The bayonet mount was removed. The threaded muzzle for attaching a \nflash suppressor was removed. And the folding stock, designed for \nconcealability, is replaced by a fixed wooden stock.\n  The protruding pistol grip, which enables the weapon to be held at \nthe hip to spray fire, was modified by essentially attaching a wood \nbridge that connects the pistol grip and the stock, called a thumbhole \ngrip. A key point that the ATF ruled is that the grip, as redesigned, \nprotrudes conspicuously and, therefore, still constitutes a pistol \ngrip, an assault weapon characteristic under the 1994 Federal law.\n  Both the Uzi and Galil, as modified, would be exported with a \nstandard 10-round ammunition clip as required by U.S. law.\n  However, these weapons are capable of accepting 30-, 50-, and 100-\nround magazines, millions of which are available and still legally sold \nin this country and still imported, although they are banned from \nimportation.\n  Now, even as modified, the Uzi and Galil are capable of firing \nbullets as fast as the operator can pull the trigger. They each possess \na grip that allows the weapon to be fired from the hip, and ATF \nindicates that with a few alterations, they are able to be made fully \nautomatic.\n  In short, these are the same type of weapons that many Americans are \ntrying to keep off our streets and out of the hands of criminals. I \nbelieve that the permitted importation of tens of thousands of these \nweapons is a terrible mistake on the part of the ATF. Assault weapons, \nlike the Uzi and the AK-47, which is similar to the Galil, are weapons \noften used against police, often with deadly results. Let me give you \nsome examples.\n  A case with which I am very familiar--and I have talked to the \ncommanding officer of this officer who hails from my city, and the \nincident took place a few blocks from my home--a San Francisco police \nofficer by the name of James Guelff was on duty one November night in \n1994. A young father, he was usually the first to arrive on the scene \nof a crime.\n  That night, a call came in about a sniper firing at civilians at Pine \nand California Streets. The perpetrator was armed with several assault \nrifles and pistols, including a 9-millimeter Uzi semiautomatic pistol, \n30- and 50-round clips and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. \nHe had more firepower than the entire complement of 104 police officers \nresponding to the scene combined.\n  Officer Guelff, a highly decorated 10-year police veteran, was the \nfirst to arrive on the scene. He was immediately pinned down by assault \nrifle fire. He was struck while attempting to reload his police-issue \nrevolver. He bled to death while his fellow officers and rescue team \ntried in vain to reach him. Because the suspect was wearing body armor \nand a Kevlar helmet, officers had to try to angle their shots under the \nhelmet to bring him down. Several other people were shot and injured \nbefore the suspect was killed.\n  Following that incident, I authored legislation which increases \ncriminal sentences for using body armor in the commission of a crime. \nThanks to you,\n\n[[Page S9965]]\n\nMr. President, as you know, that legislation, called the James Guelff \nBody Armor Act, is currently included in S. 10, the juvenile crime bill \nnow before the Senate, and I should say thanks to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Hatch.\n  Less than 1 month ago, police in Tacoma, WA, faced a man with an SKS \nassault rifle. The man fired on police and struck Officer William Lowry \ntwice, killing him. The rifle, police say, was modified to carry a \nhigh-capacity magazine and to fire automatically.\n  Last February, in Los Angeles, two would-be bank robbers took on \napproximately 350 police officers from 5 agencies in a major shootout \nin Hollywood, Los Angeles. The criminals were armed with three fully \nautomatic Norinco assault weapons, modeled after the AK-47, an import \nfrom China, a fully automatic HK-9 imported from Germany, a fully \nautomatic Bushmaster assault weapon modeled after the banned AR-15, and \na semiautomatic Berreta 9-millimeter pistol. These weapons had all been \naltered to be made fully automatic.\n  The perpetrators wore body armor from their neck to their ankles, \neven going so far as to duct tape body armor to any part of their body \nthat could possibly be exposed. They fired 1,100 rounds of ammunition \nfrom high-capacity magazines that could hold as many as 50 bullets, \ntaping them together in a unique way so that they can be replaced \nquickly in a style used by soldiers in combat. They wounded 11 police \nofficers and 7 civilians before being shot and killed.\n  This has been shown on many television shows. There is footage of it \nfrom beginning to end. I can tell you, the streets resemble a war zone. \nPolice on the scene were so outgunned that they had to go to a nearby \ngun store and ``borrow\" assault-type weapons in order to match the \ngunmen's firepower. Governor Wilson has now provided weapons to police \ndepartments which are fully automatic, again escalating the battle on \nour streets.\n\n  In addition to Officers Guelff and Lowry, Officer William Christian \nof Washington, DC, was killed with a MAC-11 in 1995;\n  Officer John Novabilski of Prince Georges County, MD, killed with a \nMAC-11 in May 1995;\n  Officer John Norcross of Haddon Heights, NJ, killed with an AK-47 in \nApril of 1995;\n  Officer Timothy Howe of Oakland, killed with an AK-47, April 1995;\n  Officer Daniel Doffyn of Chicago, killed with a TEC-9, March 1995;\n  Officer Henry Daly, Washington, DC, killed with a TEC-9, November \n1994;\n  Officer Michael Miller of Washington, DC, killed with a TEC-9 in \nNovember 1994.\n  Officer Martha Dixon-Martinez of Washington, DC, killed with a TEC-9 \nin November 1994.\n  Officer Julio Andino-Rivera, of Puerto Rico, killed with an AR-15 in \nSeptember 1994;\n  Officer Dan Calabrese of Winslow Township, NJ, killed with an Uzi in \nJune of 1994;\n  And a case I often use, a rookie police officer in Los Angeles on her \nfirst call, the top rookie of her class, Christy Hamilton, killed with \nan AR-15 responding to a domestic violence call.\n  These weapons are not designed for sporting purposes. They are not \ndesigned for hunting. They are the weapons of choice for grievance \nkillers, for gangs, and for those who go up against the police.\n  They are designed to kill large numbers of people in combat, just as \nthe Uzi and the Galil were designed for the Israeli military to do just \nthat. They have no place on the streets of a civilized society.\n  Israel has been a friend and an ally to the United States, a \nfriendship I and other Members of this body have strongly supported. It \nis my personal hope--and I have written to Prime Minister Netanyahu and \nexpressed this--that a nation that understands, perhaps better than \nmost, the paramount importance of any government's responsibility to \nensure the safety and security of its people will understand that there \nis a moral issue at stake here that far outweighs any commercial value \nthe sale of these weapons holds for their country.\n  There is a munitions manufacturer owned by the State of Israel. And \nby advancing this export, the Israeli Government is putting the \nofficial imprimatur of its people on the commercial sale of weapons \ndesigned, not for hunting but for combat, not to protect but to kill.\n  It is my earnest hope that the Israeli Government will respond to \nthese importunings and will lead the way in and set an example for \nothers to follow.\n  More than 4,000 people were killed by gang violence in Los Angeles \nalone in one 5-year period--1991 to 1995--gangs that all too often use \nthese kinds of weapons to terrorize and control neighborhoods.\n  We do not need more of these weapons on our streets.\n  As I said, I have asked Prime Minister Netanyahu to personally \nintervene to stop the export of these weapons to the United States.\n  I have personally had the opportunity to discuss this with the \nIsraeli Ambassador to the United States. Once again, I appeal to the \nPrime Minister's sense of what is right and, in the best interest of \nour continued friendship and the mutual security of our two people, to \nplease prevent this sale.\n  It is important also to understand that we are not singling out only \nthose weapons being exported by Israel. I have requested information on \nsemiautomatic rifles that have been approved for importation from more \nthan 17 other countries that may have similar military features which \ndistinguish them from the traditional definition of a sporting rifle.\n  To the extent that any other such weapons are discovered, and if such \nweapons are manufactured by Government-owned entities as is the case \nwith these weapons, I will be making the same request of those \ngovernment leaders as well.\n  In the meantime, 30 of us now urge President Clinton to use his \nexecutive authority to temporarily suspend this importation of weapons \nand to direct the ATF to use the traditional sporting purposes standard \nin determining whether any semiautomatic assault weapons should be \napproved for importation to the United States.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have at hand an impressive article \ndetailing the oppression that the people of Cuba have long suffered, \nand still suffer to this day. It was written by Carrol Fisher of \nSalisbury, NC, and I decided that it should be made available to all \nSenators--and to others who are concerned about the dictatorship 90 \nmiles off our shores.\n  Carrol Fisher is a World War II Navy veteran whose first visit to \nCuba was in 1944. He fell in love with the island and its people, \nincluding the young lady who became his wife 40 years ago. He and Mrs. \nFisher [Sonia] returned to Cuba recently to visit his seriously ill \nsister-in-law. During that visit, he observed the degrading state of \naffairs in Cuba, the results of Castro's oppressive military \ngovernment.\n  When he returned to Salisbury, Mr. Fisher wrote a detailed account of \nwhat he had witnessed in Cuba. The article, published in the Salisbury \n(NC) Post, counsels that the United States under no circumstances \nshould yield in its opposition to Fidel Castro's brutal regime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Fisher's article be \nprinted in the Record and the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Salisbury (NC) Post, Aug. 12, 1997]\n\n           Castro's Cuba is a Cruel and Full-Blown Purgatory\n\n                        (By Carrol J.W. Fisher)\n\n       [Editor's note: Carrol J.W. Fisher and his wife, Sonia, who \n     had not seen her native Cuba for 38 years, were recently \n     granted special permission to visit Sonia's seriously ill\n\n[[Page S9966]]\n\n     sister. Two of their four children, Luke and Mimi, went with \n     them.]\n       Knowing that conditions in Havana are hard--at least by \n     American standards--is one thing.\n       Seeing the sad and pitiful conditions and the obvious \n     presence of a military state is another.\n       We were immediately shocked, revolted and angry to find a \n     manned military station almost every two blocks on Quinta \n     Avenida (5th Avenue), the main travel artery in Havana, where \n     our hotel, the Comodoro, was on the ocean.\n       Security personnel, wearing blue trousers, white shirts and \n     ties, were armed with hand-held radios and/or side arms and \n     monitored every activity of hotel life.\n       No matter what their dress, they were military men--and I \n     believe our every move was watched and charted. We were the \n     only Americans in the hotel and, the waiters told us, most \n     likely the only Americans who will visit the hotel this year, \n     even though it was for tourists with American dollars.\n       Local Cubans were not welcome. They could not drive their \n     ragged automobiles to the hotel entrance. They could not park \n     in the parking lot. They were not permitted to go into the \n     guest's rooms. A very small number was tolerated in the \n     lobby.\n       Sonia was injured while we were there, and I insisted the \n     guard permit some of her relatives into our room. Just as \n     soon as I left for the hospital, they were required to leave \n     and return to the lobby.\n       Apparently, this military dictatorship is highly organized \n     and so closely administered that every phase of life in Cuba \n     today is controlled by Castro. A medical doctor is paid \n     between 400 and 600 hundred pesos--or, at 22 pesos to a \n     dollar--between $18 and $27 a month. More than one of the \n     drivers of state-controlled taxis told us he is paid 140 \n     pesos--or $6.32--a month.\n       At our hotel, graduate engineers were washing windows. An \n     electronics engineer was training to be a waiter. A \n     University of Havana graduate in language, a young man who \n     spoke good English, was also training to be a waiter rather \n     than teach English at the university.\n       I met a friend I knew in the '50s who had studied in an \n     American university. At great personal risk, he supported \n     Castro's revolution, carried ammunition, food, radios, \n     medicines, etc., from the Guantanamo Naval base to the Rebels \n     in the Oriente Mountains, labored for Castro's regime almost \n     40 years and alienated most of his blood family.\n       Today he works in a sensitive job 12 and 14-hour-days and \n     is paid 325 pesos or $14.77 a month.\n       I visited a number of other Cuban friends I knew in the \n     1950s. Their households were much alike. There were no recent \n     photographs because they cannot afford a camera or the film \n     that sells in Castro's stores for American dollars. They have \n     no adequate radio, no working television, no transportation \n     except maybe one Chinese bicycle. They have no wrist watches \n     except some pitiful Soviet watches that lose 5 minutes each \n     day. They are allowed one 100-pound tank of LP gas from \n     Mexico for cooking and hot water at a cost of 11 pesos. If \n     and when this tank is empty, a replacement costs $26 (572 \n     pesos) which is more than a month's wages.\n       So much walking is necessary, but no one seemed to have \n     adequate walking shoes. Most of my friends' family members \n     have very few clothes, and what they do have is worn and \n     mostly in tatters.\n\n\n                         poor living conditions\n\n       Kitchens and baths are old and tired. Faucets leak and \n     drip. So do the drains under the sinks and lavatories. Very \n     few houses showed any signs of having been repaired or \n     painted.\n       People are required to attend block meetings where they \n     gossip and report the activities of their neighbors. I took \n     my Timex watch off and gave it to one of my friends. He was \n     happy and pleased but afraid to wear it for fear of the \n     neighbors. They are morose and have little optimism or hope.\n       Since the Soviets fell and their aid ceased, Castro calls \n     this ``A Special Time.'' The adjective they use to describe \n     this special time is ``siempre,'' English for ``always.''\n       Quinta Avenida, the main avenue in all Havana, is \n     deteriorating badly, the paving is cracked and very rough, as \n     are the sidewalks and curbs. I saw holes 3 feet deep washed \n     out behind storm gratings that were dangerous to the many \n     pedestrians. Most of the lampposts had wires pulled out and \n     taped together.\n       Generally the infrastructure of Havana streets--bridges, \n     walks, parks--is in very poor condition. But the military \n     manned their innumerable posts.\n       I was introduced to Cuba in 1945 while flying off the \n     carrier Roosevelt. I returned to Guantanamo Naval Base while \n     flying with an anti-submarine squadron. I loved the people. \n     They worked hard building their houses and families. They \n     were fun to be with, happy and lighthearted, had many \n     parties, and danced to wonderful music.\n       I have lived and visited many countries in the world but \n     never found one like Cuba, where the weather enfolds you in a \n     pleasant comfort zone and the eye rests on pure beauty.\n       While I was there, I met a school teacher, Sonia, and fell \n     desperately in love, courting her for three years before we \n     married. We have lived in the USA together since October \n     1957. We have three wonderful sons and a beautiful daughter, \n     all university educated, married successfully, and they have \n     given us six lovely grand children.\n\n\n                         Beauty has disappeared\n\n       But the beautiful Cuba I knew is no more.\n       I am not qualified to evaluate or judge Fidel Castro's \n     motives for turning a beautiful country into a lower level \n     Third World country. If he is altruistic and wants what is \n     best for the Cuban people, then as an economist, he is an \n     idiot, and his understanding of human psychology is on the \n     level of a moron.\n       I do not believe he is either of the two.\n       He was raised in a cultured family, is a graduate of the \n     University of Havana and an experienced attorney. He is a \n     battle-tested military leader who defeated his enemies.\n       His motivation must come from a super ego that demands that \n     he wield total control over the Cuban society and over the \n     life of each individual Cuban. The terrible injustice, and \n     imbalance he has thrust into the lives of the Cuban people \n     has engendered mistrust, suspicion and jealousy of neighbor \n     for neighbor. His system is destroying the incentive to work \n     and achieve, to make free and independent decisions for their \n     own lives, to hope for something better for their children, \n     and maybe enjoy some measure of peace and happiness for their \n     senior years.\n       The depth of sadness that pervades the Cuban society today \n     is only exceeded by the pervasive evil of a communist system \n     that is destroying the higher human qualities of millions of \n     people..\n       Castro made the deliberate choice to embrace Marxism-\n     Leninism at a time that most world leaders had already \n     decided that it was a total failure.\n\n\n                            where is castro?\n\n       I saw no sign of Fidel Castro on any billboard or building \n     as we drove around Havana. It is as if he does not exist. One \n     does see signs of Che Guevara, but not Castro. I heard not \n     one single word of condemnation or support for Fidel Castro, \n     but I did hear a lot of criticism of the system.\n       As we arrived back in the United States, my daughter, Mimi, \n     said, ``What disturbs me most its that Castro has succeeded \n     in making the Cuban people equally poor--from the doctor who \n     makes $18 to $26 a month and must drive a cab at night just \n     to make ends meet, to the waiter in training who is not paid \n     anything. They are all victims of Castro.''\n       ``The trip was a pilgrimage,'' Sonia said. ``I went, I \n     prayed, I visited what is left of my family there. But, this \n     Cuba is not my home.'' And there were tears.\n       I am joining Senator Helms, the Miami Cuban community, even \n     Mas Canosa, and the conservatives who unfailingly resist any \n     softening of the Cuban embargo.\n       The Cuban people are suffering badly and should be \n     relieved. But any plan of relief advanced so far will \n     strengthen Castro and his ever-tightening control of every \n     facet of the lives of every single Cuban living in that \n     unhappy island. This is a very difficult decision, but I \n     believe it must be made.\n       While we were in Cuba, two hotels were bombed, a school was \n     totally destroyed by fire, and I was told by a man who left \n     Santiago, Monday, July 14, that the downed aircraft out of \n     that city that killed all 40 aboard was the work of a \n     terrorist bomb.\n       He also told me that life in Oriente Province--the one that \n     gave Castro his start--is so desperate that they were leaving \n     in droves to go to Havana.\n\n\n                            what of future?\n\n       Buy today they are being forced to return. Now they are \n     referred to as Palestinians, for they have no home. Just \n     before I left Cuba, I tried to quietly warn my Cuban friends \n     that the Miami Cubans were very wealthy, that they are very \n     powerful, and that they hate Fidel Castro with a deep and \n     pervasive hate, and there is no sign that they will ever \n     relax this hate. I told my friend to be aware of this fact \n     and that they should take what ever precautions they can \n     take.\n       Do I believe that Fidel Castro is a threat to this country? \n     At this time the answer is no. There are groups of \n     academicians going from university to university in the U.S. \n     conducting seminars designed to promote Castro.\n       But we must keep in mind that Castro, who is desperate, can \n     and might at any time turn over a chunk of the Cuban island \n     to any number of countries hostile to the U.S. They would be \n     just 90 miles from our shore. Do I have any trust in Castro? \n     Absolutely none.\n       While we were waiting in the Jose Marti airport, we talked \n     to a Cuban lady from the U.S. who was visiting relatives for \n     the first time in 30 years. With her was her daughter and her \n     daughter's friend. Both the young ladies were attorneys with \n     the N.Y. Justice Department and appeared to be in their mid-\n     30s. We asked the friend of the daughter if she would ever \n     make a return visit to Cuba.\n       ``Yes,'' she said quietly, ``in a thousand years,'' and \n     then she added, ``when I get back to New York City, I will \n     break out my American flag. I will wave that flag. I will \n     play the `Star Spangled Banner.' And I will behave like the \n     most patriotic American you have ever seen.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9965-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9966-S9967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING SEPTEMBER 19\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  On September 26, 1993, I declared a national emergency with respect \nto the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (``UNITA''), \ninvoking the authority, inter alia, of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the United Nations \nParticipation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c). Consistent with United \nNations Security Council Resolution 864, dated September 15, 1993, the \norder prohibited the sale or supply by United States persons or from \nthe United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of \narms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and \nammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and petroleum \nand petroleum products to the territory of Angola other than through \ndesignated points of entry. The order also prohibited such sale or \nsupply to UNITA. United States persons are prohibited from activities \nthat promote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies, or \nfrom attempted violations, or from evasion or avoidance or transactions \nthat have the purpose of evasion or avoidance of the stated \nprohibitions. The order authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, as might be \nnecessary to carry out the purposes of the order.\n  1. On December 10, 1993, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign \nAssets Control (OFAC) issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations \n(the ``Regulations'') (58 Fed. Reg. 64904) to implement my declaration \nof a national emergency and imposition of sanctions against UNITA. The \nRegulations prohibit the sale or supply by United States persons or \nfrom the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, \nof arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and \nammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and petroleum \nand petroleum products to UNITA or to the territory of Angola other \nthan through designated points of entry. United States persons are also \nprohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote \nsuch sales or supplies to UNITA or Angola, or from any transaction by \nany United States persons that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of \nevading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions \nset forth in the Executive order. Also prohibited are transactions by \nUnited States persons, or involving the use of U.S.-registered vessels \nor aircraft, relating to transportation to Angola or UNITA of goods the \nexportation of which is prohibited.\n  The Government of Angola has designated the following points of entry \nas points in Angola to which the articles otherwise prohibited by the \nRegulations may be shipped: Airports: Luanda and Katumbela, Benguela \nProvince; Ports: Luanda and Lobito, Benuela Province; and Namibe, \nNamibe Province; and Entry Points: Malongo, Cabinda Province. Although \nno specific license is required by the Department of the Treasury for \nshipments to these designated points of entry (unless the item is \ndestined for UNITA), any such exports remain subject to the licensing \nrequirements of the Departments of State and/or Commerce.\n  There has been one amendment to the Regulations since my report of \nApril 3, 1997. The UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR Part \n590, were amended on August 25, 1997. General reporting, recordkeeping, \nlicensing, and other procedural regulations were moved from the \nRegulations to a separate part (31 CFR Part 501) dealing solely with \nsuch procedural matters. (62 Fed. Reg. 45098, August 25, 1997). A copy \nof the amendment is attached.\n  2. The OFAC has worked closely with the U.S. financial community to \nassure a heightened awareness of the sanctions against UNITA--through \nthe dissemination of publications, seminars, and notices to electronic \nbulletin boards. This educational effort has resulted in frequent calls \nfrom banks to assure that they are not routing funds in violation of \nthese prohibitions. United States exporters have also been notified of \nthe sanctions through a variety of media, including via the Internet, \nFax-on-Demand, special fliers, and computer bulletin board information \ninitiated by OFAC and posted through the U.S. Department of Commerce \nand the U.S. Government Printing Office. There have been no license \napplications under the program since my last report.\n  3. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from March 26, 1997, through September 25, 1997, that are \ndirectly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities \nconferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nUNITA are approximately $50,000, most of which represent wage and \nsalary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely \ncentered in\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel) and \nthe Department of State (particularly the Office of Southern African \nAffairs).\n  I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to require the establishment of a research and grant \nprogram for the eradication or control of Pfiesteria pisicicida and \nother aquatic toxins.\n\n\n                  the pfiesteria research act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bill I am \nintroducing today, the Pfiesteria Research Act of 1997. I thank my \ncolleagues who have joined me as original cosponsors of this bill: \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, Senator Paul Sarbanes and Senator John \nWarner.\n  This bill is the first Federal legislative response to this \nmysterious microbe which has been linked to fish kills and also to \nhuman health problems all along the east coast, but particularly in the \nChesapeake Bay area and along the coast of North Carolina.\n  Pfiesteria has become more than a problem affecting one State and, as \nsuch, a Federal, broader response is necessary. The No. 1 need is \nresearch into this mystery, what causes it, why it occurs, and how it \ncan be stopped.\n  We need to involve the best research laboratories in the country, at \nGovernment agencies, at universities, and at State agencies, to study \nthe problem and to find a solution.\n  Specifically, this bill does two things. First, it authorizes the \nEPA, the National Marine Fisheries Service,\n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\nthe National Institute of Environmental Health Services, the Centers \nfor Disease Control, and the Department of Agriculture to establish a \nresearch program for the eradication or control of Pfiesteria and other \naquatic toxins.\n  Second, the bill directs these agencies to make grants to \nuniversities and other such entities in affected States for the \neradication or control of Pfiesteria and other aquatic toxins.\n  Given the potentially serious health and environmental effects--and \nthey have clearly been demonstrated by the number of people who have \ngotten sick in the Maryland-Virginia area because of it, and it has \nbeen deadly to hundreds of thousands of fish--significant Federal \naction needs to be taken to eradicate it and make sure this regional \nthreat does not become a national threat.\n  I hope this bill will be passed in the very near future and funds \nwill then be appropriated to fully fund it. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on this matter, and I particularly thank my \ncolleague from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski, for her assistance with the \nbill.\n  I send the bill to the desk and ask for its appropriate referral.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1219\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pfiesteria Research Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PFIESTERIA AND OTHER AQUATIC TOXINS RESEARCH AND \n                   GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce (acting through \n     the Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services (acting through the \n     Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health \n     Sciences and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention), and the Secretary of Agriculture shall--\n       (1) establish a research program for the eradication or \n     control of Pfiesteria piscicida and other aquatic toxins; and\n       (2) make grants to colleges, universities, and other \n     entities in affected States for the eradication or control of \n     Pfiesteria piscicida and other aquatic toxins.\n       (b) Grants.--In carrying out subsection (a)(2), the heads \n     of the agencies referred to in subsection (a) shall make \n     grants to--\n       (1) North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North \n     Carolina, for the establishment of an Applied Aquatic Ecology \n     Center and for research conducted by the Center relating to \n     aquatic toxins;\n       (2) the University System of Maryland and the Agricultural \n     Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, for the \n     establishment of a cooperative Agro-Ecosystem Center for \n     research and demonstration projects related to aquatic \n     toxins, such as Pfiesteria piscicida, including projects that \n     relate to dietary, waste management, and other alternative-\n     use related strategies that reduce the undesirable nutrient \n     and other chemical content from waste into waterways; and\n       (3) the Virginia Institute of Marine Science of the College \n     of William and Mary in Gloucester Point, Virginia, for the \n     establishment of a Marine Pathology and Applied Ecology \n     Center and for research conducted by the Center relating to \n     the effect of algal toxins on marine fish and shellfish and \n     to understanding human influences on estuarine planktonic \n     communities with an emphasis on harmful algal species, except \n     that a portion of the grants made under this paragraph shall \n     be allocated to Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, \n     for research support.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section, of which not less than--\n       (1) $1,883,619 for fiscal year 1998, and $655,890 for \n     fiscal year 1999, shall be used to carry out subsection \n     (b)(1);\n       (2) $1,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999 shall \n     be used to carry out subsection (b)(2); and\n       (3) $1,750,000 for fiscal year 1998, and $545,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999, shall be used to carry out subsection \n     (b)(3).\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am delighted to join my \ncolleagues Senator Faircloth, Senator Mikulski and Senator Warner as a \nprincipal cosponsor of this proposal providing additional Federal \nassistance to efforts combating Pfiesteria outbreaks in the Chesapeake \nBay and other Atlantic coast waterways.\n  The micro-organism Pfiesteria piscicida, linked to fish kills and \nhuman health problems this summer in the Pocomoke River on Maryland's \nEastern Shore, is a matter about which we are all deeply concerned. The \nGovernor has recently closed down two Eastern Shore waterways in \nMaryland, and fish with lesions characteristic of Pfiesteria have also \nbeen discovered in Delaware, Virginia, and other Atlantic coast \nwaterways.\n  Since the Pfiesteria outbreaks began, we, in Congress, have worked \nindividually and collectively on a variety of initiatives to assist the \nStates in battling this toxic micro-organism. The Federal agency \nresponse team, led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is providing valuable \nfunding and technical assistance to the States.\n  The Federal assistance thus far includes habitat and water quality \nmonitoring and fish lesion assessment. At my and Senator Mikulski's \nrequest, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \nNational Institute of Environment Health Sciences are providing \nscientific teams and technical assistance for human health risk-\nassessment efforts. In Maryland, the Cooperative Laboratory at Oxford \nis playing an especially key role by coordinating ongoing fisheries-\nrelated investigations.\n  The Pfiesteria Research Act of 1997 would add a critical dimension to \nthe Federal response, one that would assist farmers with agricultural-\nrelated research and demonstrations related to outbreaks of Pfiesteria \nand other aquatic toxins. This measure would provide this assistance by \nestablishing a cooperative Agro-Ecosystem Center between the University \nSystem of Maryland and the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, and \nauthorizing not less than $2 million in grants to the center. The \nUniversity System of Maryland and the Beltsville Center are world \nleaders in conducting agricultural research and demonstration projects. \nI am confident that both have the substantial scientific and technical \nexpertise necessary to lead the dietary, waste management, and other \nnutrient-reduction efforts authorized in this measure to combat \nPfiesteria.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has worked closely with \naffected States as they respond to Pfiesteria outbreaks. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure and to provide much-needed \nassistance to farmers to battle Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay and \nalong other Atlantic coast waterways.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bumpers, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 1220. A bill to provide a process for declassifying on an \nexpedited basis certain documents relating to human rights abuses in \nGuatemala and Honduras; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    the human rights information act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Human Rights \nInformation Act--legislation designed to facilitate the \ndeclassification of certain United States documents that relate to past \nhuman rights abuses in Guatemala and and Honduras. This act would \nensure the prompt declassification of information by all relevant U.S. \nGovernment agencies concerning human rights abuses, while providing \nadequate protection to safeguard U.S. national security interests. \nTimely declassification of relevant materials would be of enormous \nassistance to the Guatemalan and Honduran people who are at this moment \nconfronting past human rights violations as part of ongoing efforts to \nstrengthen democratic institutions in those countries, particularly \ntheir judiciaries.\n  This bill would ensure prompt and complete declassification within \nthe necessary bounds of protection of national security. It would \nrequire Government agencies to review for declassification within 120 \ndays all human rights records relevant to inquiries by the Honduran \nhuman rights commissioner and the Guatemalan Clarification Commission. \nAn interagency appeals panel would review agencies decisions to \nwithhold information. The bill follows declassification standards \nalready enacted by Congress in the JFK Assassination Records Act but is \nmuch simpler and less expensive than that law.\n  Honduran Human Rights Commissioner Leo Valladares has already made a \nrequest of the United States\n\n[[Page S9971]]\n\nGovernment for any relevant documents concerning Honduran human rights \nviolations and particularly those alleged to have been perpetrated by \nHonduran military Battalion 3-16 that resulted in more than 184 \nkillings or disappearances in the early 1980's.\n  The Guatemalan Clarification Commission, which was set up by the \nDecember 1996 peace accords to establish a historical record of the \nmassive human rights violations that occurred during more than three \ndecades of civil war, is expected shortly to make a similar request for \nrelevant United States documents concerning this period. The U.S. \nGovernment is, properly, offering financial assistance to the \nclarification commission. The United States should also support the \ncommission's important work to end impunity by providing relevant \ndeclassified documents.\n  While it is true that the Clinton administration has already \ndeclassified some documents related to Honduras and Guatemala, by \nExecutive order, such declassifications have been very narrowly \nfocused. And, despite a number of letters from Congress requesting \nprompt action, the administration's response to the longstanding \nrequest by Honduran Human Rights Commissioner Valladares, which was \nfirst submitted in 1993, has been slow and partial.\n  Moreover, although the administration officially agreed to honor the \nHonduran request, many of the documents released to date have been \nheavily excised, yielding little substantive information. The State \nDepartment has turned over 3,000 pages, but other agencies have been \nmuch less forthcoming. For example, the CIA has released 36 documents \nconcerning Father Carney, a United States priest killed in Honduras, \nand 97 documents pertaining to 5 other key human rights cases. Most are \nheavily excised. The Department of Defense has released 34 heavily \nexcised documents, but almost nothing that relates to the activities of \nBattalion 3-16.\n  The administration has also declassified numerous documents on \nGuatemala in response to public demands. These focus, however, on \napproximately 30 cases of human rights abuses directed against \nAmericans in Guatemala. The cases of Guatemalan anthropologist Myrna \nMack and guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca, husband of American lawyer \nJennifer Harbury, were exceptions. In May of this year, the CIA also \nreleased an important batch of documents concerning its 1954 covert \noperation in Guatemala. However, thousands of documents on human rights \nviolations that could be of interest to the clarification commission \nremain classified. Many of the documents already declassified were \nheavily excised, and, as in the Honduran case, the intelligence and \ndefense agencies were less forthcoming than the State Department.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that my colleagues can join me in voting \nfor the Human Rights Information Act. This will send a very powerful \nsignal of support for efforts to strengthen democracy and the rule of \nlaw throughout the hemisphere. It will also greatly assist Latin \nAmericans who are currently bravely working to shed light upon a dark \nperiod of their recent pasts so that they can prevent such heinous \nabuses from occurring in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Human Rights Information \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Agencies of the Government of the United States have \n     information on human rights violations in Guatemala and \n     Honduras.\n       (2) Members of both Houses of Congress have repeatedly \n     asked the Administration for information on Guatemalan and \n     Honduran human rights cases.\n       (3) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of \n     the United States firmly supports, has as an important and \n     vital component the establishment of the Commission for the \n     Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and Acts \n     of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan \n     People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification \n     Commission''). The Clarification Commission will investigate \n     cases of human rights violations and abuses by both parties \n     to the civil conflict in Guatemala and will need all \n     available information to fulfill its mandate.\n       (4) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human \n     Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting United \n     States Government documentation on human rights violations in \n     Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request \n     has been partly fulfilled, but is still pending. The request \n     has been supported by national and international human rights \n     nongovernmental organizations as well as members of both \n     Houses of Congress.\n       (5) Victims and survivors of human rights violations, \n     including United States citizens and their relatives, have \n     also been requesting the information referred to in \n     paragraphs (3) and (4). Survivors and the relatives of \n     victims have a right to know what happened. The requests have \n     been supported by national and international human rights \n     nongovernmental organizations as well as members of both \n     Houses of Congress.\n       (6) The United States should make the information it has on \n     human rights abuses available to the public as part of the \n     United States commitment to democracy in Central America.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' \n     means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the \n     United States Government containing information about gross \n     human rights violations committed after 1944.\n       (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the \n     United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign \n     policy or foreign intelligence, including the Department of \n     State, the Agency for International Development, the \n     Department of Defense (and all of its components), the \n     Central Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance \n     Office, the Department of Justice (and all of its \n     components), the National Security Council, and the Executive \n     Office of the President.\n\n     SEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF \n                   HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND \n                   HONDURAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the provision of this Act shall govern the \n     declassification and public disclosure of human rights \n     records by agencies.\n       (b) Identification of Records.--Not later than 120 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each agency shall \n     identify, review, and organize all human rights records \n     regarding activities occurring in Guatemala and Honduras \n     after 1944 for the purpose of declassifying and disclosing \n     the records to the public. Except as provided in section 5, \n     all records described in the preceding sentence shall be made \n     available to the public not later than 30 days after a review \n     under this section is completed.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the President shall report to \n     Congress regarding each agency's compliance with the \n     provisions of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF \n                   RECORDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure \n     of a human rights record or particular information in a human \n     rights record only if the agency determines that there is \n     clear and convincing evidence that--\n       (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence \n     operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United \n     States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record \n     is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and \n     such public disclosure would reveal--\n       (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently requires \n     protection;\n       (B) an intelligence source or method--\n       (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably expected to be \n     utilized, by the United States Government;\n       (ii) which has not been officially disclosed; and\n       (iii) the disclosure of which would interfere with the \n     conduct of intelligence activities; or\n       (C) any other matter currently relating to the military \n     defense, intelligence operations, or conduct of foreign \n     relations of the United States, the disclosure of which would \n     demonstrably impair the national security of the United \n     States;\n       (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \n     reveal the name or identity of a living individual who \n     provided confidential information to the United States and \n     would pose a substantial risk of harm to that individual;\n       (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could \n     reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion \n     of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so \n     substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or\n       (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \n     compromise the existence of an understanding of \n     confidentiality currently requiring protection between a \n     Government agent and a cooperating individual or a foreign \n     government, and public disclosure would be so harmful that it \n     outweighs the public interest.\n       (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not \n     be grounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights \n     record that an individual named in the\n\n[[Page S9972]]\n\n     human rights record was an intelligence asset of the United \n     States Government, although the existence of such \n     relationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in \n     subsection (a) are met. For purposes of the preceding \n     sentence, the term an ``intelligence asset'' means a covert \n     agent as defined in section 606(4) of the National Security \n     Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).\n\n     SEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL \n                   ENTITIES IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN CARIBBEAN \n                   COUNTRIES.\n\n       In the event that an agency of the United States receives a \n     request for human rights records from an entity created by \n     the United Nations or the Organization of American States \n     similar to the Guatemalan Clarification Commission, or from \n     the principal justice or human rights official of a Latin \n     American or Caribbean country who is investigating a pattern \n     of gross human rights violations, the agency shall conduct a \n     review of records as described in section 4 and shall \n     declassify and publicly disclose such records in accordance \n     with the standards and procedures set forth in this Act.\n\n     SEC. 7. REVIEW OF DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD RECORDS.\n\n       (a) Duties of the Appeals Panel.--The Interagency Security \n     Classification Appeals Panel (referred to in this Act as the \n     ``Appeals Panel''), established under Executive Order No. \n     12958, shall review determinations by an agency to postpone \n     public disclosure of any human rights record.\n       (b) Determinations of the Appeals Panel.--\n       (1) In general.--The Appeals Panel shall direct that all \n     human rights records be disclosed to the public, unless the \n     Appeals Panel determines that there is clear and convincing \n     evidence that--\n       (A) the record is not a human rights record; or\n       (B) the human rights record or particular information in \n     the human rights record qualifies for postponement of \n     disclosure pursuant to section 5.\n       (2) Treatment in cases of nondisclosure.--If the Appeals \n     Panel concurs with an agency decision to postpone disclosure \n     of a human rights record, the Appeals Panel shall determine, \n     in consultation with the originating agency and consistent \n     with the standards set forth in this Act, which, if any, of \n     the alternative forms of disclosure described in paragraph \n     (3) shall be made by the agency.\n       (3) Alternative forms of disclosure.--The forms of \n     disclosure described in this paragraph are as follows:\n       (A) Disclosure of any reasonably segregable portion of the \n     human rights record after deletion of the portions described \n     in paragraph (1).\n       (B) Disclosure of a record that is a substitute for \n     information which is not disclosed.\n       (C) Disclosure of a summary of the information contained in \n     the human rights record.\n       (4) Notification of determination.--\n       (A) In general.--Upon completion of its review, the Appeals \n     Panel shall notify the head of the agency in control or \n     possession of the human rights record that was the subject of \n     the review of its determination and shall, not later than 14 \n     days after the determination, publish the determination in \n     the Federal Register.\n       (B) Notice to president.--The Appeals Panel shall notify \n     the President of its determination. The notice shall contain \n     a written unclassified justification for its determination, \n     including an explanation of the application of the standards \n     contained in section 5.\n       (5) General procedures.--The Appeals Panel shall publish in \n     the Federal Register guidelines regarding its policy and \n     procedures for adjudicating appeals.\n       (c) Presidential Authority Over Appeals Panel \n     Determination.--\n       (1) Public disclosure or postponement of disclosure.--The \n     President shall have the sole and nondelegable authority to \n     review any determination of the Appeals Board under this Act, \n     and such review shall be based on the standards set forth in \n     section 5. Not later than 30 days after the Appeals Panel's \n     determination and notification to the agency pursuant to \n     subsection (b)(4), the President shall provide the Appeals \n     Panel with an unclassified written certification specifying \n     the President's decision and stating the reasons for the \n     decision, including in the case of a determination to \n     postpone disclosure, the standards set forth in section 5 \n     which are the basis for the President's determination.\n       (2) Record of presidential postponement.--The Appeals Panel \n     shall, upon receipt of the President's determination, publish \n     in the Federal Register a copy of any unclassified written \n     certification, statement, and other materials transmitted by \n     or on behalf of the President with regard to the postponement \n     of disclosure of a human rights record.\n\n     SEC. 8. REPORT REGARDING OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS.\n\n       Upon completion of the review and disclosure of the human \n     rights records relating to Guatemala and Honduras, the \n     Information Security Policy Advisory Council, established \n     pursuant to Executive Order No. 12958, shall report to \n     Congress on the desirability and feasibility of \n     declassification of human rights records relating to other \n     countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The report \n     shall be available to the public.\n\n     SEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Freedom of Information Act.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to limit any right to file a request with any \n     executive agency or seek judicial review of a decision \n     pursuant to section 552 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (b) Judicial Review.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to preclude judicial review, under chapter 7 of \n     title 5, United States Code, of final actions taken or \n     required to be taken under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 10. CREATION OF POSITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Act, \n     there shall be 2 additional positions in the Appeals Panel. \n     The positions shall be filled by the President, based on the \n     recommendations of the American Historical Association, the \n     Latin American Studies Association, Human Rights Watch, and \n     Amnesty International, USA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Hollings):\n  S. 1221. A bill to amend title 46 of the United States Code to \nprevent foreign ownership and control of United States flag vessels \nemployed in the fisheries in the navigable waters and exclusive \neconomic zone of the United States, to prevent the issuance of fishery \nendorsements to certain vessels, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                       the american fisheries act\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to send to the desk a bill \nthat is called the American Fisheries Act to raise the U.S. ownership \nstandard for U.S.-flag fishing vessels operating in U.S. waters, to \neliminate the exemptions and loopholes interpreted into the existing \nownership and control standard, and to phase out large fishing vessels \nthat are destructive to U.S. fishery resources because of their size \nand power.\n  As I said, this bill is called the American Fisheries Act.\n  Let me point out, these factory trawlers we are talking about make \ntrucks look like tiny bugs. They certainly waste a tremendous amount of \nfish. According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game statistics \nfor 1995--that is the most recent year for which we have statistics--\nthe 55 factory trawlers in the Bering Sea off my State threw overboard \n483 million pounds of groundfish, wasted and unused.\n  That is more fish than the targeted fisheries of New England lobster, \nAtlantic mackerel, Gulf of Mexico shrimp, and Pacific Northwest salmon \ncombined. It is the most horrendous waste of fishery resources in the \nhistory of man. And this bill is designed to stop that.\n  Mr. President, as I said, the bill I am introducing today would:\n  First, raise U.S. ownership standard for U.S.-flag fishing vessels \noperating in U.S. waters; second, eliminate the exemptions and \nloopholes interpreted into the existing ownership and control standard; \nand third, phase out large fishing vessels that are destructive to U.S. \nfishery resources because of their size and power.\n  The bill is called the American Fisheries Act. Senators Kerry, \nMurkowski, Breaux, and Hollings join me as original cosponsors.\n  Last year, we enacted major revisions to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act to improve the conservation of the \nfishery resources. The other primary goal of the original Fishery \nConservation and Management Act in 1975 was to Americanize the \nfisheries. We tried to complete that process through the Commercial \nFishing Industry Anti-Reflagging Act--Public Law 100-239--in 1987. Due \nto exemptions in the act and to misinterpretations by the Coast Guard, \nthis act has not been effective.\n  The bill we introduce today would correct the basic controlling \ninterest and foreign rebuilding requirements for U.S.-flag vessels that \nparticipate in our fisheries.\n\n\n                         closing the loopholes\n\n  The bill would require at least 75 percent of the controlling \ninterest of all vessels that fly the U.S. flag and engage in the \nfisheries in the navigable waters and exclusive economic zone to be \nowned by citizens of the United States.\n  The Commercial Fishing Industry Anti-Reflagging Act--Public Law 100-\n239--imposed a 50 percent controlling interest standard, which has \nbecome meaningless because of exceptions in the bill and \nmisinterpretations by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's \nmisinterpretation of one provision of that\n\n[[Page S9973]]\n\nact allowed at least 14 massive factory trawlers to enter the fisheries \noff Alaska.\n  As many here know, the House of Representatives recently passed a \nbill to keep one factory trawler out of the Atlantic herring and \nmackerel fisheries. Similar bills have been introduced in the Senate.\n  In Alaska, we got stuck with at least 14 factory trawlers that should \nnever have been allowed into our fisheries. Talk about loopholes you \ncan drive a truck through--these factory trawlers make trucks look like \ntiny little bugs. And they waste fish.\n  According to Alaska Department of Fish and Game statistics for 1995, \nthe most recent year for which data is available, the 55 factory \ntrawlers in the Bering Sea threw overboard 483 million pounds of \ngroundfish wasted, and unused. That is more fish than the target \nfisheries for New England lobster, Atlantic mackerel, Gulf of Mexico \nshrimp, and Pacific Northwest salmon combined.\n  The bill we introduce today draws heavily from the controlling \ninterest standard in the Jones Act for vessels operating in the \ncoastwide trade. Under our bill, vessel owners would have 18 months \nfrom the date of enactment to comply with the new 75 percent \ncontrolling interest standard.\n\n  For vessels above 100 gross registered tons--which are more likely to \nhave multiple owners or layers of ownership--the bill would require the \nMaritime Administration to closely scrutinize who actually controls the \nvessel before the vessel receives or can renew a fishery endorsement.\n  The Maritime Administration already reviews the controlling interest \nof entities applying for title XI loan guarantees and maritime security \nprogram payments. MarAd has the best expertise among Federal agencies \nto do the thorough job we intend.\n  The Secretary of Transportation would be required to revoke the \nfishery endorsement of any vessel above 100 gross tons that MarAd \ndetermines does not meet the new standard for controlling interest.\n  The bill gives the Secretary of Transportation flexibility in \nestablishing the requirements for the owners of vessels equal to or \nless than 100 gross registered tons to show compliance with the new \nstandard. Vessels of this size generally do not exceed 75 feet in \nlength, are usually owner-operated, and are less likely to have \nmultiple layers of ownership that must be scrutinized.\n  If the Secretary decides that compliance with the new 75 percent \nstandard can be demonstrated by vessels 100 tons or less using the \nexisting process through the Coast Guard, the Secretary could continue \nto use this process for those vessels.\n  As the findings point out, international law--including Article 62 of \nthe U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea--gives coastal nations the \nclear sovereign right to harvest and process the entire allowable catch \nof fishery resources in their exclusive economic zone [EEZ] if their \ncitizens have the harvesting capacity to do so. International law \nrequires that other nations be given access if the coastal nation \ncannot harvest and process the entire allowable catch in its EEZ.\n  In the United States, we have established a framework that fulfills \nthese two basic principles. Through the Magnuson-Stevens Act, we gave \nU.S. fishermen first priority in the harvesting and processing of our \nfishery resources. Foreign fishing is allowed under that act, however, \nif U.S. vessels cannot harvest the entire allowable catch.\n  For obvious reasons, the priority works only if U.S.-owned vessels \ncan be distinguished from foreign-owned vessels in the fisheries. I am \nsad to report that our current law--the way it has been \nmisinterpreted--fails to allow for this differentiation. In the \nNation's largest fishery by volume (Bering Sea pollock) Norwegian and \nJapanese companies control the vessels that take over half the \nallowable catch.\n  There is not enough fish to support the existing harvesting capacity \nin this and other fisheries, yet the line to differentiate true U.S.-\ncontrolled vessels from foreign-controlled vessels is not adequate to \nprotect the first priority for U.S. citizens. The American Fisheries \nAct will clear up this blurred line and give U.S. fishermen the top \npriority to harvest fishery resources, consistent with the historical \nintent of our laws.\n\n\n                       phase out of large vessels\n\n  When the Senate passed my bill last year to strengthen the \nconservation measures of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, I said on the Senate \nfloor that I would seek a ban on factory trawlers if those measures did \nnot work. It is too early to tell whether those measures will be \nsufficient.\n  We propose today a phase out--not a ban--of factory trawlers and \nother fishing vessels that are longer than 165 feet, greater than 750 \ntons, or that have greater than 3,000 shaft horsepower.\n  By fishing vessel, we mean factory trawlers and other vessels that \nharvest fish. Existing fishing vessels above these thresholds are \ngrandfathered--and can stay in the fisheries for their useful lives, \nprovided the 75 percent controlling interest standard is met, and the \nvessel does not surrender its fishery endorsement at any time.\n  Gradually, the useful lives of these large fishing vessels will end, \nhowever, and a smaller fleet--more able to avoid bycatch and waste and \nmore likely to be owner-operated--will replace them.\n  I reserve the option to accelerate this process through an immediate \nban on factory trawlers if the management and conservation measures \nenacted last year in the Sustainable Fisheries Act are not effective.\n  The phase out of large fishing vessels does not apply to vessels that \nfish exclusively for highly migratory fish species primarily outside \nU.S. navigable waters and the exclusive economic zone.\n  Earlier this year--we enacted comprehensive legislation to achieve \nconservation under the International Dolphin Conservation Program--in \npart with the hope that some of the eastern tropical tuna fishing \nvessels would re-flag to the Unites States.\n  These vessels are subject to stringent international conservation \nmeasures, and are able to harvest tuna in a way safer for the overall \necosystem than smaller vessels. These vessels were dealt with \ndifferently under the Anti-Reflagging Act as well.\n\n\n                            foreign rebuilds\n\n  The bill specifically addresses the foreign rebuilding provision of \nthe Anti-Reflagging Act that was misinterpreted by the Coast Guard and \nabused by speculators who did exactly what Congress tried to avoid with \nthis act. This misinterpretation and abuse resulted in at least 14 \nfactory trawlers entering the fisheries off Alaska that should have \nbeen prohibited by the Anti-Reflagging Act.\n  Section 4(a)(4)(A) of the Act was meant to protect a specific group \nof owners who relied on pre-existing law in planning to convert U.S.-\nbuilt fishing vessels abroad for use in the U.S. fisheries.\n  This provision was not intended to protect speculators who entered \ncontingent contracts to purchase vessels with the intent to profit by \nthe coming change in the law. To avoid this, Congress specifically \nrequired under section 4(a)(4)(A) and section 4(b) that the owner had \nto:\n  First, have purchased or contracted to purchase a vessel by July 28, \n1997; second, have demonstrated his/her/its specific intent to enter \nthe U.S. fisheries through the purchase of the contract itself or a \nCoast Guard letter ruling; and third, have accepted delivery of the \nvessel by July 28, 1990 and entered it into service.\n  Under the Act, all three conditions had to be met by the same owner \nbefore a fishery license could be issued to the vessel.\n  The Coast Guard erroneously allowed the vessel to be redelivered to \nany owner by July 28, 1990, and created freely transferable and \nvaluable rights to enter the fishery that Congress specifically \nintended to avoid.\n  The American Fisheries Act would correct this problem by putting the \nburden on those who benefited from the loophole to help with the \nreduction in the overcapacity that resulted. Specifically, from the \ndate of the introduction of this act--September 25, 1997--if the \ncontrolling interest a vessel that used this loophole materially \nchanges, another active vessel of equal or greater length, tonnage, and \nhorsepower in the same region will have to permanently surrender its \nfishery endorsement.\n  The capacity in the Bering Sea would be reduced on the backs of those \nwho caused the problem and who argued for\n\n[[Page S9974]]\n\nand benefited from an interpretation clearly contrary to congressional \nintent.\n\n\n                        federal loan guarantees\n\n  The bill would permanently prohibit Federal loan guarantees for any \nvessel that is intended for use as a fishing vessel, and that will be \ngreater than 165 registered feet, 750 gross registered tons, or 3,000 \nshaft horsepower when the construction or rebuilding is completed.\n  We mean to prevent the Federal Government from subsidizing or \nassisting in any way in the: No. 1, construction of vessels above these \nthresholds; No. 2 extension of the useful life of vessels above these \nthresholds; or No. 3 expansion of vessels so that they exceed these \nthresholds--where the vessel will be used as a fishing vessel.\n  For the purposes of this measure, fishing vessel has the same \ndefinition as under section 2101 of title 46, United States Code, \nmeaning a vessel that engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of \nfish or any activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the \ncatching, taking, or harvesting of fish. This obviously includes \nfactory trawlers and other fishing vessels above the thresholds listed \nabove.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n  With the American Fisheries Act, we will clean up the mess caused by \nthe exceptions and misinterpretation of the Anti-Reflagging Act. We \nwill also serve notice that entities that do not meet the 75 \ncontrolling interest standard will not likely receive individual \nfishing quota's [IFQ's] or other limited access permits under the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act.\n  The Sustainable Fisheries Act--Public Law 104-297--requires the \nNational Academy of Sciences to study how to prohibit entities that \ndon't meet the standard from owning IFQ's. We will analyze the \nAcademy's report during the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act \nin 1999. I do not want any foreign-controlled entities to be surprised \nwhen that process begins.\n  Non-U.S. citizens simply should not be given what, for all practical \npurposes, are permanent access privileges to U.S. marine resource when \nthere are U.S. citizens that can harvest these fish. The Magnuson-\nStevens Act allows these foreign-controlled entities to harvest the \nportion of the allowable catch that U.S. citizens cannot.\n  In Alaska, some of the foreign participants are doing what they can \nto patch up their relationship with Alaska and Alaskans--but I question \ntheir long-term commitment.\n  The North Pacific Council is reviewing the inshore/offshore pollock \nallocation right now--which will substantially impact them. They have \nbeen good partners this year in anticipation of this council debate--\nbut where were they last year? They were here in Washington, DC, \nlobbying against our bill to protect fishing communities, reduce \nbycatch, and prevent foreign entities from receiving a windfall \ngiveaway through IFQ's.\n  If Congress or the North Pacific Council gives away permanent access \nto our fisheries, I believe these entities will go back to their \ntactics of the last 10 years.\n  Flannery O'Connor explained this well in her short story ``A Good Man \nIs Hard to Find.'' In that story, the ``Misfit'' says of another \ncharacter that ``She would of been a good woman, if [there] had been \nsomebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.''\n  The foreign-controlled factory trawlers have the inshore/offshore gun \nto their head right now, and are being good. But their track record \nwithout this gun has been poor, both with respect to the conservation \nand to protecting fishing communities.\n  In the Bering Sea pollock, specifically, I am concerned that a single \nNorwegian entity controls an excessive share of the harvest in \nviolation of National Standard Four of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. I am \nalso concerned about the expansion of the ownership of catcher vessels \nand factory trawlers by Japanese entities.\n  Will we have the strength in the Congress or at the council level to \nprevent a giveaway of IFQ's to foreign-controlled entities in 2000 or \nbeyond if they are the only ones left in the fishery?\n  The time has come to put Americanization back on the track as we \nfirst envisioned when we extended U.S. jurisdiction over the fisheries \nout to 200 miles.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator \nStevens in sponsoring this important legislation.\n  This is a necessary follow-on to legislation I first introduced in \n1986, the Commercial Fishing Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act, which was \nenacted in 1987. That act attempted to control an anticipated influx of \nforeign-owned fishing vessels by prohibiting them from reflagging as \nU.S. vessels except in certain circumstances. At the time, I backed a \nmove to impose, for the first time, an American ownership provision \nthat would ensure U.S. control of corporations owning such vessels.\n  Had that legislation been implemented the way it was intended, \ntoday's bill would probably not be necessary. Our intention was to \ngradually eliminate foreign control by requiring new owners to be U.S.-\ncontrolled. Unfortunately, in making a decision on implementation, the \nCoast Guard decided to rely primarily on its past practice, and \npermitted all vessels with U.S. documentation to continue fishing \nregardless of existing or new ownership.\n  That, as much as any one factor, led to today's crisis, in which \nthere are far too many large vessels operating. Something has to give, \nand the laws of nature and economics say that it has to be one of two \nthings: either the resource itself or the number of vessels.\n  This bill will help insure that the resource will be held harmless; \nif change occurs, it will come to the number of large vessels allowed \nto operate in U.S. fisheries.\n  The bill we are introducing today will increase the American \nownership requirement for vessels to 75 percent from the 51-percent \nlevel required by current law. This new level is consistent with other \nlaws affecting ownership of vessels involved in the coastwise trade, \nwhich are also required to meet the 75-percent test.\n  It will also correct the mistake made by the Coast Guard a decade ago \nby requiring fishery endorsements to be removed from vessels which do \nnot qualify for the ownership criterion within a reasonable period of \ntime--18 months under this bill.\n  Under this bill, the Coast Guard will no longer be responsible for \nreviewing the ownership of fishing vessels. This authority will rest \nmore appropriately with the Maritime Administration, which currently \nhas the same responsibility for vessels seeking title XI loan \nguarantees and Maritime Security Program assistance, among other \nthings.\n  The bill will also begin the process of restoring the number of large \nfishing vessels operating off our shores to a reasonable and manageable \nlevel, by eliminating the entry of new vessels, regardless of \nownership, and by allowing attrition to take its toll on the existing \nfleet. Large vessels are those over 165 registered feet in length, \ngreater than 750 gross registered tons, or with engines totaling more \nthan 3,000 horsepower. The bill also eliminates Federal loan guarantees \nthat have been used to subsidize and accelerate the unrestrained growth \nof this fleet.\n  Further, currently operating vessels which were rebuilt for fishing \nin foreign shipyards using the loophole created by the Coast Guard's \ninterpretation of the earlier act, and which are sold to new owners in \nthe future, will not be eligible to fish under the new owners unless a \nsimilarly sized vessel is also removed from the fishery.\n  Taken together, these provisions will help to move us away from a \nfleet that is only nominally U.S.-controlled to one which is truly \nU.S.-controlled.\n  Moreover, in reducing the total number of these large vessels over \ntime, this measure will also provide tremendous benefits to the many \nsmall communities which depend not on these large vessels, but on the \nfar greater numbers of small fishing vessels and shore-based processing \nplants that hire locally, deliver locally, process locally, and support \ntheir communities through local taxes.\n  Mr. President, I enthusiastically support this legislation, and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Robb, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. D'Amato, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Warner, Mr. Reed, Ms. Landrieu,\n\n[[Page S9975]]\n\n        Mr. Graham, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. \n        Mack):\n  S. 1222. A bill to catalyze restoration of estuary habitat through \nmore efficient financing of projects and enhanced coordination of \nFederal and non-Federal restoration programs, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n        the estuary habitat restoration partnership act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Breaux and \nSenators Lieberman, Faircloth, Robb, Sarbanes, Murray, D'Amato, \nMurkowski, Warner, Reed, Landrieu, Graham, Mikulski, Dodd, Moynihan, \nand Mack to introduce the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act \nof 1997. Estuaries, those bays, gulfs, sounds, and inlets where fresh \nwater meets and mixes with salt water from the ocean, provide some of \nthe most ecologically and economically productive habitat in the world. \nThey benefit our economy, they benefit our health, in short, they are \ngood for the soul.\n\n  More than 75 percent of the commercial fish and shellfish harvested \nin the United States depend on estuaries at some stage in their \nlifecycle. Estuaries are also home to a large percentage of the \nNation's endangered and threatened species and half of its neotropical \nmigratory birds. Moreover, the livelihood of 28 million Americans \ndepends on estuaries and coastal regions.\n  Regrettably, estuaries are in danger. Within the last 30 years, \ncoastal regions have become home to more than half of the Nation's \npopulation. This population explosion has taken its toll. Fish catches \nare at their lowest, shellfish beds have been closed, and the economic \nlivelihood and quality of life of our coastal communities is \nthreatened.\n  The increase in nonpoint source pollution, such as agricultural \nrunoff, also has made its mark. And in the Chesapeake Bay, the recent \npfiesteria outbreak that has killed hundreds of fish and even harmed \nhuman health is an unfortunate example of what can happen when the \nbalance between harmful nutrients that pollute the waters take over.\n  The habitats estuaries provide for an extraordinary diversity of fish \nand wildlife are shrinking fast, jeopardizing jobs in fishing and \ntourism. The many values that estuaries bring to our lives could one \nday be gone.\n  The future of estuary habitat need not be a gloomy one. Estuaries can \nbe restored. A variety of efforts, ranging from school classrooms \nplanting eel grass in a coastal inlet to the restoration of freshwater \nflows into an entire bay area, have brought estuaries back to life. The \ndemands on Federal funding for estuary restoration activities exceed \navailable resources. We therefore must make the most of limited public \nresources by enlisting the support of our States, communities, and the \nprivate sector.\n  The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1997 will help \nrebuild these national treasures by focusing these limited resources on \nthe restoration of vital estuary habitat. This bill is unique, in that \nit builds a renewed commitment to community-driven restoration. It is \nnot a regulatory measure. Rather than provide mandates, it provides \nincentives and gives concerned citizens more of an opportunity to get \ninvolved in the effort.\n  Also, it is flexible. Every community's approach to restoring \nestuaries will vary depending upon the unique needs of the particular \narea. What works well in Rhode Island's waters may not work in a more \ntemperate areas like coastal California and Louisiana.\n  The bill also creates strong and lasting partnerships between the \npublic and private sectors, and among all levels of government. It \nbrings together existing Federal, State, and local restoration plans, \nprograms, and studies. To ensure that restoration efforts build on past \nsuccesses and current scientific understanding, the bill encourages the \ndevelopment of monitoring and maintenance capabilities.\n  Above all, this bill will benefit the environment, the economy, and \nthe quality of life of the Nation. Estuaries are ecologically unique. \nThe complex variety of habitats--river deltas, sea grass meadows, \nforested wetlands, shellfish beds, marshes, and beaches--supports a \nfluorishing range of wildlife and plants. Because fish and birds \nmigrate, the health of these habitats is intertwined with the health of \nother ecosystems thousands of miles away. Estuaries also are perhaps \nthe most prolific places on Earth.\n  Economically, this bill will benefit those Americans whose \nlivelihoods depend on coastal areas. The commercial fishing industry, \nwhich depends heavily on these areas, contributes $111 billion per year \nto the national economy. Tourism and recreation also stand to benefit.\n  Finally, estuaries are essential to our quality of life. Listen to \nthis figure: In 1993, 180 million Americans, approximately 70 percent \nof the population, visited estuaries to fish, swim, hunt, dive, view \nwildlife, hike, and learn.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important effort to restore the \nmarshes, wetland and aquatic life that nourish our fish and wildlife, \nenhance water quality, control floods, and provide so many lasting \nbenefits for the Nation. Before I conclude, I want to thank my \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, for all of his help on this \nissue. I also want to give a special thanks to Restore America's \nEstuaries and to Rhode Island Save the Bay for all of their hard work, \nwithout which this effort would not have been possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n          Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1997\n\n\n                          Sec. 1.--Short Title\n\n       This section designates the title of the bill as the \n     ``Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1997''.\n\n\n                           Sec. 2.--Findings\n\n       This section cites Congress' findings on the ecological and \n     economic value of estuaries.\n\n\n                           Sec. 3.--Purposes\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to: provide a voluntary, \n     community-driven, incentive-based program to catalyze the \n     restoration of one million acres of estuary habitat by the \n     year 2010; assure the coordination and leveraging of existing \n     Federal, State and local restoration programs, plans and \n     studies; create effective restoration partnerships among \n     public agencies at all levels of government, and between the \n     public and private sectors; promote the efficient financing \n     of estuary habitat restoration activities to help leverage \n     limited federal funding; and develop monitoring and \n     maintenance capabilities to assure that restoration efforts \n     build on the successes of past, current efforts, and sound \n     science.\n\n\n                          Sec. 4.--Definitions\n\n       This section defines several terms used throughout the Act. \n     Among the most important definitions:\n       ``Estuary'' is defined as a body of water and its \n     associated physical, biological and chemical elements, in \n     which fresh water from a river or stream meets and mixes with \n     salt water from the ocean.\n       ``Habitat'' is defined as the complex of physical and \n     hydrologic features and living organisms within estuaries and \n     their associated ecosystems, including salt and fresh water \n     coastal marshes, coastal forested wetlands and other coastal \n     wetlands, tidal flats, natural shoreline areas, shellfish \n     beds, sea grass meadows, kelp beds, river deltas, and river \n     and stream banks under tidal influence.\n       ``Restoration'' is defined as an activity that results in \n     improving an estuary's habitat, including both physical and \n     functional restoration, with a goal towards a self-\n     sustaining, ecologically based system that is integrated with \n     its surrounding landscape.\n\n\n           Sec. 5.--Establishment of a Collaborative Council\n\n       This section establishes a Collaborative Council chaired by \n     the Secretary of the Army; with the participation of the \n     Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, Department of \n     Commerce; the Secretary of the Interior, through the U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service; the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency; and the Secretaries of \n     Agriculture and Transportation. It sets forth the decision \n     making procedures to be followed by the Council in its two \n     principal functions, which are: (1) the development of a \n     habitat restoration strategy and (2) the selection of habitat \n     restoration projects.\n\n\n            Sec. 6.--Functions of the Collaborative Council\n\n       This section creates a process to coordinate, streamline \n     and leverage existing Federal, State and local resources and \n     activities directed toward estuary habitat restoration.\n       Habitat Restoration Strategy.--The Council is required to \n     draft a strategy to provide a national framework for estuary \n     habitat restoration by identifying existing restoration \n     plans, integrating overlapping restoration plans, and \n     identifying appropriate processes for the development of \n     restoration plans, where needed. In developing the strategy, \n     the Council shall consider: the contribution of estuary \n     habitat to wildlife, fish and shellfish, surface and ground \n     water quantity and\n\n[[Page S9976]]\n\n     quality, flood control, outdoor recreation, and other areas \n     of concern; estimated historic, current, and future losses of \n     estuary habitat; the most appropriate method for selecting \n     estuary restoration projects; and procedures to minimize \n     duplicative application requirements for landowners seeking \n     assistance for habitat restoration activities.\n       Selection of Projects.--The Council is required to \n     establish application criteria for restoration projects based \n     on a number of criteria, including: the level of support from \n     non-Federal persons for the development and long-term \n     maintenance and monitoring of the project; whether the \n     project criteria fall within the habitat restoration strategy \n     developed by the Council and are set forth in existing \n     estuary habitat restoration plans; whether the State has a \n     dedicated fund for estuary restoration; the level of private \n     funding for the restoration project; and the technical merit \n     and feasibility of the proposal.\n       Priority Projects.--Among the projects that meet the \n     criteria listed above, the Council shall give priority for \n     funding to those projects that: are part of an approved \n     Federal estuary management or habitat restoration plan; \n     address a restoration goal outlined in the habitat \n     restoration strategy; have a non-Federal share that exceeds \n     50 percent; and are subject to a nonpoint source program that \n     addresses upstream sources that would otherwise re-impair the \n     restored habitat.\n       The Council may not select a project under this section \n     until each non-Federal interest participating in the project \n     has entered into a written cooperation agreement to provide \n     for the maintenance and monitoring of the proposed project. \n     This section authorizes $4,000,000 for the operating expenses \n     of the Council.\n\n\n           Sec. 7.--Habitat Restoration Project Cost-Sharing\n\n       This section strengthens local and private-sector \n     participation in estuary restoration efforts by building \n     public-private restoration partnerships. It establishes a \n     non-Federal share match requirement of no less than 35 \n     percent but no more than 75 percent of the cost of a project. \n     A project applicant may waive the 35 percent minimum \n     requirement; however, if the applicant demonstrates a need \n     for a reduced non-Federal share in accordance with the \n     requirements of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. \n     Land easements, services, or other in-kind contributions may \n     be used to meet the Act's non-Federal match requirements.\n\n\n  Sec. 8.--Monitoring and Maintenance of Habitat Restoration Projects\n\n       This section assures that available information will be \n     used to improve the methods for assuring successful long-term \n     habitat restoration. To that end, it requires the Under \n     Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere (NOAA) to maintain a \n     database of restoration projects carried out under this Act, \n     including information on project techniques, project \n     completion, monitoring data, and other relevant information.\n       This section also requires the Collaborative Council to \n     publish a biennial report to Congress that includes program \n     activities, including the number of acres restored; the \n     percent of restored habitat monitored under a plan; the types \n     of restoration methods employed; the activities of \n     governmental and non-governmental entities with respect to \n     habitat restoration; and the effectiveness of the \n     restoration.\n\n\n                  Sec. 9.--Memoranda of Understanding\n\n       This section authorizes the Council to enter into \n     cooperative agreements and execute memoranda of understanding \n     with Federal and State agencies, private institutions, and \n     Indian tribes, as necessary to carry out the requirements of \n     this Act.\n\n\n   Sec. 10.--Distribution of Appropriations for Habitat Restoration \n                                Projects\n\n       This section authorizes the Secretary to disburse funds to \n     the other agencies responsible for carrying out the \n     requirements of this Act.\n\n\n                        Sec. 11.--Authorizations\n\n       This section provides that funds currently authorized to be \n     appropriated for the Corps of Engineers for land acquisition, \n     environmental improvements and aquatic ecosystem restoration \n     may be used to implement habitat restoration projects \n     selected by the Council. This section also authorizes \n     appropriations of $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1999; \n     $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2000; and $75,000,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 2001 through 2003 to carry out this Act.\n\n\n                      Sec. 12.--General Provisions\n\n       This section provides the Secretary with the authority to \n     carry out responsibilities under this Act, and it clarifies \n     that habitat restoration is one of the Corps' primary \n     missions. It further clarifies that nothing in this Act \n     supersedes existing Federal or State laws, and that agencies \n     are required to carry out activities in a manner consistent \n     with the provisions of this Act and other existing laws.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator John Chafee, chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, to introduce legislation to \nrestore America's estuaries. Our bill is entitled the ``Estuary Habitat \nRestoration Partnership Act of 1997''.\n  Estuaries are a national resource and treasure. As a nation, \ntherefore, we should work together at all levels and in all sectors to \nhelp restore them.\n  I am also pleased that 15 other Senators have joined with Senator \nChafee and me as original cosponsors of the bill. Together, we want to \ndraw attention to the significant value of the Nation's estuaries and \nthe need to restore them.\n  It is also my distinct pleasure today to say with pride that \nLouisianians have been in the forefront of this movement to recognize \nthe importance of estuaries and to propose legislation to restore them. \nThe Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, an organization which is \nwell known for its proactive work on behalf of the Louisiana coast, has \nbeen from the inception an integral part of the national coalition, \nRestore America's Estuaries, which has proposed and supports the \nrestoration legislation.\n  The Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana and Restore America's \nEstuaries are to be commended for their leadership and initiative in \nbringing this issue to the Nation's attention.\n  In essence, the bill introduced today proposes a single goal and has \none emphasis and focus. It seeks to create a voluntary, community-\ndriven, incentive-based program which builds partnerships between the \nFederal Government, State, and local governments and the private sector \nto restore estuaries, including sharing in the cost of restoration \nprojects.\n  In Louisiana, we have very valuable estuaries, including the \nPonchartrain, Barataria-Terrebonne, and Vermilion Bay systems. \nLouisiana's estuaries are vital because they have helped and will \ncontinue to help sustain local communities, their cultures and their \neconomies.\n  I encourage Senators from coastal and noncoastal States alike to \nevaluate the bill and to join in its support with Senator Chafee, me \nand the 15 other Senators who are original bill cosponsors.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Chafee and other Senators on \nbehalf of the bill and with the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana \nand Restore America's Estuaries.\n  By working together at all levels of government and in the private \nand public sectors, we can help to restore estuaries. As important, we \ncan, together, help to educate the public about the important roles \nwhich estuaries play in our daily lives through their many \ncontributions to public safety and well-being, to

Res. 127\n\n       Whereas the President of the People's Republic of China is \n     tentatively scheduled to begin a state visit in Washington, \n     D.C., on October 29, 1997;\n       Whereas a state visit, unlike a working-level visit, \n     involve the highest-level protocol that can be afforded a \n     foreign head of state;\n       Whereas on December 13, 1995, a Beijing court sentenced Wei \n     Jingsheng to 14 years in prison for peacefully advocating \n     democracy and political reforms in China.\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     had previously imprisoned Wei Jingsheng from 1979 to 1993, \n     also for peacefully promoting human rights and democracy in \n     China;\n       Whereas Wei Jingsheng is just one of hundreds, if not \n     thousands, of other political, religious, and labor \n     dissidents who are imprisoned in China and Tibet for \n     peacefully expressing their beliefs and exercising their \n     internationally recognized rights of free association and \n     expression.\n       Whereas like other prisoners, Wei Jingsheng is in poor \n     health and Chinese authorities refuse to provide him with \n     proper medical care; and\n       Whereas the Department of State 1996 Human Rights Report \n     states: ``[t]he Government [of the People's Republic of \n     China] continued to commit widespread and well-documented \n     human rights abuses, in violation of international accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should not host a state visit by the President of \n     the People's Republic of China until--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     immediately and unconditionally releases Wei Jingsheng, Wang \n     Dan, and a significant number of other prisoners of \n     conscience held in prison in China and Tibet;\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China takes \n     immediate steps toward improving the conditions under which \n     political, religious, and labor dissidents are imprisoned in \n     China and Tibet, including providing prisoners with adequate \n     medical care and allowing international humanitarian agencies \n     access to detention facilities; and\n       (3) the Government of the People's Republic of China makes \n     significant progress toward improving overall human rights \n     conditions in China and Tibet, including taking concrete \n     steps to grant freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and \n     freedom of association in compliance with international human \n     rights standards.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nregarding the upcoming State visit by the President of the People's \nRepublic of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin.\n  As we all know, President Clinton plans to host Mr. Jiang on a State \nvisit to Washington at the end of October. The resolution I am offering \ntoday is a sense of the Senate resolution that states that President \nJiang should not be given a red carpet welcome in our Nation's Capital \nuntil we see some progress on human rights in China. Specifically, the \nresolution calls for China to release Wei Jingsheng and other prisoners \nof conscience from jail as a precondition for a State visit.\n  By agreeing to this State visit without receiving any concession on \nhuman rights, the administration may be squandering perhaps its \nstrongest source of leverage with Beijing. The Chinese Government has \nbeen pressing for such a visit in Washington for several years. The \nChinese want to be treated like a great power. An invitation to the \nWhite House not only bestows legitimacy on the Communist regime, it \nwill boost the prestige of President Jiang and help him to solidify his \nposition as Deng Xiaoping's successor. In short, China needs this State \nvisit more than the United States does.\n  Agreeing to invite the President of China to the White House before \nany improvement is made on human rights will send a terrible message. \nIt will confirm what many Chinese leaders already believe--that the \nUnited States offers lots of rhetoric on human rights, but no action, \nand that the United States ultimately cares more about trade than \npolitical prisoners.\n  Judging by the administration's China policy, it is easy to see why \nthe leadership in Beijing would come to such a conclusion. In 1994, the \nPresident delinked most-favored-nation trade status from human rights. \nThis was a serious mistake. What we have seen since the delinkage is \nthe reincarceration of political dissidents and increased repression in \nTibet.\n  Just this past April, at the meeting of the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission, the United States mounted what I view as a half-hearted \nattempt to win passage of a resolution critical of China's human rights \nrecord. As we all know, that resolution failed to pass, and some of our \nclose allies--including France,\n\n[[Page S9978]]\n\nGermany, and Canada--refused to cosponsor it. Finally, just this past \nJune, the President once again unconditionally extended MFN to China \nfor one more year.\n  Now, the administration is preparing to give Jiang Zemin a red carpet \nwelcome in Washington despite the deplorable human rights conditions in \nChina. Why wouldn't Chinese leaders conclude that, in the final \nanalysis, the United States is unwilling to back up its human rights \nconcerns with concrete action?\n  What we have then is not a policy of constructive engagement but one \nof unconditional engagement.\n  An invitation to the White House is meant to symbolize a relationship \nof close cooperation. But the United States simply does not have such a \nrelationship with China. On security issues, China has sold sensitive \nnuclear and missile technologies to countries like Pakistan and Iran. \nThe People's Republic of China last year fired missiles toward Taiwan \nin an attempt to disrupt the island's first democratic Presidential \nelection. China has blatantly violated agreements on copyrights and \nintellectual property. And, as I have stated, China has made little, if \nany, attempt to improve its human rights conditions.\n  Now the administration is rewarding this lack of cooperation by \nhosting high-level visits by Chinese officials. Last December, the \nadministration welcomed China's Defense Minister, Gen. Chi Haotian, to \nWashington. Mr. Chi, also known as the butcher of Beijing, was one of \nthe People's Liberation Army officers who led the military assault \nagainst the citizens of the Chinese capital on June 4, 1989. Now, the \nadministration wants to invite the President of China for a State \nvisit, even though the Government of China--in the spirit of the \nTiananmen Square massacre--continues to persecute anyone who dares \ncriticize the Communist regime. Just this week, China's Justice \nMinister ruled out granting medical parole to pro-democracy dissident \nWang Dan despite pleas from Wang's family, who say he is seriously ill.\n  When Jiang Zemin is given a 21-gun salute at the White House, the \nUnited States will lose what little credibility we have left on the \nissue of human rights.\n  Mr. President, this resolution simply calls on the administration to \nhold off on a State visit until China releases Wei Jingsheng and other \npolitical prisoners. This resolution focuses on Wei Jingsheng, but only \nas a symbol of the thousands of people who are rotting in Chinese jail \ncells or toiling in labor camps because they dared to peacefully \nexpress their political or religious beliefs.\n  Wei Jingsheng may be the most famous Chinese dissident, but we should \nnever forget that there are many more like him, people whose names we \nmay not know, but who nevertheless show the same type of courage. This \nresolution calls for the release of a significant number of political \nand religious prisoners in addition to Wei. China must know that the \nrelease of one or two high-profile dissidents is not enough.\n  In addition to demanding the release of political prisoners, the \nresolution also calls on China to give prisoners access to medical \ncare, and to take concrete steps towards improving overall human rights \nconditions in China and Tibet.\n  These are realistic demands. This resolution does not say China must \nchange its political system or withdraw from Tibet, events that are \nunlikely to take place before next month. This resolution only states \nthat, in order to create the right atmosphere for a State visit, China \nmust make a good-faith effort to improve human rights.\n  I should also point out that this resolution only applies to a State-\nlevel visit. The State Department's protocol office tells me there are \nseveral levels of visits including private visits, working visits, \nofficial visits, and finally, at the highest level, State visits. My \ngoal in introducing this resolution is not to cut off all dialog \nbetween the United States and China. I would not necessarily object to \nhaving Mr. Jiang come to Washington for a working-level visit. But I \nfeel the pomp and symbolism of a State-level visit is inappropriate \ngiven the present situation in China.\n  Oviously, China will object to this resolution, but it contains a \nmessage that Beijing must hear. China's leaders have unfortunately \ninterpreted the inability of Congress to reach a consensus on China's \nmost-favored-nation status as evidence that Members of Congress do not \nreally care about human rights. But I assure you, Mr. President, that \neven though many of my colleagues have different views on the MFN \nissue, all share my concern for the plight of people like Wei \nJingsheng.\n  China wants to be treated as a great power, but it does not want to \naccept the responsibilities that come with the role. It does not want \nto fulfill its treaty obligations nor abide by the international \nconventions--including those on human rights--that it has signed. This \nresolution sends a clear message that if the United States is to treat \nChina like a great power, then China must comply with international \nhuman rights standards.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time for the United States to end its \npolicy of unconditional engagement and put human rights and trade on an \nequal footing in our China policy.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9977-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE CELLULAR TELEPHONE PROTECTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HATCH AMENDMENT NO. 1251\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HATCH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 493) to amend section 1029 of title 18, United States \nCode, with respect to cellular telephone cloning paraphernalia; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 6, line 1, strike ``The punishment'' and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) In general.--The punishment''.\n       On page 6, line 2, strike ``section''.\n       On page 6, line 3, strike ``(1)'' and insert ``(A)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 7, strike ``(A)'' and insert ``(i)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 11, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(ii)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 14, strike ``and''.\n       On page 6, line 15, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(B)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 19, strike the punctuation at the end and \n     insert ``; and''.\n       On page 6, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       ``(C) in any case, in addition to any other punishment \n     imposed or any other forfeiture required by law, forfeiture \n     to the United States of any personal property used or \n     intended to be used to commit, facilitate, or promote the \n     commission of the offense.\n       ``(2) Applicable procedure.--The criminal forfeiture of \n     personal property subject to forfeiture under paragraph \n     (1)(C), any seizure and disposition thereof, and any \n     administrative or judicial proceeding in relation thereto, \n     shall be governed by subsections (c) and (e) through (p) of \n     section 413 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     853).''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9978-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9978-S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1252\n\n  Mr. Graham (for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Kennedy) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 1156) making appropriations for the \ngovernment of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \nin whole or in part against the revenues of said District for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC.  .

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncareer of\n\n[[Page S9981]]\n\nDon Gordon, an outstanding newspaperman, who has retired after a \ndistinguished career in journalism. Don served the western Kentucky \narea for 8 years as editorial editor for the Paducah Sun.\n  Don was born in Overland, MO, and upon graduating high school, served \nhis country in the navy during the Korean war. In 1959, he graduated \nfrom the University of Missouri with a degree in journalism and has \nworked for newspapers ever since. Don has been a reporter, city editor, \ncopy editor, and managing editor and has worked for newspapers in \nMissouri, Illinois, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, before coming to \nKentucky. He and his wife, Zona, moved to Paducah in 1989, to return to \na part of the country they love.\n  Don's interest in writing began at a very early age, and during his \nschool days he was involved in printing neighborhood news and sports \nsheets. In the years when Don first became a professional journalist, \nit was very rare for a reporter to be credited with a byline. However, \na series of articles Don wrote covering a murder trial so impressed one \nof his first editors, that he was given a byline for his good work. \nThis was only to be the first of many instances in which Don's work was \nto be recognized by his peers. While reluctant to mention such things, \nhe has won awards for best editorial from the Kentucky Press \nAssociation and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for journalism.\n  ``Excellence'' is the word that best describes Don's work. Day after \nday, he consistently brought public issues into perspective by \ncombining a mastery of the written language and knowledge of a variety \nof subjects, both local and national. He was a newspaperman's \nnewspaperman.\n  Retirement in Don's case does not mean that he will be inactive. \nAfter 41 years of marriage, he and Zona will now have the opportunity \nto travel. The West and Alaska beckon. The couple also looks forward to \nserving as volunteer missionaries. They are active in Trinity Baptist \nChurch, and have been involved in the Gideon Bible Society, and served \nin jail and prison ministries.\n  Mr. President, I commend Don Gordon for his outstanding service to \nwestern Kentucky. He will be missed by friends and coworkers, and just \nas importantly, by his many devoted readers. I ask that you and my \nfellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding \nKentuckian, and wishing him well in all future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9980-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE GARTNER GROUP, THE NEW YORK FEDERAL RESERVE BANK, AND DEUTSCHE \n    MORGAN GRENFELL AGREE: POTENTIAL FOR A ``MILD GLOBAL RECESSIO''\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we learn today in the New York \nTimes that an alarming number of companies and governments are failing \nto cope with the impending year 2000 computer crisis.\n  A study by the respected Gartner Group, which specializes on \ninformation technology, indicates that fully ``30 percent of companies \nworldwide had not started addressing the year 2000 problem,'' and that \nof those ``88 percent were smaller companies.'' This is most troubling \nnews. Failure to comply could lead, in the opinion of William J. \nMcDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to a \nglobal recession.\n  Analysts are also predicting that many companies will go out of \nbusiness when their computer systems fail at the turn of the century. \nAgain I quote the Times article: ``Edward Yardeni, the chief economist \nat Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, issued a report last week saying that \nthere is a 35-percent chance that the millennium bug will cause `at \nleast a mild global recession' in 2000.''\n  My first day bill, S. 22, would establish an independent commission, \nmore like a task force, to ensure that the Federal Government will be \ncompliant, and to ensure that awareness and compliance will be raised \nin the private sector.\n  I ask that the article from today's Times, ``Many Reported Unready To \nFace Year 2000 Bug,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 25, 1997]\n\n              Many Reported Unready To Face Year 2000 Bug\n\n                        (By Laurence Zuckerman)\n\n       A new study shows that a large proportion of businesses and \n     government agencies around the world are not properly \n     preparing for the effect that the year 2000 will have on \n     their computer systems, increasing the possibility of \n     potentially serious disruptions as the end of the century \n     approaches.\n       The study by the Gartner Group, an adviser on information \n     technology, found that 30 percent of companies worldwide had \n     not started addressing the year 2000 problem, or the \n     millennium bug, as it is often called. Of these, 88 percent \n     were smaller companies with fewer than 2,000 employees.\n       ``We are going to see a very large number of small \n     companies in very serious trouble,'' said Matthew Hotle, an \n     analyst at Gartner, which is based in Stamford, Conn. ``They \n     are not going to finish in time.''\n       The research also showed that large institutions, like \n     universities and hospitals, and Government agencies, were far \n     behind in their efforts. ``We were expecting that some \n     agencies would have at least made up some ground over the \n     last six to nine months,'' Mr. Hotle added, ``but they are \n     way behind.''\n       The study, which is scheduled to be issued next month at an \n     annual Gartner Group symposium, comes at a time when concern \n     is rising about the potential impact of the millennium bug. \n     Last week, Representative Steve Horn of California, the \n     Republican chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees \n     information technology issues, graded the preparation efforts \n     of 24 Government agencies. Eleven received either D's or F's, \n     including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \n     the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     and the Department of Transportation.\n       In addition, some prominent economists and William J. \n     McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve \n     Bank, have warned that failure to cope with the 2000 problem \n     properly could cause a global recession.\n       The millennium bug dates back to the dawn of the computer \n     age, when computer memory was so scarce that programmers \n     abbreviated the year as two digits. A computer that read \n     ``97'' as a date assumed it meant 1997. After the turn of the \n     century, those same programs, unless corrected, will read \n     ``00'' as 1900, disrupting everything from the calculation of \n     interest rates to the shelf life of breakfast cereal. Because \n     the two-digit dates appear in different forms in different \n     software, finding and correcting each program is extremely \n     time consuming and labor intensive.\n       The Gartner Group has said in the past that fixing existing \n     computer software will cost between $300 billion and $600 \n     billion, an estimate that has not been increased as a result \n     of the study. Mr. Hotle said that other estimates, including \n     the costs of new hardware, business interruptions and \n     potential litigation, could push the figure over $1 trillion.\n       The study surveyed 2,300 companies, institutions and \n     government agencies in 17 countries. Each was given a rating \n     based on their progress. The results show that most large \n     companies are already well along in their efforts to cope \n     with the millennium bug, led by the financial services \n     industry. Though only 52 percent of companies with more than \n     20,000 employees were considered well positioned, the figure \n     was nearly 80 percent in the United States.\n       The problem is that many large companies are becoming \n     increasingly dependent on smaller suppliers that may not be \n     as well prepared. For example, if a crucial parts supplier \n     cannot deliver to a big auto maker, it will not matter that \n     the auto company is year-2000 compliant.\n       ``You are going to see some major slowdowns because of \n     these small companies,'' said Lou Marcoccio, research \n     director of Gartner's year 2000 practice.\n       Some analysts have also predicted that a number of \n     companies, already teetering on the edge, will go out of \n     business when their computer systems fail as a result of the \n     bug. Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Morgan \n     Grenfell, issued a report last week saying that there is a 35 \n     percent chance that the millennium bug will cause ``at least \n     a mild global recession'' in 2000.\n       While the Federal Government has come under criticism in \n     Congress, the Gartner study found that the United States is \n     far ahead of other countries. Last week, the Office of \n     Management and Budget sent a report to Congress predicting \n     that the cost of fixing the Government's computers would be \n     $3.8 billion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9981-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9981-S9982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MAJ. GEN. RAY E. McCOY, USA\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Maj. Gen. \nRay E. McCoy, USA, upon his retirement from the United States Army \nafter more than 32 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our \nNation.\n  Major General McCoy, a native son of the Oklahoma farmland, graduated \nin 1965 from Oklahoma State University, where he received the \nprestigious Drummond Saber Award as the year's outstanding ROTC \ngraduate. That honor was the harbinger of an extraordinary military \ncareer.\n\n[[Page S9982]]\n\n  After completing Infantry School and Ranger training, Ray McCoy \nserved in a variety of combat and command assignments stateside and \noverseas, including two tours in Vietnam and one in Korea. In the \noperations theater, his abiding concern for his charges, his roll-up-\nyour-sleeves approach to getting the mission done, and his tempered-\nsteel military bearing earned him the respect of all who soldiered with \nand for him.\n  As his career progressed, he served in a number of high-level staff \npositions at the Department of the Army, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nArmy Material Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency [DLA] America's \ncombat support agency. For the past 2 years, Major General McCoy has \nserved as DLA's Principal Deputy Director. His vision and leadership \nwere vital to the agency's business-process reengineering, which \nincorporated the best public and private sector practices. These \ninitiatives elevated material readiness and strengthened the management \nand oversight of Defense contracts--and at markedly reduced cost to the \ntaxpayers and the warfighters. Blending combat experience with business \nacumen, Ray McCoy was instrumental in the agency's successful efforts \nto accelerate logistics response and improve weapons-systems readiness. \nWith Major General McCoy having led the charge, DLA is now a front line \npartner with combat and contingency operations forces in Bosnia and \naround the world.\n  Whether it was on the rough terrain of the combat theater or behind a \ndesk, Ray McCoy served his country with valor, loyalty, and integrity. \nWith the physical stature of a sturdy oak and the energy of a \nsouthwestern tornado, Ray McCoy demonstrates time and time again that \nhe truly deserves to be called a soldier's soldier. On the occasion of \nhis retirement from the U.S. Army, I offer my congratulations and \nthanks to this esteemed son of the Sooner State, and wish him well in \nhis future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9981-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL CENTER FOR RURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

I \nalso look forward to working with Senators Hatch, Biden, and others in \nintroducing legislation in the Senate in support of a National Center \nfor Rural Law Enforcement.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n       Whereas, the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police \n     support the National Center for: Rural Law Enforcement as \n     several chiefs have attended regional conferences to discuss \n     and identify the training and technical assistance needs of \n     rural law enforcement agencies nationwide; and\n       Whereas, more than two hundred law enforcement officials, \n     from rural areas, have attended these regional meetings and \n     validated the need for federal assistance in areas of \n     technical assistance, management training, and the formation \n     of an information clearinghouse for rural law enforcement \n     agencies; and\n       Whereas, the majority of existing local, state, and federal \n     programs are too costly for small rural enforcement agencies \n     and are generally designed to serve the larger law \n     enforcement agencies of the country; and\n       Whereas, approximately one-third of all Americans live in \n     rural areas, ninety percent of all law enforcement agencies \n     serve populations of less than 25,000 residents, seventy-five \n     percent of all law enforcement agencies serve a population of \n     fewer than 10,000 residents, while rural violent crime has \n     increased over thirty-five per cent in the last ten years; \n     and\n       Whereas, rural law enforcement agencies have staffing \n     limitations and financial limitations which make it difficult \n     to properly train on and/or address the specific crime-\n     related issues facing all rural law enforcement \n     administrators in our country; and\n       Whereas, we believe that the creation of a national center \n     for rural law enforcement would enhance and complement \n     present state standards and training and does not duplicate \n     any existing program; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police \n     strongly support the creation of the National Center for \n     Rural Law Enforcement that would be funded through federal \n     legislation;\n       Be it further resolved, That the operational control and \n     oversight of the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement \n     would rest upon an advisory board made up primarily of \n     Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police from rural law enforcement \n     agencies from each region of the county.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9982-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COL. RYSZARD KUKLINSKI\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the work \nof an unsung hero, a man whose unparalleled sense of duty to a free and \ndemocratic Poland contributed immeasurably not only to that country's \nfreedom from Soviet domination but also to the security of the United \nStates. I refer to Col. Ryszard Kuklinski.\n  You see, during the height of the cold war, when NATO and Soviet-led \nWarsaw Pact forces confronted each other in a divided Europe, Colonel \nKuklinski risked his life to help free Poland from foreign oppression.\n  This risk came in the form of over 35,000 pages of secret military \ndocuments he turned over to the United States Government, documents \nthat detailed Soviet operational plans for surprise attacks on Western \nEurope, scenarios for a nuclear launch, specifications for more than \n200 advanced Soviet weapons systems, and details of Soviet plans to \nimpose Marshal law on Poland. His information was an invaluable asset \nto the West, and contributed immensely to the alliance's success in \ndeterring Soviet aggression in Europe.\n  Colonel Kuklinski asked for nothing in return for his information. \nInstead, he was forced to flee his country with his family when his \nactions were discovered by Soviet authorities sometime in 1981.\n  After the Warsaw Pact realized what had happened after his departure \nfrom Poland, Colonel Kuklinski was issued in absentia a death sentence \nby a military tribunal.\n  On Monday, the Polish Government--the government of a free and \ndemocratic Poland--took the step of dropping espionage charges against \nthis hero and formally recognized that his actions served the highest \ninterests of Poland. I commend the Polish Government and its military \nfor taking this much needed step.\n  I decided to raise the heroic story of Colonel Kuklinski for two \nreasons. First, to thank him and to express my admiration for the \nsacrifices he made for a free and democratic Poland. Second, as the \nSenate will soon be considering Poland's application for NATO \nmembership, it is important to remember that Poland is not a former \nfoe, but was once a captive nation whose people were ready to risk \nanything in order for their country to be free and to be full member of \nthe transatlantic community of democracies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9982-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9982-S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n MR. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend President \nClinton for submitting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate \nfor its advice and consent.\n  This treaty represents decades of work by eight administrations.\n  Now it is time for the Senate to do its job and ratify the CTBT at \nthe earliest possible date.\n  Just as the United States was a leader in the development of nuclear \nweapons, the U.S. has also led the drive to limit nuclear testing. On \nJune 10, 1963, President John F. Kennedy made an historic address at \nAmerican University during which he announced that the U.S. and the \nSoviet Union would begin negotiations on a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty.\n  President Kennedy said, ``The conclusion of such a treaty, so near \nand yet so far, would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most \ndangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to \ndeal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces \nin 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms.''\n  In the years since President Kennedy made those remarks, the world \nhas witnessed the end of the Cold War, and the spiraling arms race he \nspoke of has come to an end.\n  But the spread of nuclear weapons is still as great a hazard in 1997 \nas it was in 1963. President Kennedy saw then that banning nuclear \ntesting was an important step in curbing the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Now, 34 years after President Kennedy's speech and 52 years after the \nfirst nuclear test, we are finally on the verge of ending all nuclear \nexplosions, including those underground.\n  I fully agree with President Clinton, who--in announcing the action \non this\n\n[[Page S9983]]\n\ntreaty in front of the United Nations General Assembly earlier this \nweek--proclaimed the CTBT as the ``longest-sought, hardest-fought prize \nin the history of arms control.''\n  I think President Bush and President Clinton deserve a great deal of \ncredit for making the final push to achieve a total test ban.\n  In 1992, President Bush decided to place a unilateral moratorium on \nnuclear tests. President Clinton then extended the moratorium until a \ncomprehensive test ban could be negotiated with the other nuclear \npowers.\n  The leadership shown by President Bush and President Clinton created \nthe momentum that led to the passage of the CTBT in the United Nations \nlast year. Had the United States not taken the initiative to halt its \nnuclear testing first, I doubt that the Senate would have a test ban \ntreaty to consider.\n  It is critical that the United States not shirk its leadership role \nnow that the CTBT is so close to going into effect. Already, eight \nstates have ratified the CTBT including Japan, which ratified the \ntreaty this past July, and, most recently, the Czech Republic on the \n8th of this month.\n  But obviously the CTBT will be meaningless unless the five major \nnuclear powers ratify it. Here is where the United States can once \nagain be at the front of the line. The United States has, after all, \nconducted the lion's share of nuclear tests in the last 50 years--1,030 \nin all, compared to 715 by the Soviet Union; 45 by the United Kingdom; \n210 by France and 45 by China.\n  But perhaps the greatest challenge to this treaty will be getting the \nundeclared nuclear powers on board. India and Pakistan have not signed \nthe CTBT and their absence endangers the entire treaty. As two \ncountries who have been in conflict with each other since becoming \nindependent nations, India and Pakistan may have the most to gain from \na ban on nuclear tests.\n  The United States, along with each of the 145 other nations who have \nsigned the treaty, need to work together to convince India of the \nwisdom of the comprehensive test ban. India should realize that the \nCTBT is just another step towards complete nuclear disarmament. \nIslamabad [iz-LAHM-ah-BAHD] indicates that once India agrees to the \nCTBT, Pakistan would also sign. This is an historic opportunity to help \nfacilitate peace in Asia--one that the United States should not miss.\n  North Korea is another holdout.\n  But, unlike Pakistan and India, the North Koreans have yet to show a \ntrue commitment to greater integration in the international system. \nMany intelligence analysts from both the United States and South Korea \nbelieve that North Korea may already possess a crude nuclear device.\n  Hopefully, one day, even North Korea will bend to international \npressure and accept a test ban.\n  Despite what critics of the CTBT might say, the treaty is \nenforceable.\n  Nuclear explosions of any substantial size are very difficult to \nhide. This treaty will establish an international monitoring system \nthat incorporates seismological, infrasound, and other technologies. \nState-of-the-art seismological sensors can detect blasts as small as \none kiloton anywhere in the world.\n\n  But the treaty also includes provisions for on-site monitoring so \ninspectors can visit test sights quickly if there is any suspicion that \na nuclear blast has occurred.\n  Events of the last month have illustrated how important it is to have \na well-monitored CTBT. On August 16, seismologists detected evidence \nthat Russia may have exploded a nuclear device at its test site in the \nArctic. However, there is evidence to back Moscow's claim that the \nseismic activity was the result of an underwater earthquake, rather \nthan a nuclear test.\n  The monitoring regime that the CTBT will establish will make it much \neasier to investigate such incidents and will reduce mutual suspicion \nbetween the nuclear powers.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is indeed something that will \nenhance the security of the United States. In addition to making the \nnuclear programs of China and Russia more transparent, the test ban \nwill make it significantly more difficult for rogue states like Iran or \nIraq to complete development of their own nuclear weapons.\n  As a complement to the CTBT, the United States and the other nuclear \npowers should do all they can to ensure that threshold countries do not \nhave access to advanced technology--such as high-speed computer \nmodeling--that would help them to develop reliable weapons without \nactually conducting nuclear tests.\n  Mr. President, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is now in our hands \nand it is up to the Senate to act.\n  I hope the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [Mr. \nHelms] will hold hearings on this treaty before the end of the First \nSession of the 105th Congress so that the full Senate can ratify the \nCTBT by early next year.\n  This treaty has won near unanimous support in the United Nations. \nCountries--both Communist and capitalist, developing and developed--\nhave signed this treaty. The CTBT has overwhelming multilateral support \nand it deserves full bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  Let me close with another quote from President Kennedy's speech at \nAmerican University. ``Genuine peace must be the product of many \nnations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not static, changing \nto meet the challenge of each new generation. For peace is a process--a \nway of solving problems.''\n  Mr. President, the CTBT is an important tool in meeting one of \ntoday's biggest challenges: ending the threat of nuclear war.\n  We must meet this challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9982-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9983-S9984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO RAFAEL GARCIA AND OCTAVIO VIVEROS, JR.\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nHispanic American population during National Hispanic Heritage Month. \nEvery year, from September 15 through October 15, Hispanic Americans \ncelebrate their Heritage and are honored for their many civic \ncontributions and achievements throughout the Nation. In the spirit of \nHispanic Heritage Month, I recognize two individuals, Rafael Garcia and \nOctavio Viveros, Jr., whom I nominated to represent my home State of \nMissouri on the United States Senate Task Force on Hispanic Affairs.\n  Rafael Garcia is president and owner of Rafael Architects, Inc. \n(RAI). Honored with many architectural awards, Rafael has also received \nnumerous Community Service awards. In 1997, Rafael earned \n``Entrepreneur of the Year Finalist'' to add to his Hispanic Leadership \naward, and his ``Top 25 Hispanic Leaders in Kansas City'' honor given \nby Dos Mundos Newspaper. He is a member of several Charity and \nCommunity Boards of Directors including Heart of America United Way, \nStarlight Theater and the Kansas City Art Institute. Rafael volunteers \nfor FOCUS/Odyssey 2000 West as a facilitator and for Project HOPE \n(Hope, Opportunity, Performance, Education through Entrepreneurship) \nand has been written up in several prominent magazines for his many \naccomplishments and contributions. He personifies everything positive \nin the Kansas City Metropolitan area and I am excited to have him \nworking on this important cause for Hispanic communities across the \nUnited States.\n  Octavio Viveros, Jr. is a Founder and Partner of Viveros & Barrera \nL.C. Law Firm and is Founder and President of LatAm Trading, Inc. \nOctavio has been appointed to the Board of Indigent's Defense a \nGubernatorial Appointment for the State of Kansas and the Key \nCommission a Mayoral Appointment for the City of Kansas City, MO. He is \nthe founder of the Hispanic Economic Development Corporation of Kansas \nCity, a former President of the Board of Directors for the Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City and a member of the Kansas \nCity Centurious Leadership Program, to name a few of his civic \naccomplishments. Octavio has earned many awards including recognition \nas one of the ``25 Most Influential Hispanics in Kansas City'' in 1993 \nby Dos Mundos Newspaper. Most recently he attended United States Senate \nRepublican Conference as a member of the Task Force on Hispanic Affairs \nhere in Washington, DC. His continuing commitment to not only the \nKansas City Community, but also the entire Hispanic\n\n[[Page S9984]]\n\nAmerican Community is a positive example for all and I am extremely \npleased to have him on my team.\n  I believe that Rafael and Octavio will be able to help the Hispanic \ncommunity by encouraging growth and opportunity. Each year exemplary \nleadership in the Hispanic Community is evidenced by achievement in the \nwork force and community involvement. It is impressive to watch this \nexpansion and I congratulate all Hispanic Americans, especially Rafael \nand Octavio, during this important month of Heritage. I commend them on \ntheir present success and hope for even more in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9983-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LANDMINES\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many have asked whether the \nDepartment of Defense has so involved itself in the landmine debate \nthat they have even changed definition to win in their opposition to \njoining the majority of nations seeking a ban.\n  An article from September 24, 1997, the Washington Post answers the \nquestion and I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           Clinton Directive on Mines: New Form, Old Function\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       When is an antipersonnel land mine--a fist-sized object \n     designed to blow up a human being--no longer an antipersonnel \n     land mine?\n       When the president of the United States says so.\n       In announcing last week that the United States would not \n     sign an international treaty to ban antipersonnel land mines, \n     President Clinton also said he had ordered the Pentagon to \n     find technological alternatives to these mines. ``This \n     program,'' he said, ``will eliminate all antipersonnel land \n     mines from America's arsenal.''\n       Technically speaking, the president's statement was not \n     quite accurate.\n       His directive left untouched the millions of little devices \n     the Army and Defense Department for years have been calling \n     antipersonnel land mines. These mines are used to protect \n     antitank mines, which are much larger devices meant to \n     disable enemy tanks and other heavy vehicles.\n       The smaller ``protectors'' are shot out of tanks or dropped \n     from jets and helicopters. When they land, they shoot out \n     threads that attach themselves to the ground with tiny hooks, \n     creating cobweb-like tripwires. Should an enemy soldier try \n     to get close to the antitank mine, chances are he would trip \n     a wire, and either fragments would explode at ground level or \n     a handball-sized grenade would pop up from the antipersonnel \n     mine to about belly height. In less than a second, the \n     grenade would explode, throwing its tiny metal balls into the \n     soldier's flesh and bones.\n       In the trade, these ``mixed'' systems have names such as \n     Gator, Volcano, MOPMS and Area Denial Artillery Munition, or \n     ADAM.\n       These mines, Clinton's senior policy director for defense \n     policy and arms control, Robert Bell, explained later, ``are \n     not being banned under the president's directive because they \n     are not antipersonnel land mines.'' They are, he said, \n     ``antihandling devices,'' ``little kinds of explosive \n     deices'' or, simply, ``munitions.''\n       Not according to the Defense Department, which has used \n     them for years.\n       When the Pentagon listed the antipersonnel land mines it \n     was no longer allowed to export under a 1992 congressionally \n     imposed ban, these types were on the list.\n       And when Clinton announced in January that he would cap the \n     U.S. stockpile of antipersonnel land mines in the inventory, \n     they were on that list too.\n       At the time, there were a total of 1 million Gators, \n     Volcanos and MOPMS, as well as 9 million ADAMs. (Only some \n     ADAMs are used in conjunction with antitank mines, and those \n     particular devices are no longer considered antipersonnel \n     land mines.)\n       The unclassified Joint Chiefs of Staff briefing charts used \n     to explain the impact of legislation to Congress this year \n     explicitly state that Gators, Volcanos, MOPMS and ADAMs are \n     antipersonnel land mines.\n       So does a June 19 Army information paper titled ``US Self-\n     Destructing Anti-Personnel Landmine Use.'' So does a fact \n     sheet issued in 1985 by the Army Armament, Munition and \n     Chemical Command.\n       As does a recent Army ``Information Tab,'' which explains \n     that the Gator is ``packed with a mix of `smart' AP \n     [antipersonnel] and `smart' AT [antitank] mines.''\n       And when Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, vice chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed reporters at the White \n     House on may 16, 1996, he said: ``Our analysis shows that the \n     greatest benefit of antipersonnel land mines is when they are \n     used in conjunction with antitank land mines. . . . If you \n     don't cover the antitank mine field with antipersonnel mines, \n     it's very easy for the enemy to go through the mine field.''\n       A diplomatic dispute over the types of antipersonnel land \n     mines Ralston was describing then and arms control adviser \n     Bell sought to redefine last week was one of the main reasons \n     the United States decided last week not to sign the \n     international treaty being crafted in Oslo, Norway.\n       U.S. negotiators argued that because these mines are \n     programmed to eventually self-destruct, they are not \n     responsible for the humanitarian crisis--long-forgotten mines \n     injuring and killing civilians--that treaty supporters hoped \n     to cure with a ban, and therefore should be exempt from the \n     ban.\n       Also, because other countries had gotten an exemption for \n     the type of antihandling devices they use to prevent soldiers \n     from picking up antitank mines--which are actually attached \n     to the antitank mines--U.S. negotiators contended that the \n     United States should get an exemption for the small mines it \n     uses for the same purpose.\n       Negotiators in Oslo did not accept Washington's stance. \n     They worried that other countries might seek to exempt the \n     types of antipersonnel mines they wanted to use, too, and the \n     whole treaty would soon become meaningless.\n       The administration was not trying to deceive the public, \n     Bell said in an interview yesterday, bristling at the \n     suggestion. Given the fact that the U.S. devices are used to \n     protect antitank mines, ``it seems entirely common-sensical \n     to us'' to call them antihandling devices.\n       Said Bell: ``this was not a case of us trying to take mines \n     and then define the problem away.''\n\n\n                  How One `Antihandling Device' Works\n\n       When President Clinton spoke of eliminating antipersonnel \n     land mines, he left out of his directive devices such as the \n     Gator antipersonnel mine. The Gator mine prevents soldiers \n     from disarming antitank mines. It works like this:\n       1. Gator mines grouped in a cluster bomb are dumped from \n     planes onto the ground surrounding antitank mines.\n       2. When the mine lands, gas from a small squib forces \n     spring-loaded tripwires to be released.\n       3. Tension on the tripwire sets off the fuse, sending low-\n     flying fragments in all directions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9984-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO ANGENETTE ``ANGIE'' MARTIN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, a woman who devoted most of her \nlife to improving the lives of others lost her battle with cancer \nrecently, and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the \naccomplishments and the contributions of this extraordinary woman.\n  Angie Martin struggled with the dreaded disease of breast cancer for \nthe past 5 years. She died on August 31 at her home in Sausalito, CA, \nand a memorial service will be held here in Washington, DC on Monday, \nSeptember 29. The many people who knew Angie know that this memorial \nwill not be in mourning for her death, but in celebration of a life of \nservice to others.\n  The world is filled with passionate idealists. Angie was of the rarer \nbreed of people who also had the ability to inspire passion in others. \nRarer still was her talent for turning those passionate ideas into \naction. Her efforts were always aimed at improving the lives of others, \nthe most rare gift of all.\n  Angie Martin pioneered grassroots organizing techniques, establishing \na vital link between citizen action and social change, and created a \nmodel for grassroots and political campaigns nationwide. Working with \nconsumer advocate Ralph Nader in Connecticut in the early 1970's, Angie \nhelped to create the first ever citizens lobby devoted to environmental \nand consumer issues. She worked to improve conditions for migrant \nworkers in New York state, and organized the highly acclaimed 1986 \nHands Across America event to build awareness for the cause of hunger \nand homelessness in the United States.\n  Together with her friend and partner, Gina Glantz, Angie took on some \nof our Nation's toughest issues: homelessness, hunger, migrant workers, \ngun violence, teen pregnancy. Her counsel was valued by many of our \nNation's most prominent leaders, including Senator Ted Kennedy and Vice \nPresident Walter Mondale.\n  Angie battled her disease with the same conviction and courage she \nbrought to fighting for causes she believed in. Her legacy will live on \nin the lives of those she worked with, and in the lives of those she \nhelped through her passionate efforts over the last three decades.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with her husband, Gene Eidenberg, and \ndaughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. I know many of my colleagues will \njoin me in paying tribute to this remarkable woman, by continuing the \nfight to find a cure for breast cancer and for all cancers, and by \ncontinuing to address the important issues for which she dedicated her \nlife's work.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9984-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9985]]\n                 INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee's report on S. 1173, the \nIntermodal Transportation Act of 1997. The sponsors of this legislation \nargue that it will provide an adequate level of federal highway funds, \ndistributed equitably among the states, so as to meet our surface \ntransportation needs over the next six years. I wish I could be as \noptimistic, but I have concerns that this bill will simply perpetuate \nthe intolerable situation under which donor states, like Michigan, have \nbeen forced to suffer.\n  There are two basic fundamental flaws with our current surface \ntransportation funding process that must be addressed in order to \nprovide every state the ability to meet its highway needs. First, the \nvast disconnect between how much an individual state contributes to the \nHighway Trust Fund and how much it receives in Federal highway aid must \nbe bridged. Second, the vast disconnect between how much the Federal \ngovernment takes into the Highway Trust Fund from gas taxes, and the \ntotal amount it distributes to the states in Federal highway aid must \nalso be bridged. Until these two problems are properly addressed, donor \nstates such as Michigan shall be forced to suffer under a inequitable \nsystem that is neither justified nor effective.\n  The bill to be reported out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, S. 1173, the Intermodal Transportation Act attempts to \nrectify the problem of this unequal distribution among the states by \nallegedly guaranteeing each state a 90-percent return on the gas taxes \nit contributes to the Highway Trust Fund. Unfortunately, this will not \nbe the case. In FY 98, Michigan is expected to contribute over $795 \nmillion in gas taxes to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund. \nNonetheless, according to data provided by the sponsors of S. 1173, \nthis new distribution formula will provide only $686 million in federal \nhighway aid to Michigan, an 86-percent rate of return. And it only gets \nworse, for by FY 2003, when Michigan is projected to contribute $1.07 \nbillion in gas taxes, it will receive only $726 million in federal \nhighway aid, down to a 68-percent rate of return. Even these funding \nlevels are just $5.7 billion per year more than the average ISTEA \nlevels for Michigan. This formula, Mr. President, is far away from what \nI would call a fair means of distributing this country's limited \nhighway dollars. I will stand firmly against any measure that \nperpetuates this inequality.\n  As for the issue of overall funding levels, S. 1173 does not address \nthe Federal government's unfair practice of collecting gas taxes from \nAmerican motorists, while refusing to expend them. We know this process \nto be a sleight of hand scheme by which the Federal government shirks \nthe full burden of responsibility for the true size of the budget \ndeficit. Years ago, American motorists were told that a gas tax would \nbe collected as a ``user fee'' to provide a ``pay-as-you-go'' funding \nsource for the Interstate Freeway System. They should expect the taxes \nthey pay at the pump to be necessary to maintain the roads upon which \nthey drive, and to be spent on those roads. In my opinion, when those \ntaxes are not used for transportation purposes, the American motorist \ncan rightfully conclude either those taxes are not necessary, or more \nlikely, are being unjustly withheld from their proper use.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 took an important step towards \ncorrecting this unjustified withholding by transferring gas tax \nrevenues which previously were being directed to the general revenue \nback to the Highway Trust Fund. These 4.3 cents of gas tax represent \nalmost $5 billion in additional revenue for the Trust Fund, an account \nthat will grow to over $30 billion in annual revenue by 2003. Yet the \nIntermodal Transportation Act only authorizes funding levels of \napproximately $24 billion per year, continuing to withhold nearly $6 \nbillion per year in highway gas taxes to mask the deficit's true size, \nwhile allowing the continuation of wasteful government programs. Even \nunder the unfair distribution formulas found in ISTEA, these $6 billion \nadditional dollars would represent over $150 million in extra federal \naid per year for Michigan, an increase of about 25 percent.\n  Mr. President, it is clear what we must now do. Any successor \nlegislation to ISTEA must guarantee each and every state at least 95 \ncents in federal highway aid for every dollar it sends to Washington in \ngas taxes. The entire justification for this historically unfair \ndistribution, a distribution scheme that forces states like Michigan to \nsuffer as donor states, is rendered moot with the completion of the \nInterstate System, a declaration made six years ago in the very opening \nparagraph of ISTEA, to recognize America entering an era in which new \nconstruction transportation projects are started to fulfill regional, \nnot national, demands.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, we must stop withholding highway funds \nfrom the states. The successor legislation to ISTEA must guarantee that \nall the states are provided the opportunity to use all the revenues \nraised by gas taxes. Therefore, we must ensure that legislation is in \nplace that will force the Federal government to spend on our highways \nan amount at least equal to that amount raised in gas taxes. Absent \nthat, we must provide an opportunity for the States to raise their own \ngas tax revenues by repealing that portion of the gas tax not needed to \nfund the federal aid highway program, thereby allowing the states to \nraise, and keep for their roads, the gas tax revenues that would \notherwise be siphoned off to unscrupulously mask the true size of the \nfederal deficit and unjustifiably continue unnecessary federal \nspending.\n  Many of my colleagues are raising very similar concerns, Mr. \nPresident, and the next few weeks will likely see an intense debate on \nthis issue. For my constituents in Michigan, no issue is more important \nthan the federal road funding process, and I commit to them all my \nresources and efforts to rectify this inequitable situation. I will be \njoining many of my colleagues in proposing alternative methods of \ndistributing our federal road funds so as to not only make it fairer \nfor individual states, but also to ensure that the entire National \nHighway System, and our States' road system, are adequately maintained. \nAnd when Members of this Senate are able to score quick increases in \ntheir State's share of the federal dollar by threatening a filibuster, \nit makes the rest of us wonder what might be the most effective way for \nus to improve our States' situation. I plan to offer a series of \namendments to address the fundamental issues I have discussed today, as \nwell as proposals that will streamline. Only time will tell, Mr. \nPresident, but I trust we will be able to work together and derive an \nequitable and mutually beneficial funding solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9985-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9985-S9986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE NOMINATION OF PETER SCHER TO BE SPECIAL TRADE AMBASSADOR FOR \n                              AGRICULTURE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to make a few brief \ncomments regarding the nomination of Mr. Peter Scher to be the Special \nTrade Ambassador for Agriculture which this Senate is considering \ntoday. I am pleased to report that the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on which I serve, considered the nomination of Mr. Scher and \nfavorably reported his nomination yesterday.\n  I met with Mr. Scher following his confirmation hearing before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss with him the problems \nWisconsin's agricultural sector has had with our existing trade \nagreements such as the Uruguay Round of GATT and the North American \nFree Trade Agreement. I urged Mr. Scher, in his new position, to work \ndiligently to ensure that our trading partners are complying with their \nagricultural trade obligations established by these agreements.\n  Specifically, I asked Mr. Scher and the USTR to accept a section 301 \npetition filed by the dairy industry asking USTR to challenge the \nCanadian export pricing scheme before the World Trade Organization. \nCanada's dairy export subsidies violate the export subsidy reduction \ncommitments under the Uruguay Round. These subsidies disadvantage the \nUnited States dairy industry in its efforts to compete in world \nmarkets. I also pointed out that Canada also has effectively prohibited \nour dairy industry from exporting\n\n[[Page S9986]]\n\nproducts to lucrative Canadian markets. Not only must USTR aggressively \npursue WTO dispute settlement proceedings against Canadian export \nsubsidies, but it must also seek greater access for United States dairy \nproducts to Canadian markets, among others, in any upcoming trade \nnegotiations.\n  I also raised with Mr. Scher the problems the United States potato \nindustry has had with respect to access to both Canadian and Mexican \nmarkets. I urged him to pursue negotiations with the Canadians to allow \ngreater access of United States potatoes to their domestic markets and \nto aggressively seek accelerated reduction in Mexican tariffs for \nUnited States potatoes, a commitment made to potato growers when NAFTA \nwas approved. Mr. Scher assured me that potatoes would be among the \ncommodities to be considered in upcoming negotiations with Mexico.\n  I believe Mr. Scher has a fundamental understanding of both the \nimportance of trade to agriculture generally and of the complex trade \nproblems the U.S. dairy industry faces regarding compliance with \nexisting trade agreements. For that reason, I support the approval of \nhis nomination. But I expect USTR, with Mr. Scher acting as Ambassador, \nto aggressively pursue the resolution of the critical issues facing our \ndomestic dairy and potato sectors. I will continue to work with USTR to \nresolve these issues and will hold Mr. Scher to his commitment that \nUSTR will use all existing tools to ensure compliance with existing \ntrade agreements and to pursue greater access for agriculture to \ninternational markets.\n  I continue to have serious reservations about United States efforts \nto begin new trade negotiations until the problems with our current \nbilateral and multilateral agreements are successfully resolved. \nWisconsin is home to 24,000 dairy farmers, 140 cheese processing plants \nand many other businesses associated with milk production and \nprocessing. Dairy contributes some $4 billion in income to Wisconsin's \neconomy and provides 130,000 jobs. Wisconsin is also the fifth largest \npotato producing State with a large chip and french fry processing \nsector. Overall, Wisconsin ranks 10th in the Nation in farm numbers and \n9th nationally with respect to market value of agricultural products \nsold.\n  Wisconsin's farmers and food processing industry could greatly \nbenefit by gaining a greater share of international markets. However, \nfor that to happen, our trade agreements must not only be fair, they \nmust be enforceable. To date, our trade agreements have not only failed \nto provide significant benefits for many agricultural sectors, \nincluding dairy, they have placed some sectors at a distinct \ndisadvantage. I will look at all future trade agreement proposals with \nan eye to these issues and make decisions on those proposals based, in \npart, on how they treat Wisconsin farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/25/senate-section/article/S9985-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 25\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.
