Mr. President, I wanted to take the opportunity today as \nwe gather, and before we begin debate on a specific bill, to talk a \nlittle bit about the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Republican bill that \nwas introduced last week, a bill that I believe has a great deal of \nvalue for the American people. S. 2330, the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwill be the subject, I think, of our discussion this week and, indeed, \nshould be.\n  For some time now we have been hearing from the other side of the \naisle with respect to a Patients' Bill of Rights, and they will have \none. Hopefully what will happen, we will have an opportunity to \nconsider both of these bills, have an up-or-down vote on each of them, \nand successfully pass one of these versions that will protect patients \nthroughout the country.\n  The Republican proposal is a carefully crafted plan intended to give \npatients and families more choices as we change the way health care is \ndelivered in this country. And as we move toward more managed care, \nthen there needs, I believe, to be some additional provisions put into \nlaw which will ensure that Americans and their families receive the \nkind of care we would like them to receive.\n  There are differences between the two bills. Some of them, I believe, \nare significant--some of them are broad differences that are \nphilosophical, I suppose. For example, the Republican bill deals with \nthose health plans that are not regulated by the States.\n  In Wyoming, my home State, things are quite different in terms of a \nhealth care delivery system compared to New York or California. We have \na State of 100,000 square miles with 470,000 people, so you can \nimagine--we have small towns, and we have a different kind of system. \nJust this weekend I was in Casper, WY, celebrating the 15th anniversary \nof the Life Flight program in Wyoming. That is the helicopter, and a \nfixed wing as well, from the Central Wyoming Medical Center which \nserves the whole State.\n  We have one Life Flight program for all of Wyoming. It serves the \nmountains in the north; it serves the towns in the south. It is quite \ndifferent, for example, than you would have in New England. So I think \nit is important that we allow States to continue regulating those \nhealth plans that they have jurisdiction over so they may craft \nregulations tailored to their specific needs. The Republican Patients \nBill of Rights, therefore, focuses solely on health plans outside State \njurisdiction.\n  Secondly, Republicans propose a different type of appeals process. \nThe Democratic proposal says go to the courts; let's have more \nlitigation; let's bring the lawyers in to decide health care issues. \nRepublicans, on the other hand, say let's have a health care system \nwhere the appeals are decided more quickly, less expensively, and are \nmade by doctors.\n  I think those are very important differences. The main focus of this \ndebate, then, will and should center around patients. That is really \nwhat health care is all about. And I think the Republican plan achieves \nthe goal of dealing with the needs of patients.\n  It includes at least six new consumer standards that I think are \nimportant for us to consider. One is access to emergency care. This is \nthe kind of thing that I just spoke of in terms of Wyoming. As you can \nimagine, the Life Flight helicopter is an expensive project but very \nnecessary. There is no other way to carry patients from a small town in \nthe Big Horns to the medical center in Casper. This ensures that \nemergency care will be received.\n  The prudent lay care standard is adopted where emergency health care \nscreening is guaranteed. And this is not the case, of course, in all \nmanaged care plans. So it is very important.\n  Point-of-service access, point-of-service coverage, this provides \nthat if you choose to see a provider outside of the managed care \nnetwork, the program should make arrangements for you to be able to do \nthat. We think that is important. For continuity of care in case the \nphysician leaves the health plan or the plan changes, patients must be \nnotified of such changes. Patients also should have the opportunity to \ncontinue seeing that provider for at least 90 days while they make the \ntransition to choose another provider in the health plan's preferred \nnetwork. This transition period would apply to patients in their second \ntrimester of pregnancy or for those who may be terminally ill. Again, \nalso, that is an important issue. By the way, many of these issues are \nthe same in both bills and that is good; there will be some \nagreement. There needs to be open discussion of all treatment options. \nThose of us who are in managed care need to know exactly what is \ncoming. We need to know exactly what benefits will be covered. On the \nother hand, if you are going to have managed care and choose that as a \nless expensive option, then we can only expect to utilize the benefits \nthat are covered. So there needs to be open discussion of all treatment \noptions, as well as full disclosure of the health plan's terms and \nconditions.\n\n  There are some key differences, and I have mentioned them, between \nthe GOP and the Kennedy bills. Most of the areas considered are the \nsame or are, indeed, similar, and I think that is as it should be. But \nI have already mentioned that there is a grievance process that \nreplaces litigation. I happen to think that is a great idea.\n  One of the real problems we have had in health care through the years \nis not only the cost of litigation itself, but also the types of \nduplicative services performed to prevent lawsuits, tests that are \nterribly expensive. Over the last several years, we have been able to \nreduce these costs. But now we find ourselves faced with similar \ncircumstances than may raise the cost of health care again.\n  Obviously, you have to have some form of appeals program. However, \nthe key is to make sure it proceeds in a timely manner so you do not \nwait 2 or 3 years to get redress. You don't have the time to do that in \nhealth care. You need some decisions made very quickly. The other \nrequirement is to make sure such decisions are made by doctors, not by \nlawyers. That is important. So I think there is a great deal of merit \nto our approach.\n  So there are a number of reasons why I think the Republican approach \nis best. One is, it gives rights and remedies to 48 million Americans \nwhose current coverages are unregulated. It also provides for some new \nprovisions. It allows full deductibility for the purchase of health \ninsurance by the self-employed, which has not been the case in the \npast. It outlaws gag rules placed on physicians. Most States have done \nthat. It expands emergency room coverage. It makes it easier to get \nservice outside of the HMO. It remove barriers to seeing obstetricians, \ngynecologists and pediatricians, which provides great peace of mind. It \nalso requires the continuity of care and more information to consumers. \nConsumers are entitled to these standards. Standards which are designed \nto make managed care plans more accountable. So as we change health \ncare in this delivery system, there needs to be some regulatory \nrevisions, and that is what the Republican Patients Bill of Rights \ndoes.\n  This bill is something we need to do. The purposes are good. The \nlegislation is well-written. It provides quality care based on sound \nmedical evidence, and that is something that we sorely need in this \ncountry. I urge Members of the Senate to support the Republican health \ncare bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Wyoming, way \nover there, if he needs more time, we don't have many people on the \nfloor. I don't want him to rush on my account. Does he need more time? \nIf so, I am pleased to wait.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I have finished what \nI have to say. I appreciate his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8548-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8548-S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are a number of matters I thought \nI would cover, since there are not a lot of people here on the floor\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\ntoday yet. First of all, I want to talk about the appropriations bill \nthat we passed for VA and HUD last week. While I submitted a statement \nfor the Record, since we were in a rush and squeezed for time, I didn't \nhave a chance to talk about FEMA and in particular the Director, James \nLee Witt. I feel bad about that. I want to talk about FEMA, and I want \nto talk about Mr. Witt today on the floor because this small agency \nwith a very big heart has made a huge difference to a lot of our \nStates--to a lot of people in our States. As we go to conference, I \nhope the conferees will remember the very big job I think FEMA does and \nwill honor the level of funding requested by the President in the \nPresident's budget.\n  My contact with James Lee Witt--I want to talk about him, and then I \nwant to talk about FEMA. It is about more than one person. It goes back \nto 1993. The Chair today, from Kansas, of course, knows agriculture as \nwell as anyone and knows what happens when you are faced with record \nflooding. We were hit with just terrible flooding in 1993. Farmers \ncouldn't plant the crop. There was a lot of economic pain. I think that \nis the first time that I had a chance to just watch James Lee Witt in \naction.\n  What I was most impressed about was just what we call the hands-on \napproach. I felt he was the opposite of somebody who was impersonal, \nthe opposite of a ``bureaucrat.'' By the way, there are many \nbureaucrats who aren't ``bureaucrats.'' There are many people in \nGovernment who do their very best for people. I get tired of the \nbashing sometimes. But he was so personable and really came through for \npeople.\n  Then, of course, not that long ago--what was it, a year ago, a year-\nand-a-half ago--we had the floods in North Dakota. Everybody remembers \nGrand Forks, the flooding, the fire, the cold winter weather, and East \nGrand Forks in Minnesota, and other communities--Ada, Warren--it was \njust devastating.\n  I just want to say, again, the bad news is that, with FEMA, you know \nFEMA people are going to come out because there is a real crisis. The \nbad news of a James Lee Witt, the Director, visiting your State, is you \nknow he wouldn't be there and other FEMA people wouldn't be there \nexcept for some kind of disaster, except for some kind of a crisis. The \ngood news is that always good things happen afterwards.\n  Once upon a time, I remember, there was all sorts of frustration \nabout FEMA. I don't want my colleagues to forget what Mr. Witt has \ndone. I think he is one of the best appointments the President has ever \nmade. He has done an excellent job of making this agency so much more \nresponsive to people in our communities, people who are facing a real \ncrisis. What he did, and what FEMA did, to help people who had been \naffected by the devastating flood of the Red River, was just \nremarkable. It was just remarkable. I want to comment on that on the \nfloor.\n  Again, this past year, we were hit with tornadoes, and again the town \nof Comfrey was essentially leveled to the ground, St. Peter was hit \nhard, Le Center--I could talk about a lot of communities. Again, James \nLee Witt came.\n  The people in Minnesota, the people in these communities who have \nbeen faced with these crises, have tremendous appreciation for this \nDirector--tremendous appreciation. He has gone the extra mile every \ntime to try to push the categories of assistance as far as he can, to \ntry to get the help to people, to try to make sure there is not \nunnecessary delay, to try to make sure he cuts through as much of the \nbureaucracy as possible. And he has done that. I just want to say to \ncolleagues, especially to the conferees, I hope we give this agency the \nfunding they really deserve.\n  The other thing I think is real important is, FEMA is now focused on \nthis predisaster mitigation program, which I think is real important. \nThis is another example of FEMA being in a good partnership with our \nlocal communities and with our businesses, to figure out, given what we \nhave been faced with, how, in fact, we can do the mitigation work to \nprevent a lot of the damage and a lot of the pain and a lot of cost \nthat happens afterwards. This is a very proactive Director.\n  My last point is, I have fallen in love with FEMA people. I don't \nknow if I would ever do this or not, but I am tempted, if I have the \nskill, when I am no longer in politics or public life, to work for \nFEMA. It is really fascinating when you get to know people. These are \npeople from all around the country, and they travel around, they \nrespond to these crises, they come into your State, they live in the \nState--it is like a family.\n  It is constant responding to people--people who have been flooded out \nof their homes, people who don't have any clothing, people who don't \nknow where they are going to stay, people whose businesses have been \ndestroyed.\n  Of course, it is so difficult, but I am so impressed with a lot of \nthe FEMA people and the job that they do. It is just quite amazing. You \nmeet a former head of the State patrol of California, retired military \nperson here, retired business person there--a whole lot of pretty \nfascinating people who work for FEMA who are just experts at dealing \nwith these crisis situations.\n  I don't think that any of us had an opportunity to speak about FEMA \nas we were going through the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I wanted to \nspeak about FEMA, and I wanted to speak about FEMA's very able \nDirector. I am positive that I am not just speaking for myself. I am \nalso positive that I am not just speaking for Democrats. I think there \nare many Republicans who would echo my sentiments about Mr. Witt and \nabout FEMA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8548-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8549-S8550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AUTO WORKERS' STRIKE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last week I had a chance to speak about \nthe auto workers' strike in Flint, MI. Today, this strike is about \nlocal issues, but it is of national importance. Today the presidents \nand the other active members of United Auto Workers locals from around \nthe country are in Flint, MI. I wanted to one more time say that we now \nare more than 5 weeks into this strike.\n  This has affected, I think, well over 100,000 workers in the country, \nnot just the workers of Flint. The issues are clear cut--health and \nsafety issues, which still are very important issues at the workplace \nin America, the speeding up of production lines, and the sending of \nwork or the contracting out to outside suppliers.\n  My own view is that GM has made a mistake with what I characterize as \nhardball tactics, because I think what happens is with hardball \ntactics--the walking away from negotiations, the threat of cutting off \nhealth care benefits of those who are out on strike, the threat of \nshutting down the two parts plants in Flint, MI--what it does is it \nundercuts the very good labor relations that actually are so critical \nto productivity.\n  On the floor of the Senate, I say to GM in particular that I think \ngood labor relations begin with a handshake, not a 2 by 4, and I hope \nto see both parties back in negotiations, and the sooner the better.\n  What is happening in Flint, MI--again, the issues are local but the \nsignificance of it is national. What is at stake is American jobs, good \njobs, living-wage jobs, jobs that pay a good wage with good fringe \nbenefits.\n  As I stand today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I want to make it \nclear that as a Senator, that even though I am on the floor of the \nSenate, I also feel like my heart and soul are with the auto workers in \nFlint, MI. I extend my support as a Senator from Minnesota.\n  There is a whole tradition to this. When I was a college teacher, I \nused to teach labor history, a labor politics class, and some of the \nmost famous sitdowns took place in Flint, MI, in 1937--a very \ncourageous, very courageous action by workers. These auto workers come \nout of a very rich tradition, a lot of courage by their parents and \ntheir grandparents, and I believe they are showing the same courage \ntoday.\n  My hope is that we will see that negotiations will resume, that there \nwill be a fair settlement, and that the United Auto Workers will not \nonly have done well for themselves, but, more importantly, will do well \nfor workers around the country.\n  There are key issues here--health and safety issues. People who work \nhave a right to say, ``Look, we're going to work, but we're going to \nwork under civilized working conditions.'' People have a right to have \na decent wage.\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\n People have a right to focus on pension and health care benefits. \nPeople have a right to be concerned about the contracting out of jobs. \nThey have a right to be concerned about the trade agreements, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  That is why the workers in Flint, MI, are on the picket line today, \nand that is why, as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, I strongly support \nthese workers who are out on the picket line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8549-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JAMES HORMEL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I read today in the paper--and I am not \nquite sure where we are headed, and I always look forward to having a \nchance to meet and talk with the majority leader, agree or disagree, on \nall issues--but I read in the paper the majority leader said he didn't \nthink he would have time to bring up the nomination of James Hormel. \nThat is a terrible mistake.\n  I have spoken on the floor. I said after the tobacco legislation, I \nwas looking for an opportunity to offer an amendment. Frankly, on the \nbasis of discussions I had with a lot of different people, I decided \nthat it would be better to wait because I was hoping, if you will, that \ncooler heads would prevail on this matter and we would figure out a way \nto bring this nomination to the floor.\n  If it is a debate or discussion, it will be a good debate and good \ndiscussion.

If the \nmajority leader is basically shutting the door on any action on the \nfloor of the Senate--I hope he isn't; I guess that is my plea to the \nmajority leader: I hope you have not done that--I want to find out as \nsoon as possible. Then, I believe, it will be important for some of us \nto bring amendments to the floor and, basically, one way or another, \nhave a debate and have an up-or-down vote.\n\n  Every Senator is entitled to their own opinion about whether or not \nJames Hormel would be an able Ambassador to Luxembourg, and every \nSenator is entitled to a vote. I am entitled to my opinion, and I am \nentitled to a vote. I think the majority of us --well over 60 of us--\nwould vote to confirm this nomination.\n  I cannot see anything in Mr. Hormel's record--anything in his record, \nanything in his record--that would disqualify him from this job. I see \nsomeone with an enormously successful background in education--that \nmeans a lot to me; education has been my life's work--a very successful \nbusiness person, philanthropist, and very active in the legal \nprofession. For the life of me, there is no reason to stop this \nnomination, except for the fact--and if this is the fact, let's get it \nout in the open--that he is gay. If that is what troubles colleagues, \ncome out here and say it. If colleagues want to say he is gay, or if \nthey want to say he has been too outspoken on gay causes, then let's \nget that out here.\n  Too many comments have been made in the last several months --made \nhere, there--and I don't think that is good for the Senate. Frankly, \nthe failure of the U.S. Senate to at least bring this nomination to the \nfloor and have an honest discussion and an honest debate--frankly, this \nis less about Jim Hormel than it is about the Senate. The Senate is far \nmore on trial than is Jim Hormel. This is not good for this \ninstitution. If this is just a case of discrimination against somebody \nbecause of their sexual orientation, we all have to look ourselves in \nthe mirror. If not, fine, we will have the discussion, we will have the \ndebate, and we will have the vote. But I don't think, as much as I \nmight respect the majority leader or respect his prerogatives, \nnecessarily his word would be the final word, at least in terms of a \ndiscussion and a debate. My hope is, we can figure out a way of \nbringing Mr. Hormel's nomination to the floor and that there will be a \nvote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8550-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8550-S8551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Finally, Mr. President, seeing no other colleague on \nthe floor, I want to talk about this more in detail and in depth when \nwe have the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill before us, which \nI think will be in the next day or so. I am working on an amendment--I \nhope it can be ready--that actually evolves from a piece of legislation \nI have been working on for some time dealing with mental health in \nchildren.\n  I have been very lucky to have done a lot of the mental health work \nwith Senator Domenici from New Mexico, my Republican colleague. He has \ncertainly been more of the leader than I have, but I have been honored \nto work with him.\n  Mr. President, I went on a visit--I will talk about this in more \ndetail, in more depth later--to Lula, LA, about 2 weeks ago as a \nSenator. I think it was some of the best work I have done as a Senator \noutside of Minnesota--the best work is in Minnesota. I wanted to go \nthere because I have read some Justice Department reports about the \nneed for real dramatic improvement in the conditions affecting these \nchildren.\n  I see pages here. This is a corrections center, and the kids that are \nhere in the center range in age from 11 to about 18. A lot of the kids \nI talked to were 14, 15. I did talk to several 11-year-olds as well. I \nwent down there determined--I talked to both of my colleagues from \nLouisiana, not to sort of say, well, how terrible, Louisiana; only in \nLouisiana. I do not believe that for a moment. I think we can do a lot \nbetter.\n  My focus had to do with mental health and children. The estimates now \nmade by the Justice Department--there was a pretty powerful front-page \nstory in the New York Times that was written last week that I will get \nin the Record when I offer this amendment. But the fact of the matter \nis, the estimates are that about 25 percent of the kids here struggle \nwith mental problems. Many of them actually never committed a crime. I \nmean, they would be picked up, they would run away from home, be out in \nthe street. A very small percentage committed a violent crime; I guess \nprobably less than 10 percent, closer to 5 percent. I will talk about \nthat in a moment.\n  But what happens is that these facilities--and this is certainly what \nhappened in Lula--become a dumping ground with kids struggling with \nmental illness. They should not be there in the first place. To \ncompound the problem, they are there, but with no treatment. And to \ncompound that problem, it becomes pretty brutal with them. They should \nnot be there.\n  I went to Lula--and, again, I am going to be very careful as not to \nspeak with that much emotion because there is plenty to be emotional \nabout, but to just give a report on the floor of the Senate. I will \nfocus on this again in more detail with the amendment so my colleagues \nknow what the amendment is about.\n  In the administrative building there were a lot of people from \nLouisiana that were there, a lot of officials, which was fine. I met \nthe new warden, whom I believe is trying to make changes. He just got \nthere, so it would be unfair to pin any of this on him.\n  I wanted to go to the solitary confinement cells because I also heard \nkids were locked up in solitary confinement as many as 23 hours a day \nfor as long as 6 or 7 weeks. I wanted to know which kids. I wanted to \nknow, What does a kid do to be put in solitary confinement like this? \nWhat is the criteria you use? I wanted to know more about that.\n  Initially, we negotiated, and the idea was I would get there, but \nfirst I would start off with kids who were eating lunch. I went in, and \nit was interesting. There were kids eating lunch. I also say, since I \nthink race is still a reality in America, my guess is over 80 percent \nof the kids of about 500-plus kids were African American. I do not know \nwhat the population is in Louisiana--certainly nowhere close to 80 \npercent.\n  Kids were eating, and I went up to some kids who were eating, and I \njust said, ``How are you doing?'' This one young guy said to me, ``Not \nthat good.'' I said, ``What do you mean?'' He said, ``Well, you see \nthis food?'' By this time lots of officials were with me. He said, \n``See this food?'' I said, ``Yeah.'' He said, ``We never eat this food. \nWe never have a meal like this. This is just because you're here.''\n  He said, ``The table--smell the paint. This was just painted. These \ntables don't look like this.'' He said, ``These clothes I have on,''--I \nam just reporting what he said to me--he said, ``These clothes I have \non, they just gave us this stuff last night. These aren't the clothes \nwe usually wear. It's hot. There's no air conditioning. You\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\nknow, we smell--the same clothing, same underwear. We never get new \nclothing like this.''\n  Then he went on and he said, ``When you go outside and you look at \nthe baskets there, when you look at the hoops, the nets were put on the \nhoop. We didn't have any nets on these hoops. This all just happened. \nThis is a show.''\n  That is the way it started out. I just give that report. Then I \nwalked across the yard, heading over to where the solitary confinement \ncells are, and there was a group of kids outside. It was very hot. And \nthis one young man just basically broke away from the guards and leaped \non to a roof of a building and started running toward me. I had a whole \nlot of people that were with me, a lot of media people from Louisiana, \nand again a lot of people from the State.\n  I went over to where he was, and I said, ``You're going to get in a \nlot of trouble.'' And I think he said, ``I know.'' I said, ``Why are \nyou doing this?'' He said, ``I want to make a statement.'' I said, \n``What is your statement?'' He said, ``I want to tell you this is a \nshow. And I want to tell you, when you leave we're going to be beaten \nup; we're going to be retaliated against.''\n  Mr. President, I then met with four kids and their lawyer from the \nSouthern Poverty Law Center--a great lawyer--for about an hour. They \ntalked about some of the retaliation--which, by the way, I have to give \nthe warden credit. There has been some reduction in this. But the more \nI was there, the more it became clear to me--and, again, I will, from \nFox Butterfield's article in the New York Times, I will spend more time \non this with the amendment.\n\n  But it became clear to me that there was precious little by way of \nvocational ed, hardly any education, not adequate counseling services, \nnot an adequate way of assessing kids. Did they come from a home where \nthere was violence in the home? Were there substance abuse problems? \nWere they themselves in need of treatment, especially in the mental \nhealth area, pharmacological treatment, or other treatment? Hardly \nadequate medical facilities.\n  I just have to tell you, Mr. President, I am not so angry at \nLouisiana because I know you can find plenty of these conditions around \nthe country. But I am wondering how in the world we can let this happen \nin America.\n  Some of the kids I met with--one boy had stolen a moped, and thus he \nwound up here. One was there for breaking and entering and had broken \ninto somebody's home. Another cut somebody with a knife in a fight, so \non and so forth.\n  But here is my question: I have two questions now. One, which will \nspeak to the amendment that I hope to have ready, and the other goes \nbeyond that. On mental health and children, I really do believe--and I \nspoke with the warden afterwards and, again, I give him credit for, I \nbelieve, trying to make changes, and I believe the same with the \ncommissioner of corrections. I am always interested in having things \nchange.\n  Senator Breaux said that there is going to be an all-out effort to do \na lot more by way of training with the staff there. But my question is \nwhether or not--when it comes to Louisiana or any State in the country, \nfrom Louisiana to California, to New York, to Minnesota; though I think \nthere are great differences, great differences right now--the question \nreally is this: Whether or not we are going to, within some kind of \nframework of integrated mental health services, provide these States \nwith some resources so that, in fact, an assessment can be made, and so \nthat we just do not dump kids in these facilities. And if they are in \nthese facilities because they really have committed a crime, and they \nneed to be in such a facility--although there are many alternatives--\nthen we ought to make sure they get the treatment.\n  The second thing that I want to say, Mr. President, in this \nparticular case is this has been all contracted out to--I forget the \nname of the company--and I have to wonder about how we do this. I mean, \nI have to say, I am all for profit. I am all for a strong private \nsector, especially the more small business focused it is, the more I \nlike it. But when you are talking about juveniles, they are supposed to \nbe receiving additional help.\n  They are supposed to get the educational and vocational \nopportunities. And they are supposed to be able to receive the kind of \nsupport services that will enable them, when they are 15 or 16 and \nafter they have been in these facilities, to get out and rebuild their \nlives.\n  I have to tell you, America, that I do not think too many of these \nkids are going to be able to do that. And, frankly, if they went in \nmixed up, having made a mistake, having done something they should not \nhave done, they are going to come out very different. You might not \nwant to meet them at 10 p.m. at night.\n  I think what we are doing in some of these facilities is so \nshortsighted, it is so myopic, it is such a big mistake. Yes, hold \npeople accountable. And if people commit crimes and should be in a \ncorrections center, so be it. But you know what? There are certain \nstandards of decency. There are certain standards about how we treat \nyoung people. Every one of these children is some mother's child, is \nsome father's child. I do not care whether they are in Lula, LA, or in \nCalifornia, New York, Minnesota, or any other State.\n  Now, one of the things in Minnesota that I will brag on a little bit, \nalthough it is not heaven on Earth, we have tried very hard to do an \nassessment at the front end of the system and look for alternatives to \nincarcerating kids. I just think it is an area that even if we don't \nwant to look at--sometimes we don't want to know what we don't want to \nknow--we better look at this with our eyes open. These are kids. These \nare kids. A lot of them shouldn't be there. A lot of them are \nstruggling with mental problems. A lot of them aren't getting any care \nwhatever. We are talking about the criminalization of mental illness.\n  Above and beyond that, the other issue I point out is that the \noverall conditions of this facility are unconscionable. I want to make \nit clear again to the warden and to Louisiana, it is not just \nLouisiana. I know that. That just happened to be my first visit. But I \ndo have to tell you that after 3 hours--and I don't think I am naive; I \nhave done a lot of organizing in a lot of communities with a lot of \npeople who have struggled on the bottom--I have to tell you I was \nreeling for 3 hours there. I believe we have to do better. I am looking \nforward to introducing this legislation and maybe it will be an \namendment on this bill. I hope I will get good support from my \ncolleagues.\n  I thank both of my colleagues from Louisiana, in particular, for \nbeing supportive, talking with me about the trip, and their very strong \ninterest in working with officials in Louisiana to make things better. \nThere are some people in Louisiana State government who are absolutely \ncommitted to doing that. I know that. I certainly hope, as a Senator \nwith an interest in this area, I can help out with their efforts.\n  What I can't, however, forget, as I speak on the floor of the Senate, \nis what I saw. I saw conditions that I didn't think existed today in \nAmerica. I saw kids living under conditions that should not be. Kids \nshouldn't be assaulted or beaten up for no good reason. That will take \nus nowhere.\n  There are new people who are moving in as security guards. There are \nchanges that are being made. But I tell you, the sooner the better; the \nsooner the better. That is one of the reasons I speak on the floor of \nthe Senate to try to help make these changes happen.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, notwithstanding the previous order, I ask \nunanimous consent, detecting no other Senator wishing to speak, I may \nbe permitted to continue for 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8550-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n CONGRATULATING THE 22D AIR REFUELING WING, McCONNELL AFB, WICHITA, KS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Men and \nWomen of the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base in \nWichita, Kansas. The crew at the 22d won recognition as the top KC-135 \nmaintenance team in the world at a recent competition known as the Air \nMobility Rodeo. This is an event sponsored by the Air Mobility Command. \nIt is an accomplishment that requires skill, training, leadership, \nteamwork, pride, professionalism and unselfish dedication to the task \nat hand. I take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge their great \nsuccess and professionalism.\n  The Air Mobility Rodeo is a binannual, multinational event that is \ndesigned to develop and improve techniques and procedures that enhance \nair mobility operations--something that is very crucial in today's \nworld. In this year's competition at McCord Air Force Base, the \nparticipants included more than 2,500 competitors formed in 80 teams \nfrom over 300 active duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve command, Air \nNational Guard, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, and other Allied Nations. \nWinning this award is an important event worthy of real recognition. \nWhat also makes this such an important win is that for the 22d, it is a \nrepeat win for this team. They walked away with the prize in the 1996 \ncompetition as well. And this leads me to say there is no question that \nthe KC-135 aircraft at McConnell are the best maintained in the world.\n  Let me acknowledge the leadership at Team McConnell because without \ntheir leadership and guidance, the atmosphere at McConnell would never \nsupport the effort required to win this competition. The two key \nplayers are the Wing Commander, Col. Michael C. Gould, and the Senior \nEnlisted Advisor, Chief Master Sergeant Herbert V. Williams, Jr. Anyone \nwho has been around the military understands how much the senior \nleadership of an organization sets the tone for the entire command.\n  There is one other member of the team whose contribution I want to \nrecognize. That member is Lead Crew Chief, Sergeant Jeffery Gass. He \nwas singled out for special recognition and was selected as Air \nMobility Command's Crew Chief of the year.\n  It is men and women such as Sgt. Gass who make our military the most \nsuccessful in the world. They are the unsung heroes--quietly working in \nthe background, exceptionally professional, dedicated to their service \nand their nation, and serving the communities where they are stationed. \nThe award nomination for Sgt. Gass is testimony to his unselfish \ndedication, his professional knowledge, and his service to his country \nand the local community.\n  I am particularly proud to recognize this team from McConnell Air \nForce Base and Sgt. Gass not only because they contribute so much to \nthe defense of our nation but because they contribute so much to \nWichita and Kansas. Well done to the 22nd Air Refueling Wing and well \ndone to Sgt. Gass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8552-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE MARINE ACTION IN CENTCOM FOR NEO OPERATIONS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to compliment the men and \nwomen of our sea services, the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy, on \nan operation recently conducted. It was about a month ago in the \nAfrican country of Eritrea. I think we should all be very proud of the \nway the Navy and the Marine Corps team responded to what I refer to as \na 911 call, to execute an evacuation operation, commonly called a NEO, \nin that part of the world in Africa. It resulted from the unrest that \nthis country, Eritrea, has had with its neighbor, Ethiopia. Let me \nhighlight the action as it unfolded.\n  On the evening of the June 5 of this year, the marines and sailors of \nthe 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, part of a forward-deployed \nAmphibious Ready Group, received what is called a warning order. A \nwarning order is a ``heads up'' that a specific tasking is about to \ncome your way and you had better start thinking about the mission that \nis contained in the warning order. That mission was the removal of \nAmerican citizens from Eritrea because of the increasing unrest, as I \nhave indicated, with Ethiopia. The marines, who had just finished \nconducting an exercise in Jordan, began their preparations right off \nthe bat.\n  At 3:30 in the afternoon of the 6th of June, the commanding officer, \nColonel T.L. Moore, as ordered by General Anthony Zinni, the Commander \nin Chief of the U.S. Central Command, launched two C-130 aircraft along \nwith 30 marines and sailors from this expeditionary unit. They arrived \nin Asmara, Eritrea, and began removing U.S. citizens and personnel from \nother countries. At 11:50 p.m., on that same day, the mission was \ncomplete.\n  What mission?\n  These superb marines and sailors removed from harm's way, and to \nsafety, 105 American citizens, 24 Norwegians, 20 who were British, 8 \nCanadians, 3 Ethiopians, 3 Japanese, 1 Korean, 1 Mexican, and 1 Swedish \ncivilian. I am told the C-130s were proudly flying the Stars and \nStripes in regards to this mission instead of their usual command \nbanner strictly as a matter of pride in their mission and their nation.\n  Also as part of this continuing effort, the U.S.S. Tarawa got \nunderway at 3 p.m. on the 6th and steamed at full speed to the coast of \nEritrea to wait for any further requests for NEO assistance in case any \nmore problems did, simply, come up.\n  I think the remarkable thing about the Tarawa is that the ship did \nactually prepare for this mission and got underway in less than 72 \nhours.\n  There was not any fanfare in the press about this. There were no \nstories in the media about the successful effort or pride of our men \nand women involved in this important mission. I think probably too many \ntimes the only military stories we hear about are some isolated event \ninvolving a service member that creates a negative headline, or some \ncontroversial issue, like today we are hearing over the media that \nsomehow or other we are going to lessen or keep or improve or make more \nstringent the rules of the military in regards to adultery.\n  I just wanted to take this opportunity to share this mission with my \ncolleagues because it reflects, I think, the pride and the \nprofessionalism that is the standard of the vast majority of the \nmembers of our Armed Forces. It is so infrequent that we in the \nCongress really salute these fine Americans.\n  So, Semper Fi and Bravo Zulu to the men and women of the 11th Marine \nExpeditionary Unit, the U.S.S. Tarawa, and all other members of our \nCorps and Navy involved in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8552-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8552-S8553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues some headlines that are in today's press in reference to the \nproblems that we are experiencing, the challenge we face, what could be \na real tragedy in Kosovo. As I look at this, here is a headline from \nthe Washington Post, as of this morning, written by R. Jeffrey Smith of \nthe Post foreign service: ``Thousands Flee As Lawlessness Spreads In \nKosovo.'' And it gives an up-front and personal account in regards to a \nparticular Albanian citizen who has lived there for 40 years and was \nbeaten in the middle of the night, and what is going on in that \ncountry.\n\n  Here is another headline from the Washington Times as of today, by \nPhilip Smucker of the Washington Times: ``Kosovar Rebels Grow Bolder.''\n\n       A grimy-faced teenager with bloodshot eyes and an automatic \n     rifle ran at us, screaming, as we came down a hill into the \n     heart of a raging firefight yesterday, on the bloodiest \n     weekend of the Kosovo war.\n\n  Here is another headline from the European Stars and Stripes: \n``Fighting Flares In Kosovo.''\n  From the New York Times: ``Rebels Claim First Capture Of Kosovo \nCity.''\n  Last week I had an intelligence briefing on Kosovo. They indicated if \nthis happened, in regards to Pristina, and also in regards to \nOrahovac--I am having a little trouble with the pronunciation, but it \nis indicative of many of the communities there. So we have the fighting \nthat has actually spread.\n  Here is another article from the European Stars and Stripes: ``SFOR \nPatrols Bosnian Border for Gun-Running.'' That is the situation in \nBosnia. Of course right down from Bosnia, we have the situation in \nregards to Kosovo.\n  I am concerned about this because I think the United States and the \nrest of\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\nour allies in Western Europe are on the verge of a deep and expensive \nand very dangerous involvement in yet another area of the Balkans. \nUnfortunately, and once again, I have yet to hear from the executive, \nand from the administration--more especially the President--to explain \nto the Congress nor, more important, the American people, why is this \nin our vital national interest to get in the middle of this growing \nconflict.\n  I think I can make a pretty good case in that regard, because I just \nreturned from the three new prospective NATO countries--Poland, the \nCzech Republic and Hungary--with the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, Senator Shelby. To a person, every \nofficial whom we met with in those three countries indicated that what \nNATO does with regard to Kosovo and what we continue to do in Bosnia is \nthe real test of NATO: What it will be; what it will do; what our \ninvolvement will be; if, in fact, we have a Palestinian kind of \nsituation in the middle of Europe with Bosnia and Kosovo; whether or \nnot we can end this kind of ethnic strife.\n  So I think you could probably make a case for our involvement in \nKosovo, but I have yet to hear from anybody in the administration other \nthan reacting to news accounts or to questions. I think it is time we \nheard.\n  On the other side of it, we don't want to back into a situation where \nthere is no end in sight, no exit strategy, and no real consideration \nin terms of cost and involvement.\n  The media reports are very clear that the Yugoslavian leader, Mr. \nMilosevic, is taking very hard and brutal action against the ethnic \nAlbanians who are living in Kosovo. They comprise 90 percent of the \npopulation. This is the same kind of activity that he promoted in \nregards to Bosnia and the breakup there.\n  We are making some diplomatic efforts. We have people there working \novertime, but these efforts seem to keep changing. We have drawn \nseveral lines in the sand with threats of severe reprisals if the \nSerbian action against the Albanian population does not cease, and \nthose lines in the sand are still there, they have been gone over, and \nthe activity continues. So much for any kind of believability in \nregards to our commitment.\n  The Albanian rebels, known as the KLA, are simply growing in strength \nand the fighting is growing more fierce. There is no real peaceful \nsolution in sight. The United States and NATO have threatened military \naction and they have had a military demonstration. It was a fly-over or \nfly-by. It was called ``Determined Falcon.'' I really don't know how \ndetermined that falcon is, but neither side has offered to end the \nconflict and efforts to bring them to the table to get a solution have \nfailed. In fact, the KLA is really, I think, buoyed by the apparent \nWestern support for their cause. Obviously, they are not interested in \nbacking off now.\n  Mr. Milosevic, having observed our unwillingness to carry out our \nthreats in the past, and coupled with the strong support of the Serbian \npeople to put an end to the rebel uprising in Kosovo, has no reason to \nback off, either. So we have a standoff.\n  We have now started an international monitoring program in Kosovo \n``aimed at bringing peace to this strife-torn region.''\n  Mr. President, I want everybody to understand this. This is a very \nimportant development. This observer group is comprised of about 40 \ndiplomats and ``military experts'' attached to embassies in Belgrade. \nOur ``military experts'' are unarmed U.S. military forces from the \nEuropean Command. This means we have U.S. personnel now in this kind of \na situation.\n  I was reading press reports about it several days ago, and they are \nin white cars, very clearly marked. You hope, obviously, the white cars \nwill be very clearly marked so they will avoid any kind of hostilities. \nIn other words, if you are traveling in a white car and either side \nwants to do great mischief--and that is probably not the right word for \nit--why certainly, obviously, they would be highlighted.\n  I have several concerns, Mr. President, about all of this: We are, \nonce again, backing into a military commitment in regard to Kosovo. The \nterm of ``unarmed military observers or experts'' certainly brings back \nsome memories of other situations where we have backed into those \nconflicts. It is deja vu all over again. We are running a great risk \nthat our ``military experts'' or diplomats could be in harm's way.\n  NATO is conducting contingency planning that could involve thousands \nof military troops to separate the warring factions or impose peace. I \nmust tell you, in talking to a British general at the ceremony \ncelebrating the 50th anniversary of the Berlin airlift, when I was \ntalking about this, I asked the general, ``How many people would it \ntake to really maintain order on that border?'' And there have been \nestimates of anywhere from 7,000 to 25,000. It is very difficult \nterrain.\n  He said, ``Oh, my no, it would take upwards of 70,000.''\n  ``Seventy thousand?'' My mouth, obviously, dropped a little bit.\n  He said, ``Of course, we don't intend on doing that.'' But, of \ncourse, then we didn't intend on doing that in other rather political \ninvolvements of gradualism that we have had around the world, and I am \nnot going to spell those out in specific terms. I think everybody here \nknows what we are talking about. So we have those contingency plans \nthat could involve thousands of military troops.\n  The costs, both in dollars and the impact on our already-stressed \nmilitary, are potentially very devastating. I remember the briefing \nthat we had in regard to India and Pakistan, and our esteemed Secretary \nof State Madeleine Albright was talking about the related situation in \nregard to Kosovo and indicated that we might have to become much more \ninvolved there.\n  Senator Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, said, ``Wait a minute, we do not have the \nmoney, we do not have the funds, we do not have the materiel, we do not \nhave the men and women in uniform to get the job done. We are already \ncommitted in the gulf. We are already committed in Bosnia. Most of \nthose funds in the past have been taken out of the readiness account--\nwe are not paying for it--and that is a real problem.'' I think the \nSenator's sense of urgency in his response to the Secretary was well \ntaken.\n  There are many unanswered questions on how this conflict in Kosovo is \nin our vital national interest. Let me stress vital national interest. \nI do think it is in the best interest of NATO. I think we have to be \nvery careful; I think we have to be very firm.\n  Senator Lieberman, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, and \nthe former distinguished majority leader in the Senate and my colleague \nand longtime friend, Bob Dole, indicated we must take aggressive and \nvery positive action. There are unexplained scenarios of Kosovo leading \nto a larger war in Europe if this conflict is not ended now.\n  But my primary concern in bringing this up, Mr. President, is this: \nThis whole issue has yet to be addressed by the President and, for that \nmatter, to some extent by this Congress in any way. Yet, here we are \nbacking into a situation with ``military observers'' and with \ncontingency plans that could involve thousands more. The President \nshould not, nor will the Congress let him, commit the men and women of \nour Armed Forces without defining our national interests. That is \nfundamental, and I think we ought to spell that out. I call for the \nPresident to do so and to outline the objectives in the exit strategy \nfor any involvement in that part of the world and in regard to Kosovo \nin particular.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8552-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8553-S8554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound \nconcern for the International Criminal Court that was overwhelmingly \napproved in Rome late on Friday. I was pleased that the United States \nvoted against final passage of this global criminal court. The \nAdministration should be commended for rejecting this international \nfolly, which would have been dead on arrival in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, however, the danger from this Court has not passed. \nThe Administration is already coming under pressure from proponents of \nthe court to reconsider its opposition. Even more disturbing is the \npossibility that the Court would assert jurisdiction over American \nsoldiers, despite the American refusal to join the court. The \nAdministration should ``just say no'' to any efforts to get the United \nStates to reconsider or to signal any informal compliance with the \nCourt.\n  As both a Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as \nChairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and \nProperty Rights, I find the International Criminal Court profoundly \ntroubling. If there is one critical component of sovereignty it is the \nauthority to define crimes and punishments. This Court strikes at the \nheart of sovereignty by taking this fundamental power away from \nindividual countries and giving it to international bureaucrats.\n  There are other aspects of this Court that are equally troubling. As \nexamples, the authorization of international independent prosecutors, \nthe expense of such a permanent court, and the lack of any clear limits \non the Court's jurisdiction are all alarming. But no aspect of this \nCourt is more troubling than the fact that it has been framed without \nany apparent respect for--indeed, in direct contravention of--the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  As Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, I have a number of \nparticular concerns about the Court. First and foremost, I remain \nconcerned by the possibility that Americans could be dragged before \nthis Court and denied the protections of the Bill of Rights.\n  Even more fundamentally, I am concerned that the Administration \nparticipated in these negotiations without making any effort to insist \nthat the proposed International Criminal Court incorporate and honor \nthe Bill of Rights. Even if one concedes that we need an International \nCriminal Court--which I emphatically do not--we should certainly insist \non respect for the Bill of Rights as the price of American admission.\n  America's ideals and values are ascendant in the post-Cold War world. \nAmerica's position as world leader is, in no small part, a product of a \nConstitution that is the envy of the world. The Administration should \nbe justly proud of that Constitution and should have insisted that \nthose principles form the cornerstone for any International Criminal \nCourt. That unfortunately was not the official position of this \nAdministration.\n  In the United States, there is a right to a jury of your peers. In \nthe United States, there is a privilege against self-incrimination. In \nthe United States, we have eliminated the prospect of criminal \nliability for ill-defined common law crimes. In the United States, the \nConstitution limits the authority of prosecutors. None of these \nprotections will be guaranteed for defendants brought before this \ninternational star chamber.\n  The proposed Court negotiated in Rome neither reflects nor guarantees \nthe protections of the Bill of Rights. The Administration was right to \nreject the Court and must remain steadfast in its refusal to join a \ncourt that stands as a rejection of American constitutional values. We \nmust never trade away American sovereignty and the Bill of Rights so \nthat international bureaucrats can sit in judgment of the United States \nmilitary and our criminal justice system.\n  In today's New York Times, there is an opinion piece in which Anthony \nLewis chastises the United States for missing a historic opportunity by \nfailing to vote in favor of the International Criminal Court. The \nauthor states that the vote to form the International Criminal Court \n``will be seen as a turn in the road of history.'' That is perhaps the \nonly point in the piece with which I agree. The approval of this Court \nwas indeed ``a turn in the road of history.'' By ceding the authority \nto define and punish crimes, many nations took an irrevocable step to \nthe loss of national sovereignty and the reality of global government. \nI, for one, am heartened to see that the United States took the right \nturn on the road of history, and I will work hard to ensure that there \nis no backtracking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8554-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The United States today has become the world's largest \n     debtor nation.\n       (4) The United States merchandise trade deficit is \n     characterized by large bilateral trade imbalances with a \n     handful of countries.\n       (5) The United States has one of the most open borders and \n     economies in the world. The United States faces significant \n     tariff and nontariff trade barriers with its trading \n     partners. The United States does not benefit from fully \n     reciprocal market access.\n       (6) The United States is once again at a critical juncture \n     in trade policy development. The nature of the United States \n     trade deficit and its causes and consequences must be \n     analyzed and documented.\n\n     SEC. 403.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place at the end of the bill insert:\n       Sec. 311. (a) This section applies to the following \n     officials:\n       (1) The Architect of the Capitol.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Senate\n       (3) The sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate.\n       (4) The Public Printer.\n       (5) The Director, and the Executive Director, of the United \n     States botanic Garden.\n       (b)(1) Not later than March 30, 1999, each official named \n     in subsection (a) shall submit to Congress a list of each \n     activity that----\n       (A) is to be performed by or for the official in fiscal \n     year 2000;\n       (B) is not an inherently governmental function; and\n       (C) is----\n       (i) performed by a Federal Government source on September \n     30, 1998; or\n       (ii) initiated after that date, if one or more Federal \n     government sources are to be considered for selection as the \n     source to perform the activity.\n       (2) Each list shall include (for each activity listed)----\n       (A) the number of full-time employees (or its equivalent) \n     that would be necessary for the performance of the activity \n     by a Federal Government source; and\n       (B) the name of a Federal Government employee responsible \n     for the activity from whom additional information about the \n     activity may be obtained.\n       (c) An activity is not required to be included on an \n     official's list under subsection (b) if the activity, as \n     determined by the official----\n       (1) is to be performed as a Federal Government response to \n     a national emergency declared by the President or Congress;\n       (2) is to be performed for the official by a privat3e \n     sector source pursuant to a contract or other agreement \n     entered into by the head of another department or agency of \n     the Federal Government; or\n       (3) is the provision of items that should be produced, \n     manufactured, or provided, or services that should be \n     provided, by a Federal Government source for reasons of \n     national security (including reasons relating to the \n     acquisition, processing, or analysis of intelligence in the \n     national security interests of the United States).\n       (d) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Federal Government source'', with respect to \n     performance of an activity, means any organization within the \n     Federal Government that uses Federal Government employees to \n     perform the activity.\n       (2)(A) The term ``inherently governmental function'' means \n     a function that is so intimately related to the public \n     interest as to require performance by Federal Government \n     employees.\n       (B) The term includes activities that require either the \n     exercise of discretion in applying Federal government \n     authority or the making of value judgments in making \n     decisions for the Federal government, including\n\n[[Page S8557]]\n\n     judgments relating to monetary transactions and entitlements. \n     An inherently governmental function involves, among other \n     things, the interpretation and execution of the laws of the \n     United States so as--\n       (i) to bind the United States to take or not to take some \n     action by contract, policy, regulation, authorization, order, \n     or otherwise;\n       (ii) to determine, protect, and advance United States \n     economic, political, territorial, property, or other \n     interests by military or diplomatic action, civil or criminal \n     judicial proceedings, contract management, or otherwise;\n       (iii) to significantly affect the life, liberty, or \n     property of private persons;\n       (iv) to commission, appoint, direct, or control officers or \n     employees of the United States; or\n       (v) to exert ultimate control over the acquisition, use, or \n     disposition of the property, real or personal, tangible or \n     intangible, of the United States, including the collection, \n     control, or disbursement of appropriated and other Federal \n     funds.\n       (C) The term does not normally include----\n       (i) gathering information for or providing advice, \n     opinions, recommendations, or ideas to Federal Government \n     officials; or\n       (ii) any function that is primarily ministerial and \n     internal in nature (such as building security, mail \n     operations, operation of cafeterias, housekeeping, facilities \n     operations and maintenance, warehouse operations, motor \n     vehicle fleet management operations, or other routine \n     electrical or mechanical services).\n       (3) The term ``private sector source'', with respect to the \n     operation of a facility owned by the Federal Government, \n     includes a contractor that is operating, or is to operate, \n     the facility.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nBrownback, in offering this amendment. What we seek to do with this \namendment is quite simple: require the legislative branch to identify \nits commercial functions that are performed in-house.\n  For the past several years, I have been the primary Senate sponsor of \nthe Freedom from Government Competition Act. That legislation would \ncodify the 40 year old administrative policy in place for the executive \nbranch which requires: (1) Federal agencies to identify their \ncommercial activities; and (2) Conduct public/private competitions to \ndetermine whether the private sector or government employees can \nprovide the ``best value'' to the American taxpayer. Unfortunately, \nthis policy, now found in OMB Circular A-76, is routinely ignored by \nmany federal executive agencies. In fact, OMB recently issued another \ncall for federal agencies' commercial inventories, its third request in \nthe last several years. That's why Senator Brownback and I have been \nworking to get this policy into statute.\n  Today, Senator Brownback and I seek to extend some of these \nrequirements to cover the legislative branch. In fact, we know that \nthere are over one million federal executive branch employees engaged \nin commercial work. But since this policy doesn't apply to the \nlegislative branch, we don't know how many legislative branch employees \nare doing commercial work, how much that work costs or whether the work \ncould be done more efficiently by the private sector. This amendment \nwill help us gather that information and make the legislative branch \nplay by the same rules as the rest of the federal government.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this good government, common sense \nreform.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Thomas and I \nhave offered would simply require the Architect of the Capitol, the \nSecretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, the Public \nPrinter, and the Director of the United States Botanic Garden to submit \nto Congress an inventory of all noninherently governmental--or \ncommercial--activities.\n  Throughout this session of Congress, my colleague from Wyoming and I \nhave been working on S. 314, also known as the Federal Activities \nInventory Reform (FAIR) Act, which would require the Federal agencies \nto do the same. My subcommittee, the Oversight Subcommittee on \nGovernment Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia has \nheld three hearings focusing on this legislation. More recently, the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee reported this bill out of \ncommittee. This bill has bipartisan support, the support of the \nAdministration, as well as Federal employees and the industry \ncommunity.\n  Through our work on this issue, we concluded that this requirement \nshould apply to the legislative branch as well. Last month, OMB asked \nall Federal agencies to submit their commercial inventory to OMB. The \nlegislative branch should do the same and submit their inventory to \nCongress.\n  The Thomas-Brownback amendment tasks those who are engaged in the \ndaily operations of the legislative branch to identify these commercial \nactivities. Once these activities are identified, the heads of these \nlegislative branch departments, along with the Senators, will have the \nopportunity to evaluate these functions.\n  Past discussions concerning these activities in the legislative \nbranch have focused only on specific targets such as the Senate Barber \nShop and Beauty Salon. In order to have a comprehensive view of how to \nimprove operations in the legislative branch, we need to know all \ncommercial activities performed in-house.\n  As the legislative body of the Federal Government, we, as Congress \nhave the opportunity to not only legislate on this issue, but to set an \nexample. I challenge my colleagues who are committed to ensuring that \nno taxpayer's dollar is wasted in the Federal Government, to set this \nexample and support this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say, it was with some reservations that I sent this \namendment to the desk. But that was the agreement of the managers that \nwas made on Friday, that we would adopt this amendment. Therefore, I \nask to carry out their agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3224) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2138, the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999.\n  The bill, as reported provides $1.6 billion in new budget authority \nand $1.3 billion in outlays for the Senate and other legislative branch \nagencies, including the Library of Congress, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Government Printing Office, among others. As a matter \nof comity, the bill does not include funding for operations of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  When outlays from prior year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the bill totals $2.4 billion in budget authority \nand outlays. The bill is under the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation $38 \nmillion in budget authority and at its allocation for outlays.\n  I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Legislative Branch Subcommittee for producing a bill that is \nsubstainially within their 302(b) allocation. I am pleased that this \nbill continues to hold the lien on congressional spending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record \na table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of S. 2137, as \nreported. I urge the Senate to support this bill and refrain from \noffering amendments that would cause the subcommittee to violate its \n302(b) allocation.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           S. 2137, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS, 1999 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL          \n                                   [Fiscal year 1999, in millions of dollars]                                   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory   Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n  Budget authority............................................  .......      2,361   .......        94     2,455\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......      2,328   .......        94     2,422\nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority............................................  .......      2,399   .......        94     2,493\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......      2,328   .......        94     2,422\n1998 level:                                                                                                     \n  Budget authority............................................  .......      2,257   .......        92     2,349\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\n                                                                                                                \n  Outlays.....................................................  .......      2,209   .......        92     2,301\nPresident's request                                                                                             \n  Budget authority............................................  .......      2,472   .......        94     2,566\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......      2,411   .......        94     2,505\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority............................................  .......      2,330   .......        94     2,424\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......      2,302   .......        94     2,396\n                                                                                                                \n               SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO                                                                 \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority............................................  .......        -38   .......  .........      -38\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......  ..........  .......  .........  .......\n1998 level:                                                                                                     \n  Budget authority............................................  .......        104   .......         2       106\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......        119   .......         2       121\nPresident's request                                                                                             \n  Budget authority............................................  .......       -111   .......  .........     -111\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......        -83   .......  .........      -83\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority............................................  .......         31   .......  .........       31\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......         26   .......  .........       26\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN CRS WEB SITE INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Availability of Information.--\n       (1) In general.--The Director of the Congressional Research \n     Service shall make available on the Internet, for purposes of \n     access and retrieval by the public, all information that--\n       (A) is available through the Congressional Research Service \n     web site;\n       (B) is described in paragraph (2); and\n       (C) is not confidential as determined by--\n       (i) the Director; or\n       (ii) the head of a Federal department or agency that \n     provided the information to the Congressional Research \n     Service.\n       (2) Information.--The information referred to in paragraph \n     (1)(B) is as follows:\n       (A) All Congressional Research Service Issue Briefs.\n       (B) All Congressional Research Service Reports that are \n     available to Members of Congress through the Congressional \n     Research Service web site.\n       (C) All Congressional Research Service Authorization of \n     Appropriations Products or Appropriations Products.\n       (3) Removal of information; changes and updates.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the \n     Director of the Congressional Research Service may--\n       (A) remove from the information required to be made \n     available on the Internet under this section the name of, \n     phone number of, and information regarding, an employee of \n     the Congressional Research Service;\n       (B) remove from the information required to be made \n     available on the Internet under this section, any material \n     the Director determines may infringe the copyright of a work \n     protected under title 17, United States Code; and\n       (C) make any changes or updates in the information required \n     to be made available on the Internet under this section that \n     the Director determines are necessary to ensure that the \n     information is accurate.\n       (b) Time.--The information shall be so made available not \n     earlier than 30 days after the first day the information is \n     available to Members of Congress through the Congressional \n     Research Service web site.\n       (c) Requirements.--The Director of the Congressional \n     Research Service shall make the information available in a \n     manner that the Director determines--\n       (1) is practical and reasonable; and\n       (2) does not permit the submission of comments from the \n     public.\n       (d) Method of Public Access.--The public shall have access \n     to the web page containing Congressional Research Service \n     information that is available to the public only through the \n     Library of Congress' THOMAS web page (http://thomas.loc.gov). \n     The Director of Congressional Research Service shall work \n     with the Librarian of Congress to establish an appropriate \n     Internet link to carry out this subsection. The Director of \n     Congressional Research Service shall be responsible for \n     maintaining and updating the web page containing \n     Congressional Research Service products. The Director of \n     Congressional Research Service shall have sole discretion to \n     edit the web page based on the criteria established by this \n     Act. The Librarian of Congress shall have the responsibility \n     of working with the Director of Congressional Research \n     Service only to the extent necessary to establish the link \n     from the THOMAS web page to the public access Congressional \n     Research Service web page. Nothing in this Act may be \n     construed to interfere with the Librarian's normal duties \n     concerning THOMAS.\n       (e) Further Approval Not Required.--Notwithstanding the \n     first proviso under the subheading ``salaries and expenses'' \n     under the subheading ``Congressional Research Service'' under \n     the heading ``LIBRARY OF CONGRESS'' under title I of this Act \n     (relating to prior approval of certain publications), the \n     Director shall make information available in accordance with \n     this section without the prior approval of the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration of the Senate or the Committee on \n     House Oversight of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment to HR 4112 would direct \nthe Director of the Congressional Research Service to post ``CRS \nReports to Congress'' and ``CRS Issue Briefs'' on the Internet. My \nintention for offering this amendment would be to establish a web site \nfor the public to access CRS products only through the THOMAS web site. \nThis amendment is co-sponsored by Senators Coats, Leahy, Faircloth, \nAshcroft, Kerrey, Robb, Feingold, Abraham, Enzi, and Wyden.\n  I believe that it is important that the public be able to use this \nCRS information. For FY 1999, the American taxpayers will pay $67.9 \nmillion to fund CRS' operations. CRS is well-known for being composed \nof expert specialists who write reports on the important policy issues \nof the day that are both factual and unbiased--a rarity for Washington. \nThe public has a right to see that its money is being well-spent and \nhas the right to see the product of thier labors.\n  The CRS products can play an important role in educating the American \npublic. Public access to these documents will mark an important \nmilestone in opening up the federal government. Our constituents will \nbe able to see the research documents that influenced our decisions and \nunderstand the trade-offs and factors that we consider before a vote. \nThis will give the public an accurate view of Congress, instead of the \ncurrent cynical view that sometimes prevails.\n  Also, constituents can learn a lot from these products. They can \nreceive a concise, accurate summary of the issues before Congress. As \nelected representatives, we should do what we can to promote an \ninformed, educated public. The educated voter is best able to make \ndecisions and petition us to do the right things here.\n  I would also like to make my colleagues aware that in many cases \nthese products are already out on the Internet. ``Black market'' \nprivate vendors can charge $47 for a single report. Other web sites \nhave outdated CRS products on them. It is not fair for the American \npeople to have to pay a third party for out-of-date products that they \nhave already footed the bill for.\n  I know that my colleagues in the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration have proposed that Senators and Committee chairman be \nallowed to post CRS products as they see fit on the Internet. I \nappreciate that gesture, and believe that it is a first step. However, \nI am proposing this amendment as a way to take this process to the next \nlogical step--a centralized web site.\n  A centralized web site will make it much easier for the public to \nfind CRS information. The public can just go to a web site and look up \nthose products that interest them. That would be much easier than \nhaving them go through all of our web sites to find CRS reports. This \nweb site will be attached to the Congressionally mandated THOMAS web \nsite, so that our\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\nconstituents can find legislation and the relevant CRS products--simple \none-stop shopping.\n  A centralized web site will also present the information in a \nnonpartisan format. I know that cynical constituents will look at the \nCRS reports on a Member's web page, and believe that those products are \nonly put up to gain adherents to a particular political position. CRS \nis a nonpartisan organization, and its work should be presented on a \nnon-partisan web site. This will allow the public to see CRS as it \ntruly is, not as a political organization.\n  This bill also gives the Director of CRS discretion to protect \nhimself from liability suits. The Director will be allowed to remove \nthe names and phone numbers of a CRS employee to keep the public from \ndistracting them from doing their jobs. I have also been informed that \nCRS may not have permission to release copyrighted information over the \nInternet. While I hope that this situation can be quickly resolved, I \nhave included a provision in the bill to allow the Director to remove \nunprotected copyrighted information from the bill. Finally, I have \nallowed a 30 day delay between the release of these CRS products to \nMembers of Congress and the public. This will allow CRS to revise their \nproducts and make sure that it is accurate and up-to-date before \nreleasing it to the public.\n  Opponents of this legislation have tried to accuse this bill of \nviolating the ``Speech or Debate'' Clause of the Constitution. I find \nthis argument to be complete and total nonsense. When I first \nintroduced this bill, I submitted a letter from Stanley M. Brand, the \nformer General Counsel to the House of Representatives, who has \nexperience in litigating ``Speech or Debate'' cases. I would like to \nre-submit his letter for the Record, and highlight his quote that:\n\n       I believe that the concerns expressed . . . are either \n     overstated, or the extent they are not, provide no basis for \n     arguing that protection of CRS works will be weakened by your \n     bill.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be made part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Brand, Lowell & Ryan,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1998.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to amplify the comments \n     that I recently made to the press concerning applicability of \n     the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 6, cl. \n     1, to certain CRS products which your bill would, if enacted, \n     make available on the Internet. Juliet Eilperin, Memo Claims \n     That McCain Legislation to Put CRS Reports Online Could Have \n     Constitutional Problems, Roll Call, January 15, 1998, p. 8.\n       First, as General Counsel to the House of Representatives I \n     litigated virtually scores of cases involving the Speech or \n     Debate Clause, including a landmark case before the Supreme \n     Court reaffirming the central function of the clause in \n     protecting the legislative branch from judicial and executive \n     branch interference, United States  v. Helstoski; 442 U.S. \n     477, Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.S. 500 (1979); see also, \n     Vander Jagt v. O'Neill, 699 F.2d 1166 (D.C. Cir. 1983); In Re \n     Grand Jury Investigation, 587 F.2d 589 (3d Cir. 1978); United \n     States v. Eilberg, 507 F. Supp. 267 (E.D. Pa. 1980); Benford \n     v. American Broadcasting Co., 98 F.R.D. 42 (D. Md. 1983), \n     rev'd sub nom. In Re: Guthrie, 735 F.2d 634 (4th Cir. 1984). \n     Many of these cases which I litigated were cited in the CRS \n     memorandum as supporting their conclusion that publication on \n     the Internet would adversely affect the Speech or Debate \n     Clause privilege.\n       I believe that the concerns expressed in the CRS memorandum \n     are either overstated, or the extent they are not, provide no \n     basis for arguing that protection of CRS works will be \n     weakened by your bill. I also want you to know that I was, \n     and remain, a strong advocate for vigorous assertion and \n     protection of the Speech or Debate Clause privilege as a \n     great bulwark of the separation of powers doctrine that \n     protects the Congress from Executive and Judicial branch \n     encroachment.\n       The CRS memorandum states ``extensive involvement by CRS in \n     the informing function might cause the judiciary and \n     administrative agencies to reassess their perception of CRS \n     as playing a substantial role in the legislative process, and \n     thereby might endanger a claim of immunity even in an \n     instance in which CRS was fulfilling its legislative \n     mission.''\n       This fear is simply unfounded. While the courts have \n     consistently relegated the so-called ``informing function'' \n     to non-constitutionally protected status, they have also \n     steadfastly refused to permit litigants to pierce the \n     privilege for activities that are cognate to the legislative \n     process despite later dissemination outside the Congress. So, \n     for example, McSurely v. McClellan, 553 F.2d 1277, 1286 n.3 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1976)(en banc), the Court refused to allow a \n     litigant to question Senate aides about acts taken with the \n     Committee, even though acts of dissemination outside the \n     Congress were subject to discovery. Publication of a CRS \n     product on the Internet would no more subject CRS employees \n     to questioning about the basis for their work, consultations \n     with colleagues or the sources of that work, than would be \n     the case if the same CRS product were obtained by means other \n     than the Internet. Indeed, the fact that House and Senate \n     proceedings are televised does not alter the applicability of \n     the clause to floor speeches, committee deliberations, staff \n     consultation, or other legislative activities. Even certain \n     consultations concerning press relations are protected though \n     dissemination to the media is not protected. Mary Jacoby, \n     Hill Press Releases Protected Speech, Roll Call, April 17, \n     1995, p. 1 (the Senate Legal Counsel argued that because a \n     legislative discussion is embedded in a press release doesn't \n     entitle a litigant to question staff about the substance of \n     the legislation); see also Tavoulareas v. Piro, 527 F. Supp. \n     676, 682 (D.D.C. 1981) (court ordered congressional deponents \n     to merely identify documents disseminated outside of Congress \n     but did not permit questions regarding preparation of the \n     documents, the basis of conclusions contained therein, or the \n     sources who provided evidence relied upon in the documents), \n     Peroff v. Manual, 421 F. Supp. 570, 574 (D.D.C. \n     1976)(preparation of a Committee witness by a congressional \n     investigator is protected because ``facially legislative in \n     character''). Under this line of caselaw, it is difficult to \n     foresee how the mere dissemination of a CRS product could \n     subject any CRS employee to inquiry concerning the \n     preparation of such a product. In short, because ``discovery \n     into alleged conduct of [legislative aides] not protected by \n     the Speech or Debate Clause can infringe the [legislative \n     aides'] right to be free from inquiry into legislative acts \n     which are so protected,'' McSurely v. McClellan, 521 F.2d \n     1024, 1033 (D.C. Cir. 1975), aff'd en banc by an equally \n     divided court, 553 F.2d 1277 (1976) courts have imposed the \n     Clause as a bar to any inquiry into acts unrelated to \n     dissemination of the congressional reports.\n       In Tavoulareas v. Piro, 527 F. Supp. at 682, the court \n     ruled ``[t]he fact that the documents were ultimately \n     disseminated outside of Congress does not provide any \n     justification'' for piercing the privilege as to the staff's \n     internal use of the document. Accord McSurely v. McClellan, \n     553 F.2d at 1296-1298 (use and retention of illegally seized \n     documents by Committee not actionable); United States v. \n     Helstoski, 442 U.S. 477, 489 (1979) (clause bars introduction \n     into evidence of even non-contemporaneous discussions and \n     correspondence which merely describe and refer to legislative \n     acts in bribery prosecution of Member); Eastland v. United \n     States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U.S. at 499 n. 13 (subpoena to \n     Senate staff aide for documents and testimony quashed because \n     ``received by [the employee] pursuant to his official duties \n     as a staff employee of the Senate'' and therefore ``. . . \n     within the privilege of the Senate''). See also United States \n     v. Hoffa, 205 F. Supp. 710, 723 (S.D. Fla. 1962), cert. \n     denied sub nom Hoffa v. Lieb, 371 U.S. 892 (wiretap withheld \n     from defendant by ``invocation of legislative privilege by \n     the United States Senate'').\n       In the Tavoulareas case, in which I represented the House \n     deponents, part of the theory of plaintiff's case against the \n     Post was that the reporter ``laundered'' the story through \n     the committee ``as a means of lending legitimacy'' to the \n     stories and information provided by other sources, \n     Tavoulareas v. Piro, 93 F.R.D. at 18. In pursuance of \n     validating this theory, the plaintiff sought to prove that \n     the committee never formally authorized the investigation, \n     but rather that the staff merely served as a conduit and \n     engaged in no bona fide investigative activity. The court \n     ruled that ``although plaintiffs have repeatedly suggested \n     that the subject investigation was not actually aimed at \n     uncovering information of valid legislative interest . . . it \n     is clear that such assertions, even if true, do not pierce \n     the legislative privilege.''\n       As a practical matter, therefore, a litigant suing or \n     seeking to take testimony from a CRS employee based on \n     dissemination of a report alleged to be libelous or \n     actionable may be unable to obtain the collateral evidence \n     needed to prove such a claim--a serious impediment to \n     bringing such a case in the first place.\n       Even in the case of Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306 (1973) \n     relied on by the CRS memorandum to support its narrow view of \n     the Clause's protection, the Court of Appeals on remand \n     stated: ``Restricting distribution of committee hearings and \n     reports to Members of Congress and the federal agencies would \n     be unthinkable.'' 566 F.2d 713, 718 (D.C. Cir. 1977). It \n     would be similarly unthinkable to subject CRS to broad \n     ranging discovery simply because its work product was made \n     available on the Internet.\n       The CRS memorandum raises the specter that litigants might \n     even seek ``the files of CRS analysts'' in actions \n     challenging the privilege. It is beyond peradventure of \n     doubt, however, that publication of even alleged defamatory \n     or actionable congressional committee reports does not \n     entitle a litigant to legislative files used or created in \n     preparing such a report. United States v. Peoples Temple of \n     the Disciples of Christ, 515 F. Supp. 246, 248-49 (D.D.C. \n     1981) In re: Guthrie, Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, \n     773 F.2d 634 (4th Cir.\n\n[[Page S8560]]\n\n     1984), Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U.S. \n     at 499, n. 13. Given the foregoing caselaw, I fail to see a \n     realistic threat that CRS employees will be subjected to any \n     increased risk of liability, or discovery of their files. Of \n     course, nothing can prevent litigants from filing frivolous \n     or ill-founded suits, but their successful prosecution or \n     ability to obtain evidence from legislative files seems \n     remote and nothing in your bill would change that.\n       The CRS memoranda even goes so far as to suggest that \n     claims of speech or debate immunity for CRS products might \n     lead to in camera inspection of material, itself an incursion \n     into legislative branch discretion. Yet in the very case \n     cited to by CRS memo, no court ordered in camera inspection \n     of House documents. In Re: Guthrie, supra, involved no in \n     camera inspection of legislative documents. These cases are \n     typically litigated on the basis of the facial validity of \n     the privilege and few, if any, courts of which I am aware \n     have even gone so far as to order in camera inspection. See \n     United States v. Dowdy, 479 F. 2d 213, 226 (4th Cir. 1973) \n     (``Once it was determined, as here, that the legislative \n     function . . . was apparently being performed, the \n     proprietary and motivation for the action taken as well as \n     the detail of the acts performed, are immune from judicial \n     inquiry''). Under the Clause, courts simply do not routinely \n     resort to in camera review to resolve privilege disputes. \n     Given the now highly developed judicial analysis of the \n     applicability of the Clause to modern legislative practices \n     it rarely occurs. In one recent celebrated case cited to by \n     the CRS, the Court upheld a claim of privilege for tobacco \n     company documents obtained by Congress even though they were \n     alleged to have been stolen, without ever seeking in camera \n     review. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Williams, 62 F.3d \n     408, 417 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (``Once the documents were received \n     by Congress for legislative use--at least so long as \n     congressmen were not involved in the alleged theft--an \n     absolute constitutional ban of privilege drops like a steel \n     curtain to prevent B from seeking discovery'').\n       In an abundance of caution, and to address CRS' concerns, \n     you might consider adding the following language to the bill: \n     ``Nothing herein shall be deemed or considered to diminish, \n     qualify, condition, waive or otherwise affect applicability \n     of the constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, or any other \n     privilege available to Congress, its agencies or their \n     employees, to any CRS product made available on the Internet \n     under this bill.''\n       I appreciate the CRS sensitivity to subjecting its \n     employees, or their work product, to searching discovery by \n     litigants. Based on the very good caselaw protecting their \n     performance of legislative duties and the strong \n     institutional precedent in both the House and Senate in \n     defending CRS against such intrusions, I do not believe your \n     bill creates any greater exposure to such risks than already \n     exists.\n       I hope my views are helpful in your deliberations on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stanley M. Branch.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in addition, I would like to point out \nthat the Rules Committee has approved a decentralized system, where \nSenators can release CRS products on their private web pages. I see no \ndifference between the release of CRS material on one hundred \nindependent web pages and THOMAS, a Congressionally mandated web page. \nBoth approaches should protect CRS equally.\n  I also urge my colleagues not to believe other arguments that CRS \nwill suffer from a huge rise in workload from this amendment. It will \nrequire only two computer technicians to set up this web site, and keep \nit updated. CRS already has a process for deciding which information \ngoes up on their web site for Members of Congress. This bill only asks \nthat they duplicate this process for a public version of that web page. \nAlso, we release paper copies of these products to our constituents \nevery day without causing a great strain to CRS staff. Finally, I have \nthe results of an analysis of state legislative research organizations \nthat do work similar to CRS and post these products on the Internet. \nNone of these organizations have complained of a huge increased \nworkload from releasing their products to the Internet.\n  In conclusion, I would like to point out that a centralized web site \nhas been endorsed by the Congressional Accountability Project, the \nLeague of Women Voters, the American Council on Education, the American \nLibrary Association, the American Association of Engineering Societies, \nIBM, America Online Corporation, Intel Corporation, The Washington \nPost, The Dallas Morning News, The Arizona Republic, and a host of \nother groups, businesses, and newspapers interested in maintaining an \ninformed electorate. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It \nwill give CRS wide discretion to set up a nonpartisan centralized web \nsite that will benefit the public and allow it to continue to do its \ngreat work for us.\n  Madam President, the number of people who use the Internet is \nincreasing geometrically every single month. More and more Americans, \nespecially young Americans, are relying on the Internet for \ninformation. Since we spend $67 million a year in turning out the best \npossible information we can from Members of Congress, it seems to me at \na very, very modest cost we should share that information with our \nconstituents on the Internet at the web site that is already \ndesignated, the so-called THOMAS web site.\n  It is hard for me to understand why the Rules Committee has refused \nto act in an affirmative fashion on this issue. I hope we will be able \nto consider this amendment and that we will be able to have a voice \nvote on it and move forward and make this thing happen. If not, \nobviously, we will have to come back and back and back, but I have no \ndoubt that the American people overwhelmingly, especially those who use \nthe Internet to obtain information for themselves, for their \nclassrooms, for their associates, for their families, should be privy \nto the same information that we are and that we provide our \nconstituents in written form when requested rather than have to leaf \nthrough each of the 100 different web sites of Senators. It is time we \ncaught up with the technology that is changing America. It is past time \nwe caught up in a broad variety of ways, and this is one way we can do \nit.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Senator from Virginia if he seeks the floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I do \nseek the floor. I would like to make a reply for the record on the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague. First, might I inquire of my \ncolleague--I came as quickly as I could when I saw that Senator McCain \ntook the floor--is his amendment now on file? Have the yeas and nays \nbeen requested?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senator from Virginia asks the \nquestion about Senator McCain's amendment. The yeas and nays were not \nrequested, to my knowledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. They have not been requested.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The circumstances, I say to the Senator from Virginia, \nwill preclude a vote on that amendment if cloture is granted at 10 a.m. \ntomorrow morning. If it is not granted, then he will be in a position \nto ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, in fairness to my colleague from \nArizona, even though I am in opposition, did he seek to have an up-or-\ndown vote? I think we should extend the courtesy to him.\n  Mr. STEVENS. With due regard to the Senator's request, Madam \nPresident, the pending cloture vote would, if it is approved, mean that \nthere would not be a vote on that amendment as it is not germane to the \nlegislative appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I understand that, so I guess the \nSenator clarified as best he can the status of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is important at this time as chairman of the \nRules Committee to put into the Record some comments that I have.\n  Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that if the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Ford, desires to put something \nin, the Record be made available to his entry, as well as the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. Both of these \nSenators have done a great deal of work on this and are in opposition \nto the McCain amendment. So I make that unanimous consent request in \nthe event that they wish to do so.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, as I understand it, I would have to \nobject.\n  Does the Senator wish to have an opportunity for those two Senators \nto make a statement today or put them in the Record?\n  Mr. WARNER. Just to put them in the Record.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection to that, nor do I have objection if \nthe Senators wish to come now and speak. But I would object to keeping \nthe Senate in session very much longer because we know we have a series \nof very long days coming now. Tuesday and Wednesday are going to be \nvery long, and it is\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\nour understanding the Senate will not be in session beyond 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will momentarily notify Mr. Ford.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry? I \nunderstand the Senate will stand in adjournment following the statement \nof Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Recognizing the distinguished Senator from Alaska wants \nto be brief, I will simply say this is a very important recommendation \nthat the Senator from Arizona has made. It has been carefully studied \nby the Rules Committee. I, as chairman; Mr. Ford, as ranking member, we \nhave taken a position in opposition--not to the ultimate goals sought \nby the distinguished Senator from Arizona, but to the time with which \nsuch a goal could likely be achieved. Second, we are still studying the \nissue and we are concerned that this proposal would take the Member out \nof the sequence of making this information available to the public. As \nI read the McCain request, it would mandate that the CRS and its \nDirector would send a great deal of material---reports and issue \nbriefs--right into the Internet system. No Member would be interposed \nbetween the recipients of that information and the Director of CRS.\n  That concerns this Senator a great deal, because if I am out there \nand come up on the system and access some of this information, it reads \nthat the Director of the CRS put it out. Who is he? Of course, we all \nknow that the CRS is a part of the Library of Congress. It was created \nfor the purpose of accommodating the important needs of Members of \nCongress, committees, and their respective staffs. Suddenly, this \ninformation takes on the imprimatur that the Director takes this \nposition on an issue, as opposed to a Member sending it out and the \nrecipient contacting the Member.\n  So we, the Rules Committee, felt we should take a first step and \ntherefore, on June 10, we sent to all Members of the Senate a Dear \nColleague letter stating that we had now set up a system electronically \nwhereby the CRS could, at the Member's request, transfer certain CRS \nproducts to a Member's web site.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Rules and Administration,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: The Committee on Rules and Administration \n     wishes to advise all Senators of their ability to make \n     Congressional Research Service (CRS) products available to \n     the public via Member and Committee Internet web sites.\n       As you know, CRS works exclusively for Congress and is \n     prohibited from disseminating its work directly to the \n     public. However, in accordance with a longstanding policy in \n     the Senate, Members can and often do release CRS products to \n     the public as part of their constituent service activities.\n       With the rapidly expanding use of the Internet, we believe \n     it is appropriate for Members and Committees to use their web \n     sites to further disseminate CRS products. The Rules \n     Committee has worked with CRS to develop a system to \n     facilitate the posting of CRS products on Member and \n     Committee web sites. We invite you to visit the Rules \n     Committee web site at http://www.senate.gov/rules/ to view \n     our posting of CRS products and we encourage you to post CRS \n     products on your web site.\n       It is our intent to evaluate the public interest in this \n     feature and the accompanying impact on CRS, Committees and \n     Member offices before considering additional ways to \n     electronically disseminate CRS products.\n       Robert Newlen of CRS can be reached at 7-4313 to coordinate \n     the posting of CRS products on your web site.\n           With kind regards,\n     John Warner,\n                                                         Chairman.\n     Wendell H. Ford,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n  Mr. WARNER. Also, I would like to have printed in the Record a letter \nby the Senator from Arizona and others, and a July 20 Dear Colleague \nfrom myself and Senator Ford. This will create a record of \ncorrespondence on this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent those be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 24, 1998.\n     Hon. John W. Warner, Chairman,\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Warner and Ford: We are writing to you in \n     reference to your recent letter allowing Senators and their \n     Committees to post issue Briefs and ``Congressional Research \n     Service (CRS) Reports to Congress'' on the Internet. While we \n     appreciate this first step to make this information available \n     to the pubic over the Internet, we are concerned that this \n     decentralized approach may end up hurting our shared goal of \n     giving the public electronic access to CRS products.\n       We have a number of concerns that we believe must be \n     addressed in order to ensure that CRS Reports and Issue \n     Briefs are put up on the Internet in a way that will benefit \n     both the American people and the Congressional Research \n     Service.\n       (1) We are concerned that CRS products will become \n     inherently politicized by a decentralized approach.\n       The major reason why the American public is clamoring for \n     CRS products is that they contain both accurate and \n     nonpartisan information abut important political issues--a \n     rarity for Washington. Our concern with a decentralized \n     approach is that it will inherently politicize CRS in the \n     eyes of the American people. Members and Committees will be \n     able to release CRS information as it suits their political \n     needs. It is a likely possibility that Members may not give \n     their constituents access to CRS products if they do not want \n     an issue discussed or if they disagree with the CRS analysis \n     of the issue. This will allow individual Senators to censor \n     what their constituents see. It will also mean that CRS \n     products will be publicly used to support Senators' political \n     positions, and give the public an inaccurate impression that \n     CRS is a partisan agency. If CRS becomes politicized, there \n     are important public and legal ramifications that must be \n     considered.\n       We want to ensure that CRS keeps its excellent nonpartisan \n     reputation. That is why we proposed in S. 1578 that CRS \n     remain in control of a centralized public access web site \n     that would be attached to a nonpartisan Congressionally \n     mandated site, such as either the THOMAS web site or the \n     United States Senate web site (www.senate.gov). CRS already \n     has a nonpartisan process for making its products available \n     electronically over the Senate intranet, and we believe that \n     it would be best to allow them to continue to use this \n     nonpartisan process for the public.\n       (2) A decentralized system will be confusing to \n     constituents.\n       There is no doubt that a decentralized system will confuse \n     constituents. Considering that different Members and \n     Committees may post different CRS products, it is almost \n     impossible for a constituent to find information about an \n     issue. Instead, they will become confused by the multiple \n     places they have to search. When faced with having to examine \n     possibly 580 web sites for information, the public is apt to \n     either give up or request a centralized web site.\n       We proposed a centralized web site based on the intranet \n     web page CRS has already established. This system will allow \n     constituents to search a general index based on what CRS has \n     already established in order to easily find products. This \n     will be less confusing for our constituents.\n       (3) A decentralized system may cause legal and liability \n     problems for CRS.\n       The strategy as outlined in your letter will leave \n     copyrighted information in the public CRS products. We have \n     been informed by CRS that this oversight will cause legal and \n     liability problems for CRS. On February 26, 1998, Daniel P. \n     Mulhollan, the Director of CRS, testified before your \n     committee that ``If a CRS product, containing substantial \n     copyrighted material (albeit with appropriate credit) is made \n     available to the general public without permission and \n     outside the confines of traditional fair use, liability is \n     possible.''\n       Furthermore, there is nothing in your plan that will remove \n     the names of CRS analysts from their products. During our \n     consultations, CRS requested that the names of these analysts \n     be removed in order to prevent the public from calling these \n     analysts with their complaints. We share CRS's concerns on \n     these issues, and would ask that you consider our proposals \n     to give the Director of CRS discretion to remove the names of \n     analysts and copyrighted information as he feels is \n     necessary.\n       (4) A decentralized system will be a logistical nightmare.\n       As alluded to earlier, we are concerned that a \n     decentralized system with no protocol from the Senate Rules \n     Committee will be a logistical nightmare. Different Members \n     and Committees may end up putting up the same CRS products, \n     while other products are not released to the public. If there \n     is no rule about updating CRS reports, the public may end up \n     seeing out of date CRS products that will misinform them or \n     even be a liability concern for CRS. Finally, there is \n     concern that there will be a drag on the Members' personal \n     and committee office staff as they select and update the web \n     pages.\n       We are also concerned that the restrictions in the Senate \n     Internet Usage Policies may obstruct your attempts at a \n     decentralized system. According to these restrictions: \n     ``During the 60 day period immediately preceding the date of \n     any primary or general\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\n     election (whether regular, special, or runoff) for any \n     national, state, or local office in which the Senator is a \n     candidate, no Member may place, update or transmit \n     information using a Senate Internet Server (FTP Server, \n     Gopher, and World Wide Web), unless the candidacy of the \n     Senator in such election is uncontested.''\n       This clearly prohibits Members from posting CRS products on \n     their web sites before elections. One-third of the Members of \n     the Senate will not be able to update what they have posted \n     during the biennial election cycle.\n       A centralized web site will solve all of these concerns. \n     CRS already has a uniform system for maintaining its \n     centralized intranet web site. This web site has prevented \n     much of the confusion that a decentralized web site would \n     entail. The legislation proposed by us during our discussions \n     with you would simply ask that CRS use its existing processes \n     to maintain a web site that the public could access through a \n     non-partisan Congressionally mandated web page. We know that \n     this proposal would only require 3 CRS staff and not involve \n     over 100 personal office and committee staff.\n       (5) A decentralized system may cost more than a centralized \n     system.\n       Our concern is that a decentralized system may incur the \n     same costs for CRS as a centralized system, while also being \n     a funding and time drag on personal and committee offices. \n     CRS will still have to use the same staff and resources \n     preparing products for public dissemination in either a \n     centralized or decentralized web site. However, the \n     decentralized proposal will also end up using valuable \n     personal and committee staff resources to post the products \n     on their web pages and update them.\n       While we appreciate your recent attempt to address the \n     issue of giving the public access to CRS products, we want to \n     make sure that this is not a mis-step. By using our proposal \n     for a centralized web site, we hope to work with you to \n     create a public venue for access to CRS products that will \n     give the Director of CRS greater discretion over the \n     dissemination of CRS products while also reducing the public \n     visibility of CRS. This will give the American public access \n     to the high quality information that they already pay for, \n     and still allow CRS to perform its statutory responsibility \n     to only serve Congress.\n       We look forward to your continued cooperation on this \n     issue, and hope to continue working with you to pass S. 1578 \n     and establish a centralized web site where the public can \n     access CRS products.\n           Sincerely,\n     John McCain.\n     Lauch Faircloth.\n     Patrick Leahy.\n     Mike Enzi.\n     Dan Coats.\n     Spencer Abraham.\n     Charles Robb.\n     J. Robert Kerrey.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Committee on\n\n\n                                     Rules and Administration,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: When the Senate considers the FY99 \n     Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, Senator McCain is \n     expected to offer an amendment that would mandate that the \n     Congressional Research Service (CRS) directly release certain \n     documents to the public through the THOMAS web site. As \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of the committee with oversight \n     of CRS, we have serious concerns regarding this amendment.\n       Let us state up front that we support the objective of \n     using technological advances to increase the availability of \n     CRS products to the public. Following testimony before the \n     Committee on Senator McCain's proposal, we announced a new \n     initiative designed to increase access to this information \n     while maintaining a long-standing policy that Congress, not \n     CRS, disseminate CRS products to the public. This initiative, \n     outlined in a June 10 letter which you have previously \n     received, increases public access by facilitating \n     dissemination of CRS information through member and committee \n     home pages.\n       The McCain amendment would make a radical change in CRS \n     policy by forcing CRS to directly disseminate material to the \n     public. CRS is not an independent agency. It is an extension \n     of our staff and was never intended to be an independent \n     source of legislative information for the public. Instead, \n     members communicate with their constituents and channel CRS \n     information products to them as the member determines it is \n     appropriate.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost \n     to CRS to implement this amendment would likely range between \n     $2 and $8 million dollars annually. This amendment would \n     create an entirely new mission for CRS--a public information \n     function that CRS is neither organized nor funded to perform. \n     The Rules Committee initiative, however, has minimal cost, \n     preserves the representational relationship between a member \n     and his or her constituents, and substantially increases \n     public access to CRS information products.\n       Furthermore, the Joint Committee on Library is nearing \n     completion of a report regarding this very matter. It would \n     be premature to adopt this amendment prior to the completion \n     of that report.\n       It is our intent to continue to evaluate the Rules \n     Committee initiative to determine the level of public \n     interest in CRS information products and to determine the \n     best approach for achieving broader dissemination while \n     preserving the historic role of CRS. We urge you to oppose \n     this amendment and allow the Committee to continue to work \n     with CRS to expand access to its products.\n       With kind regards,\n     Wendell H. Ford,\n       Ranking Member.\n     John Warner,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. This helps Members, then, to better understand the inner \nworkings of the Rules Committee, what we have done for Members, and \nwhat Senator McCain is endeavoring to do. It lays out my concerns that \nit is important that we run this initial test, whereby Members of the \nU.S. Senate can now put this material out or the committees of the \nSenate can put this material out. Let's make some assessment over the \nnext few months of what it costs, what staff are involved, and to the \nextent there is an interest out there in the public for this very \nvoluminous amount of information that is created by CRS. It may well be \nin the due course of time we will take a further step towards the goals \nMr. McCain has in his amendment.\n  So for the time being we oppose the amendment and ask Senators to \nentrust to the Committee on Rules and Administration the proper \nanalysis of the objective by Senator McCain, as well as the costs \nassociated with it and the desirability, in the public domain, for the \ndissemination of this information.\n  That concludes the remarks of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by \nmy colleague and good friend from Arizona. I do not do so because I \ndisagree with his goal of making the good work of the Congressional \nResearch Service available to the general public. Nor do I believe that \nthe American people should be prevented from seeing the kinds of \ndocuments we use every day to help us make difficult decisions here in \nCongress. The Senator from Arizona is nothing if not consistent in his \ncommitment to open government, and this current effort, like so many \nothers, is continued proof of his faith in those principles.\n  That said, however, I oppose this amendment because it attempts to \nsolve a problem that really doesn't exist. For years, all Members of \nCongress have had the opportunity to make CRS materials available to \nconstituents upon request. This arrangement has been beneficial to \neveryone concerned: citizens receive information on issues of interest; \nMembers of Congress are kept informed about the issues that concern \ntheir constituents; and the CRS--which is an extension of Congressional \nstaff and not a public agency--maintains the ability to study and \nexplain difficult issues for its primary audience, the Congress, \nwithout external pressure from groups with an interest in the issues \nthat CRS is charged with researching.\n  Of course, as technology has changed, CRS has been able to improve \nthe ways of delivering materials to Congress. While CRS still prints \nreports and delivers them to Congressional offices by hand and by mail, \nthose same reports are also now available to Members and staff via the \nInternet. Congress, similarly, can make use of technology and the \nInternet to distribute CRS materials to their constituents. There is no \nreason to switch from the procedure of allowing Members of Congress to \ninteract with their constituents with regard to CRS products to a \nsystem where CRS responds directly to the public.\n  That is why Senator Warner and I, as Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Rules Committee, recently circulated a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \nannouncing that the Rules Committee will be providing selected CRS \ndocuments to the public through a special link on the Committee Web \nsite and inviting Members and Committee Chairmen to investigate the \nfeasibility of doing the same with their Web sites.\n  Although it might seem like a big step for the Rules Committee and \nother offices to make CRS documents available on the Internet, the \ntruth is that our Web page is nothing more than a new twist on the old \nmethod of making CRS documents available to interested citizens. The \nonly difference is that, instead of using what Internet users call \n``snail mail,'' Members of Congress can make CRS materials available to \nconstituents at the click of a mouse or the press of a button.\n  What has not changed is the necessary participation of Member offices \nin the process. Without that participation--without the ability of \nMembers\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nand Committees to respond to constituent requests and to provide CRS \nproducts accordingly--CRS risks losing its status as an extension of \nour staff and the scholarly research and non-partisan analysis that are \nits hallmarks will be jeopardized.\n  That is why I think the pending amendment--which would remove \nCongressional offices from the equation and require that CRS prepared \nand maintain a central public Website for its products--is flawed. What \nis worse, requiring CRS to put all of its products on the Internet \nwould cost millions of dollars--money that could be put to better use \nin recruiting new CRS analysts to replace those who will be eligible to \nretire shortly after the turn of the century. I simply cannot \nunderstand why CRS should be saddled with a project of this size when \nwe in Congress already have the means to use existing technology to \nsignificantly improve the traditional method of distributing CRS \nproducts.\n  Madam President, as Ranking Member of the Rules Committee I have had \nseveral opportunities to hear out my colleague from Arizona on this \nissue. I urge him and any colleagues who support this amendment to \nfollow the lead of the Rules Committee in offering CRS products to \nconstituents via the Internet. As of now, no other Senate Committee--\nincluding the Commerce Committee, chaired by my colleague from \nArizona--has taken advantage of the offer by CRS to assist Committee \nand Member offices with online access to CRS products.\n  Madam President, I have always believed that ``if it ain't broke, \ndon't fix it''--and until it is clear that Committee- and member-\nsponsored online distribution of CRS products is inadequate, I do not \nthink we should expend the energy of the Senate--or the resources of \nthe CRS--on such a questionable solution. I urge my colleagues to \noppose the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8558-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2330.

This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\n     People's Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the \n     average fine is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual \n     income. Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China, including any official of the Communist \n     Party or the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     its regional, local, and village authorities (except the head \n     of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on credible \n     information, has been involved in the establishment or \n     enforcement of population control policies resulting in a \n     woman being forced to undergo an abortion against her free \n     choice, or resulting in a man or woman being forced to \n     undergo sterilization against his or her free choice.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to a national of the People's \n     Republic of China if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     no funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department of State for fiscal year 1999 for the United \n     States Information Agency or the United States Agency for \n     International Development may be used for the purpose of \n     providing travel expenses and per diem for the participation \n     in conferences, exchanges, programs, and activities of the \n     following nationals of the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) The head or political secretary of any of the following \n     Chinese Government-created or approved organizations:\n       (A) The Chinese Buddhist Association.\n       (B) The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.\n       (C) The National Congress of Catholic Representatives.\n       (D) The Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference.\n       (E) The Chinese Protestant ``Three Self'' Patriotic \n     Movement.\n       (F) The China Christian Council.\n       (G) The Chinese Taoist Association.\n       (H) The Chinese Islamic Association.\n       (2) Any military or civilian official or employee of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China who carried out \n     or directed the carrying out of any of the following policies \n     or practices:\n       (A) Formulating, drafting, or implementing repressive \n     religious policies.\n       (B) Imprisoning, detaining, or harassing individuals on \n     religious grounds.\n       (C) Promoting or participating in policies or practices \n     which hinder religious activities or the free expression of \n     religious beliefs.\n       (b)(1) Each Federal agency subject to the prohibition in \n     subsection (a) shall certify in writing to the appropriate \n     congressional committees, on a quarterly basis during fiscal \n     year 1999, that it did not pay, either directly or through a \n     contractor or grantee, for travel expenses or per diem of any \n     national of the People's Republic of China described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Each certification under paragraph (1) shall be \n     supported by the following information:\n       (A) The name of each employee of any agency of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China whose travel \n     expenses or per diem were paid by funds of the reporting \n     agency of the United States Government.\n       (B) The procedures employed by the reporting agency of the \n     United States Government to ascertain whether each individual \n     under subparagraph (A) did or did not participate in \n     activities described in subsection (a)(2).\n       (C) The reporting agency's basis for concluding that each \n     individual under subparagraph (A) did not participate in such \n     activities.\n       Sec. 9013. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China described in section 9012(a)(2) (except the \n     head of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014. In this subtitle, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives.\n\n         Subtitle C--Monitoring of Human Rights Abuses in China\n\n       Sec. 9021. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Political \n     Freedom in China Act of 1998''.\n       Sec. 9022. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``[a]buses include torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     incommunicado detention''.\n       (D) ``[p]rison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``[a]lthough the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``[n]onapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups * * * experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``[s]erious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia[, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``[o]verall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n       Sec. 9023. (a) The Secretary of State, in all official \n     meetings with the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China, should request the immediate and unconditional release \n     of Ngodrup Phuntsog and other prisoners of conscience in \n     Tibet, as well as in the People's Republic of China.\n       (b) The Secretary of State should seek access for \n     international humanitarian organizations to Drapchi prison \n     and other prisons in Tibet, as well as in the People's \n     Republic of China, to ensure that prisoners are not being \n     mistreated and are receiving necessary medical treatment.\n       (c) The Secretary of State, in all official meetings with \n     the Government of the People's Republic of China, should call \n     on that country to begin serious discussions with the Dalai \n     Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, on the \n     future of Tibet.\n       Sec. 9024. (a) There is authorized to be appropriated for \n     fiscal year 1999, $1,100,000 for support personnel to monitor \n     political repression in the People's Republic of China in the \n     United States Embassies in Beijing and Kathmandu, as well as \n     the American consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, \n     Chengdu, and Hong Kong.\n       (b) Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of \n     appropriations in subsection (a) are in addition to any other \n     amounts appropriated or otherwise available in fiscal year \n     1999 for the personnel referred to in that subsection.\n       Sec. 9025.

Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Trade Deficit Review Commission Act''.\n       Sec. 402. Findings. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States continues to run substantial \n     merchandise trade and current account deficits.\n       (2) Economic forecasts anticipate continued growth in such \n     deficits in the next few years.\n       (3) The positive net international asset position that the \n     United States built up over many years was eliminated in the \n     1980s. The United States today has become the world's largest \n     debtor nation.\n       (4) The United States merchandise trade deficit is \n     characterized by large bilateral trade imbalances with a \n     handful of countries.\n       (5) The United States has one of the most open borders and \n     economies in the world. The United States faces significant \n     tariff and nontariff trade barriers with its trading \n     partners. Current overall trade balances do\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\n     not reflect the actual competitiveness or productivity of the \n     United States economy.\n       (6) Since the last comprehensive review of national trade \n     and investment policies was conducted by a Presidential \n     commission in 1970, there have been massive worldwide \n     economic and political changes which have profoundly affected \n     world trading relationships. Globalization, the increased \n     mobility of capital and technology, the role of transnational \n     corporations, and the outsourcing of production across \n     national boundaries, are reshaping both the comparative and \n     competitive trade advantages among nations.\n       (7) The United States is once again at a critical juncture \n     in trade policy development. The nature of the United States \n     trade deficit and its causes and consequences must be \n     analyzed and documented.\n       Sec. 403. Establishment of Commission. (a) Establishment.--\n     There is established a commission to be known as the Trade \n     Deficit Review Commission (hereafter in this title referred \n     to as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Commission is to study the \n     causes and consequences of the United States merchandise \n     trade and current account deficits and to develop trade \n     policy recommendations for the 21st century. The \n     recommendations shall include strategies necessary to achieve \n     United States market access to foreign markets that fully \n     reflects the competitiveness and productivity of the United \n     States and also improves the standard of living of United \n     States citizens.\n       (c) Membership of Commission.--\n       (1) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of 12 \n     members of whom--\n       (A) 1 Senator and 2 other persons shall be appointed by the \n     President pro tempore of the Senate upon the recommendation \n     of the Majority Leader of the Senate;\n       (B) 1 Senator and 2 other persons shall be appointed by the \n     President pro tempore of the Senate upon the recommendation \n     of the Minority Leader of the Senate;\n       (C) 1 Member of the House of Representatives and 2 other \n     persons shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (D) 1 Member of the House of Representatives and 2 other \n     persons shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (2) Qualifications of members.--\n       (A) Appointments.--Persons who are appointed under \n     paragraph (1), other than a person who is a Senator or Member \n     of the House of Representatives, shall be persons who--\n       (i) have expertise in economics, international trade, \n     manufacturing, labor, environment, business, or have other \n     pertinent qualifications or experience; and\n       (ii) are not officers or employees of the United States.\n       (B) Other considerations.--In appointing Commission \n     members, every effort shall be made to ensure that the \n     members--\n       (i) are representative of a broad cross-section of economic \n     and trade perspectives within the United States; and\n       (ii) provide fresh insights to analyzing the causes and \n     consequences of United States merchandise trade and current \n     account deficits.\n       (d) Period of Appointment; Vacancies.--\n       (1) In general.--Members shall be appointed not later than \n     60 days after the date of enactment of this Act and the \n     appointment shall be for the life of the Commission.\n       (2) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall not \n     affect its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner as \n     the original appointment.\n       (e) Initial Meeting.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold its first meeting.\n       (f) Meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the call of the \n     Chairperson.\n       (g) Chairperson and Vice Chairperson.--The members of the \n     Commission shall elect a chairperson and vice chairperson \n     from among the members of the Commission.\n       (h) Quorum.--A majority of the members of the Commission \n     shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.\n       (i) Voting.--Each member of the Commission shall be \n     entitled to 1 vote, which shall be equal to the vote of every \n     other member of the Commission.\n       Sec. 404.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nDaniel K. Akaka, I would like to say a few words about Mr. Kenji Sumida \nwho is retiring next month from the post of President of the East-West \nCenter in Honolulu, Hawaii. The East-West Center is a national \neducation and research institution established by the United States \nCongress in 1960 to promote better relations and understanding among \nthe nations of Asia, the Pacific and the United States.\n  During his tenure as President of the East-West Center, Mr. Sumida \neffectively led the Center through a particularly difficult period of \nreduced funding and budget cuts while maintaining and building upon the \nCenter's reputation as the premiere United States institution dealing \nwith major issues in the Asia-Pacific region. He substantially \nincreased the visibility of the Center in Washington, DC and reached \nout to the Center's many alumni in the United States and throughout the \nAsia-Pacific region.\n  In addition to his leadership role at the East-West Center, Mr. \nSumida has served his native State of Hawaii in numerous other \ncapacities, including high-ranking administrative posts at the \nUniversity of Hawaii, the State of Hawaii, and City and County of \nHonolulu; director of administration of the Pacific International \nCenter for High Technology Research; and chief of staff and commander \nof the Hawaii Air National Guard, retiring with the grade of Brigadier \nGeneral. His long-standing involvement and commitment to numerous \ncommunity service activities is commendable.\n  In all of his pursuits, Kenji Sumida has worked tirelessly and \nconscientiously to create bonds of friendship, respect and mutual \nunderstanding in his home state and the nation, as well as with our \nneighbors in Asia and the Pacific.\n  We would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to Kenji Sumida for an \noutstanding career of service to our great nation and to extend our \nbest wishes in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8576-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8576-S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THERE THEY GO AGAIN: WILL TRIAL LAWYERS STIFLE YEAR 2000 SOLUTIONS?\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to address the imminent \nwave of Year 2000 lawsuits that will flood our courts and enrich \nthousands of trial lawyers at the expense of American consumers. I also \nrise to commend President Clinton for his announcement that he will \npropose legislation to shield businesses from lawsuits based on \ninformation shared in efforts to solve these so-called Y2K problems.\n  Based on the information that I have received, I believe that his \napproach is too narrow, but it is a step in the right direction.\n  It is a step away from greedy trial lawyers and litigation towards \ncreative computer programmers and solutions.\n  We face the so-called millennial glitch--the Year 2000 problem--\nbecause most software programs cannot recognize dates after December \n31, 1999.\n  Over the past twenty years, to save computer memory that was \nprohibitively expensive, programmers shortened the date field in \nsoftware programs to hold only the last two digits of the year.\n  This glitch will cause computer systems to malfunction and to crash \nif these programs are not rewritten and fixed. Certainly, this is a \nmajor problem, one that has sent computer programmers scrambling for \nsolutions.\n  This is one of the most important issues before businesses, Mr. \nPresident, and the costs of Y2K compliance are estimated to be hundreds \nof billions of dollars. The junior Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, is \nto be commended for his fine work on the Year 2000 subcommittee.\n  We will face computer chaos if these problems are not resolved before \nthe clock strikes midnight on December 31, 1999. We are looking at the \npossibility of power outages, frozen bank accounts, even the specter of \na global recession.\n  Unfortunately, though, the solutions are not all clear.\n  The efficient exchange of information among the involved parties--\nprogrammers, computer companies, and consumers--is critical. We will \nnever find solutions if all parties are not free to exchange all the \nrelevant information.\n  There is, however, a major hurdle to this critical exchange of \ninformation--the trial lawyers. The trial lawyers are excited by this \nYear 2000 problem.\n  The Gartner Group, a consulting firm, estimates that the costs of the \nY2K fix will run up to $600 billion, but that the legal costs--the \ntrial lawyer taxes--may explode to one trillion dollars.\n  Yes, Mr. President, $1 trillion for litigation.\n  The projected trillion dollars in legal fees is yet another ``trial \nlawyer tax'' that greedy plaintiffs' lawyers impose on the American \npeople in the form of increased costs inevitably passed on to \nconsumers.\n  The only jobs that the trial lawyers will create with their Year 2000 \nlawsuits are in the Lear jet factory as the orders come rolling in from \nthese millionaire trial lawyers.\n  The trial lawyers see another problem to exploit for financial gain, \nanother opportunity for personal enrichment at the expense of the \nnation.\n  The justifiable fear that businesses have of these trial lawyers is \nactually slowing down efforts to solve these critical problems.\n  The Washington Post reported that, ``Many companies have resisted \nexchanging technical advice with one another, delaying the pace of \nrepair work, because they fear costly litigation if the information \nthey provide inadvertently turns out to be inaccurate.''\n  So, if the Social Security checks are late and the power gets turned \noff because computer companies cannot share information with the \nFederal government, you can thank the trial lawyers and their greed.\n  The headlines may proclaim that the Social Security Administration is \nwell along in its Year 2000 progress, and it is amongst the more \nresponsive agencies, about 90 percent of the way to getting its \ncomputers ready.\n  However, Mr. President, the Treasury Department--not the Social \nSecurity Administration--prints Social Security checks. The bad news is \nthat Treasury is amongst the least responsive federal agencies to the \nY2K issue.\n  I hope that trial lawyers' greed won't leave older Americans \nshivering in the cold on New Year's Day in the year 2000 because \neveryone was too afraid of being sued to work together on a solution.\n  As I said, the threat of a tidal wave of expensive litigation is \nshutting down the exchange of information, which is\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nessential to a resolution of this issue. Further, however, the stampede \nof trial lawyers to the courthouse is also contributing to a shortage \nof qualified staff to deal with the issue.\n  Many specialized firms that could work on this issue--firms with the \ntechnical expertise to do this job--are, in fact, avoiding it because \nthey fear that they will become the target of the trial lawyers.\n  The pattern is a familiar one. Trial lawyers, many of whom sue on a \ncontingent fee basis that guarantees them a fixed percentage of their \nclient's award, look for the parties with the ``deep pockets.'' A \ncompany with deep pockets is likely to be sued even if its systems are \nworking properly.\n  It's the old ``supply chain'': if a supplier, partner, or customer \nwinds up with a Year 2000 problem, then the lawsuits will likely ripple \nall the way through the supply chain.\n  One lawyer involved in this Year 2000 litigation observed that, if \nthe problem drives the suppliers and customers into bankruptcy, the \nplaintiffs are likely to sue ``everyone standing around the dead \nbody.''\n  The lawyers are getting ready, Mr. President, and there have been \nlitigation summits in California.\n  In fact, Bill Lerach, known for the securities ``strike suits'' that \nprompted reform legislation, is already filing Year 2000 lawsuits. He \neven filed one against Symantec Corporation, the maker of the popular \nNorton Anti-Virus software. Symantec is a golden oldie for Mr. Lerach. \nHe sued this company in 1994 in one of his self-described ``favorite'' \nsecurities lawsuits.\n  This outstanding member of the plaintiffs' bar even sued the pop \nsingers ``Milli Vanilli'' for lip-synching its songs. He sued on behalf \nof fans who felt betrayed.\n  This courtroom crusader also sued Ragu for selling a ``fresh \nItalian'' salad dressing that wasn't fresh or Italian.\n  This is a man who paid $64,000 in fines for breaking electoral laws \nand paid court fines due to his lawsuit antics.\n  It's time to choose, Mr. President, between these trial lawyers and \nthe average Americans.\n  Do we stand with Mr. Lerach and his greedy band of litigators or with \nthe regular people who just want solutions to a problem that threatens \ntheir parents' Social Security checks?\n  I commend President Clinton for his proposal. I believe that we need \nsomething far more broad, but it is a first step, and I am ready to \nmove forward.\n  Let's tell the trial lawyers and their Gucci-loafered lobbyists that \nwe stand with the American people, not the special interests.\n  I'm worried about the Social Security checks getting out on time, not \nthe court papers getting in on time.\n  I want solutions, not lawsuits. I'm looking out for the American \npeople and their interests, not the trial lawyers and the special \ninterests.\n  The trial lawyers want to turn the Year 2000 issue into a lawsuit \n``House of Horrors'' but I'm here to deny them a building \npermit.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8576-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANNIVERSARY OF THE INVASION OF CYPRUS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President: Twenty four years ago today, \nTurkish troops invaded and divided the nation of Cyprus. This illegal \nand immoral division of Cyprus continues today--dividing a country and \ncreating instability in the Mediterranean.\n  During the early days of the Turkish occupation, six thousand Greek-\nCypriots were killed. Over two hundred thousand were driven from their \nhomes. Many of the missing, including some Americans, have never been \naccounted for.\n  Little has changed in the past quarter century. Today, forty thousand \nTurkish troops remain in Cyprus. The Greek-Cypriots who remain in the \nnorthern part of the island are denied basic human rights such as the \nright to a free press, freedom to travel, and access to religious \nsites.\n  I am disappointed that we have made no progress in ending the \noccupation of Cyprus. Earlier this year, there were reasons to be \nhopeful. We thought that possible European Union membership would made \nTurkey more receptive to peace talks. but Turkey is not on the short \nlist for EU membership--and Turkey responded by imposing preconditions \non any negotiations. So we are far as ever from a peaceful solution for \nCyprus.\n  This year, as we mark this somber anniversary, I urge my colleagues \nto join me in recommitting ourselves to bring peace to Cyprus.\n  First of all, we must continue to make the resolution of the Cyprus \nproblem a priority. President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright \nhave focused more attention on this region that any other \nAdministration. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and Ambassador Tom Miller \nhave done an excellent job trying to bring both sides together. As \nAmbassador Holbrooke assumes his new responsibilities at the United \nNations, we must encourage the Administration to replace him with an \nemissary of equal stature.\n  The secondary priority is that we must continue to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to the people of Cyprus. Each year, Congress \nprovides fifty million dollars to foster bicommunal cooperation in \nCyprus. These funds are used for education, health care, and to help \nboth communities to solve regional problems--such as to improve water \nand energy supplies.\n  The third priority is that Congress should pass the Enclaved People \nof Cyprus Act. Senator Olympia Snowe and I introduced this legislation \nto call for improved human rights for the Greek Cypriots living under \nTurkish control.\n  Mr. President: The crisis in Cyprus has brought two NATO allies to \nthe brink of war. The occupation is also a human tragedy that should \nenrage all of us who care about human rights. I urge my colleagues to \ncontinue to work toward a peaceful and unified Cyprus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8577-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AFRICA SEEDS OF HOPE ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to co-sponsor S. 2283 the \nAfrica Seeds of Hope Act. This bill offers us a rare opportunity to \nimprove a people's way of life. Introduced by my colleagues Senator \nDeWine and Senator Sarbanes, the Africa Seeds of Hope is landmark \nlegislation that will help feed a continent, but more importantly \nprovide the people of that continent with the tools of self-sustenance. \nThis bill not only validates our judgement as good legislators, but \nchallenges us to a higher standard.\n  S. 2283 designates organizations such as the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development and the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation to support rural finance, agricultural research, and food \nsecurity programs to increase food production and the capital of small \nscale African farmers and entrepreneurs. It also provides women, the \nfacilitators of agricultural growth in Africa, with improved resources \nto expedite development. Financial support for this program would \nemanate from a presently existing account and would not require any new \nfunds to be allocated.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to note a few crucial \nstatistics that are often overlooked, and that are shocking, \nparticularly in comparison with our own fortunate state. Today, on the \nbrink of the 21st Century and the new millennium, 215 million African \nmen, women and children go hungry. This is happening, Mr. President, at \na time during which the United States spends about one-half of 1 \npercent of the federal budget on foreign aid. And only one-tenth of 1 \npercent of that limited budget aids Africans, with a declining part \ngoing to agricultural development. If Africa is to achieve any kind of \nfood security, international agencies tell us, it must triple its food \nsupply by the year 2050. Africa cannot achieve this huge expansion on \nits own.\n  The global economy, for better and worse Mr. President, links \ntogether every nation and every people on this earth. We no longer have \nthe option, if we ever did, of closing our doors and shutting out any \npeople, let alone an entire continent. Support for the Africa Seeds of \nHope constitutes support for our own economy, our own people and our \nown principles. It will provide, not just meals and nutrition for a \nweek or a month, but the chance for a continent to rise and feed itself \nand eventually gain self-sustenance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8577-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8578-S8579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n                      RECOGNITION OF ``SPACE WEEK\"\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate ``Space Week'' \nand recognize the accomplishments of our nation's space programs over \nthe course of forty years of NASA space exploration.\n  As my colleagues may know, this month marks the 29th anniversary of \nthe Apollo 11 launch on July 16, 1969 which began one of man's greatest \nvoyages of exploration: the first flight to land a man on the moon. \nLike most Americans, I can recall my wonderment on July 20, 1969 when \nthe lunar module Eagle landed on the moon. Soon thereafter, Commander \nNeil Armstrong descended from Eagle to the moon's surface and declared \nthose memorable words, ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap \nfor mankind.''\n  Since that historic moment, NASA and its private sector partners have \nguided this nation to the forefront of aeronautical excellence. Today, \nthis nation's commitment to expanding the development of technology and \nlearning more about our vast universe remains as strong as ever.\n  My home state of Minnesota has earned a well-deserved reputation as a \nhigh-technology giant, making our job creators a perfect match with \nNASA. That NASA depends so heavily on the ingenuity and know-how of \nMinnesota's high-tech industries is a strong testament to the \ninnovative spirit of our citizens. I am particularly impressed at \nMinnesota's contributions to the space shuttle program, and I had the \nunique opportunity to witness their work first-hand last November, when \nI toured NASA's Florida facilities and viewed the launch of the space \nshuttle Columbia. I ask that the names of the 31 Minnesota firms \ncurrently working under NASA's space shuttle program be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The names follow:\n\n     3M Company Industrial Chemical Product (St. Paul, Minnesota)\n     ADC Telecommunications, Inc.

Minnesotans were there at the dawn of the Space Age, and I \nlook forward to the role our state will play as the next chapter of \nAmerica's space history, the era of the International Space Station, is \nwritten.\n  I believe the nation's space programs, such as the International \nSpace Station, represent important investments in America's future. The \nscientific and technological benefits of this ambitious initiative are \nimpressive and will produce a high rate of return on the American \ntaxpayers' investment in aeronautical and space programs. Among these \nbenefits, the space station will provide new insight into industrial \nresearch for air and water purification, waste management and \nrecycling, computer technology, and environmental engineering. Most \nnotable is the progress being made in the biomedical field.\n  The promise of a long-term, zero gravity environment has scientists \npoised to conduct research into the development of cures for diabetes, \ncancer, emphysema, and immune system disorders. Moreover, the study and \neventual findings of why astronauts who spend extended periods of time \nin space often experience weakening of their hearts and blood vessels \nmay lead to the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. It should \nalso be noted that the International Space Station is supported by many \nof this nation's most prominent medical and research organizations, \nincluding the American Medical Association, the Multiple Sclerosis \nAssociation of America, the American Medical Woman's Association, \nBristol-Myers Squibb, and Mount Sinai Medical Center. Clearly, the \nspace station promises to make significant contributions to the study \nof medicine.\n  Mr. President, the International Space Station will help to maintain \nU.S. leadership in space while promoting international cooperation. \nThis international laboratory in orbit will bring American, Russian, \nEuropean, Japanese, and Canadian astronauts together in search of a \ncommon goal: to develop further advances in science and technology that \nwill benefit future generations.\n  More importantly for the young people of America, the space station \nwill inspire greater interest in our nation's space programs. With this \nin mind, I would like to commend some of the colleges and universities \nin my home state of Minnesota for their commitment to encouraging the \ninvolvement of our country's future leaders in our aeronautical and \nspace industry.\n  Mr. President, since 1989, NASA has administered the ``Space Grant'' \nprogram to enhance aerospace research and education in the United \nStates. This program is an effective partnership among universities, \nthe aerospace industry, and federal, state, and local governments that \nassists in the recruitment and training of professionals in aerospace \nscience, engineering, and technology.\n  In my home state, the Minnesota Space Grant Consortium is comprised \nof nine academic institutions along with the Minnesota Department of \nTransportation. Those nine institutions are: Augsburg College, Bemidji \nState University, Bethel College, College of St. Catherine, Fond du Lac \nTribal and Community College, Macalester College, Normandale Community \nCollege, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and the University of \nSt. Thomas.\n  For the last several years, these institutions have worked \neffectively together to promote aerospace science through fellowships \nand scholarships, the development of new courses in Physics and \nGeology, the establishment of a new Space Studies minor among the \nconsortia members, and public lectures relating to space science and \nengineering.\n  I met recently with Emily Eelkema, a native of Minneapolis and a \nsenior at the University of Minnesota studying Aerospace Engineering. \nEmily is a participant in the NASA Academy on Aeronautics at the Dryden \nFlight Research Center in California, and was initially selected for \nthis honor through the Minnesota Space Grant Consortium.\n  Those selected for the NASA Academy are among the brightest students \nin the country and have expressed a deep interest in NASA aeronautical \nspace research. I was extremely impressed by Emily's grasp of Dryden's \nflight research program and her life-long interest in aeronautics and \nspace activities. I am encouraged to learn of her goals of becoming an \nastronaut and playing an important role in the design of a manned Mars \nmission. Her commitment to a career in this exciting field makes me \noptimistic about the future of our space program.\n  Mr. President, the commemoration of ``Space Week'' would not be \ncomplete without paying tribute to a true American hero, our colleague \nSenator John Glenn. On October 29, Senator Glenn will embark on a \nsecond journey into space, this time aboard the Space Shuttle \nDiscovery, as a Payload Specialist responsible for conducting space-\nbased research on aging. His work may lead to further understanding by \nscientists about the process of\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\naging, and help reduce the number of individuals requiring long-term \nmedical care in their later years.\n  Many deserving accolades have been placed upon Senator Glenn for his \naccomplishments throughout his career as a marine, the first American \nto orbit the Earth, and a United States Senator. I believe no \ncommendation has captured the essence of John Glenn's commitment to \npublic service than that bestowed upon him more than 35 years ago by \nPresident Kennedy during a visit to Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n  Upon presentation of NASA's Distinguished Service Medal to Lt. \nColonel Glenn, President Kennedy spoke of Glenn's historic orbital \nflight when he said, ``His performance was marked by his great \nprofessional knowledge, his skill as a test pilot, his unflinching \ncourage, and his extraordinary ability to perform the most difficult \ntasks under conditions of great physical stress and personal danger. \nHis performance in fulfillment of this most dangerous assignment \nreflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States.''\n  Mr. President, I encourage all Americans to reflect upon the benefits \nof our nation's space programs during this Space Week. As we approach \nthe 21st century, Americans can share a sense of national pride as we \nmove forward in our epic journey--a journey filled with uncertainty, \nyet with great promise--into the space frontier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8578-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to one of the international organizations being funded by the \nCommerce-State-Justice Appropriation bill, the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n  As many of my colleagues areaware, the OECD has its origins in the \nMarshall plan. While its original mandate was to help rebuild post-War \nEurope, over the years, the OECD has taught us that nations through \neconomic cooperation can take charge of their own destinies. Article 1 \nof the OECD Convention clearly states its mission, which is to have its \nmember nations achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and \nemployment, to contribute to sound economic expansion in Member as well \nas non-member nations, and to contribute to the expansion of world \ntrade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis. These goals are as \nrelevant today as they were when the OECD was founded.\n  The current work of the OECD spans the horizon. A few issues that are \nimportant to this Congress that the OECD is working on are the Asian \neconomic crisis, the Anti-Bribery Convention and crytography policy. \nOECD economic surveys, its twice-yearly Economic Outlook and its \ncountless statistics on a wide range of economic activities are \nimportant sources of information for us as we meet the challenges of \nthe global economy.\n  But the OECD has also understood that in today's tough budgetary \nenvironment, there is a real need to make cuts. And organization \nofficials have taken these necessary steps. The OECD is decreasing its \nbudget which to date includes a reduction of 180 staff, more than 10% \nof its total. Clearly, the OECD gets the message and deserves credit \nfor its efforts.\n  I urge the committee and the administration to fully fund the OECD. \nIt continues to make a valuable contribution, and is willing to \nimplement the kinds of reforms that should only increase its efficiency \nand productivity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/20/senate-section/article/S8594-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 21, 1998\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
