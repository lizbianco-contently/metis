Mr. President, under the previous order, we now have an \nhour of debate equally divided, and I have been designated as the \nmanager to control the time on this side. I do not see a colleague yet \nwho will control the time on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to Senate Joint Resolution 22 for 1 hour, with 30 minutes under \nthe control of the distinguished Senator from Utah, 20 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Leahy, and 10 minutes under the control of \nSenator Byrd.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 22) to express the sense of \n     the Congress concerning the application by the Attorney \n     General for the appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 \n     Presidential election campaign.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, some general observations prior to \ngetting into the details of this resolution, I think, are in order. As \nthis matter has come before the Nation in the form of press reports, \ntelevision commentary, newspaper analyses, et cetera, something that is \nvery disturbing to me has happened. That is, a single cloak of \nsuspicion regarding illegalities and improprieties has been cast over \nall aspects of anything relating to campaign financing, campaign \nfundraising, and campaign expenditures. Somehow, anything related to \nraising money or\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nspending money in a campaign has now become tainted, and we find people \nin the press and people in this Chamber casting aspersions that, in my \nview, are inappropriate and uncalled for.\n  I would like to set the terms of the discussion in this fashion. I \nsuggest that, of course, the first dividing line is between that which \nis legal and that which is illegal. Many times in the press reports no \none is making this dividing line. They are attacking anything dealing \nwith fundraising as if it were all the same and all in the same pot. We \nshould make it clear, we should understand that many of the things that \nare done for political fundraising are perfectly legal and, in my view, \nperfectly appropriate, while there are other things that are clearly \nillegal, and obviously anything illegal is not appropriate.\n  If I may, I was disturbed by some of the comments made on this floor \nwith respect to the actions of the majority leader, primarily by the \nminority leader. The suggestion was left in the minds of some people \nthat the majority leader was being accused of doing something illegal \nor improper by urging people to attend a Republican fundraiser and \nurging people to support the Republican Party. Not only was it not \nillegal nor was it improper, it was perfectly appropriate for the \nmajority leader of the Republican Party to engage in this kind of \nactivity. Just as, to be completely fair about it, in my view it was \nperfectly appropriate and perfectly proper for the senior Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Dodd], in his role as the general chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, to engage in fundraising activity on \nbehalf of the Democratic Party in the last campaign. The Senator from \nConnecticut has not been attacked on the floor, as the majority leader \nwas, but he has been attacked in the press, as people have tried to \ncast the cloak of impropriety that I described over all fundraising \nactivities.\n\n  I will stand here and defend the right of the senior Senator from \nConnecticut to do what he has done on behalf of the Democratic National \nCommittee as being perfectly appropriate as well as legal, just as I \ndefend the right of the majority leader for what he has done in \nfundraising activities that are perfectly appropriate as well as legal.\n  Now, on the legal side of the line there have been activities that \nhave taken place that, in my view, while legal, are not appropriate. It \nis, perhaps, legal for the President to have had the kind of extensive \ncontact with campaign donors in the White House that we have seen \nreported in the press. The President has suggested that every President \nhas met donors in the White House, and therefore this is perfectly OK. \nI will agree, once again, that previous Presidents have on occasion met \nwith donors to their party or to their particular campaigns while in \nthe White House. It is my personal opinion that the scale and the \norganized effort that went into bringing people into the White House, \nwhether it is for overnights in the Lincoln bedroom, organized and \norchestrated by the President's own hand, or for the coffees, as they \nwere called, has reached a level of unprecedented pattern of activity, \nand I consider it to be inappropriate.\n  I will stipulate that it apparently was not illegal. That does not \nmean we should not comment about it, we should not express our opinions \nabout its appropriateness. But, clearly, it does not call for the \nappointment of an independent counsel. It is something we can talk \nabout in the political arena. It is on the legal side of the line. If \nwe think it is inappropriate, we should say so. If we think the pattern \nof activity in this area is just overwhelmingly improper, we have the \nright to say so. But we must recognize, once again, that some of that \nactivity may clearly not have been illegal.\n\n  Drawing the line and coming over to the side of that which is \nillegal, I find, once again, there are degrees of illegality. Let me \ngive you an example that has been heavily reported in the press: the \nreceipt of a $50,000 check by Maggie Williams, the chief of staff to \nthe First Lady, while Ms. Williams was in the White House. That \napparently is illegal.\n  Naturally, we take breaking of the law seriously. I don't think we \nneed an independent counsel, however, to investigate Maggie Williams \naccepting a $50,000 check while in the White House, and I don't think \nit is worth some of the furor that has been created in the press. If \nshe broke the law in that instance, I think the Justice Department and \nthe FEC, whoever is the appropriate legal authority, can handle that \nwithout any difficulty and does not require an independent counsel and, \nfrankly, in my view, may not even require the tremendous hue and cry \nthat has risen in this area in the press.\n  Again, I do not mean to minimize someone who violates a regulation or \nrestriction, but there is a difference between violations that are \neither inadvertent, relatively innocent or springing out of a lack of \nunderstanding of the rules to those violations that, in my view, are \ntruly sinister. We should not be talking about an independent counsel \nunless we have moved from the legal side of campaign funding and those \nthings that are perfectly appropriate, toward those things that are \nperhaps inappropriate and improper, across the line to those violations \nthat are inadvertent or relatively minor. We still don't have the \nnecessity of calling for an independent counsel until we cross over \ninto the territory of those infractions that are truly sinister and \nhave serious implications about misuse of power in very high places.\n\n  It is my opinion that there have been enough violations in very high \nplaces in areas that I think are truly sinister that an independent \ncounsel is, indeed, called for. But before I get into the details of \nthat, I want to make my position perfectly clear that I do not think we \nshould appoint an independent counsel because people in the press, or \npeople in this Chamber, get all exercised about activities in the three \nareas I have just described. None of them is serious enough to justify \nan independent counsel. Let's focus on the fourth area I have \ndescribed, which I consider to be the truly sinister areas.\n  Mr. President, with that general statement and overview, I am \nprepared now to turn to my colleague from Michigan and yield such time \nto him as he may require from his 30 minutes so that we keep the time \nbalanced in this debate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for his invariable courtesy. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be yielded 10 minutes. Senator Leahy is not \nyet here, but I ask that, I am sure with his approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will be voting on two resolutions later \nthis morning. The first resolution, that of the majority leader, is a \nclearly partisan document, for a number of reasons which I will get \ninto in a moment. The second resolution, which Senator Leahy and I have \nintroduced, intends to carry out the spirit and the purpose of the \nindependent counsel law without prejudging the Attorney General review \nand, unlike the first resolution of the majority leader, the \nalternative resolution includes allegations against Members of \nCongress. The majority leader's resolution, the first resolution we \nwill be voting on, does not in its final clause, its action clause, \nmake reference to congressional campaigns, but only to the Presidential \ncampaign.\n  The second resolution avoids prejudging the Attorney General's \nreview, urges that the review be carried out without any political \nfavoritism or any political pressure, and, perhaps most important, \nincludes in that review Members of Congress and allegations against \nMembers of Congress.\n  The first resolution is a partisan document for a number of reasons. \nFirst, it mentions Democratic problems exclusively. Second, it omits \nwhat it should include, which is a review of activities of Members of \nCongress. And, third, it includes what it should omit, which is a \nprejudgment of the process of the law that it seeks to invoke.\n  The independent counsel law provides that the Attorney General, upon \nreceipt of certain specific information from a credible source against \ncertain groups, including Members of Congress, shall take certain \nactions. It doesn't prejudge that action. The independent counsel law \ndoesn't say that the Attorney General, in the absence of specific \ninformation from a credible source, will seek an independent counsel. \nIt is only when those first two steps are\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\ntaken where she determines that there is specific information from a \ncredible source that then the independent counsel law says she shall \nseek or, in the case of Members of Congress or other than the specific \ncovered officials, she may seek an independent counsel.\n  The purpose of this law, in which I have been so deeply involved with \nSenator Cohen as my Republican counterpart in now three \nreauthorizations, the purpose of this law is to get an independent \ninvestigation of top Government officials at either end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue free from the taint of politics. That is the purpose of this \nlaw, to try to remove the allegations which swirl too often in election \ncampaigns, or otherwise, that could involve criminal activities, to \nremove the consideration of those allegations against certain \nindividuals and groups from partisan politics.\n  The independent counsel law, as I said, covers really three groups. \nFirst, there are covered officials--the President, Vice President, \nCabinet officials, a few named others. Where there is specific \ninformation from a credible source that a crime may have been committed \nby one of these covered officials, then the Attorney General, if she \nfinds those things have occurred, she must seek an independent counsel.\n\n  The second group is other persons where she might have a conflict of \ninterest.\n  And the third group is Members of Congress, where, in the case the \nfirst steps have been taken and there is specific information from a \ncredible source, then she may, if she determines it is in the public \ninterest, seek an independent counsel. It is that third group which is \nomitted from the majority leader's resolution.\n  The law specifically provides for certain congressional participation \nthrough the Judiciary Committee. This is very important as the Supreme \nCourt, in upholding this law in the case of Morrison versus Olson, made \nspecial reference to the fact that the involvement of the Congress was \nlimited because the Supreme Court ruled under the separation of powers \ndoctrine that the Congress could not control the independent counsel \nprocess. And so the Supreme Court, in the Morrison case, pointed out \nthat the involvement of Congress was limited to members of the \nJudiciary Committee writing a letter to the Attorney General which, in \nturn, would trigger a report from her within 30 days. That is what the \nindependent counsel law provides.\n  This resolution goes way beyond that, because it would put the Senate \non record, albeit in a nonbinding way, nonetheless the full Senate on \nrecord, which is far different than a letter from members of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I have indicated the partisan nature of the first resolution that we \nare going to be voting on. Let me just give a few examples of \nallegations made against Members of Congress or others than those that \nwould be covered by this resolution, particularly in the area of tax-\nexempt organizations.\n  Just 2 months ago, the specially appointed investigative subcommittee \nof the House Ethics Committee released a unanimous bipartisan report \nrelative to Speaker Gingrich.\n  Here is what that bipartisan report found. This is a quote:\n\n       The subcommittee found that in regard to two projects, Mr. \n     Gingrich engaged in activity involving 501(c)(3) \n     organizations that was substantially motivated by partisan, \n     political goals.\n\n  The subcommittee also found--these are the words of the \nsubcommittee--that ``it was clear that Mr. Gingrich intended''--I \nemphasize the word ``intended''--``that the [American Opportunities \nWorkshop] and Renewing American Civilization Projects''--those are the \n501(c)(3)'s--``have substantial partisan, political purposes.''\n  The subcommittee said--this is a bipartisan report--that ``In \naddition, he was aware that political activities in the context of \n501(c)(3) organizations were problematic.''\n  Mr. President, it is illegal for 501(c)(3) organizations to \nparticipate in partisan activities. It violates the law. Yet, you have \nhere a bipartisan subcommittee of the House that finds that Mr. \nGingrich, in regard to two projects, engaged in activity that was \nmotivated by partisan goals and that he intended--he intended--that \nthose projects--I am using their words-- ``have substantial partisan, \npolitical purposes'' and ``he was aware that political activities in \nthe context of 501(c)(3) organizations were problematic.''\n  You talk about specific information from a credible source. Pretty \nspecific, pretty credible, bipartisan subcommittee of the House of \nRepresentatives, part of the ethics committee. And yet, in the first \nresolution that we will be voting on, no suggestion to the Attorney \nGeneral that she review the possibility that the public interest \nrequires her to seek an independent counsel relative to Members of \nCongress. Only the Presidential election is in the ``action'' clause in \nthe resolution before us. No reference to anything but Democratic \nactivities in the ``whereas'' clause.\n  There are other tax exempts that should be considered by the Attorney \nGeneral as provided for by the independent counsel--$4.5 million went \nfrom the Republican National Committee to a tax-exempt group called \nAmericans for Tax Reform.\n  According to the Washington Post, 20 million pieces of mail were sent \nout by that organization, millions of phone calls in 150 congressional \ndistricts. They even put on television ads in States, and in one State \nagainst a colleague of ours, attacking him for not showing up for work. \n``That is wrong,'' said the television ad. This is by an organization \nthat is not supposed to engage in partisan activity, putting on \ntelevision ads attacking somebody who is running for Congress, for the \nSenate, in this case.\n  A group using the same offices as Americans for Tax Reform, also a \ntax-exempt group, puts on an ad on television saying the following: \n``When Clinton was running, he promised a middle-class tax cut. Then he \nraised my taxes. He was just lying to get elected. This year he'll lie \nsome\nmore . . .''\n  That is a tax-exempt group that is not supposed to be putting on \npartisan ads, but the resolution of the majority leader does not \nprovide that the Attorney General will look into that kind of activity \nby tax exempts; only Democrats are mentioned and only the Presidential \nelection is mentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired. Do you \nwish to yield more time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I think I better reserve the \nbalance of Senator Leahy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  May I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes and fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am interested in the comments by my friend from \nMichigan. He is a distinguished lawyer. I have never had the experience \nof going to law school. But I must respond out of experience relating \nto the political circumstance.\n  He decries at length ``no reference to Members of Congress'' and \ngives us an example out of the life of Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the \nHouse, in saying, why does not the resolution call on Janet Reno to \ninvestigate the Speaker?\n  Mr. President, if Janet Reno were to decide that there was further \naction that needed to be taken with respect to Mr. Gingrich, I doubt \nthat she would run into any resistance in the White House to that \ndecision. I doubt that the President would think that was not a good \nidea for her to do that or send her any kind of direction or subtle \nhints saying, ``Do not pursue Mr. Gingrich.''\n  The reason we have an independent counsel operation is because the \nAttorney General is indeed subject to pressure from the White House. \nAnd there is no such pressure with reference to Members of Congress, \nparticularly Members of Congress of the opposing party.\n  In this body, both the Senator from Michigan and I sat with Dave \nDurenberger. Dave Durenberger found out directly that there was no \nproblem in the Justice Department coming after a Member of Congress.\n  There are Members in this body who were here when Harrison Williams, \nknown as ``Pete,'' was pursued by the Justice Department and his own \nparty and ultimately went to jail.\n  In the structure of our Government, with the separation of powers, \nthere is\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\nno pressure on the Attorney General in the executive branch that would \nprevent him or her from going after a Member of the legislative branch, \nbut there is clear pressure within the executive branch that could \nprevent an Attorney General from going after a member of the executive \nbranch. And that is why the independent counsel statute was created.\n  I think the omission from the majority leader's resolution with \nrespect to Members of Congress is a recognition that the independent \ncounsel was never intended to go after a Member of Congress and it \nwould be inappropriate to go after Members of Congress to put that in. \nIt would fundamentally change the nature of the independent counsel \ncircumstance.\n  Now, Mr. President----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. When the Senator says it was never intended that the \nindependent counsel go after a Member of Congress, I must yield myself \n2 minutes to answer that.\n  The law specifically provides that when the Attorney General \ndetermines it would be in the public interest, that indeed she ``may \nseek''--I am quoting the law--``an independent counsel for or relating \nto Members of Congress.''\n  It is very specific in the law. And I just used the exact words, \nreading. Members of Congress are included in this law. Indeed, it was \nthe current majority in this body that insisted that Members of \nCongress be included in the law and wanted to make it mandatory, and \nnow they are left out of the resolution of the majority leader.\n  The ultimate resolution was to make it discretionary where the \nAttorney General found it in the public interest to do so. But the \nmajority in this body had determined that Members of Congress be \nincluded. They were included, left discretionary, but it is very \nprecise.\n  If I can disagree with my dear friend, it is very precise that \nMembers of the Congress are included in the independent counsel law \nwhen it is determined by the Attorney General it would be in the public \ninterest.\n  I will use 1 more minute.\n  The pressure that the Senator from Utah talks about, which he \npresumes comes from the White House--if it does--is wrong. We should \nnot compound any such alleged pressure if, in fact, it exists by \nputting pressure on her by this legislative body. Pressure from any \nsource is wrong. If the White House pressures her, it is wrong.\n  By the way, she has shown tremendous independence, tremendous \nindependence when it comes to the selection of a decision to seek an \nindependent counsel. This Attorney General has shown no reluctance to \nseek the appointment of independent counsel.\n  So if there is pressure, there should not be pressure from any \nsource, White House or Congress. That is exactly why this first \nresolution, it seems to me, runs so counter to the spirit of the \nindependent counsel law, because it does explicitly put pressure on \nher. It jumps to a conclusion as to what she should find at the end of \na process. We should not do it. If anybody else is doing it, they \nshould not do it. We should not do it.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Michigan for correcting my legal \nlack of understanding. And I do stand corrected and accept that \ninstruction.\n  I say to him, and to any who feel, as he apparently does, that Mr. \nGingrich should be included in this, that I would be happy to have Mr. \nGingrich included in the resolution if indeed there were evidence \nsuggesting there was something that had not already come out in the \nproceedings that have already gone forward.\n  The reason I am supporting this resolution is that I feel there is \ninformation that is being hidden within the executive branch, coming \nfrom somewhere. I do not know whether it is coming from the White \nHouse. I do not know whether it is coming from the executive office of \nthe President. But from somewhere, there seems to be some kind of \npressure being applied to the Attorney General to keep her from \nproceeding with the appointment of an independent counsel, as Members \nof this body individually have urged her to do, including Members of \nthe Democratic side of this body, who have urged the Attorney General \nto proceed with the appointment of the independent counsel.\n  For example, the senior Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] has said \nit is time for an independent counsel. I am sure my friend from \nMichigan would not stand to censure the senior Senator from New York \nfor making that expression. He has expressed that freely, openly, and \npublicly as is his right.\n  All the resolution does that is offered by the majority leader is \ngive other Members of the Senate the opportunity to make the same \nexpression in a vote for a sense of the Senate--not binding, not with a \nforce of law, simply making public the fact that they agree with \nSenator Moynihan in his calling for a independent counsel.\n  Now, why is it that we feel there are things that need to be examined \nwith an independent counsel that have not been? There are many, and our \ntime is limited, but let me go quickly, Mr. President, to one example \nof something that I think calls out for the attention of an independent \ncounsel. On the 13th of September, 1995, there was a meeting in the \nOval Office, not in the Democratic National Committee, not in some \nother governmental office, in the Oval Office in the White House. \nPresident Clinton, of course, was there and with him were four other \nindividuals--James Riady, not a Federal employee, an executive, indeed, \nan owner of the Lippo Group; Bruce Lindsey, who was a Government \nFederal employee and is the Deputy White House counsel; Joseph Giroir, \nLippo joint venture partner and adviser and a former partner of the \nRose Law Firm in Arkansas, again, not a Federal employee; and John \nHuang, a former executive with Lippo but at the time of the meeting he \nwas a Federal employee. So here you have the President, two non-Federal \nemployees and two Federal employees. The discussion is whether or not \nJohn Huang will move from his position at the Department of Commerce to \nbecome vice chairman of finance of the Democratic National Committee. \nSo here is the discussion in the Oval Office, including the President, \nregarding the future role of John Huang, taking place in the presence \nof two of Mr. Huang's former associates in the private world.\n  Mr. Huang made that move from the Commerce Department to the \nDemocratic National Committee where he raised, according to the \nDemocratic National Committee, $3.4 million, $1.6 million of which has \nhad to be returned by the Democratic National Committee because they \nhave been determined to be either inappropriate or illegal.\n  Now, when you ask the question, do we know everything we need to know \nabout Mr. Huang and his activities stemming from that meeting in the \nOval Office presided over by the President of the United States, we \nhave Mr. Huang taking the fifth amendment, refusing to tell us anything \nfurther on the grounds that it might incriminate him. He joins with \nCharlie Trie, Pauline Kanchanalak, Mark Middleton, and Webster Hubbell \nin taking the fifth amendment, saying they will not cooperate with the \ninvestigation on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate them. \nThere are others who have not taken the fifth amendment but who have \nleft the country, including John H.K. Lee, Charlie Trie, Pauline \nKanchanalak, Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata, Charles DeQueljoe, and Mr. \nRiady.\n  Of the four people who were in that meeting along with the President, \none has taken the fifth amendment and the other has left the country. \nRoughly half of the money that Mr. Huang raised has already been \nreturned by the Democratic National Committee on the grounds that it \nwas either illegal or inappropriate. I think this summarizes the fact \nthat we need much further investigation into, (a), what was decided at \nthat meeting, and (b), what was done subsequent to that meeting as a \nresult of those decisions, but of the four non-Presidential \nparticipants in that meeting, half of them are unavailable to us to \ngive us a version.\n  There are many more examples. I see my friend from West Virginia has \narrived. I will reserve such additional time as I have to summarize \nthis later, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on March 11, this body voted 99 to 0 to \nadopt a resolution that provides more than $4.3\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\nmillion to the Committee on Governmental Affairs for the sole purpose \nof investigating any and all improper or illegal activities stemming \nfrom the 1996 federal elections. The investigation will cover the \npresidential and congressional elections, and the results will be made \nknown to the public early next year.\n  I believe that one of the primary reasons the resolution had the full \nsupport of the Senate was because of the various compromises that \nsucceeded in making the scope of the investigation both bipartisan and \nfair. Absent those accommodations, the resolution would have been seen \nby the American people as nothing more than an attempt by one party to \ngain political advantage over the other.\n  That is why I am deeply concerned with the direction now being taken \nwith this measure. Unlike the resolution that received the full support \nof the Senate on March 11, this resolution specifically targets for \ninvestigation by an independent counsel the President, the Vice \nPresident, unnamed White House officials, and the Democratic National \nCommittee, and it does so based on nothing more substantial than \n``reports in the media.''\n  Mr. President, the American people are painfully aware that both \nparties are guilty of abusing the campaign financing system currently \nin place. But this resolution would seek to exploit--apparently for \nparitsan political advantage--the actions of only a Democratic \nPresident and the Democratic Party. Now, where is the objectivity? \nWhere is the objectivity in that proposition?\n  Even if we disregard fairness, there is simply no logical reason why \nthe Senate needs to be spending its time on this resolution. The simple \ntruth is that the law governing the appointment of an independent \ncounsel already provides a process that the Attorney General must \nfollow. That process is clearly laid out in the U.S. Code, and it does \nnot--I repeat, does not--include sense of the Congress resolutions.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that this is an unprecedented behest.\n  Never before has the Congress attempted to dictate the naming of an \nindependent counsel. We have never passed any measure that would tell \nthe Attorney General, as this resolution does, that she ``should'' \napply for the appointment of an independent counsel. The reason we \nhaven't done so is because that would unnecessarily politicize a \nprocedure that was expressly designed to restore public confidence \nafter Watergate by taking politics out of our criminal justice system.\n  Furthermore, I find it ironic that we are debating this resolution at \nthe same time that the Justice Department's Office of Public Integrity \nis actively engaged in an investigation of the very matters that this \nresolution seeks to have investigated. Career prosecutors are, as we \nspeak, already working as part of an independent task force looking \ninto fundraising efforts in connection with the 1996 Presidential \nelection. In addition, a Federal grand jury has already begun hearing \ntestimony in connection with campaign contributions to the Democratic \nNational Committee. But under the independent counsel statute, each of \nthose efforts would cease. There would be no further authority for the \nAttorney General to convene grand juries or to issue subpoenas. Where \nis the logic? Where is the logic in that, Mr. President?\n  The decision to invoke the independent counsel process is, by law, a \ndecision for the Attorney General alone to make. Let us let the law \nwork as it was intended. We should not, through some misguided attempt \nat grandstanding, pass a resolution that serves no legitimate purpose \nexcept to score political home runs. Such a course tends to call into \nquestion the integrity of the Justice Department and of the entire \nindependent counsel process.\n  This resolution has not had the benefit of committee examination and \nhas been moved to the calendar by parliamentary device--I suppose \nthrough rule XIV. While that may be acceptable for some measures, and \nis acceptable for some measures, I feel that, on a matter this \nsensitive, a committee should have certainly had the opportunity to \npass some judgment. The Congress is attempting to direct an Attorney \nGeneral, when the law specifies the decision to invoke the independent \ncounsel is and ought to be, by constitutional necessity, that of the \nAttorney General alone.\n  There is a mean spirit alive in this town currently, Mr. President, \nwhich is destructive, overly partisan and overtly partisan, and \nthoroughly regrettable. We seem to have completely forgotten about the \nmundane necessities of governing, like crafting a budget and dealing \nwith the myriad problems that face the American people.\n  Instead, we are engaged in a feeding frenzy, like sharks that have \ntasted a little blood and hunger for more. If you have ever observed \nsharks being fed red meat, you know that it is not a pretty picture. \nAnd I am sure that the excesses of partisanship emanating from \nWashington these days and being witnessed by the American people are \nfar from appetizing.\n  No one is suggesting that we turn our backs on corruption or fail to \nexplore wrongdoing. But I implore some in this body to cool off and to \ntry to get a sense of perspective on this entire matter.\n  Service in the U.S. Senate is a tremendous honor. Each of us has \nexpended great personal effort to get here, including the straining of \nour personal lives in order to attain a wonderful prize, a seat in this \ngreat body. The benefits of winning that prize include the opportunity \nto participate in governing the greatest country on Earth, the United \nStates of America, and through the quality of that governance, to \ninspire and to uplift our people.\n  So I urge each of my colleagues to focus on that opportunity and on \nthe great and long tradition of this body. Let's put aside this and all \nother unwise techniques for embarrassing each other and do something \nfor the good of the American people. If there are those who want to \nembarrass themselves by wrongdoing, they will be found out because \nthere are processes already at work to ferret out that information and \nbring it to the full light of day. So let us leave the investigation of \ncampaign abuses by both political parties in the hands of the very \ncapable people charged with conducting them and avoid the allure of \n``piling on'' for political advantage. It is time for us to remember \nour real duties and our heavy responsibility to legislate and to govern \nfor the common good and, by that example, so encourage our President to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will vote against both the Republican \nand the Democrat resolutions.\n  I hold that the Attorney General should appoint an independent \ncounsel to investigate alleged improprieties by Democrats and by \nRepublicans in fundraising for the 1996 Presidential and congressional \ncampaigns. I believe the public will only be reassured if an \nindependent counsel looks into what has been happening. The issues must \nbe aired in an independent, nonpartisan setting. And if there have been \nviolations of law, there must be consequences.\n  Last week, after much debate, the Senate agreed to fund the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee probe into illegal and improper \nfundraising and spending practices in the 1996 Federal election \ncampaigns. A unanimous Senate believed that a credible investigation \nrequires that we look not only at our President, but also at ourselves. \nSo, too, should an independent counsel.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 22 suggests that the scope of the independent \ncounsel's investigation should be limited to the allegations of wrong-\ndoing by Democrats in the 1996 Presidential campaign. There is no \nmention of an investigation of congressional campaigns.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 23 does not call for the appointment of an \nindependent counsel. To say again, in my view, an independent counsel \nis the only entity capable of conducting an investigation without \ndissolving into partisan bias. And it is the only way of proceeding \nthat avoids the appearance of conflict of interest.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to offer just few comments to \nindicate why I believe the course chosen by the majority today relating \nto the independent counsel is unwarranted.\n  First, the official responsible for initiating the appointment of an \nindependent counsel--Attorney General\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\nJanet Reno--has maintained the highest standards of integrity and \nprofessionalism. Second, the Attorney General has proven her \nwillingness to request the appointment of independent counsels in the \npast when she believed the statutory standard was met. And, third, the \nAttorney General has already undertaken a serious inquiry into the \ncampaign fundraising issues and continues to consider, as the facts \ndevelop, whether to seek an independent counsel.\n  As we review the facts, we must remember that the independent counsel \nstatute is triggered only upon receipt of specific, credible evidence \nthat high-ranking Government officials listed in the statute may have \nviolated our criminal laws. This is an appropriately high threshold \nthat must be met before the process of appointing an independent \ncounsel can go forward. This standard is not met by vague allegations. \nThe law does not apply to unethical, improper, or unseemly conduct. \nRather, the statute is triggered only after the Attorney General \ndetermines, after consulting with career Justice Department prosecutors \nand engaging in a serious, deliberative process, that the statutory \ntest has been satisfied.\n  The conduct of the 1996 elections are being carefully scrutinized by \nthe Department of Justice. A task force comprised of career prosecutors \nfrom the Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division, supported \nby over 30 FBI agents, has been assembled to explore fully the range of \nissues that have been raised. This task force will determine which, if \nany, of the allegations warrant criminal investigation. Of course, if \nthe task force receives specific evidence from a credible source that a \nperson covered by the Independent Counsel Act may have violated the \nlaw, a preliminary investigation under the act would be initiated. But, \nto date, the Attorney General has determined that the Department has \nnot received such evidence.\n\n  In short, we are at the early stages of the task force's operations \nwhere the job is best left to career investigators and prosecutors.\n  What is more, under the independent counsel statute, it is the \nJudiciary Committee--not the full Senate--which has the most proper \noversight role of the independent counsel process. I argued last week \nthat was unnecessary for the Judiciary Committee to make any \nconclusions at this time as to the propriety of appointing an \nindependent counsel. But, a majority of the committee did exactly that \nlast week. Now, the full Senate has been called on to embark on an even \nmore unnecessary and unwarranted course by asking all Senators to--in \neffect--substitute their judgement for that of the career investigators \nand prosecutors. I do not believe that the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee who spend so much of their time overseeing Justice Department \nactivities could make such a judgement now--so, I certainly do not \nthink it possible that all the other Senators who do not sit on the \nJudiciary Committee can prudently or accurately make this judgement.\n  Not only do we have a comprehensive task force already reviewing the \n1996 campaign fundraising issues, but we also have an Attorney General \nwho has repeatedly shown her independence, integrity, and willingness \nto call for an independent counsel. Since taking office, Attorney \nGeneral Reno has requested the appointment of at least four independent \ncounsels--Kenneth Starr, Donald C. Smaltz, David M. Barrett, and Daniel \nS. Pearson--to investigate wrongdoing of high executive branch \nofficials and other individuals covered by the statute.\n\n  In short, the most prudent course today is to wait for the Justice \nDepartment's investigation to be completed. Then, and only then, can \nthe need for appointment of an independent counsel can be evaluated \nbased on a complete and full record.\n  I would also add that this is consistent with how I have proceeded in \npast cases. For example, in 1992, I, along with several other \nDemocratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to then-\nAttorney General William Barr requesting that he call for an \nindependent counsel to investigate the possibility that high-ranking \nofficials engaged in obstruction of justice in the prosecution of a \nparticular case. I did so only after Attorney General Barr had \nappointed a special counsel, indicating that the Attorney General had \nalready concluded that criminal conduct may have taken place. I called \nfor an independent counsel at that point to ensure that this \ninvestigation be carried out by someone whose independence was clear, \nrather than by a special counsel hired by the Attorney General.\n  Finally, we also need to keep in mind that there are some costs to \nappointing an independent counsel at this time. An inquiry is already \nwell under way--FBI agents have been assigned to the task force and, \naccording to press reports, subpoenas have been issued and a grand jury \nhas been convened. Once an independent counsel is appointed, that \ninquiry must be shut down and the independent counsel will have to \nstart from scratch. And as we know from past experience, independent \ncounsel investigations can linger for years. So if we are interested in \nresolving this matter, and getting answers as soon as possible, we \nought to allow the Justice Department to go forward and put our trust \nin Attorney General Reno to trigger the independent counsel statute \nonly if and when she deems it necessary.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance \nthe administration of justice and is not authorized by the independent \ncounsel law. I believe it an inappropriate effort to subvert the \nindependent counsel process.\n  We spent 4 days debating this. We have yet to confirm one single \njudge. We may possibly have a vote on a nominee to one of the almost \n100 Federal judge vacancies before we go on our second vacation. We \nhave not had 1 minute of debate on a budget resolution. We have not had \n1 minute of debate on the chemical weapons treaty. We have not had 1 \nminute of debate on the juvenile crime bill. But we spent 4 days on \nthis.\n  I would have thought that the day the President leaves for an \ninternational summit with the President of Russia would not be an \nappropriate time for attacking the President. I would have thought it a \ntime for coming together to demonstrate to the rest of the world that \nDemocrats and Republicans can work together and can at least show \nsupport for the President of the United States as he pursues the \ninterests of the United States in his meetings with the President of \nRussia.\n  That is the way we have always done it. In my 22 years here, under \nthe majority leadership of Mr. Mansfield, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Baker, Mr. \nMitchell, and Mr. Dole, we have always, always followed the rule that \nwe do not bring something onto the floor of this Senate attacking the \nPresident of the United States as he is about to go into a summit.\n  Apparently, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia said, \nthere is a meanness going through this town, and that rule that has \nalways been followed, a bipartisan rule always followed with Democratic \nand Republican Presidents, always followed with Democratic and \nRepublican leaders, is not going to be followed here today. I think \nthat is unfortunate. I think it gives an unfortunate image to the rest \nof the world, and it certainly is not in the best traditions of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  It is also ironic that we are being asked to take this action today \nknowing that last Thursday the Republicans and Democrats on the House \nand Senate Judiciary Committees sent written requests to the Attorney \nGeneral invoking the statutory provisions that provide a limited role \nfor Congress in the independent counsel process.\n  And, of course, this resolution would call for an independent counsel \nonly for the President--it is restricted to the 1996 Presidential \ncampaign. This resolution carefully crafted so that it won't touch any \nof the Republicans or Democrats in the Senate or Republicans or \nDemocrats in the House. In other words, we say we are like Caesar's \nwife, we are above all this, we are untainted by any scandals. But go \nafter the President and the Vice President; and, incidentally, let's \nreally slam the President as he heads off to negotiate with the only \nother President of a nuclear superpower. I think the resolution\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\ntakes too narrow a view if we are up to making demands upon the \nAttorney General for an independent counsel. The resolution shields \ncongressional fundraising practices from investigation.\n  Boy, somebody is not reading the paper. It didn't make sense to try \nto shield us from an investigation when the same limits were proposed \nin connection with the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and it does not make sense or increase our credibility with \nthe public now.\n  Indeed, today, the Washington Post had a front page story reporting \nthat a lobbyist for a foreign government was shaken down last summer by \nthe same Member of the House who now chairs their investigation into \nalleged campaign fundraising abuses. Incidentally, this was not only \nthe lobbyist but, if this article is accurate, it even went to the \nambassador of a foreign power.\n  We on the Judiciary Committee and in the Congress have done all that \nthe statute allows with respect to the determination by the Attorney \nGeneral. The 30-day period for the Attorney General's response has \nbegun to run. We do not need to do anything further on this at this \ntime.\n  We ought to get about the real business of the U.S. Senate and \nabandon this ill-conceived effort to instruct the Attorney General how \nto proceed. She doesn't need our guidance and I do not want to derail \nthe investigations that are under way.\n  But if we have to engage in this kind of sideshow, as the President \nleaves for an international summit, let us at least restrain ourselves \nfrom seeking to pressure the head of our Federal law enforcement agency \nand instead pass the alternative form of resolution that urges her to \nresist political pressure and follow the law. Incidentally, unlike the \noriginal resolution, the alternative resolution, Senate Joint \nResolution 23, does not shield the Congress from any investigation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the admonition by the senior \nSenator from West Virginia and repeated by the Senator from Vermont \nwith respect to meanness. I have made every attempt during this \npresentation to make sure that there is none in any of the things that \nI have said, and to remind Senators in my opening comments that I think \nmany Members of this body have inappropriately been stigmatized by the \npress and others for doing that which is perfectly appropriate and \nperfectly legal.\n  I must once again make reference to what I consider to be an \ninappropriate attack on the motives of the majority leader that was \nmounted by the minority leader earlier during this debate. I think that \nis inappropriate. The majority leader is acting out his good motives, \neven though there may be some who disagree with him.\n  As to the argument that this resolution somehow exempts Members of \nCongress and somehow exempts members of the Republican Party from any \naction on the part of the Attorney General, I point out the effective \nlanguage of the resolution which says, ``It is the sense of Congress \nthat the Attorney General should make application to the Special \nDivision of the United States Court of Appeals to the District of \nColumbia for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \nallegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 Presidential election \ncampaign.''\n  There is nothing in there that says she shall not exercise this right \nwith respect to a Member of Congress, that she shall not go after a \nRepublican nominee, that she shall not do any of the other things that \nare simply an expression that she should do it with respect to the \nPresidential campaign, and no reference in that resolve portion of even \nDemocrats rather than Republicans.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Order for Morning Business\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the stacked votes today that there be a period of morning \nbusiness until the hour of 3 p.m. today, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 5 minutes each with the exception of the following: \nSenator Daschle, or his designee, in control of up to 60 minutes; \nSenator Bennett, or his designee, in control of up to 30 minutes; \nSenator Brownback for up to 10 minutes; and, Senator Cleland for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today after months of media exposes and the \nAmerican people asking questions about exactly what is going on here, I \nthink the question that we are trying to answer today is, ``Why hasn't \nAttorney General Reno appointed an independent counsel to investigate \nthese matters?'' Members of both parties, Democrats as well as \nRepublicans, have asked that question, and they can't get a \nsatisfactory answer. They have called on the Attorney General under the \nlaw involving the independent counsel to appoint an independent \ncounsel. Senator Moynihan, Senator Feingold, and I think others in both \nparties have said this is the way that we should proceed, and this \nindependent counsel should be appointed.\n  That is why we brought before the Senate Senate Joint Resesolution 22 \nto express the sense of this body ``that the Attorney General should \nmake application to the Special Division of the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia for the appointment of an \nindependent counsel to investigate allegations of illegal fundraising \nin the 1996 Presidential election campaign.''\n  I cannot understand how anyone who is familiar with the language of \nthe independent counsel statute can disagree with this resolution. And \nI have gone back and read it and reread it. I have been around when \nthis statute has been passed, and modified and passed again. Frankly, I \nhave always had some reservations about it. But it is on the books, and \nit is clear when it should be activated.\n  That statute sets two thresholds for the process of appointing an \nindependent counsel. The first is whether there have been credible and \nserious allegations of illegal acts by high officials. And it defines \nwho these high officials may be.\n\n  That doesn't mean anyone has to be presumed guilty. As long as the \nallegations are credible and serious, the statute requires the Attorney \nGeneral to take action.\n  Clearly, that first threshold has been met by what we already know \nfrom news reports about illegal foreign donations and the use of White \nHouse facilities for campaign fundraising.\n  I need not repeat all the instances others have cited during this \ndebate. One expose has followed another. One admission has followed \nanother. One explanation or excuse is followed by another. Without \njudging anyone involved, it is as clear as can be that the first \nthreshold of the independent counsel statute has already been met.\n  But if anyone disagrees with that assertion let them consider the \nsecond threshold of the law, the second set of circumstances that \npermits the Attorney General to take action. That second threshold is \nthe existence of a perceived conflict of interest on the part of an \nAttorney General who is appointed by the President and confronted with \npossible illegal activities involving the White House.\n  This provision was put in the independent counsel statute in 1978 in \norder to extricate Attorneys General from serious situations just like \nthe one in which the Attorney General finds herself now. Confronted by \nmyriad allegations of wrongdoing within the administration, of which \nshe is a part, it is not her role to pass judgment on them, and it \nshould not be. Under the law, it is her responsibility to trigger the \ncourt process by which an independent counsel takes over the role and \ndoes the job which the law deliberately takes out of her hands.\n  Listen to the Attorney General herself on this point when she \ntestified, just 4 years ago, on the reenactment of the independent \ncounsel statute:\n\n       It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system, and you cannot do that when there \n     is a conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who \n     is, in effect, the chief prosecutor.\n\n  In other words, the Attorney General herself.\n  Who did deny that this second threshold for applying the independent \ncounsel has been more than met? Through no fault of her own, Attorney\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\nGeneral Reno is caught in an excruciating conflict of interest. If she \nwere to aggressively investigate charges of misconduct by senior \nadministration officials, she could be accused of excess zeal to \nprotect her own reputation for integrity. If, on the other hand, she \ndoes not uncover wrongdoing, she would be accused of letting the guilty \nescape because of political considerations.\n  To shield the Attorney General--any Attorney General--from that \npredicament, and to protect the integrity of the entire Department of \nJustice, is the essential and primary purpose of the independent \ncounsel statute.\n  If that is all so obvious, why then, the question might be asked, is \nthe Senate considering this resolution today? The answer is that we are \ncompelled to take this step, formally expressing the sense of this \ninstitution, for two reasons.\n  First--it is quite common, and, in fact, almost always when there are \nserious issues being debated that don't necessarily require a law to be \npassed--the Senate expresses its collective sense on the issue of \nnational import. If we do not do that with regard to this matter, I \nthink we will be slighting our duty.\n  Second, this resolution is a result of our rising frustration with \nwhat seems to be determined inaction on the part of the Attorney \nGeneral to appoint, or start the process to appoint, an independent \ncounsel. Like the American people, we must wonder what it will take to \njar the Department of Justice to activate the independent counsel law. \nAfter all, the Department is not dealing with one or two frivolous \nallegations. It is dealing with a steady drip, drip, drip of \nrevelations over a period of several months that has now become a \ntainted stream of suspicion.\n  There is only one way to clean it up, and that is through the \nappointment of an independent counsel. Let me remind my colleagues that \nthe purpose of such an appointment is not just to prosecute the guilty \nbut to clear the innocent. In neither case should that be seen as a \npartisan endeavor.\n  Nonetheless, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfind fault with this resolution. They say it ought to apply to the \nCongress as well. But the independent counsel statute already does \napply to Members of Congress.\n  If the Attorney General has received credible and serious allegations \nof illegal activity by one or more Members of Congress, she is already \nfully empowered to ask the Federal court to name an independent \ncounsel. And it has been done in the past. Believe me, it has been \ndone. The conflict is not between the administration and the Congress. \nThe Attorney General can take that action. The perceived conflict of \ninterest is when you have the Attorney General of the same party of the \npeople in control of the White House where allegations are being made.\n  I respectfully suggest that the effort being made here to include the \nCongress in this resolution is, once again, just a distraction. That is \nas polite a term as I can find for something that is irrelevant to the \nNation's concern about what we have seen happening.\n  But what has been the modus operandi? Every time another new, serious \nallegation comes out, the alternative by the Democrats has been to \nattack the people who are going to be in critical positions. Senator \nFred Thompson, who is chairman of Governmental Affairs, his motives \nwere impugned when we were moving through with setting up the \ninvestigation for Governmental Affairs. Insinuations, well, this has \n2,000 ramifications. And now today Dan Burton, the chairman of the \ncommittee in the House who has a job to do, yes, attack him.\n  That has been the way it has been done for the last 4 years. Anytime \nyou get accused by somebody or somebody has a job to do, go after them. \nThat is what is at stake here--distraction, obfuscation, say, well, \nthey do it, too. No. So much of what has happened here is not normal; \nit is not the way it has always been done.\n  That campaign is the heart of matter. The campaign has been the focus \nand the forum on other issues whereas what we are trying to get at is a \nvery serious matter here, illegal foreign contributions. I mean even \nthe word espionage has been suggested in all this. We are talking about \nstaggering sums of money that have been raised and in unusual ways.\n  That campaign continues to generate media allegations about \nimproper--we voted on that last week--as well as illegal conduct.\n  If anyone is tempted to take the position of a pox on both houses, I \nhave news for them. It is not true that everybody in politics per se \nbehaves alike or ignores the law or pushes the limits of legality. \nThere are clearly things in the law that may be debatable, but they are \nlegal and they are appropriate. If we want to go back and have a \ndebate--and we will have a debate this year on campaign finance reform, \nbut before we start trying to reform the law, I think we need to look \nat how do we find out what happened. Who did what? What has gone on \nhere?\n  If anyone is tempted to take that position, I think they need to \nreconsider. We do not all do it, and I do not think that it is going to \nwork to just try to shove it off by trying to drag the Congress into \nit. We are trying to get at what has happened.\n  The independent counsel, by the way, is not necessarily going to be a \nslap at the President. In fact, that is the way to quiet this thing \ndown, have the process go forward, have an appropriate investigation, \nfind out what happened, who did what, by an independent counsel.\n  As a matter of fact, I am going to presume that it may not reach to \nthe President. I do not think all of these things involve the \nPresident. They may not come to that conclusion in the end. But this is \nthe way to get at the bottom of what really has happened. So I urge my \ncolleagues here today do not be distracted. We have a very clear \nresolution here that just says it is the sense of the Senate that the \nthresholds have been met to provide for an independent counsel and that \nwe should do that, make it very clear what our position is and go on \nwith the substantive business that we have to do around here.\n  Some people say, how are you going to deal with the budget, less \ntaxes, less spending, less Washington, more freedom if you are going to \nbe fighting on these other things? As a matter of fact, maybe now we \nare in a position to move on. We have a committee that has been funded. \nThey can do their investigation, their hearings. If we have an \nindependent counsel appointed, which clearly I think the law has \nprovided for, and the threshold has been met, then we can go on about \nour other business.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Senate Joint Resolution 22, I \nbelieve it is, and then vote to table the other resolution that is \npending, because it is no more than a distraction because the law \nalready provides for that coverage.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, do I not have a minute, 40 seconds \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute, 42 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield 1 second.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On the Senator's time.\n  Mr. LOTT. On my time. Do I have any time left or has all time on this \nside expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader continues to have leader time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the soothing words of my \ngood friend from Mississippi, but they do not bring out the fact the \nAttorney General has already formed a task force of experienced \nprosecutors to investigate whether criminal conduct took place in the \n1996 Federal election campaigns involving, as well, 30 agents from the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation with subpoena power and testimony \nreportedly being heard before a grand jury. If a preliminary \ninvestigation is begun under the statute and an independent counsel is \nappointed, all this investigation stops, clang, like that. And to say \nthat we are looking at Congress is interesting. If you read Senate \nJoint Resolution 22, it speaks only of investigating allegations of \nillegal fundraising in the 1996 Presidential election campaign. If you \nlook at Senate Joint Resolution 23, which the majority leader wants \ntabled, it\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\nspeaks of Members of Congress as well as Presidential elections. It is \nvery clear they do not want it going to the Members of Congress \nquestion.\n  I still say I am disappointed not to hear why we have broken decades \nand decades and decades of tradition to bring up something obviously \naimed directly at the President of the United States as he leaves for a \nsummit meeting with the President of the only other nuclear superpower. \nIt has never been done, it has never been allowed by majority leaders \nof either Republicans or Democrats with either Republican or Democratic \nPresidents. Perhaps at some point in this Congress we will go back to \nthe traditions of comity that we have seen before. But, in the \nmeantime, let us vote on this resolution, but let us also vote on \nSenate Joint Resolution 23, which would include the Congress. I call on \nall my colleagues to be courageous enough to speak up and say we will \nsupport investigations of ourselves as well as the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair lays before the Senate Senate Joint \nResolution 23 for 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 23) expressing the sense of \n     the Congress that the Attorney General should exercise her \n     best professional judgment, without regard to political \n     pressures, on whether to invoke the independent counsel \n     process to investigate alleged criminal misconduct relating \n     to any election campaign.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the full scope of fundraising \nirregularities on both sides of the aisle and on both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue should be the subject of investigation.\n  Today, we have seen reports that a lobbyist for a foreign government \nwas being shaken down and a foreign ambassador was contacted in this \nregard by the House Member who chairs the committee charged with \ninvestigating allegations of fundraising abuses.\n  The resolution that many just voted for carefully excludes any \nattention to congressional conduct. The resolution on which we are now \nprepared to vote lets the chips fall where they may. It includes \ncongressional election campaign activities.\n  Having just voted to instruct the Attorney General to apply for an \nindependent counsel to investigate those with the Presidential \ncampaign, let us proceed to support--not dodge by trying to table--a \nresolution that would allow the Attorney General to proceed with \nrespect to congressional fundraising abuses, as well. Otherwise, the \nAmerican people are going to see this as a blatant political attack on \nthe President as he goes to Helsinki that excludes any attention to \nourselves.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as my friends on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle have so often reminded us during the debate, there is a \nmechanism going forward in the Governmental Affairs Committee to \ninvestigate all aspects of the 1996 campaign, congressional as well as \nPresidential. This is clearly not the function of an independent \ncounsel.\n  The function of an independent counsel is to investigate allegations \nof the most serious and difficult kinds of lawbreaking. I know of no \nsuch allegations that would require a special counsel in the area \noutside of those that we have talked about during the debate. \nTherefore, I intend to vote against this resolution because it does not \naddress the problem that we face. Whatever problem is there will be \nclearly handled, and handled competently, by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to table Senate Joint Resolution 23 \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table Senate Joint Resolution 23. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, under Federal law, the Attorney General may \nconduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether to apply to \nthe special division of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for \nappointment of an independent counsel whenever she receives specific \ninformation from a credible source constituting grounds for \ninvestigating whether a Federal criminal law was violated by a \nspecified category of executive branch officials, or where she \ndetermines that there are grounds for investigating whether a criminal \nlaw has been violated, and conducting the investigation would create a \nconflict of interest. If, after conducting a preliminary investigation, \nthe Attorney General determines that further investigation is \nwarranted, she shall apply for the appointment of an independent \ncounsel. The appointment of an independent counsel is a serious matter \nand one which the Attorney General should only initiate when necessary. \nThat is why I, and many others, had refrained from joining the \nassortment of calls for Attorney General Reno to appoint an independent \ncounsel in connection with the 1996 Presidential campaign.\n  Yet, last week, all 10 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee felt \nthe time had come to request such an appointment. We sent a letter to \nthe Attorney General, as we are authorized to do by the independent \ncounsel statute, requesting that she make an application for an \nindependent counsel.\n  I must confess, as I did then, to a degree of frustration with the \nIndependent Counsel Act. Did I appreciate having to send our letter? \nCertainly not. However, the law sets forth a specific process by which \nCongress is to request that the Attorney General begin the process by \nwhich an independent counsel is appointed, and this process requires \nthe Judiciary Committee to make what the other party will inevitably \ncharacterize as partisan charges in order to trigger the Attorney \nGeneral's responsibilities. In order for Congress to trigger the most \npreliminary steps for the Department of Justice to take to consider the \nneed for an independent counsel, the law essentially provides that the \nparty not in control of the executive branch make specific charges when \nand if the Attorney General fails to act on her own. I would have \npreferred to have had the Attorney General seek an independent counsel \non her own. But she has not done so. At the very least, I would have \npreferred that she conduct a preliminary investigation on her own. But \nshe has refused to do even this. I would have preferred to have \nrequested that she seek an independent counsel without having to set \nforth, in such a public manner as the law requires, the specific and \ncredible evidence which warrants such an appointment. But in order for \nus to require the Attorney General to take certain minimal steps toward \ninvestigating whether an independent counsel is warranted, we were \nrequired by law to send our letter. In short, the Independent Counsel \nAct is the law of the land and, notwithstanding its relative flaws, we \non the Judiciary Committee have an obligation to abide by it.\n\n  I am hopeful that Attorney General Reno, for whom I continue to have \ngreat respect, will appreciate the concerns set forth in our letter, \nand will agree that an independent counsel should be appointed \nforthwith to investigate these matters. Recent developments have, I \nbelieve, made clear that a thorough Justice Department investigation \ninto possible fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \nPresidential campaign will raise an inherent conflict of interest, and \ncertainly raises at least the appearance of such a conflict, and that \nthe appointment of an independent counsel is therefore required to \nensure public confidence in the integrity of our electoral process and \nsystem of justice.\n  With respect to the proposed alternative resolution proposed by some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Senate Joint \nResolution 23, I must oppose this resolution. This resolution comes on \nthe heels of a letter some of my Democrat colleagues have written to \nthe Attorney General urging her, should she decide to apply for an \nindependent counsel, to request an independent counsel who will \ninvestigate the ``full scope of fundraising irregularities.'' They \nargued in that letter that the Attorney General should ``avoid \npartisanship'' by instructing the independent counsel to investigate \nRepublicans who have ``skirted the spirit'' of the law. I appreciate \nwhat my colleagues were doing with their letter and I appreciate what \nthey are doing with this resolution. Their loyalty to their political \nparty is duly noted. But, as I have said repeatedly, the appointment of \nan independent counsel is a serious matter and partisan proportionality \nshould not be a consideration. Would these Senators have sent this \nletter had the majority not sent its letter? Would we be debating their \nresolution had the majority leader not turned to his resolution? I \nthink we all know the answer to that question. Furthermore, neither \ntheir letter nor their resolution cite any congressional activities \nwhich independently warrant an independent counsel nor do they actually \nurge the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel.\n  The resolution before the Senate expresses the Sense of the Congress \nthat the Attorney General should do only as she pleases. But, it goes \non to provide, if she does decide to initiate the independent counsel \nprocess, the Attorney General should be sure to include Members of \nCongress. It seems my colleagues want to have the best of both worlds. \nIt appears from the language of their alternative resolution that they \ndo not want to go on record as having asked for an independent counsel. \nBut, heaven forbid, should an independent counsel be appointed, he or \nshe should be instructed to initiate a partisan fishing expedition of \nCongress.\n  The Democrats' proposal that an independent counsel, if appointed, \nshould have jurisdiction to investigate Members of Congress is \ninsupportable under the independent counsel statute.\n  The entire purpose of the statute is to avoid the existence or \nappearance of a conflict of interest in Justice Department \ninvestigations. This conflict is inherent whenever an investigation \ninvolves any of the high-ranking executive branch officials enumerated \nin 28 U.S.C. 591(a), and may also arise--and indeed has been found by \nthe Attorney General to have arisen--when an investigation involves \nother executive branch officials. 28 U.S.C. 591(c)(1). Such a conflict \nplainly does not, however, ordinarily exist with respect to Justice \nDepartment investigations of Members of Congress. As the Senate Report \non the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act states:\n\n       . . . no inherent conflict exists in Justice Department \n     investigations and prosecutions of Members of Congress. This \n     conflict does not exist, because the Attorney General is not \n     part of the legislative branch and is not under the control \n     of any Member of Congress. The Department also has a long \n     history of successful prosecutions of Members of Congress. . \n     . . Public perception of a conflict of interest is also not a \n     problem. . . . Also, in 1993, the Department of Justice \n     testified that no inherent conflict of interests in its \n     prosecuting Members of Congress. . . .\n\n  The statute does provide that the Attorney General may conduct a \npreliminary investigation with respect to a Member of Congress where \nfirst ``the Attorney General receives information sufficient to \nconstitute grounds to investigate whether a Member of Congress may have \nviolated'' a Federal criminal law, and second the Attorney General \n``determines that it would be in the public interest'' to conduct a \npreliminary investigation. 28 United States Code 591(c)(2). Neither of \nthese two required findings are even suggested by the Democrats' \nproposed resolution, nor does it appear that they could even arguably \nbe present here.\n  First, the Democrats have made no specific allegations that a Member \nof Congress has violated a criminal law, thus warranting further \ninvestigation. Whereas the Attorney General has for over 3 months been \nconducting an extensive investigation into alleged fundraising \nviolations by members of the\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nDemocratic National Committee [DNC] and the executive branch, I am \naware of no such investigation pertaining to Members of Congress, and \nthe Democrats' proposed resolution does not even purport to make such \nallegations. The independent counsel statute plainly does not authorize \nthe appointment of an independent counsel with jurisdiction to go on an \nundefined fishing expedition to dig up unspecified violations by \nMembers of Congress.\n  Second, I can imagine no reason--and my Democrat colleagues have \nsuggested none--why it would be in the public interest to initiate \nindependent counsel proceedings with respect to Members of Congress. \nThe legislative history clearly indicates that there are two instances \nwhen independent counsel proceedings are in the public interest under \nsection 591(c)(2). The first is where there would be a real or apparent \nconflict of interest for the Attorney General to investigate a Member \nof Congress. While we could imagine that there might be instances in \nwhich an Attorney General would have a conflict in investigating \nMembers of Congress of the same party, only in the most extraordinary \ncircumstance would an Attorney General have a conflict in investigating \nMembers of the other party. In any event, we are confident that this \nAttorney General is fully capable of investigating Members of Congress \nof both parties.\n  The third reason for initiating independent counsel proceedings with \nrespect to Members of Congress is when ``there is a danger of disparate \ntreatment if the case were handled by the Department of Justice,'' such \nthat ``a Member of Congress were unfairly subjected to a more rigorous \napplication of criminal law than other citizens.'' This danger, \nhowever, clearly does not arise with respect to allegations that laws \nregulating the fundraising activities of public officials have been \nviolated; if the law only applies to public officials, there is no \npossibility of disparate treatment between Members of Congress and \nprivate citizens. In any event, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have not even attempted to articulate why there would be a danger \nof disparate treatment if the Justice Department were to investigate \nMembers of Congress.\n  In closing, Attorney General Reno has appointed four independent \ncounsels to date. It is the sense of a majority of the members of the \nJudiciary Committee that the need to avoid even the appearance of a \nconflict of interest, and thereby to ensure the public's confidence in \nour system of justice, requires an independent counsel in connection \nwith the 1996 Presidential campaign. However, the record does not \nwarrant, nor does the law permit, the appointment of an independent \ncounsel to investigate Congress. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to \noppose Senate Joint Resolution 23.\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 33 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon H.\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wyden\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Dodd\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the joint resolution (S.J.

Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to speak with \nrespect to the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. I notice the \nmajority leader is here. I wanted to try to get the majority leader's \nattention for a moment, if I can. Mr. President, I know that Senator \nBiden, who is the ranking member of the committee, has been in \ndiscussions and negotiations with a number of parties, and many of us \nwho have been deeply involved in this issue for a long period of time \nare growing increasingly concerned.\n  I raised the subject of the Chemical Weapons Convention on the floor \na couple weeks ago and signaled that a great many of us were growing \nsufficiently concerned that we are running out of legislative time on \nthis important treaty that we were poised to consider coming to the \nfloor and exercising whatever rights we have as Senators in order to \ntry to guarantee a debate on it. For years, we have been making an \neffort to pass this convention or to pass a convention that regulates \nchemical weapons. The United States of America has made a policy \ndecision not to produce them. So we are watching 161 nations who signed \noff on this, and 68 of whom have ratified it, come together without the \nUnited States to set up the protocol that will govern the verification \nand regulatory process for chemical weapons and their precursors for \nyears to come. If we are not allowed in the U.S. Senate to debate this \nand have a vote, we will not have performed our constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  I know the majority leader--he and I have had a number of \nconversations on this personally. I would like to begin now at least to \nascertain publicly, and on the record, where we may be going so that we \ndon't lose this critical time. I would like to know if the majority \nleader can guarantee us that we are going to have an opportunity to \nvote up or down on this convention, or whether we have to begin to be a \nlittle more creative.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts will yield, I would be glad to respond.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield, without giving up my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. As the Senator from Massachusetts recalls, this issue was \nreported by the committee in the last Congress, and I made a commitment \nin connection with other bills that we would bring it to a vote. In \nfact, I believe it was scheduled for a vote, or we were moving toward a \nvote. But for a variety of reasons--and there is no use rehashing the \nhistory of it--the Secretary of State called and asked that we pull it \nback and not force it to a vote last year. We honored that request.\n  This year, there have been a number of discussions. The President did \ncall and ask that we meet with his Director of the NSC, Sandy Berger, \nto talk about how we could bring it to a conclusion. At his request, I \ndid meet with him, and Senator Helms met with him. Other Senators that \nare interested have been talking with the President's representative. \nAnd we continue to work on that. I think some good progress has been \nmade as a result of those meetings. Some conditionalities have been \nmore or less agreed to. Of course, until it is final, it is never \nfinal. Some have been agreed to, some are still being discussed, and \nsome probably will have to have amendments or votes on them when it \ncomes to the floor of the Senate.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. We have made a decision to destroy \nour chemical weapons. That is a fact. We are doing that. He is also \nright that a number of countries have ratified that\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\ntreaty; some very important ones have not. Not only the United States \nhas not, but neither has Russia. The indications are that they may or \nmay not. Of course, neither has Iran.\n  There are some real questions that are legitimate questions on both \nsides of this issue. One of them is, of course, the verification \nquestion. How do you verify what some of the rogue countries may or may \nnot be doing? How do you deal with some of the questions about things \nlike the poison gas that we have seen in Japan? How do you deal with an \nissue like tear gas being used in our country? Also, there are very \nimportant questions like constitutional questions with regard to search \nand seizure in our country. The administration representative \nindicated, yes, that is an area where there is concern, and we need to \nwork on that. Work has been done, and we continue to work on it.\n  This week, I met with the chairman of the committee and talked \nthrough where we are and how we can continue to proceed on this matter. \nI have talked to other Senators on both sides of the aisle and both \nsides of the issue, as to how we can move it forward. I talked to Mr. \nBerger again and I urged him to do a couple things. One of those things \nis to seriously address, with the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, some very important parallel issues. Although they are not \nnecessarily tied together on a parallel basis, they are related and of \ngreat concern. The State Department reauthorization. In the previous \nyear, I think the State Department kind of indicated, no, we don't want \nto do anything. That is not a tenable position. I don't think that is \nthe administration's position.\n  I think the new Secretary of State has indicated that she understands \nand wants to do some of these things and has been talking to the \nchairman about that. I am hoping that additional conversations are \noccurring on that today between the Secretary of State and the chairman \nof the committee. In another parallel issue, for this very afternoon I \nhave been able to call together a meeting of the key players, Democrats \nand Republicans, House and Senate, on the U.N. reform matters. We met \nonce with the Secretary of State. We are meeting today with the new \nU.N. Ambassador, and we are getting a process to see how we deal with \nthe United Nations reforms and, of course, the money that the U.N. \nwould like to have from the United States.\n  So, again, that is a parallel. A lot of people are involved. None of \nthese issues are easily resolved. All of them are very important--what \nwe do about chemical weapons, about the State Department \nreauthorization, U.N. reform, and with regard to what happens \nprocesswise. I know what you are asking there.\n  It is our hope that we will be able to get this issue up in April. It \nprobably would involve some hearings in the committee. But action early \non, when we come back, to get it to the floor in a way where everybody \nwill be comfortable with what amendments will be offered. There is a \npossibility that a statute may be offered, or a regular bill, to be \nconsidered in conjunction with the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I have given a long answer, but I am saying this to make it clear to \nyou that I am working aggressively to address the concerns on all sides \nof this issue. I will continue to do so. I know you are concerned, and \nother concerns are concerned. You may feel that you have to do more. \nBut I have learned over the years that as long as everybody is talking, \nyou are probably making progress, and we are talking. I have also \nlearned that when you have a chairman that has legitimate concerns, you \nhave to give that chairman time to deal with those concerns.\n  We are trying to do that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished majority \nleader that, first of all, I thank him for taking the time to have this \ncolloquy. I think it is very important.\n  But let me say to the distinguished majority leader that during the \nyears that I was the ranking member negotiating this with the \ndistinguished chairman of committee, we traveled over all of this \nground. We have had these hearings. The Foreign Relations Committee has \nhad them. The Intelligence Committee has had them. The Armed Services \nCommittee has had them. And we all know sort of what the clouds are \nthat are there. There is no new sort of definition with respect to \nthose clouds.\n  For this Senator--and I know I speak for several other Senators, and \nI think two or three of them are on the floor right now--we do not want \nto wind up in the situation which I have seen previously. I negotiated \nthe agreement that brought us to the floor last year with a vote. We \nall know we got caught up in the politics of the Presidential campaign, \nand that predicated that it may not have been the best moment.\n  The problem is that we run out of time. The clock tolls on us \nautomatically on April 29. We do not want to wind up in a situation \nwhere there is an ability on the floor to have so little time left that \nwe can't work through the problems. Recognizing the road we have \ntraveled here, I do not want to come back to a situation where we have \nkind of sat here while the negotiations are going on and then there is \nno window of opportunity to sufficiently let the legislative process \nwork its will.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will in just a moment.\n  I would like to say to the majority leader that we would like to help \nthe majority leader and others to leverage the reality here. What we \nwould like to suggest is that there be sort of an internal date certain \nwithin the Senate--we would suggest that date be when we return--that, \nbetween now and when we return, the administration, the chairman, and \nthe appropriate parties have to come to cloture. If they can't come to \ncloture----\n  Mr. LOTT. Closure.\n  Mr. KERRY. Come to cloture on these issues, and, if they can't come \nto that resolution, this should be on the floor of the Senate for us to \ndeal with in a matter of legislative urgency.\n  I know, Mr. President, that there is a significant group of us \nprepared to exercise every right available to us with respect to the \nSenate business in order to try to guarantee that we have the \nopportunity to act on the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, one thing is that \nI do not want to mislead the Senator with regard to the probability of \nhearings. I assume that was a possibility. I do not think it needs long \nhearings. But I think a day or two--and I have not asked for those or \ncalled for them, and the chairman may or may not feel that they are \nneeded.\n  So I may have mislead when I was indicating that we are talking about \nanother whole round of hearings. I agree with the Senator. I do not \nthink a lot of hearings need to be done again.\n  But I wanted to clarify that point. I didn't mean to infer that we \nwere going through a long list or that a decision has been made. But it \nis something that I have asked: Is there going to be a need for a \nhearing on a day or so before action could occur? It could.\n  There is another point. I want to commend the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl, who has spent a lot of time and has worked on these issues \nwhen he was in the House Armed Services Committee and continues to be \nvery interested in them. He is very knowledgeable when you talk about \narticle X, article XI, and all of the ramifications. He knows what is \nin this convention. He has very legitimate concerns, some of which have \nbeen addressed in a way that I think the Senator from Massachusetts \nwould agree with and find acceptable. Others are still open, and there \nis time to work on those.\n  I want to recognize the work of Senator Kyl. He may want to respond \nor comment on some of what has been said here today.\n  I just wanted to make that one clarification.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that, Mr. President. I know that the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Senator Levin, is equally as versed and has had a long \ninterest. I know that all of us believe very deeply that where there \nmay be a legitimate question, we are and have been--and I think the \nadministration has been--fully prepared to try to suggest legitimacy. \nBut we can't allow an endless series of questions to be an excuse for \nputting us in the box where the U.S. Senate cannot perform its \nconstitutional responsibility to advise\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nand consent on a treaty as important as this one.\n  So we are in the predicament here where we want to offer a good-faith \neffort to work through every single one of those particular issues. But \nwe have to signal that we can't do so simultaneously taking away from \nourselves our own rights to be guaranteed that the Senate ought to be \nable to have a vote.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  To the majority leader I would say the power of the majority in the \nCongress is a power to schedule. There are a number of us on our side \nof the aisle who have been patient to the edge of our abilities on this \nissue. And the question that is being asked is, Will we have an \nopportunity to consider the chemical weapons treaty on the floor of the \nSenate? What I heard the Senator from Mississippi say is that he hoped \nthat would be the case. I very much would like to hear a commitment at \nsome point today or tomorrow, before we leave, that we will when we \nreturn have an opportunity at a time certain to continue the chemical \nweapons treaty.\n  Mr. LOTT. As the distinguished Senator knows, if he will yield, Mr. \nPresident, the scheduling does to a large degree rest in the hands of \nthe majority leader. But it is usually done in coordination with both \nsides of the aisle. Like on the Mexico certification, or \ndecertification, issue, quite often it can be objected to. I mean that, \nif I today proceeded to call up the House-passed version with the idea \nof offering a bipartisan substitute to it, we would have to get \nagreement to do that. The other option is to just call up \ndecertification, which we could do, and start the 10-hour process \nrunning.\n  The point, though, is that you have to work with a lot of different \nparties. And I intend to do that. I think the decision will come up in \nApril, and we will work in the direction to say that we can get it up \nby a date certain. Once again, I think it might raise expectations \nbeyond what is achievable.\n  But we are continuing to work on that, and we are going to do it this \nvery day.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to reiterate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to finish this \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  As further evidence, if I could, I gave the Democratic leader \nyesterday and members of our conference--and I presume it was given to \nthe Democratic caucus--a list of items that we anticipate we will \nconsider prior to the Memorial Day recess. It includes nuclear waste, \nsupplemental appropriations, the TEAM Act, comptime, flextime, \nlegislation regarding chemical weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention \ntreaty, and others.\n  It is on our list of things that we anticipate will be considered \nbefore we come back.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the problem is that this particular \nconvention stands in a different place from all of those other things \nwhich the majority leader has listed, and for obvious reasons. The \nother things don't have a drop-dead date on them which runs into the \nconvention processes themselves, which are controlled by other \ncountries--not by us.\n  So I think everybody understands how it works around here. We could \nwind up in a situation where we would have a very long debate. And if \nwe need to have a very long debate, we want to make certain that we \nhave the ability to adequately flesh out concerns for all Members and \nstill not run up against that deadline, or drop-dead date.\n  So I think what we are really trying today to say to the majority \nleader is that this has to be the first priority when we come back, or \nclearly stated as to what the date will be with a date certain.\n  All we are trying to do is help the majority leader convey that \nmessage to parties on his side because otherwise, obviously, we are \nleft no choice but to try to do whatever we can to leverage a date. We \nare not precluding nor predetermining an outcome. But we are asking for \nthe Senate to be able to exercise its rights and privileges.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield \nfor a question? I wonder if the majority leader might listen because \nthe drop-dead date issue is a critical issue on this, of course, and \nthe Senate should be allowed to work its will in whatever way in time \nso that, if we ratify, our ratification will be relevant.\n  My question to the Senator from Massachusetts is this: We do not know \nprecisely the drop-dead date in terms of Senate ratification, assuming \nit does ratify the treaty. But will the Senator from Massachusetts \nagree that it is some number of days in advance of April 29?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering whether the majority leader, if I could \njust ask, is aware of that fact. Could I ask the majority leader \nwhether or not, on the time of the Senator from Massachusetts, if the \nSenate does in fact ratify it, that ratification needs to come some \ndays in advance of the 29th in order to meet the 29th deadline?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am aware that when you have a treaty issue, there are \nactions that occur after the treaty that could take time. We will have \nto--at some point we could have a full debate about what that drop-dead \ndate is. That is the point here. It is not a specific date in terms of \nhaving to take up the treaty to get the work done, but it is a fact if \nyou assume some action must be taken, you have to back off that in \norder to get the work done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the majority leader for his time on this. We will \nobviously be discussing it in the next day or so, and I look forward to \nour coming forward to some kind of mutual agreement. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I just wanted to also comment on this \nissue and state that I think we are to the point where it is not \nresponsible for the Senate to go on with its other business if we \ncannot get agreement among Senators to bring up this very important \nmatter on a timely basis. I think clearly we can do other work while we \nwait for the time certain to bring up the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nbut if we cannot get agreement to bring it up, then I do not think it \nis responsible for us to go ahead and proceed with business as usual.\n  Unfortunately, under the rules of the Senate, the only option \navailable to those of us in the minority is to insist that this issue, \nwhich is time sensitive, be given attention by the Senate or at least \nget scheduled for attention by the Senate before we proceed to other \nmatters, and I would expect to do that in the future. I do think the \nmajority leader is trying to move ahead with this, but evidently there \nare objections being raised by others. I do not question that \namendments will be offered. I do not question that real issues will be \nraised about different portions of the treaty. That is what we are \ndesignated to do under the Constitution, to debate those issues and \nvote on them. We do have a responsibility, though, to have a final vote \non this treaty in a timely fashion, and I think until we can get \nagreement to do that, it is very difficult to proceed with business as \nusual.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me add my voice to this for just a \nmoment. For many of us who have chemical weapons stored in our State--\nand there are a good many States--this piece of legislation becomes \nhighly important because certain language we hope to be in this treaty \nwill allow us to look for alternate sources other than burning or \ndestroying by burning. And so particularly in my case, where we have \nthe nerve gas, this treaty becomes vital to us. And to have it timely \nconsidered becomes a very important aspect of alternative sources under \nthis international treaty.\n  So I am here pleading for my constituency to eliminate the so-called \nchemical weapons. We are being held up for reorganization of the State \nDepartment, reorganization of United Nations, this thing or that thing. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\nheld up when we have a deadline of April 28 and we have people out \nthere worried about chemical weapons and how you destroy them. We have \nthe answer under this piece of legislation, but we cannot go forward \nwith it.\n  Mr. President, I hope you will listen to my friend from New Mexico, \nthat there is going to be an effort to bring this piece of legislation \nup because of the deadline. If we worried about deadlines, we would \nhave a budget. We do not have a budget. But this is an international \ntreaty, and it has a deadline. And for one, I do not want to miss it \nbecause of the chemical weapons that need to be destroyed and the way \nthey are to be destroyed so that we might protect your constituents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition under the time \nallocated to Senator Daschle in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 60 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2501-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2504-S2507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the last several days of debate in \nthis Chamber we have heard those who favored the appointment of a \nspecial counsel say that time is of the essence, and that we should \nmove forward and ask the Attorney General to make this appointment as \nquickly as possible. In fact, they were so determined to pass this \nresolution as a bon voyage gift to the President as he heads off to the \nHelsinki summit that we had to vote today. Today, before the President \nleft, we had to make certain that this gesture was made. Many of us \nfelt this was unnecessary and ill-timed and, frankly, unprecedented, \nthat this type of embarrassment would be directed at the President as \nhe left our shores to head off for a critical summit with the only \nother superpower with nuclear weapons in the world. And yet those who \nprevailed on the majority side were convinced that time was of the \nessence: let us move forward and do it now.\n  Catching that spirit, I come before the Senate today with the \nsuggestion that we not stop with this resolution but go even further \nand plumb the depths of the real problem that we are examining here. It \ngoes beyond the 1996 Presidential campaign. It goes beyond the \nDemocratic Party. What we are focusing on is our very campaign finance \nsystem itself as used by Presidential candidates, congressional \ncandidates, Democrats and, yes, Republicans.\n  And so today I am hoping that that same sense of urgency, that same \ncommitment to truth, and that same perseverance that we find changes to \nwin back the confidence of the American people will be demonstrated \nwhen I call a resolution before this body in a few moments.\n  You see, Mr. President, those who follow Federal election campaigns \nknow that there have been some dramatic changes over the last few \ndecades. Federal election campaign costs have increased from an \nestimated $2.65 billion in the 1996 cycle--that is a threefold increase \nover campaign spending just 20 years ago even adjusting for inflation--\n$2.6 billion on our campaigns. In the 1995-96 election cycle, the \nDemocratic Party committees raised $332 million, a 73-percent increase \nover the $192 million raised just 4 years before. The Republicans \noutdid us, as usual, raising $549 million, a 74-percent increase over \nthe $316 million that they raised 4 years earlier.\n  Take a look at congressional races. In 1976, all congressional races \nin the United States cost $99 million. By 1996, 20 years later, that \n$99 million had mushroomed to $626 million--more than a sixfold \nincrease.\n  Soft money. Well, for those who do not follow this closely, it may be \na curiosity to use these terms ``hard money'' and ``soft money,'' but \npoliticians know what it is all about. Soft money is kind of the \nmystery money in politics. And has it grown. Take a look at the fact \nthat since 1992, the amount of soft money in campaigns has tripled, \nfrom $86 million to $263 million.\n  Stepping aside from the whole debate about the nature of campaigns \nand whether they are too negative, too personal and too nasty, most \neveryone will concede that we are plowing more and more money into our \npolitical campaigns in America.\n  There is a curious thing that has to be noted, though. As political \ncampaigns have become longer, more expensive, and more negative, voters \nhave apparently decided not to participate in elections. Consider this. \nBetween 1948 and 1968, 60 percent of the electorate showed up to vote \nin a Presidential election. Then from 1972 to 1992, we saw a 53 percent \nturnout, a decline after Watergate. Listen to what happened in 1996, \nthe most expensive Federal election in our history for congressional \ncandidates, senatorial candidates and Presidential candidates, heaping \ndollar upon dollar in this election process. The voters out there \nlistened carefully and a majority of them decided to stay home. So, for \nthe first time since 1948, we had fewer than 50 percent of the \nelectorate turning out to vote in a Presidential election; 49 percent \nof the electorate turned out. Is it not interesting that the more money \nwe plow into our election campaigns, the fewer voters turn out?\n\n  Consider if you had a company and you were designing a marketing \nprogram and you went to the owners of the company and said, ``We have \njust got the statistics and information back. After we spent millions \nof dollars on advertising, people are buying fewer products.'' It might \nraise some serious questions. Maybe your advertising campaign is not \nwhat it should be--and I think the voters tell us that when they see \nnegative ads. But perhaps the fact that you are spending more on \nadvertising is not helping the low regard people have for your product. \nIn this case, the voters told us, in 1996, in the November election, \nthat they had a pretty low regard for the product, the candidates, all \nof us.\n  I think there is a message here, an important message about the \nfuture of this democracy. We can talk about special investigations: Did \nsomeone violate the law in 1996, Democrat or Republican, and should we \nhold them accountable if they did? But if we do not get down to the \nroot cause of the problem here, if we do not address what I consider to \nbe the serious issue of campaign finance reform, I can guarantee the \ncynicism and skepticism among voters will just increase. So, we have \nheard a lot of talk today about the sense of urgency and the need to \ndeal quickly with this whole question of campaign finance reform. Some \nof my colleagues have said, ``Oh, don't move too quickly now; let us \nmake sure we make the right changes.''\n  Let me show a little illustration. How much time have we spent on the \nissue of campaign finance reform in the last 10 years? Mr. President, \n6,742 pages of hearings; 3,361 floor speeches--add one for this one \ntoday; 2,748 pages of reports from the Congressional Research Service, \n1,063 pages of committee reports; 113 votes in the Senate; 522 \nwitnesses; 49 days of testimony; 29 sets of hearings by 8 different \ncongressional committees; 17 filibusters; 8 cloture votes on one bill; \n1 Senator arrested and dragged to the floor--with bodily injury, I \nmight add--and 15 reports issued by 6 different congressional \ncommittees. And what do we have to show for it? Nada, zero, zilch, \nnothing. What we have to show for it is the call for an independent \ncounsel to determine whether someone has violated the laws under the \ncurrent system. I think there is a lot more to this.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in believing that if this process of \ninvestigation does not lead to reform, the American people will be \ndisappointed. It is one thing to be hyperinflated with moral rectitude \nabout the violations of campaign law. But that is not enough. Just \ncataloging the sins of the current system, that is not enough. The real \ntest is whether we are prepared to change the system, reform the law, \nand return public confidence to our democratic process.\n  There are a lot of options out there. One of those that is frequently \nspoken of is the McCain-Feingold legislation, I believe the only \nbipartisan campaign reform bill before us. Two Republican Senators and, \nI believe, 22 Democratic Senators have come together in an effort to \nhave campaign finance reform. I have cosponsored it. It may not be the \nbest, or the only, but it is a good one. We should consider it as a \nstarting point in the debate.\n  Yesterday, my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, Senator\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\nKerry of Massachusetts, and others announced agreement to introduce a \nplan modeled after the Maine election law reform. It is a very \ninteresting proposal which would really deflate the money in politics. \nSenator Wellstone is here to join me in this debate and describe that \nbill and his own thoughts on that subject.\n  There are lots of ideas, good ideas. We have to really dedicate \nourselves with the same sense of urgency and with the same passion to \nreforming the system that we are dedicated to investigating wrongdoing \nunder the current political finance system.\n  At this point, I yield to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek recognition in his own \nright?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is speaking within the 60 minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Of course, the Senator will stay within the 60 \nminutes. And, I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, far less than 60 \nminutes. I just wanted to add a couple of things to what the Senator \nfrom Illinois has just said.\n  First of all, I really appreciate the emphasis of the Senator from \nIllinois on representative democracy in our country. I think this is \nthe central issue for this Congress. I think this is the most important \nissue in American politics. I have spoken before on the floor of the \nSenate about this. I am not going to repeat what I have said already.\n  But I really think, if we want to have people engaged in the \npolitical process, if we want people to register to vote and vote in \nelections, if we want people to believe in our political process, if we \nwant people to believe in us, then I think we absolutely have to deal \nwith this awful mix of money and politics. Because regular people--\nwhich I use in a positive way--in Illinois and Minnesota and Oklahoma \nand around the country, know that, No. 1, too much money is spent on \nthese campaigns; No. 2, some people count more than others and there is \ntoo much special interest access and influence; No. 3, there is too \nmuch of a money chase and Senators from both political parties have to \nspend entirely too much time raising money.\n  I just ran for office. I had to raise the money.\n  And, No. 4, I think people in the country know that it is getting \ndangerously close to the point where either you are a millionaire \nyourself, or you have to be very dependent upon those that have the \nhugest amounts of capital for these expensive capital-intensive TV \ncampaigns. Otherwise, you are disqualified.\n  In a democracy, people should not be, de facto, disqualified because \nthey are not wealthy or because they do not have access to those people \nwho have the wealth or the economical clout or the political clout in \nAmerica. That turns the very idea of representative democracy on its \nhead. That takes the very goodness of our country and turns it on its \nhead. That takes the American dream and turns it on its head. I have \nsaid it before, but it is worth repeating, that if you believe in the \nstandard that each person ought to count as one and no more than one, \nthen you would be for reform.\n  My last point, because I could talk about this for a long, long time, \nmy colleague was kind enough to mention the McCain-Feingold bill. He \nwas kind enough to mention the bill that yesterday we agreed to \nintroduce, Senator Kerry and I, and Senator Glenn and Senator Reid; and \nSenator Bumpers was there as well.\n  Mr. President, the point today is as follows. I think people--\nunfortunately, but the proof is going to be in eating the pudding--\nbelieve that what is going on in the Congress amounts to little more \nthan symbolic politics. I think people believe we are going to have a \ncommittee investigation, an attempt to move some of these issues to the \nRules Committee, maybe try and bury this here, maybe have hearings and \nhearings and hearings, then have a variety of different charges or \ncountercharges made, maybe more polarization, maybe more accusations. \nThen, after all is said and done, it will be the same moving picture \nshown over and over and over again, where you have hearings, speeches, \nreports, witnesses, you name it, followed by the same hearings, the \nsame speeches, the same calls to action, the same kind of \ninvestigations, followed by inaction. I do not understand, for the life \nof me, why we do not move forward. I think the purpose of this \nresolution is to say, set a date.\n  A good friend of mine, Jim Hightower, who was great on the Ag \nCommittee, loves to say, ``You don't have to be `Who's Who' to know \nwhat's what.'' People in this country have figured this out. It is time \nfor reform. We know more than enough about what is wrong. We know more \nthan enough about what is wrong with this game, the ways it is broken, \nand it is time to fix it.\n  So this resolution calls for a date certain. It is right on mark, and \nI am proud to support it.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise also to support the unanimous-\nconsent request that will be propounded by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Almost the first question from our constituents that all of us, I \nsuppose, when we reach the airport going back to our States, confront \nis, ``Well, what are you working on?'' I know what I would like to be \nworking on. A moment ago we talked about the need for this Senate to \nwork on the chemical weapons treaty, a treaty that has been in the \nworks for a number of years, has been signed by many countries, and \nwould end the spread of poisonous gas around our world and make this a \nsafer world. I would like to be working on that, but we cannot get it \nto the floor of the Senate. I hope it will get here soon. The power of \nscheduling, of course, is not on this side of the aisle.\n  The Senator from Illinois raises the other issue that I would like \nfor us to be working on, and that is the issue of campaign finance \nreform. No one who has been paying attention in this country can fail \nto understand the need for us to consider campaign finance reform. The \nSenator from Illinois is simply raising the question, and a \nrecommendation is implicit, to say we would like, by a date certain, to \nhave a commitment to consider campaign finance reform on the floor of \nthe Senate. That is what the Senator from the State of Illinois is \nsaying to the Senate with his resolution, a resolution that I think is \ntimely, one that I support and one that I hope will allow us to reach \nan agreement with the majority party on a date certain to bring \ncampaign finance reform to the floor of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Illinois held up a chart that shows the number of \nhearings that have been held, the number of pages of testimony, the \nnumber of witnesses. There doesn't need to be a great deal more \ndiscussion about whether we should be considering campaign finance \nreform. The system is broken, it ought to be fixed, and there isn't \njust one answer to fix it. There are a number of ideas, probably from \nboth sides of the aisle, that can contribute to an approach that will \naddress this in a way the American people believe we ought to address \nthis issue.\n  So, this issue is not one that will simply go away. This is not an \nissue you can bury in the backyard somewhere and forget about it. Every \nday when you read the newspapers, you see stories, again, about this \ncampaign or that campaign, about this administration or that Member of \nCongress. The American people, I think soon, will insist to know who in \nthe Congress, in the House and the Senate, contributed to making \ncampaign finance reform a reality and who stood in the way.\n  I guess the message here is for those who do not want to see any \nreform of our campaign financing system, our message is to them: Get \nout of the way, let us at least have a shot on the floor of the Senate \nin crafting, hopefully, a bipartisan approach, if we can craft it, a \ncampaign finance reform proposal that gives the American people some \nconfidence that the abuses we have read about, the excesses, the \nexponential growth in campaign spending in this country can come to an \nend.\n  I happen to feel very strongly that one of the ingredients that is \nnecessary is spending limits. The Supreme Court had a decision in \nBuckley versus\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\nValeo--it was a 5 to 4 decision, I believe --in which they said it is \nperfectly constitutional to limit political contributions, but it is \nunconstitutional to limit political expenditures. Far be it for me to \nspeak over the shoulder of the Supreme Court, but, by the same token, I \ndon't understand that logic.\n  It seems to me, and we have had debate on this on a constitutional \namendment just in the last days, it seems to me that part of the answer \nto this problem is to reasonably limit campaign expenditures for all \npoliticians running for all offices in a fair and thoughtful way. We do \nnot deserve the kind of campaigns that the American people are now \ngetting.\n\n  There are other models around the world. I kind of like the British \nsystem, where they apparently sound a starting gun, or whatever it is, \nand for 30 or 45 days, they scramble and wrestle and debate and do \nwhatever you do in campaigns, and the fur flies and the dust is all \nover, and then the bell goes off and it is over. It is over. Then they \nvote.\n  In this country, my Lord, what happens is years in advance of an \nelection now, we have campaign activities cranking up for President and \nthe Senate and Congress, and it never ends. It bores the American \npeople to death, first of all, and second, they have become so long and \nso expensive, is it any wonder that 50 percent of the American people \nsaid when it comes time to casting a vote, they say, ``Count me out, \nI'm not going to participate''?\n  There are a lot of things we need to do to reform our political \nsystem and make it better. It seems to me job one is this issue of \nreforming the campaign finance system, the method by which all \ncampaigns are financed in this country. The Senator from Illinois is \nsimply saying today, let us have an opportunity, a commitment, a date \nby which the Senate will consider campaign finance reform. I am pleased \nto support him, and I hope others in the Senate will do the same. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there have been a lot of headlines in the \nlast several weeks of embarrassment to both political parties. There \nhave been a lot of questions asked about the system by which we raise \nfunds at all levels. Questions were raised about the use of a telephone \nby the Vice President, and I do not know, frankly, what was legal and \nwhat was proper in that situation, but we all know that at least two \nMembers of this body have acknowledged that they used their office \ntelephones in campaigns gone by to raise money. They said they will \nnever do it again, as the Vice President has said. But it raises a \nbipartisan challenge to us in limiting campaign fundraising activities \nin any public building.\n  There was a question raised as to whether or not an employee at the \nWhite House was handed a check for the Democratic National Committee \nwhich she then turned over to the committee, and whether that was legal \nor proper. We know 2 years ago a Republican Congressman on the floor of \nthe House walked around handing out campaign checks from tobacco \ncompanies to their favorite candidates, and that, of course, raises a \nbipartisan question about the propriety of receiving or distributing \ncampaign checks in a public building, on the floor of the House or the \nSenate. These are all legitimate and bipartisan questions.\n  This morning's Washington Post raised a question on the front page as \nto whether a Member of Congress was putting some pressure on a certain \ngroup to raise money for him in the last campaign, and the pressure \nwent so far as to suggest that the Ambassador from the country involved \nwas saying, ``This is unusual; we have never had this kind of pressure \nput on us.'' The same charges are made against the White House: Did \nthey go too far in soliciting contributions? Again, a bipartisan \nproblem and one we clearly should address.\n  For those who have tunnel vision on this and see all of the sins and \nwrongdoing only on the Democratic side, I think in all honesty, they \nknow better. We are all guilty of this. We are guilty of this at the \ncongressional level, at the Presidential level, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and to merely turn that spotlight on one group or one \nparty really does not get to the real challenge here. And the real \nchallenge is, will we change the system?\n  The resolution that I am going to offer says to the Senate, let us \nmake a commitment, both sides of the aisle, that by a time certain, we \nwill bring to this floor campaign finance reform legislation and pass \nit by a time certain. I do not presume what that might include. I do \nnot presume to suggest that any bill pending might be passed. We might \ncome up with a new work product completely, totally, but I do suggest \nto you that unless and until we make this commitment to reform the \nsystem, the skepticism and cynicism will continue and may increase.\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Dorgan and \nWellstone, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Senate Resolution 65, a resolution calling \non the Senate to commit to bring comprehensive campaign finance reform \nlegislation to the floor by May 31 and to adopt, as a goal, the \nenactment of such legislation by July 4 of this year; that the \nresolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did you conclude, I ask my colleague from Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will just make a couple brief comments concerning \ncampaign finance.\n  One, I share some of the concerns of my colleague from Illinois. I \nwill be happy to work with him. I did object to the resolution saying \nwe wanted to have it done by May 31 or July 4. But I am committed to \nmaking campaign reform. And I will work with my colleague and friend \nfrom Illinois and others to try and see if we cannot come up with a \nbipartisan package that would do just that.\n  It may not include everything that everybody has been talking about, \nbut it will be constitutional, and, hopefully, may be passable through \nboth Houses. It may not include everything. We may have to pass a \ncouple pieces of legislation before we are done. But I have been \ncharged with the responsibility on this side to try to put together a \npackage that is saleable. I will work with my colleague and friend from \nIllinois to try to make that happen.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his statement. And \nit may be progress. I hope it is.\n  Would the Senator be kind enough to tell me his thoughts as to \nwhether or not we should accomplish significant and meaningful campaign \nfinance reform this year so that the 1998 election cycle can be a \ncleaner, perhaps better managed election with more interest and \nparticipation by our voters across the country?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to tell my colleague, if you are asking \nme what the effective date of the legislation will be, I am not sure. \nBut I do think that we have an interest, and I would say a bipartisan \ninterest, in trying to do some things together: Greater disclosure, \ntrying to make sure that nobody is forced or compelled to contribute to \nany campaign against their will, maybe making some change in \ncontribution limits, increasing individual limits, maybe reducing other \nlimits. Possibly we can get a bipartisan coalition on that, and doing a \nfew other things that we might be able to get agreement on.\n  But the effective date, well, that would be one of the things we will \nhave to wrestle with. That is a challenge. Some of those things for \ndisclosure, I expect could be effective certainly for the 1998 \nelection. If you changed individual contributions, which I am \ncontemplating offering as one suggestion, whether that should be \neffective immediately or effective post the 1998 election is something \nwe will have to discuss.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield further?\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could the Senator give me some assurance by the majority \nleadership that this issue should come to the floor this calendar year?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will just tell my colleague, I have been charged with \nthe responsibility of trying to make sure that we are ready to do that. \nIt is my hope and expectation that we will be ready to do that--not tie \nthis down to a particular timetable--but I hope that we will be able to \ndo it in the not-too-distant future. Maybe we will be able to meet the \ntimeframe as suggested by my colleague from Illinois. I am not ready to \ngive a date. But you are saying for this year. I hope that will be the \ncase.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield.\n  I will return and my colleagues will return with similar resolutions \nin the hopes that we can reach a bipartisan agreement for a timetable \nto consider this issue. Absent that agreement, many of us are afraid \nthat we will once again fall into this morass of hearings and speeches \nand a lot of jawboning and very little progress on the subject. I hope \nthat my colleague from Oklahoma will join me in that effort.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2504-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2507-S2509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VICTIM RIGHTS CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 924 just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 924) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     give further assurance to the right of victims of crime to \n     attend and observe the trials of those accused of the crime.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague and friend, \nSenator Leahy, for his cooperation in bringing this bill to the floor. \nAs I mentioned, the House passed this bill yesterday. It was by a vote \nof 418 to 9.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues, Senator Hatch, Senator Inhofe--\nwho is an original cosponsor of this legislation with me--Senator \nGrassley and Senator Kennedy and their staffs for working together with \nour staff to make this bill possible.\n  And I want to thank the bipartisan and bicameral cooperation that we \nhave had because we have negotiated with the House, came up with \nsimilar legislation to correct, I think, a mistake, a problem.\n  Mr. President, we introduce this legislation on behalf of the victims \nof the Oklahoma City bombing and other victims of crime. This \nlegislation will clarify the rights of victims to attend and observe \nthe trial of the accused and also testify at the sentencing hearing.\n  The Victim Rights Clarification Act is necessary because a Federal \njudge interpreted his sequestration power as authorizing the exclusion \nof victims of crime from trial who will only be witnesses at \nsentencing. The district judge presiding over the Oklahoma City bombing \ncase basically gave the victims and their families two choices. They \ncould attend the trial and witness the trial--or in this case we have \nclosed-circuit TV for the families, since the trial is actually in \nDenver and many of the families are in Oklahoma City. So they have \nclosed-circuit TV. They have two options: They can view the trial in \nDenver or in Oklahoma City, or they could participate in the sentencing \nphase of the trial.\n  Most of the families of the victims wanted to do both--or many wanted \nto do both. They should not have had to make that decision. This \nlegislation will clarify that.\n  Such rulings as the judge made extend sequestration far beyond what \nCongress has intended. The accused has no legitimate basis for \nexcluding a victim who will not testify during the trial. Congress \nthought it already adopted a provision precluding such sequestration in \nthe victims' bill of rights. This bill clarifies the preexisting law so \nit is indisputable that district courts cannot deny victims and \nsurviving family members the opportunity to watch the trial merely \nbecause they will provide information during the sentencing phase of \nthe proceedings.\n  This bill also applies to all pending cases and in no way singles out \na case for unique or special treatment. Rather, a serious problem has \ncome to light and Congress has responded by clarifying the applicable \nFederal law across the country from this day forward.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has specifically upheld the power of Congress \nto make ``changes in law'' that apply even in pending cases. In \nRobertson versus Seattle Audubon Society, a unanimous court explained \nthat Congress can ``modify the provisions at issue'' in pending and \nother cases. This bill makes it clear that Federal crime victims will \nnot be denied the chance to watch the court proceedings simply because \nthey wish to be heard at sentencing.\n  This bill will be enforced through normal legal channels. Federal \ndistrict courts will make the initial determination of the \napplicability of the law. In disputed cases, the courts will hear from \nthe Department of Justice, counsel for the affected victims, and \ncounsel for the accused. If the district court persists in denying a \nvictim the right to observe a trial in violation of the law, both the \nDepartment of Justice and the victims can seek appellate review through \nthe appropriate pleadings.\n  Once again, Mr. President, this is an important piece of bipartisan \nlegislation that will clarify the intent of Congress with respect to a \nvictim's right to attend and observe a trial and testify at sentencing.\n  I very much appreciate the support of my colleagues in both the \nSenate and the House who have made this bill possible today. I am very \ngrateful for their assistance. I know that I am speaking on behalf of \nhundreds of victims and the families in Oklahoma City, that they are \ngrateful for this legislation, and a special thank you to my \ncolleagues, Senator Inhofe and Senator Leahy and Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Hatch, for making this bill possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends, Mr. Hatch, \nthe two Senators from Oklahoma, and Senator Grassley, as an original \ncosponsor of the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997.\n  I am glad we are considering and passing this important \nlegislation. They are doing this in an expeditious and bipartisan \nmanner.\n\n  Two of the most important rights Congress can safeguard for crime \nvictims are the right to witness the trial of the accused and the right \nto be heard in connection with the sentencing decision. The Victim \nRights Clarification Act is not the first time Congress has addressed \nthese two ideas. In 1990, we passed the Victims' Rights and Restitution \nAct, providing that crime victims shall have the right to be present in \nall public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court \ndetermines the testimony by the victim would be materially affected.\n  In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Congress included several \nvictims' rights provisions. For instance, we amended rule 32 of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require Federal judges at the \nsentencing for crimes of violence or sexual assault to determine if the \nvictim wishes to make a statement.\n  Last year, we enacted the Televised Proceedings for Crime Victims Act \nas part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. \nThat responded to the difficulties created for victims of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing.\n  Mr. President, I think this is important because so often what we set \nin the criminal procedures in the Federal court are then adopted by the \nState courts. During my days as a prosecutor, I felt victims should \nhave complete access to the court during a trial and that victims \nshould be heard upon sentencing. Frankly, I found many times when the \nperson being sentenced had suddenly gotten religion, had suddenly \nbecome a model person, usually dressed in a better suit and tie than I \nwore as a prosecutor and was able to cry copious tears seeking \nforgiveness and saying how it was all a mistake, sometimes reality came \nto the courtroom\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\nonly when the victim would speak. I remember one such victim had very \nlittle to say, with heavy scars on her face that would probably never \nheal. That said more than she might.\n  I say that, Mr. President, because in enacting this legislation, we \naffect not only Federal courts directly, which of course I think is \nimportant, but I say to my colleagues in the Senate that after this is \nexperienced in the Federal courts for a couple of years, we are going \nto find the same procedures followed by State courts all over this \ncountry. We saw it in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We see it \nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. If they work in the Federal \ncourts, they tend to work in the State courts.\n  I am glad to join with my friend from Oklahoma, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma and his colleague, Senator Inhofe, in \nsupport of this legislation which shows how responsive Congress can be \nto victims' rights.\n  The Supreme Court has also spoken to whether victim impact statements \nare permissible in death penalty cases.\n  In the 1991 case Payne versus Tennessee, the Supreme Court made clear \nthat a sentencing jury in a capital case may consider victim impact \nevidence relating to the victim's personal characteristics and the \nemotional impact of the murder on the victim's family.\n  The Court observed that it is an affront to the civilized members of \nthe human race to say that at sentencing in a capital case, a parade of \nwitnesses may praise the background, character, and good deeds of the \ndefendant, but nothing may be said that bears upon the character of, or \nthe harm imposed upon, the victims.\n  Unfortunately, the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing case are \nbeing categorically excluded from both watching the trial and providing \nvictim impact testimony. Thus the victims are faced with an \nexcruciating dilemma: If they sit outside the courtroom during the \ntrial, they may never learn the details of how the justice system \nresponded to this horrible crime. On the other hand, if they attend the \ntrial, they will never be able to tell the jury the full extent of the \nsuffering the crime has caused to them and to their families.\n  I do not believe that current law thrusts this painful choice upon \nvictims in this country. However, recent court rulings reveal the need \nto clarify and even hone existing law. That is exactly what Congress is \ndoing by passing the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997.\n  This important legislation will:\n  Clarify that a court shall not exclude a victim from witnessing a \ntrial on the basis that the victim may, during the sentencing phase of \nthe proceedings, make a statement or present information in relation to \nthe sentence.\n  Specify that a court shall not prohibit a victim from making a \nstatement or presenting information in relation to the sentence during \nthe sentencing phase of the proceedings solely because the victim has \nwitnessed the trial.\n  Just as importantly, the Victim Rights Clarification Act will not:\n  Apply to victims who testify during the guilt phase of a trial.\n  Eliminate a judge's discretion to exclude a victim's testimony during \nthe sentencing phase that will unfairly prejudice the jury. \nSpecifically, the legislation allows for a judge to exclude a victim if \nhe or she finds basis--independent of the sole fact that the victim \nwitnessed the trial--that the victim's testimony during the sentencing \nphase will create unfair prejudice.\n  Attempt to strip a defendant of his or her constitutional rights.\n  Overturn any final court judgments.\n  My cosponsors and I worked together to pass this legislation within a \ntime-frame that could benefit the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing \ncases.\n  Our final legislative product, however, will not only assist the \nvictims in the Oklahoma City bombing case, but crime victims throughout \nthe United States.\n  In response to real people, real problems and real pain, Congress has \ndemonstrated its ability to find a real solution--the Victim Rights \nClarification Act of 1997.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly in support of \nH.R. 924, the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997. A companion to \nthis bill was introduced this past Friday by Senator Nickles as S. 447, \nwhich is cosponsored by Senator Inhofe, myself, Senator Leahy, and \nSenator Grassley. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this vital \nbill because it advances the rights of crime victims in the criminal \njustice process. This bill will ensure that victims of a crime who may \nbe victim-impact witnesses at the sentencing phase of a trial are able \nto attend that trial and still testify at sentencing.\n  Mr. President, too often the victims of crime seem to be forgotten as \nthe wheels of justice turn. In a sense, they are victimized twice--\nfirst by the criminal, and then by a justice system that too frequently \ntreats them as irrelevant to the administration of justice.\n  This legislation clarifies that the victims and survivors of crime \nwho might present testimony at sentencing about the effects of the \ndefendant's act should not be prevented from observing the trial. It \nalso clarifies that, conversely, observing the trial is not grounds for \nexcluding a victim or survivor from presenting impact testimony at \nsentencing. In 1991, the Supreme Court ruled in Payne v. Tennessee [501 \nU.S. 808] ruled that victims and survivors may be given the right to \nprovide testimony at sentencing about the victim and the impact of the \ncrime on the victim's family. Since then, Congress has ensured that the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide this right to victims of \nviolent crimes when the defendant is tried in federal court.\n\n  Recent court decisions have made it evident that some clarification \nof this right is badly needed. These decisions have excluded from \ntrials victims and survivors who might give impact testimony at \nsentencing.\n  Generally, witnesses may be excluded from viewing a trial until they \nhave testified. The rationale for this rule, known as the rule on \nwitnesses and embodied in rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, is \nthe need to prevent witnesses from collaborating on their testimony, as \nwell as the need to prevent each witness from shaping his or her \ntestimony to the testimony that already has been presented. Those \nrationales do not apply, however, when victims testify at sentencing \nabout the effect of the crime on their own lives. As a result of this \nbill, victims and survivors will be permitted to observe the trial and \nstill testify about the effect of the crime on their lives, without \nrunning afoul of the policy underpinnings for excluding witnesses from \nviewing a trial.\n  Another rationale for application of the rule on witnesses, and one \nthat has been advanced to prevent victims from both observing the trial \nand presenting impact testimony, holds that a victim may testify only \nabout the effect of the crime on his or her life, not about the effect \nof the trial on his life. But, Mr. President, for the victim the trial \nis one of the effects of the crime and becomes forever a part of the \nvictim's life.\n  Remember, this amendment deals only with victim impact testimony. By \nthat point in the process, the defendant already has been convicted. In \nmy view, it is not unfair for the law to treat the effect on a victim \nof viewing a trial as part of the effect of the crime, since the trial \nis a proximate, reasonably foreseeable consequence of the commission of \na crime. As the result, a victim should be free to see the trial and \nstill give victim-impact testimony at sentencing.\n  This bill will ensure that victims of crimes have an opportunity to \nalleviate some of their suffering through witnessing the operation of \nthe criminal justice system. Moreover, this bill will accomplish this \nsalutary result without having forced upon them the cruel choice of \nobserving the trial or giving impact testimony at sentencing. Indeed, \nthe bill before the Senate is a significant improvement over the \nlegislation originally introduced in the other body because, unlike the \noriginal House bill, it specifically ensures that victims have the \nright both to attend the trial and provide impact testimony at \nsentencing. The opportunity to do both is critical to providing closure \nto victims and ensuring justice for victims, as well as defendants and \nsociety.\n  Mr. President, this provision is not controversial. I hope that it \ncan be\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\npassed by the Senate and sent to the President for his approval without \ndelay.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Nickles and Leahy in getting through the Senate H.R. 924, the \nVictim Allocution Clarification Act. This is an important issue for \nvictims and their families of the Murrah Federal Building bombing. \nClearly, we would not have been able to get this through unless there \nwas widespread support for clarifying congressional intent with respect \nto the rights of victims and their families.\n  Although the Victims Rights and Resolution Act of 1990 provided that \nvictims have the right to be present at all public court proceedings, \nit conditioned that on a court determination that the testimony by the \nvictim would not be materially affected if the victim heard other \ntestimony at the trial. Recent courts decisions have held that victims \ncannot attend the trial and submit a victim's impact statement. H.R. \n924 clarifies congressional intent by allowing the victim and their \nfamily to both attend the trial and submit a statement during the \nsentencing phase.\n  I believe this language has reached a delicate balance between \nprotecting the rights of the victims while maintaining the \nconstitutional protections of the defendant. As noted by Senator \nNickles, it is critical that we pass H.R. 924 before the trial in the \nOklahoma City bombing case begins on March 31. I appreciate the efforts \nof all involved in getting through the Senate and House expeditiously.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 924) was deemed read a third time and passed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nLeahy from Vermont. We have done something rather unusual. We worked \ntogether in a very bipartisan fashion to do some good work, and we did \nit very quickly. It is not often that Congress passes legislation this \nquickly, and we did so.\n  Also, I want to thank Senator Daschle and Senator Lott because we \nwanted to expedite this. We would like to get it to the President \nbefore he leaves the country today. This trial happens to start on the \n31st of this month.\n  I might mention that this is the third piece of legislation that we \nhave passed that deals directly, or has had some impact, I guess, as a \nresult of the Oklahoma City bombing. Last Congress, we passed \nlegislation dealing with habeas corpus reform, one of the most \nsignificant improvements, I think, in our statutes dealing with \ncriminal law in a long time. We wanted to have an end to endless \nappeals. I think the Oklahoma City tragedy gave us great momentum to \nmake that happen. I remember several of the victims coming to testify, \nurging Congress to enact a crime bill, but also urging Congress to \nenact habeas reform because they wanted to see justice soon rather than \nlater.\n  We also passed legislation to allow closed-circuit TV so victims \nwould not have to go all the way to Denver. I was disappointed the \ndecision was made that the trial would be held in Denver. Originally, \nthe judge said the people would have to attend to witness the trial. \nThis trial could last for months. We passed legislation basically \nmandating that closed-circuit TV would be allowed in this case and, \nhopefully, other cases. Hopefully, we will not have other cases, but if \nwe have another case that might be identical to this, the victims and \ntheir families would not have to travel several hundred miles just to \nbe able to witness the trial.\n  Finally, we passed this legislation, this important legislation, to \nallow victims and their families to be able to witness a trial and \nalso, if they desire, to be able to testify during the sentencing \nphase. This would not have happened if we did not have bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for making it happen. I am delighted. On \nbehalf of hundreds of Oklahoma City families who are directly impacted, \nwe say thank you to both our colleagues in the House and the Senate for \npassing this legislation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2507-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2509-S2511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM NEEDED\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate for the first time. I do so with mixed emotions. Following in \nthe great tradition of this seat once held by such notables as Dick \nRussell and Sam Nunn, I am poignantly aware that freshman Senators \nshould be seen and not heard. However, there is an issue building in \nthis country which I feel obligated to comment on and regarding which I \ncan no longer remain silent. This is the issue of reforming the way we \nfinance our political campaigns at the Federal level, particulary seats \nin the U.S. Congress, and especially seats in the U.S. Senate.\n  There are many other issues facing our Nation to which we are all \ncompelled to pay time and attention: issues such as eliminating the \nFederal deficit, taking care of those who have served this Nation in \nthe Armed Forces, caring for our elderly and our young, improving our \nenvironment, and recommitting our educational system to excellence. \nHowever, as important as these issues are, in my opinion, they are all \nsecondary to the basic issue before us--the need to recapture the \npublic's faith in our democratic processes and our democratic \ninstitutions. Without that faith, all of these other endeavors will be \nundermined.\n  Confucius, the noted Chinese sage, once wrote that there were three \nthings that make up a great nation: First, a strong defense; second a \nvigorous economy; and third, the faith of people in their government. \nConfucius noted that a great nation might do without a strong defense, \nor that a great nation might be able to do without a vigorous economy, \nbut, Confucius noted that a great nation could not remain great without \nthe faith of the people in their government.\n\n  Mr. President, I am committed to supporting programs and plans for a \nstrong defense for our Nation. I serve on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee with great pride and a sense of awesome responsibility in \nthis regard. I also am committed to a vigorous economy, and to \nupgrading the quality of education in America, in particular to \ncreating hope for all of our qualified youngsters that they will have \nan opportunity to go to college or to receive vocational training. In \nfurtherance of this objective, I am a cosponsor of S. 12, a program \ndesigned to provide a $1,500 tax credit and a $10,000 tax deduction to \nworking families so they can see their children achieve the American \ndream. But I am especially committed to doing those things which we \nneed to do to enhance the faith of people in this country in their own \nGovernment by cleaning up the campaign finance mess.\n  When I first came to Washington as a young college student in the \nfall of 1963, I was inspired by President Kennedy to get involved in \npublic service. I especially enjoyed meeting and learning from Members \nof the Senate. I can vividly recall personal meetings with Senators \nRussell and Talmadge from Georgia, and a young Senator from West \nVirginia named Robert C. Byrd. In those days, my heart was stirred to \ndevote my life to politics.\n  Many of us in this Chamber today got our first taste of politics in \nthe early sixties. For me, that introduction was a positive one.\n  However, when I was sworn in here on the Senate floor on January 7 of \nthis year, I could not help but think how differently our current \nleaders and our current institutions are perceived by today's public, \nespecially our young people. I do not believe that our leaders or our \ninstitutions are of lesser caliber that those of my youth, but \nsomething has obviously gone wrong. We in public\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\noffice today face a hostile and cynical public, quite willing to take \nthe worst possible reports about us and believe them instantly. One of \nthe reasons for this attitude toward our public officials, I think, is \nthe constant money chase that U.S. House and U.S. Senate campaigns have \nbecome. Additionally, when this money is spent on 30-second character \nassassination ads which have become the staple of American politics, \ncan we expect our public to truly speak highly of us?\n\n  I believe the single most important step we can take in the Congress \nthis year in restoring public confidence and faith in our democracy is \nto enact meaningful campaign finance reform. This is not a problem for \nDemocrats. This is not a problem for Republicans. It is a problem for \nus all. We must act together in a bipartisan manner to clean up a \nsystem which has gotten completely out of control and which undermines \nboth the operation and reputation of our entire national Government.\n  Throughout my early days in this body, I and all of my colleagues \nhave been under a constant barrage of reports of campaign financing \nimproprieties in the 1996 elections. I feel very strongly that our \ncurrent campaign system has become a national embarrassment.\n  Will Rogers said back in the 1930's that, ``Politics has got so \nexpensive that it takes lots of money to even get beat with.'' How true \nthat is, especially today. In the 1960's a Georgia politician remarked, \n``The only thing tainted about political money is that it 'taint mine \nand 'taint enough.''\n  The American public isn't laughing anymore. They are demanding a \nchange in the attitudes of politicians on the question of campaign \nfundraising. We currently have a political system which is drowning in \nmoney and rife with real and potential conflicts of interest. Simply \nstated, we have too many dollars chasing and being chased by too many \npoliticians too much of the time.\n  This unseemly money chase has taken its toll in terms of public \nconfidence. The election year of 1996 witnessed both a record high in \nthe amount of money spent in pursuit of Federal office--a staggering \n$800 million--and the second worst voter turnout in American history! \nIn 1996, 10 million fewer voters went to the polls to cast their \nballots in that Presidential year than went to the polls 2 years \nearlier. What's wrong with this picture? Some $220 million was spent on \nSenate races alone. In my Senate race in Georgia, I raised and spent \nsome $3.5 million, but was outspent by a multimillionaire who spent \nover $10 million running for the Senate seat--$7 million of which was \nhis own money. Is it any wonder that more and more of our citizens see \nthat there is a for sale sign on more and more public offices in \nAmerica? If we don't bring about reform of this process, limit \nexpenditures, and establish rules for everyone to play by, the average \ncitizen will have less and less chance to serve in this body or run for \npublic office. Senator Daschle predicts that at the current pace of the \nmoney chase, in only 29 years the average Senate race will cost $143 \nmillion.\n\n  This is insanity.\n  We cannot allow the Congress of the United States, especially the \nU.S. Senate, to become a millionaires' club dominated by the rich and \nrun by the powerful special interests. This system continues to take \nits toll on this body as the money chase continues. The exodus of \ndistinguished, veteran legislators who have voluntarily departed from \nthe U.S. Senate in the last 2 years is at an historic level. Even in my \nfirst 2 months in the Senate, I have seen noted Republican and \nDemocratic legislators like Dan Coats, John Glenn, and Wendell Ford \nannounce their retirement from this body partially because of the \nfrustration of spending the next 2 years doing nothing but raising \nmoney for their upcoming campaign. Senator Ford spoke the thoughts of \nmany when he said on his retirement:\n\n       The job of being a U.S. Senator today has unfortunately \n     become a job of raising money to be reelected instead of a \n     job doing the people's business. Traveling to New York, \n     California, Texas, or basically any State in the country, \n     weekend after weekend for the next 2 years is what candidates \n     must do if they hope to raise the money necessary to \n     compete in a Senatorial election. Democracy as we know it \n     will be lost if we continue to allow government to become \n     one bought by the highest bidder, for the highest bidder. \n     Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in a \n     campaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and \n     hired guns.\n\n  The essential first step in repairing the current system is passage \nthis year of S. 25, the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance \nreform bill. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nproposal. It was the very first piece of legislation I attached my name \nto as a U.S. Senator. Briefly outlined, the bill would: ban soft money \ncontributions to national political parties; ban contributions by \npolitical action committees to Federal candidates; establish voluntary \nspending limits, including limits on personal spending, and require \nthat at least 60 percent of funds be raised from home State individuals \nfor Senate candidates; provide candidates who abide by these spending \nlimits with limited free and discounted television time and a discount \non postage rates; require greater disclosure of independent \nexpenditures; and prohibit contributions from those who are ineligible \nto vote in Federal elections, including non-American citizens.\n\n  Mr. President, the best endorsement I can think of for this measure \nis that had McCain-Feingold been in effect for the 1996 elections, we \nwould not now need to divert our attention away from the many serious \nproblems facing our country in order to devote time and energy toward \nthe investigation of campaign finance abuses. I serve on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which will be conducting this \ninvestigation. I fully support the purposes for which this \ninvestigation is intended, but I'm saddened it has to be undertaken in \nthe first place. I only hope that this effort will result in meaningful \ncampaign finance reform this year.\n\n   After we pass McCain-Feingold, we will need to turn to additional \nreforms in order to further improve our electoral process. I am working \non legislation which would strengthen the Federal Election Commission. \nThe proposal would do several things: Alter the Commission structure to \nremove the possibility of partisan gridlock; eliminate current \nrestrictions on the Commission's ability to launch criminal \ninvestigations, and to impose timely, and effective penalties against \nviolations of campaign law; and mandate electronic filing of all \nreports.\n  In addition, my proposal would expand the free air time provisions of \nMcCain-Feingold in order to help level the playing field for \nchallengers, and attack the single biggest factor in driving up \ncampaign expenditures--expensive television costs. Finally, I am \nlooking for methods to effectively enforce a shorter timeframe for the \nconduct of campaign-related activities.\n  Strengthening enforcement, expanding public access to information \nabout candidates and their ideas, and reducing the length of the \ncampaign season will, in my judgment, build upon the solid foundation \nwhich I hope we will create when we enact S. 25.\n  We have important work ahead, and often times there will be \nlegitimate partisan, philosophical, and regional differences of opinion \nwhich should be voiced and acted upon. However, we have a shared \ninterest, as Senators, but more importantly, as American citizens, in \nalways acting to enhance the respect our citizens have for our great \ncountry and our democratic institutions, especially this body.\n  In that spirit, and with that commitment, I urge my colleagues to \njoin in the cause of mending our broken campaign finance system. Let us \ncreate a new campaign finance system which instills public confidence \nrather than undermines it, and aids the governing process rather than \nhinders it.\n  President Grover Cleveland was right: ``A public office is a public \ntrust.'' The current money chase we all engage in is severely eroding \nthat trust. We must act to change a campaign finance system that is \nbroken, or continue to see good men and women from all walks of life \nand from all political persuasions broken by it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator. All I wanted to do is be the first \nto congratulate the Senator from Georgia on his first speech as a \nMember of this body. I can't tell you how delighted we all are to have \nthe Senator from Georgia here. The Senator from Georgia ran a tough \nrace. I know the Senator from Georgia has run other races before.\n  The people of Georgia know well that the Senator from Georgia did not \ncome to this campaign finance reform issue in the last few weeks, or \njust after the revelations of the last election. The Senator from \nGeorgia has been a leader in Georgia and in the country for years in \nauthoring and considering and moving forward the issue of campaign \nfinance reform. I can't think of anything that made me happier than \nwhen the Senator from Georgia said his first bill would be to cosponsor \nour bipartisan effort. On behalf of my colleagues and myself, it is a \ngreat moment in the Senate to have the Senator from Georgia join us and \nto hear his first speech.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if I may have 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I echo what my colleague from Wisconsin \nhas said. I believe, I say to the Senator from Georgia, that when we \npass the reform bill in this Congress--and we must and we will--the \nwords uttered in the Senator's first speech on the floor of the Senate \nwill be remembered and will be part of a good piece of history in this \ncountry. I thank my colleague from Georgia, and I thank the people from \nGeorgia for sending him here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief comment? \nI ask unanimous consent that he retain his right to the floor and that \nthe time consumed by me and by the two Senators preceding me not come \nout of the Senator's time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield for a minute, if I could please, \nsir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with others of my colleagues in \ncomplimenting the distinguished Senator from Georgia on his maiden \nspeech.\n  It used to be, Mr. President, that when a new Senator came to this \nbody, he waited several months before he spoke. Then when he made his \nmaiden speech, other Senators who had been notified that he was going \nto make a speech would come to the floor and gather around him and \nlisten to his speech. In those days we did not have the public address \nsystem. So Senators generally moved toward the desk of the Senator who \nwas speaking so they could hear him better.\n\n  I have enjoyed listening to the distinguished Senator. He comes here \ntoday as someone who is fresh off the campaign trail. I am sure that \nwhat he has had to say is something of importance, and I hope it will \nbe read by our colleagues. He comes in the great tradition of Senators \nfrom Georgia. When I first came to Washington as a new Member of the \nCongress, we had Senator Walter George in the U.S. Senate, and Senator \nRichard Russell, who was my mentor in many ways, and it was I who \nintroduced the resolution to name the old Senate Office Building in \nhonor of Senator Richard Russell. Of course, there was also Sam Nunn, \nwho followed in Senator Russell's footsteps.\n  I congratulate the distinguished Senator. He is a true American hero. \nI know that he will be an outstanding Member of this institution. I \ncongratulate him.\n  I hope that all Senators will take note of what Senator Cleland has \nsaid in his speech today. It will be well worth their time to read that \nspeech.\n  I thank him.\n  And I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to recognize and congratulate \nthe Senator from Georgia for joining the body. I am joining him on his \nfirst maiden speech.\n  I also thank the Senator from West Virginia for educating and sharing \nwith us some of the culture and the history of the U.S. Senate, which I \nthink is always beneficial for us to have and to be able to share with \nthe American people the history, the ability, and the nature of this \nbody as it was set up by the Founding Fathers and which has been \nmaintained with most of its integrity since that time and age of what \nthey set forward.\n  I think it is always positive for us to know the history and the \nnature and why we serve and how we should serve.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nvery kind and overly charitable remarks.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. They are not overly charitable at all.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brownback pertaining to the introduction of S. \n471 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I wish to add to the remarks that \nhave been made this afternoon in recognition of the first speech given \nas a Member of the U.S. Senate by our new colleague, the Senator from \nGeorgia. He has represented this Nation with great distinction \nthroughout his life, and we are gratified that he has now joined us in \nthe Senate. I am confident that the remarks he made a few minutes ago \nwill be illustrative of the contributions he will make throughout his \nSenate career. I am proud to call him a friend and colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2511-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with a number of my \ncolleagues to say there was a very important argument in the Supreme \nCourt today over the constitutionality of the Communications Decency \nAct, which we passed last year. You will recall that we passed a bill \nto make it difficult to communicate pornography to children. The day it \nwas passed and signed, the American Civil Liberties Union jumped in to \nsay it was unconstitutional. I'm sorry, but I think the ACLU has it all \nwrong. I was very pleased to be one of a group of Senators, including \nthe occupant of the Chair, who signed a brief in support of Congress' \neffort to impose reasonable regulations and restrictions to prevent the \nworst form of pornography from reaching our children.\n  Congress can regulate speech when there is a compelling reason. That \nhas been clear. That has been held constitutional in many instances, \nand I suggest that there is no more compelling need than to protect our \nchildren and future generations from exposure to explicit pornographic \npictures and messages, and from the people who send them.\n  The government, both the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernments, have engaged in efforts to regulate pornography. We \nregulate media available to children such as the sale of books and \nmagazines, the viewing and sale of films, the use of telephone services \nto communicate adult messages, and the broadcast media. So, this has \nbeen done and it has been done for a very good and I believe a very \ncompelling reason. The standard put forth in the Communications Decency \nAct is even more stringent than that, in terms of the limitations of \nit. The constraints are more severely limited than the constraints on \nthe broadcast media. We have tightened up the definitions and made the \nban much narrower.\n  The Internet is clearly the latest means of communications. Any of us\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nwho have children knows how readily accessible the Internet is. If you \nare like I am, when you have a computer problem you ask your child how \nto fix it, because the children know how to make it work. My forehead \nstill breaks out in perspiration and my hands shake when I try to send \ne-mail. But the kids can not only send the e-mail for you, they can \ntell you how to send it, fix the problems on it, and make things \nhappen. We want to make sure that what they do not make happen is that \nthey get access to things that are now banned to them through adult \nbook stores, through broadcast media, through telephone communications. \nThey should not be subject to the deviants, the pornographers, the \nchild molesters who want to use the Internet in an interactive way to \nget access to our children.\n  There are, unfortunately, an abundance of examples of where perverts \nhave used Internet communications to communicate with and to lure young \nchildren to locations away from their homes. They have used pornography \nas a tool. Not only have they polluted children's minds with this \npornography, but they have used it as a tool for their own, very sick \npurposes.\n  In Louisville, I know there was a 12-year-old girl who was sent a bus \nticket and left home without her parents knowing about it. These \nexamples have happened time and time again. I believe this Congress had \nevery right to say it is OK for adults to communicate anything they \nwant but you cannot be sending material to children that is \npornographic. You cannot be putting pornographic information on the \nkiddie chat rooms.\n  Contrary to what the ACLU will tell you, the Communications Decency \nAct does not ban speech or interrupt the free exchange of ideas. There \nis technology available that can keep children from gaining access to \nit. And if it takes a pornographer a little more difficulty to \ncommunicate pornographic materials to another consenting adult, so they \ndo not get the information before children, I am not going to lose any \nsleep over it.\n  There is every reason that we can, under the Communications Decency \nAct, continue to use the Communications Decency Act for communicating \nmedical information, discussing literature--these are not banned. If \nthe purpose is getting pornography, for pornographic purposes or even \npersonal whims of those who communicate it, to children, that the \nCommunications Decency Act bans.\n  I think this should be upheld. I am proud to be one of the signers of \nthe brief and we will all be watching to see this very important case \nresolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, I took the floor to detail what \nI thought was an extremely disturbing and very potentially abuse of \nExecutive power of the White House to improperly influence the outcome \nof the American Presidential election. As part of that chronology of \nevents of information that we now know that has been printed and that \nwe are aware of, I detailed the situation relative to the latest \nscandal that has been reported in the press, and that involves Mr. \nLake, former National Security Adviser to the President, an individual \nnominated for the job as Director of the CIA.\n  Mr. Lake, as we all now know, withdrew his name from consideration \nthe day after a major story broke about a problem involving the \nDemocratic National Committee, the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Security Council, and the fundraising operation of the White \nHouse. I think this is probably the most damaging, or at least one of \nthe most damaging allegations relative to the entire fundraising \nefforts by the Democratic Party for this last election. We now know \nthat the Central Intelligence Agency was used by the Democratic \nNational Committee to encourage access to the President by an \nindividual who is an international fugitive and was a major donor to \nthe Democratic Party.\n  The administration, in response to Mr. Lake's withdrawal, indicated \nthat it was the confirmation process by members of the Intelligence \nCommittee that is at fault in the withdrawal of the Lake nomination. \nThe fault, Mr. President, I suggest, lies elsewhere. The Lake \nnomination was eventually undermined because Mr. Lake was forced to \noperate, or at least chose to operate or was forced to operate, in the \nvery center, the very heart of a political fundraising machine whose \nabuses are revealed to us each day as we pick up the paper in the \nmorning.\n  The White House blames partisan Republicans, and yet a major story in \nthe New York Times today, titled ``Leading Democrat Tells of Doubt of \nCIA Nominee, White House Was Warned, Senator Kerrey's Reservations May \nHave Persuaded Lake Not To Fight the GOP,'' hardly speaks to a partisan \neffort to dethrone Mr. Lake.\n  Legitimate questions were asked of Mr. Lake of what his role was as \nNational Security Adviser to the President in terms of clearing certain \nindividuals to come to the White House for various favors, coffees, \nLincoln Bedroom stays, et cetera, and, on several occasions--at least \ntwo that we know of--the National Security Council issued very direct \nreservations and, in fact, warnings about certain individuals who, \nnevertheless, attended more than one meeting at the White House.\n  Mr. Lake's response was that he essentially was out of the loop; he \ndid not know what was going on. Legitimate questions were raised: If \nyou did not know what was going on with a 150-member staff that went to \nthe very essence of the Presidency, of who sees the President, of what \nthe involvement of these individuals is relative to fundraising for the \nelection, if you are not aware of that going on, how are you possibly \ngoing to manage a multithousand-member agency with 12 separate \ndivisions as important to the security of the United States as the \nCentral Intelligence Agency?\n  So even though the White House blamed partisan Republicans, we now \nknow that the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee had raised \nhis own concerns about Mr. Lake's qualifications and what his role was \nand the role of the National Security Council in terms of all this \nfundraising morass that the administration is caught up in.\n  Mr. President, fortunately, publications that are following the story \nare not buying the White House response. The New York Times editorial \ntoday states:\n\n       In the end, Mr. Lake was undone by Mr. Clinton's reckless \n     1996 election campaign and the failure of top White House \n     officials, including Mr. Lake, to insulate American foreign \n     policy from fundraising efforts.\n\n  That is an extraordinary statement, Mr. President, and I want to \nrepeat it. The New York Times editorial today refuting the White House \nresponse to Mr. Lake's withdrawal from nomination to be CIA Director, \nstates:\n\n       In the end, Mr. Lake was undone by Mr. Clinton's reckless \n     1996 election campaign and the failure of top White House \n     officials, including Mr. Lake, to insulate American foreign \n     policy from fundraising efforts.\n\n  Jim Hoagland, in today's Washington Post, states:\n\n       [Lake] is not a victim of the system but of the President \n     he served. His angry words try to obscure an embarrassment \n     and the true dimension of one more political fiasco at the \n     Clinton White House. One more close Clinton associate is \n     badly damaged while the President cruises on with high but \n     flagging approval ratings.\n\n  To continue:\n\n       The system that did in Tony Lake is the one that allowed \n     the fundraisers to trump Lake's staff repeatedly over access \n     to the White House.\n       In Washington the system is people--people who are \n     supremely attuned to the wishes, needs, and whims of the \n     boss. If Roger Tamraz, Chinese arms supplier Wang Jun, Thai \n     trade lobbyist Pauline Kanchanalak and the others made it \n     into the White House, it is ultimately because Bill Clinton \n     communicated, in one form or another, that he did not want \n     tight screening of campaign contributors. In the end, Tony \n     Lake paid the price for Clinton's need not to know.\n\n  That from today's Washington Post. Then, finally, Maureen Dowd in the \nNew York Times states:\n\n       Although Mr. Lake's ``haywire'' line got all the \n     attention--\n\n  That is referring to a process ``gone haywire'' that Mr. Lake \nstated--\n\n     it was another sentence in his letter that provided the real \n     reason for his withdrawal.\n\n  Quoting Ms. Dowd:\n\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\n\n       In addition, the story today about the activities of Mr. \n     Roger Tamraz is likely to lead to further delay as an \n     investigation proceeds.\n\n  Maureen Dowd goes on to state:\n\n       Mr. Lake would have had a tough time explaining why he was \n     missing in action while the Democratic Party tried to use the \n     CIA to pressure Mr. Lake's office to help get an accused \n     embezzler and big donor access to the White House. The cold \n     war might be over, but don't these agencies have something \n     better to do than vet global hustlers and fat cats?\n       Sheila Heslin, an NSC Asia expert with a regard for ethics \n     unusually high for the Clinton White House, offered to shield \n     the President from the notorious Roger Tamraz. But like the \n     ubiquitous Johnny Chung, who also got into the White House \n     despite tepid NSC warnings, Mr. Tamraz had his run of the \n     people's house.\n       So that's why Tony Lake pulled out:\n\n  She concludes--\n\n       He was not Borked. He was Tamrazzed.\n\n  Mr. President, former President Harry Truman had on his desk a sign \nthat said, ``The buck stops here.'' Unfortunately, it seems that the \nsign posted throughout the White House and throughout this \nadministration is ``The Buck Must Rest Somewhere Else; It Sure Doesn't \nStop Here.''\n  Mr. President, we have a very serious situation before us. We have \nallegations, backed by substantial evidence, that the executive power \nof the White House was abused to improperly influence the outcome of an \nAmerican Presidential election. We have serious questions about foreign \ngovernments' involvement at invitation by the Democratic Party and the \nClinton administration, involvement in helping corrupt American \nelections. We have serious allegations, backed by considerable \nevidence, that the privilege of American citizenship has been distorted \nand undermined to serve the President's reelection. And now we are \nforced to ask, were American intelligence services manipulated by this \nadministration as part of this fundraising machine?\n  All of this, Mr. President, speaks for the need for independent \ncounsel, speaks for the need to move this process outside of the \nCongress because clearly the administration has taken the position that \nwhatever is said by this Member or any other Member of the Republican \nParty is simply partisan politics, that everything that happens is \ndirected from a partisan basis.\n  What we are trying to get at here, Mr. President, is the truth. What \nwe are trying to do is examine what statutes were violated, trying to \nexamine what ethics rulings were violated, trying to impose some \nstandards on the way in which we conduct elections in this country and \nthe way in which the White House is viewed and held by occupants of \nthat White House and what its purpose should be.\n  Mr. President, for that reason, I supported the resolution to call \nfor an independent counsel. I would hope that the Attorney General \nwould pay close attention to the recently passed Senate resolution in \nthat regard. I think these are serious issues and they must be \naddressed.\n  Finally, let me just say that the practice of this administration and \nthis President of simply saying, the process is corrupt, that the \nCongress is partisan, that all of this has to do with politics and none \nof this has to do with ethics and legal violations, that that is a lame \nexcuse and removal from accountability and responsibility that we \nexpect in the leadership of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Indiana for \nbringing together for us what is a perplexing issue.\n  I had watched from afar, because I am not a Member of the \nIntelligence Committee, the process of the interviewing of the nominee, \nTony Lake. While I know there was considerable controversy and an \nunwillingness on the part of this administration to send forth the full \nFBI file, that was really the only argument I ever heard. Finally some \nof that file came, but certainly not all of it did, nor was there ever \nfull disclosure.\n  Yet on the evening news last night I watched a very indignant \nPresident talking about the corruption of the procedure. And nowhere \nduring all of this did I understand that there was any corruption, only \na request for knowledge, for information to decide whether the No. 1 \nintelligence officer of this country was eligible to serve in that \nposition.\n  The Senator from Indiana has told us the rest of the story. And the \nrest of the story is that Tony Lake is a refugee of this \nadministration's mispractices, if not illegal acts. He is not a refugee \nof this Congress' failure to act, because we were doing what is our \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  I, too, today voted for an independent counsel. Two weeks ago I \ncalled for an independent counsel, as I think most of us were growing \nto believe that anything we did here would be either tainted by the \nopposition or tainted by the media as somehow a partisan act.\n  What the Intelligence Committee of the Senate did was not partisan. \nIt was constitutional. It was responsible. What the President did in \nhis ``mea culpa, mea culpa'' last night was the first to the altar of \nthe sinners to say ``not I'' when in fact the stories are now pouring \nout that somehow the process was corrupted and that Tony Lake, as an \ninstrument of that process, grew corrupt along with it.\n  Just because the great Soviet empire and communism as a sweeping rave \nof ``isms'' around the world seems to be on the rapid decline, is \nforeign policy and the integrity of foreign policy in our country any \nless important? I would suggest that it is not.\n  When foreign countries wish to influence the most economically \npowerful country in the world for purposes of commerce or access to its \ndecisionmaking, that in itself is of concern. And it has to be this \nCongress that understands that and this President that understands that \nand in no way allows foreign policy, decisionmaking, or any part of \nthat process to be biased by undue influence. And yet day after day, \nnow almost hourly, the stories pile up. Tony Lake is now part of that \nstory.\n  Janet Reno must step aside from what appears to be at this moment a \ngross conflict of interest and do what is her statutory responsibility, \nand that is to appoint an independent counsel. Then let the chips fall \nwhere they may. And I do not know where they will fall. And I do not \nthink the Senator from Indiana knows.\n  We are talking about allegations, allegations that were first \nlaunched, not by a politician, but by the media itself. It was an \narticle in the Los Angeles Times back in the latter days of the last \ncampaign that argued that somehow there appeared to be an issue of \ncorruption or an issue of compromise or an issue of illegality as it \nrelates to how this administration, most importantly, this President \nand his Presidential campaign had raised money.\n  Now Janet Reno, do your job. Call the independent counsel. Get on \nwith the business of ferreting out whether there were illegal acts \ninvolved in the corruption of or the compromise of this President and \nthis President's foreign policymaking.\n  And, thank goodness, through all of the winnowing process Tony Lake \nis now out of the picture and we can get on with the business of \nreviewing nominees who can meet the test of integrity and legitimacy in \nconducting what is still a very important part of this country's \naffairs, and that is our intelligence-gathering network, the eyes and \nears of a government who is responsible for conducting the foreign \npolicy of a nation that still remains critical to the security of our \ncountry and our financial and economic well-being.\n  I thank my colleague from Indiana for so clearly pointing these \nissues out. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business until 3 o'clock, \nwith a 5-minute limitation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will need more than 5 minutes. May I ask \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada, does he wish to speak?\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I might respond, the Senator from Nevada \nneeds about 5 to 6 minutes, but if that inconveniences the Senator from \nWest Virginia, I am happy to wait. Whatever the Senator wishes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak for not \nto exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may yield to the \nSenator from Nevada for not to exceed 5 minutes, without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate that. That would accommodate the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me preface my remarks by acknowledging \nthe courtesy from the senior Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate \nhis courtesy in allowing me to make a floor statement for a period not \nto exceed 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2512-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOMEOWNERS' PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, yesterday in the Senate Banking Committee \nAmerican consumers were dealt a major setback. The committee was \nexpected to vote out legislation that would have ended a practice that \ncosts hundreds of thousands of homeowners millions of dollars per year.\n  The Banking Committee was scheduled to vote out S. 318, the \nHomeowners' Protection Act of 1997 which is sponsored by Senators \nD'Amato, Dodd, Domenici, and myself. This bill would outlaw the \npractice of overcharging homeowners for private mortgage insurance they \nno longer need.\n  Unfortunately, Chairman D'Amato was forced to cancel the markup \nbecause a number of Members put the interest of a small, yet highly \nprofitable, industry over the public's interest. To make matters worse, \nthis industry is clearly taking advantage of millions of Americans in \nan unconscionable manner.\n  The opponents of Chairman D'Amato's legislation argue that the bill \nplaces too heavy a burden on this one industry. I do not share their \nopinion and believe the interests of millions of American homeowners \nshould be put ahead of an industry that is clearly taking advantage of \nthese same homeowners.\n  Those protecting the industry need to heed the advice of one of their \ncolleagues, Congressman James Hansen. Let me share from Congressman \nHansen's observations:\n\n       As a small businessman for most of my life . . . I have \n     learned that if an industry polices itself, the government \n     should not interfere. I firmly believe that the government \n     should stay out of the private marketplace. However, when an \n     industry does not follow even its own guidelines, I believe \n     it is our responsibility to draw that line.\n\n  Now that comes, Mr. President, from one of our more conservative \ncolleagues who serves in the other body.\n  I commend Chairman D'Amato for his leadership in introducing this \nimportant legislation that will affect millions of homeowners. Let me \nindicate how important that is and how many people are affected.\n  In 1996, of the 2.1 million home mortgages that were insured, more \nthan 1 million required private mortgage insurance. One industry group \nhas estimated that at least 250,000 homeowners are either overpaying \nfor this insurance or paying when it is totally unnecessary. At an \naverage monthly cost of $30 to $100, unnecessary insurance premiums are \ncosting homeowners thousands of dollars every year.\n  Now, clearly, private mortgage insurance serves a useful purpose in \nthe initial mortgage lending process. It enables many home buyers who \ncannot afford the standard 20-percent downpayment on a home mortgage to \nachieve a dream of home ownership. While private mortgage insurance \nprotects lenders against default on a loan, there comes a time when \nthat protection afforded to the lender becomes unnecessary, and the \npoint, it seems to me, is reached when the homeowner's equity \ninvestment in the residence gives the lender sufficient assurance \nagainst default.\n  The comfort level generally within the industry has been 20 percent. \nSo it stands to reason that PMI is not necessary for risk management \nand prudent underwriting procedures once the homeowner has reached the \n20-percent equity mark. Therefore, borrowers who amass equity equal to \n20 percent of their homes' original value should be treated in the same \nway as borrowers who are able to make a 20-percent downpayment or more \nat the outset of the loan.\n  The Homeowners' Protection Act of 1997 would ensure that existing and \nfuture homeowners would not continue to pay for private insurance when \nit is no longer necessary. Specifically, this legislation would inform \nthe borrower at closing about private mortgage insurance and outline \nhow the servicer of the loan will automatically cancel the mortgage \ninsurance, assuming the transaction is not exempt from cancellation \nwhen the loan balance reaches 80 percent of the original value.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that private mortgage insurance is \nan important tool in the American system of mortgage finance. However, \nretaining private mortgage insurance beyond its usefulness to the \nhomeowner is a practice that should be ended. The Homeowners' \nProtection Act will prevent present and future homeowners from paying \nfor private mortgage insurance that is no longer needed. This proposal \nwill end the unfair practice and protect the consumer.\n  This legislation is supported by almost every consumer group, but \nalso leading industry groups such as the American Bankers Association, \nthe National Association of Realtors, and the National Association of \nHomebuilders.\n  I urge my colleagues to move forward on this important piece of \nconsumer legislation and put the industry's objections below the \noverriding public interest. We must lift this unfair burden from \nAmerican homeowners.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my senior colleague from West Virginia for \nhis courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2514-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2514-S2515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMISSION TO ELIMINATE THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, in introducing an ambitious \nnew effort on the matter of our nation's persistent and growing trade \ndeficit. This legislation would establish a Commission to take a broad, \nthorough look at all important aspects of, and solutions to the growing \nU.S. trade deficit, with particular attention to the manufacturing \nsector.\n  The trade deficit, as my colleagues know, is a relatively recent \nphenomenon, with large deficits only occurring within the last 15 \nyears. In the 1980's, the U.S. merchandise trade balance ballooned from \na deficit of $19 billion in 1980 to $53 billion in 1983, and then \ndoubled in a year, to $106 billion in 1984. Last year it stood at $188 \nbillion, setting a new high record for the third consecutive year. \nProjections by econometric forecasting firms indicate long term trends \nwhich will bring this figure to over $350 billion by 2007. No one is \npredicting a decline in the near future. If we do nothing, within 2 \nyears the merchandise trade deficit will equal the annual budget for \nnational defense.\n  To reiterate, in 1996 the United States had the largest negative \nmerchandise trade balance in our history, some $188 billion, and it is \nthe third consecutive year in which the deficit has reached a new \nrecord high.\n  This legislation is committed to a goal of reversing that trend of \nthe next decade. The goal of the commission is to ``develop a national \neconomic plan to systematically reduce the U.S. trade deficit and to \nachieve a merchandise trade balance by the year 2007.\n  While it is not clear what the particular reasons for this growing \ntrade deficit may be, nor what the long term impacts of a persistently \ngrowing deficit may be, the time is overdue for a detailed examination \nof the factors causing the deficit. We need to understand the impacts \nof it on specific U.S. industrial and manufacturing sectors. \nFurthermore, we need to identify the gaps that exist in our data bases \nand economic measurements to adequately understand the specific nature \nof the\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\nimpacts of the deficit on such important things as our manufacturing \ncapacity and the integrity of our industrial base, on productivity, \njobs and wages in specific sectors.\n  Throughout the 1980's, my own State of West Virginia literally bled \nmanufacturing jobs. We saw the jobs of hardworking, honest West \nVirginians in the glass, steel, pottery, shoe manufacturing and leather \ngoods industries--and other so-called smokestack industries--hemorrhage \nacross our borders and shipped overseas. While economic development \nefforts in my State have commendably encouraged our businesses to \nrefocus to help recover from those losses, the lack of knowledge about \nthe causes and impact of our trade deficit leaves West Virginia, and \nthe nation as a whole, at a disadvantage in the arena of global \ncompetition.\n\n  We debate the trade deficit from time to time. We moan about it. We \ncomplain about it. But, if we do not understand the nature, of the \nlong-term vulnerabilities that such manufacturing imbalances create in \nour economy and standard of living, we are surely in the dark. It \nappears to me that debate over trade matters too often takes on the \nform of rhetorical bombast regarding so-called protectionists versus \nso-called free traders. This is hardly a debate worthy of the name, \ngiven the problems we are facing. It is not an informed debate. We are \ntalking past each other, and in far too general terms. It has been more \nof an ideological exchange than a real debate, primarily because we \nhave not had sufficient analytical work done on the data bearing on \nthis problem. Neither side knows enough about what is really \ntranspiring in our economy, given the very recent nature of these \npersistent deficits.\n  Certainly we know that the deficit reflects on the ability of \nAmerican business to compete abroad. We want to be competitive. \nCertainly we know that specific deficits with specific trading partners \ncause frictions between the United States and our friends and allies. \nThis is particularly the case with the Japanese, and is quickly \nbecoming the case with China. It is clear that the trade deficit has \ncontributed to the depreciation of the dollar and the ability of \nAmericans to afford foreign products. Less clear, but of vital \nimportance, is the relationship of the trade deficit to other important \npolicy questions on the table between the United States and our foreign \ntrading partners.\n  Attempts by the United States to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers \nin the Japan and China markets, which clearly restrict access of U.S. \ngoods to those markets, have been crippled by the intervention of \nother, more important policy goals. During the cold war, the United \nStates-Japan security relationship had a severe dampening effect on our \nefforts to reduce these myriad barriers in Japan to United States \nexports. The same effect appears to have resulted from our need for the \nJapanese to participate in our treasury bill auctions. This becomes a \nclosed cycle--the need to finance the trade deficit with foreign \ncapital, resulting in regular involvement of the Japanese Government in \nour treasury bill auctions, seems to dampen our efforts to push the \nJapanese on market-opening arrangements. Naturally, without reciprocal \nopen markets, the trade imbalance remains exaggerated between the \nUnited States and Japan, prompting further need for Japanese financial \nsupport to fund the national debt. Of course, this is a vicious circle. \nThus, some argue that the need for Japanese involvement in financing \nour national debt hurt the ability of our trade negotiators to get \nstronger provisions in the dispute settled last year over the Japanese \nmarket for auto parts.\n  Similar considerations appear to prevail in negotiating market access \nwith the Chinese in the area of intellectual property. While our trade \nnegotiator managed a laudable, very specific agreement with the Chinese \nin 1995 in this area, the Chinese were derelict in implementing it, \nleading to another high-wire negotiation last year to avoid sanctions \non the Chinese, and to get the Chinese to implement the accord as they \nhad promised. Again, it is unclear whether the Chinese will now follow \nthrough in a consistent manner with the implementing mechanisms for the \nintellectual property agreement belatedly agreed to in the latest \nnegotiation. The highly trumpeted mantra about how the U.S.-China \nrelationship will be one of, if not the most important, U.S. bilateral \nrelationship for the next half century, has a chilling effect on \ninsisting on fair, reciprocal treatment, and good faith implementation \nof agreements signed with the Chinese government.\n\n  The Chinese government has again recently reiterated its desire to \nbecome a member of the World Trade Organization and certainly her \ninterest in joining that organization is a commendable indication of \nher willingness to submit to the rules of that organization regarding \nher trading practices. There is legitimate concern however, that \ninsufficient progress has been made by the Chinese on removing a wide \nvariety of non tariff discriminatory barriers to U.S. goods and \nservices, as she committed to do in the 1992 bilateral Market Access \nMemorandum of Understanding [MOU]. Indeed, in the 1996 report by the \nUnited States Trade Representative entitled foreign trade barriers, the \namount of material devoted to the range of such barriers on the part of \nChina is exceeded only by the material on Japan, indicating that we \nhave a continued persistent problem that needs serious attention along \nthese lines.\n  It will only be when we truly understand the specific impacts of \nthese large deficits on our economy, particularly our industrial and \nmanufacturing base, that the importance of insisting on fair play in \nthe matter of trade will become clear.\n  Finally, the legislation requires the Commission to examine \nalternative strategies which we can pursue to achieve the systematic \nreduction of the deficit, particularly how to retard the migration of \nour manufacturing base abroad, and the changes that might be needed to \nour basic trade agreements and practices.\n  These are the purposes of the Commission that Senator Dorgan and I \nhave proposed in this legislation.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for his \nstudious approach to this question. He is as knowledgeable, if not more \nso, than certainly most other Senators, and perhaps any other Senators, \nas far as I am concerned, on this subject. I am pleased to join him in \noffering this proposal for the consideration of the Senate.\n  I hope that many of our colleagues will join us, and that we can \nsecure passage of the proposal in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2514-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2515-S2538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MERRICK B.

The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, before we get to the specific discussion \nof the merits of Merrick B. Garland, let me make an important point. \nThere have been some suggestions made that this Republican Congress is \nnot moving as rapidly or as well as it should on judges, or at least \nlast year did not move as well or as rapidly as it should have on \njudges.\n  With regard to judicial vacancies, the important point I would like \nto make before getting into factual distortions that are being made \nabout the judiciary confirmation process is this. Federal judges should \nnot be confirmed simply as part of a numbers game to reduce the vacancy \nrate to a particular level.\n  While I plan to oversee a fair and principled confirmation process, \nas I\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\nalways have, I want to emphasize that the primary criteria in this \nprocess is not how many vacancies need to be filled but whether \nPresident Clinton's nominees are qualified to serve on the bench and \nwill not, upon receiving their judicial commission, spend a lifetime \ncareer rendering politically motivated, activist decisions. The Senate \nhas an obligation to the American people to thoroughly review the \nrecords of the nominees it receives to ensure that they are qualified \nand capable to serve as Federal judges. Frankly, the need to do that is \nimperative, and the record of activism demonstrated by so many of \nPresident Clinton's nominees calls for all the more vigilance in \nreviewing his nominees.\n  So I have no problem with those who want to review these nominees \nwith great specificity. The recent allegations by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle and in the media that there is a Republican \nstall of judges is nothing short of disingenuous.\n  The fact is that last Congress under Republican leadership the \nFederal courts had 65 vacancies--as you see, the Federal courts had 65 \nvacancies--which is virtually identical to the number of vacancies--\n63--there were at the end of the previous Congress when the Democrat-\ncontrolled Congress was processing Clinton judges.\n  Historically speaking, this is a very low vacancy rate. In contrast, \nat the end of the 102d Congress, when Senator Biden chaired the \nJudiciary Committee and President Bush was at the White House, there \nwere 97 vacancies--as you can see, back in the 102d Congress, 97 \nvacancies--in the Federal system for an 11.46 percent vacancy rate, \nnearly twice the vacancy rate than at the adjournment of the 104th or \nlast Congress. That rate was, of course, 7.7 percent at that time.\n  The vacancies have risen since the end of Congress so that there are \nnow 95 vacancies, or a vacancy rate of just over 11 percent. But a \nlittle perspective reveals that this is by no means a high level for \nthe beginning of a Congress. In fact, it is far lower than the vacancy \nrates at the beginning of Democrat-controlled Congresses, like the 102d \nwhen the vacancy rate at the beginning of that Congress was 14.89 \npercent, and the 103d Congress at 12.88 percent. In the 104th, it was \ndown to 8.27 and now it is 10.07.\n\n  Moreover, we just reported two judges out of the committee this past \nThursday--Merrick Garland for the DC circuit and Colleen Kollar-Kotelly \nfor the DC district court. We had a hearing on four judicial nominees \njust yesterday. I hope that will put to rest any of the partisan \nallegations that have been seen deployed about delaying tactics to hold \nup nominees.\n  In fact, this is the most prompt reporting of judges to the floor in \nrecent Congresses. When the Senate was under the control of the other \nparty, the first hearing on judicial nominees in the new Congress was \ntypically not held until mid-March or April and candidates were not \nreported to the floor until after these hearings.\n  In the 100th Congress, the first hearing was not held until March 4, \n1987. In the 101st Congress, the first judges hearing was not held \nuntil April 5, 1989. And in the 102d Congress, when there was a vacancy \nrate of 15 percent in the courts, the first hearing was not held until \nMarch 13, 1991.\n  So I think some of the arguments made against what we have been doing \nare just fallacious and I think done for partisan reasons. We ought to \nget rid of the partisanship when it comes to judges and go ahead and do \nwhat is right. I have tried to do that.\n  Now let us talk about the number of judges confirmed last year. \nDemocrats have been critical of the fact that only 17 judges were \nconfirmed last year. The fact is that President Clinton had already had \nso many judges confirmed that he only nominated 21 judges last year. \nDuring President Clinton's first term, he had 202 judges confirmed--\nmore than President Bush, 194; President Reagan, 164 in his first term; \nPresident Ford, 65 in his term. I might say that as a result there were \nvery few vacancies to fill at the end of the 104th Congress, and the \ncourts were virtually at full capacity.\n  In fact, at the close of the last Congress, there were only 65 \nvacancies in the entire system, which is a vacancy rate of 7.7 percent. \nIn fact, the number of vacancies under my chairmanship at the close of \nthe 104th Congress, 65 vacancies--when a Republican Senate was \nprocessing Clinton's nominees--was virtually identical to the number of \nvacancies at the end of the 103d Congress, 63, when a Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate was processing President Clinton's nominees. At that \npoint the Department of Justice proclaimed that they had nearly reached \nfull employment in the 837-member Federal judiciary. That is in an \nOctober 12, 1994, Department of Justice press release.\n\n  When the Democrats left open 7.44 percent of Federal judgeships after \nPresident Clinton's first 2 years, we had approached ``full \nemployment'' of the Federal judiciary. But, when Republicans are in \ncontrol, a virtually identical vacancy level becomes an ``unprecedented \nsituation,'' the ``worst kind of politicizing of the Federal \njudiciary.'' Those are comments that were made by my friend, Senator \nLeahy. And ``partisan tactics by Senate Republicans,'' according to the \nNew York Times. This is nothing short of disingenuous.\n  In contrast, at the end of the 102d Congress when Senator Biden \nchaired the Judiciary Committee and President Bush was in the White \nHouse, there were 97 vacancies in the Federal system for an 11.46 \npercent vacancy rate--nearly twice the vacancy rate than at adjournment \nof the 104th Congress, which was 65 vacancies at a 7.7 percent vacancy \nrate.\n  What about the judges who were left unconfirmed at the end of last \nAugust?\n  It is true, 28 nominees did not get confirmed last Congress. There is \nno use kidding about it. We had 28 who did not make it through. But \nthis was at a point where there were only 65 vacancies in the court, \nor, in other words, a full Federal judiciary. There is some extra \nconsideration here. Compare this to the end of the 102d Congress when, \nnotwithstanding 97 vacancies in the Federal system, the Democratic \nSenate left 55 Bush nominees unconfirmed.\n  Let us talk about the present vacancies. Due to an unprecedented \nnumber of retirements since Congress adjourned, there are currently 95 \nvacancies in our Federal system or a vacancy rate of 11.25 percent as \nof March 1 of this year. That is the most recent report from the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. Notice that when the 105th \nCongress convened on January 7, 1997, there were 85 vacancies, or a \n10.7 percent vacancy rate. But a little perspective reveals that this \nis by no means a high level for the beginning of the Congress. In fact, \nit is lower than the vacancy rates at the beginning of the \nDemocratically controlled 102d and 103d Congresses, where the vacancy \nrates were 126 vacancies in the 102d, at a 14.89 percent vacancy rate, \nwith 109 vacancies in the 103d, for a 12.88 vacancy rate.\n  So, there is little or no reason to be this critical or this \nirritated with what has gone on. I pledge to the Senate to do the very \nbest that I can to try to confirm President Clinton's judges, if they \nare not superlegislators, if they are people who will uphold the law \nand interpret the law and the laws made by those who are elected to \nmake them. Judges have no reason on Earth to be making laws from the \nbench or to act as superlegislators from the bench and to overrule the \nwill of the majority of the people in this country when the laws are \nvery explicitly written--or at any other time, I might add.\n  Having said all that, we are bringing our first two nominees this \nyear to the floor, one of whom is in contention. I think unjustifiably \nso.\n  Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of the nomination of \nMerrick B. Garland for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. On March 6, 1997, the Judiciary \nCommittee, including a majority of Republican members, by a vote of 14 \nto 4, favorably reported to the full Senate Mr. Clinton's nomination of \nMerrick B. Garland. Based solely on his qualifications, I support the \nnomination of Mr. Garland and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  To my knowledge, no one, absolutely no one disputes the following: \nMerrick B. Garland is highly qualified to sit on the D.C. circuit. His \nintelligence and his scholarship cannot be questioned. He is a magna \ncum laude graduate of the Harvard Law School. Mr. Garland was articles \neditor of the law review, one of the most important positions for any \nlaw student at any university, but in particular at Harvard; a very \ndifficult position to earn. And he has\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\nwritten articles in the Harvard Law Review and the Yale Law Journal, \ntwo of the most prestigious journals in the country, on issues such as \nadministrative law and antitrust policy.\n  His legal experience is equally impressive. Mr. Garland has been a \nSupreme Court law clerk, a Federal criminal prosecutor, a partner in \none of the most prestigious Washington firms, Arnold & Porter, Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's Criminal \nDivision, and, since April of 1994, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral to Jamie Gorelick, at the Justice Department, where he has \ndirected the Department's investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing case. And he has done a superb job there.\n  Mr. Garland's experience, legal skills, and handling of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing case have earned him the support of officials who served \nin the Justice Department during the Reagan and Bush administrations, \nincluding former Deputy Attorney General George Terwilliger, former \nDeputy Attorney General Donald Ayer, former head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel, Charles Cooper, and former U.S. attorneys Jay Stephens and Dan \nWebb--all Republicans, I might add, who are strong supporters of Mr. \nGarland, as I believe they should be, as I believe we all should be.\n\n  Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, who himself was denied one of those \njudgeships by our friends on the other side--even though I think most \nall of them admitted he would have made a tremendous judge, but has \nsince done well for himself in becoming the Governor of Oklahoma and \nhas distinguished himself. I might add his nomination, back in 1992, \nfor the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in the 102d Congress, was never \nvoted on by the Judiciary Committee. He languished in the committee for \nquite a length of time. But Governor Keating has endorsed Mr. Garland's \nnomination, praising in particular his leadership in the Oklahoma City \nbombing case. As he should be praised.\n  Mr. Garland was originally nominated in September 1995. His \nnomination was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee but not \nacted on by the Senate during the 104th Congress, much to my chagrin, \nbecause I think he should have passed in that last Congress. But to my \ncolleagues' credit, and certainly to the leader's credit, the new \nmajority leader, he has cooperated with the Judiciary Committee in \nbringing this nomination to the floor.\n  At the time of Mr. Garland's original nomination to fill the seat \nvacated by Judge Abner Mikva, who went on to become White House \nCounsel, concerns were raised by several, including several \ndistinguished judges here in Washington, as to whether the D.C. circuit \nneeded its full complement of 12 judges due to a declining workload on \nthe Court. I support Senator Grassley's efforts to study the systemwide \ncaseloads of the Federal judiciary and am fully prepared to work with \nSenator Grassley as chairman of that Subcommittee on the Courts, on \nlegislation to authorize or deauthorize seats wherever such adjustments \non the allocation of Federal judges are warranted, based upon court \ncaseloads.\n  With respect to the D.C. circuit, however, the retirement of Judge \nJames Buckley, in August 1996, last year, now leaves only 10 active \njudges on the 12-seat court. Accordingly, the Garland confirmation does \nnot present the Senate with a question whether the 12th seat on the \nD.C. Circuit should be filled, and I have made it clear to the \nadministration that I do not intend to fill that seat unless and until \nthey can show, and I believe it will take quite a bit of time before \nthey could show it, that there is a need for the filling of that seat. \nIn fact, I would be, right now, for doing away with that seat. If at \nsome future time we need that extra, 12th seat, fine, we will pass a \nbill to grant it again. But right now it is not needed.\n  I would just say, rather, with the two current vacancies, Garland \nwill be filling only the 11th seat. So the 12th seat is not in play \nanymore, which was the critical seat.\n  The confirmation of Merrick B. Garland to fill the court's now vacant \n11th seat is supported by D.C. Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman, a \nReagan appointee who himself testified against creating and/or \npreserving unneeded judicial seats on his circuit, meaning the 12th \nseat, and who has stated that, ``it would be a mistake, a serious \nmistake, for Congress to reduce''--that is, the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia--``down below 11 judges.''\n  I am aware that there may be some who take the position that the D.C. \ncircuit's workload statistics do not even warrant 11 judges. With all \ndue respect, I think these arguments completely miss the mark, and \ncaution my colleagues to appreciate that certain statistics can, if not \nproperly understood, be misleading.\n  The position that the D.C. circuit should have fewer than 11 judges \nis belied not just by the statements of Judge Silberman, who himself \nwanted to get rid of the 12th seat, but also by the fact that comparing \nworkloads in the D.C. circuit to that of other circuits is, to a large \nextent, a pointless exercise.\n  There is little dispute that the D.C. circuit's docket is, by far, \nthe most complex and time consuming in the Nation. Justice Department \nstatistics show that whereas in a typical circuit, 5.9 percent of all \ncases filed are administrative appeals, which are generally far more \ntime consuming than other appeals, and 26.7 percent are prisoner \npetitions which tend to be disposed of far more quickly than other \nappeals. While that is true in other circuit courts, 45.3 percent of \nthe cases filed in the D.C. circuit over the past 3 years have been \ncomplex administrative appeals and only 7 percent easily disposed of \nprisoner petitions.\n  Moreover, most of the administrative appeals heard in the D.C. \ncircuit involved the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency and \nare much more complex and time consuming than even the immigration and \nlabor appeals, which comprise most of the administrative agency cases \nfiled in other circuits.\n  In short, simply comparing the number of cases filed in the D.C. \ncircuit to the number filed in other circuits, and even comparing the \nnumber of agency appeals, is not a reliable indicator of the courts' \ncomparative workloads.\n  As Senators, we have a responsibility to the public to ensure that \ncandidates for the Federal bench are scrutinized for political \nactivists. A judge who does not appreciate the inherent limits on \njudicial authority under the Constitution and would seek to legislate \nfrom the bench rather than interpret the law is a judicial activist, \nand nominees who will be judicial activists are simply not qualified to \nsit on any Federal bench, let alone the Federal circuit court of \nappeals or any Federal circuit court of appeals.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I will continue to carefully \nscrutinize the records involved in cases of judicial nominees and to \nexercise the Senate's advise-and-consent power to ensure we keep \nactivists off the bench. In addition, I will continue to speak out both \nin the Senate and in other forums to increase public awareness of harm \nto our society posed by such activists. Although we can never guarantee \nwhat the future actions of any judicial nominee will be or any judge, \nfor that matter, and it may be difficult to discern whether a \nparticular candidate will be an activist, I do not believe there is \nanything in Mr. Garland's record to indicate that, if confirmed, he \ncould amount to an activist judge or might ultimately be an activist \njudge.\n  Accordingly, I believe Mr. Garland is a fine nominee. I know him \npersonally, I know of his integrity, I know of his legal ability, I \nknow of his honesty, I know of his acumen, and he belongs on the court. \nI believe he is not only a fine nominee, but is as good as Republicans \ncan expect from this administration. In fact, I would place him at the \ntop of the list. There are some other very good people, so I don't mean \nto put them down, but this man deserves to be at the top of the list. \nOpposition to this nomination will only serve to undermine the \ncredibility of our legitimate goal of keeping proven activists off the \nbench.\n  I fully support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to strongly \nconsider voting in favor of confirmation.\n  I hope that we will also confirm the nominee Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, \nalthough we will only be voting on\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\nMerrick Garland today, that is my understanding. I hope we will put \nboth these judges through. I do not know of any opposition to the \nnominee Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, and I know very limited opposition at \nthis point to Mr. Garland. Like I say, I do not think there is a \nlegitimate argument against Mr. Garland's nomination, and I hope that \nour colleagues will vote to confirm him today.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am delighted the Senate is finally \nconsidering the nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals, the District of Columbia Circuit. I compliment my good friend, \nthe senior Senator from Utah, for his kind remarks about Mr. Garland.\n  Like the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \ntoo believe that Merrick Garland is highly qualified for this \nappointment and would make an outstanding Federal judge.\n  My concern that I have expressed before is that this is the first and \nonly judicial nomination scheduled for consideration in these first 3 \nmonths of the 105th Congress. The Senate is about to go on vacation for \na couple of weeks. It will be the only judgeship considered, as I \nunderstand it. In the past, the Senate has not had to wait the Ides of \nMarch for the first judicial confirmation. The Federal judiciary has \nalmost 100 vacancies now and, with the Ides of March, we are getting \nonly one vacancy filled.\n  I, too, am sorry we have not proceeded to confirm and schedule the \nnomination of Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to the district court bench. \nHere is one nominee we could go with, and we ought to be able to do \nthat today, too.\n  The Senate first received Merrick Garland's nomination from the \nPresident on September 5, 1995. We are now way into March of 1997. So \nwe have this nomination that has been here since 1995. All but the most \ncynical say this man is highly qualified, a decent person, a brilliant \nlawyer, a public servant who will make an outstanding judge, but his \nnomination sat here from 1995 until today.\n  This is a man who has broad bipartisan support. Governor Keating of \nOklahoma; Governor Branstad of Iowa; William Coleman, Jr., a former \nmember of a Republican President's Cabinet, former Reagan and Bush \nadministration officials, Robert Mueller, Jay Stephens, Dan Webb, \nCharles Cooper--all have supported Merrick Garland. So this is not a \ncase of somebody out of the pale. In fact, the Legal Times titled him, \n``Garland: A Centrist Choice.'' I will put those recommendation letters \nin the Record later on.\n  So why, when you have somebody who, in my 22 years here, is one of \nthe most outstanding nominees for the court of appeals, has that person \nbeen held up? What fatal flaw in his character has been uncovered? \nNone, there is no fatal flaw. There was not a person who spoke against, \ncredibly spoke against, his qualifications to be a judge, but he was \none of the unlucky victims of the Republican shutdown of the \nconfirmation process last year. I liken it to pulling the wings off a \nfly. This is what happened.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate in \n1995--in 1995. But here we are in 1997, and we finally get to vote on \nit.\n  Madam President, we have 100 vacancies on the Federal bench. At this \nrate, by the end of this Congress, with normal attrition, we will \nprobably have 130 or 140. We had an abysmal record last session dealing \nwith Federal judicial vacancies.\n  We ought to show what we have here. Here, Madam President, are the \nnumber of judges confirmed during the second Senate session in \nPresidential election years:\n  In 1980, 9 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges.\n  In 1984, 10 appeals court judges, 33 district court judges.\n  In 1988, 7 Court of Appeals judges, 35 district court judges.\n  In 1992--incidentally, 1992, Democrats were in charge with a \nRepublican President--11 appeals court judges, 55 district court \njudges.\n  So what happens when you switch it over, put in a Republican Senate \nand Democratic President? Do you see the same sense of bipartisanship? \nNot on your life.\n  It is 11 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges with a \nRepublican President and a Democratic Congress. Switch it to a \nDemocratic President and a Republican Congress--zero, nada, zip, goose \negg for the court of appeals judges and only 17 for the district court \njudges. Not too good.\n  We have some other charts here. Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke on \nthis. A Chief Justice speaks only in a restrained fashion, when he \ndoes. But look what he said. Look at what Chief Justice William \nRehnquist said about the pace we have seen in this Senate:\n\n       The number of judicial vacancies can have a profound impact \n     on a court's ability to manage its caseload effectively. \n     Because the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in \n     comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the \n     vacancy rate is beginning to climb . . . It is hoped that the \n     administration and Congress will continue to recognize that \n     filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and \n     effective administration of justice.\n\n  The administration is sending up judges, but it is like tossing them \ndown into a black hole in space. Nothing comes back out.\n  In fact, 25 percent of the current vacancies have persisted for more \nthan 18 months. They are considered a judicial emergency jurisdiction.\n  There are 69 current vacancies in our Nation's district courts. \nAlmost one in six district court judgeships is or soon will become \nvacant.\n  I compliment the distinguished majority leader and my good friend \nfrom Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in \nscheduling this one nominee to the Federal Court of Appeals, but there \nare still 24 current vacancies on the Federal courts of appeals. That \nnumber is rising.\n  We are way behind the pace of confirming the judges we have seen in \nour past Congresses. In fact, let us take a look at--I just happen to \nhave a chart on that, Madam President. I know Senators were anxiously \nhoping I might.\n  Number of judges confirmed in past Congresses: 102d Congress, 124; \n103d Congress, 129; 104th Congress, 75. So far in the 105th Congress, \nnone. I assume that is going to change later this afternoon when we \nfinally do confirm one judge. But look at this: 102d Congress, 124; \n103d Congress, 129 confirmed; 104th Congress, 75 confirmed. The 105th \nCongress, zippo.\n  I think we ought to take a look at this next chart. We have 94 \njudicial vacancies. Just put the old magnifying glass--I used to be in \nlaw enforcement, Madam President. We actually used these things. Of \ncourse, we were kind of a small jurisdiction and I am just a small-town \nlawyer from Vermont. We do the best we can. But the magnifying glass \nshows zero. I am pleased by the end of this afternoon I can put a ``1'' \nin there, and let us hope that maybe we will get some more. Let us hope \nmaybe we will get some more.\n  We can joke about it, but it is not a joking matter. We have people \nwith their lives on hold. When the President asks some man or woman to \ntake a Federal courtship, their entire practice is put on hold--it is \nkind of a good news/bad news situation. The President calls up and \nsays, ``I've got good news for you. I'm going to nominate you for the \nFederal bench. Now I have bad news for you. I'm going to nominate you \nfor the Federal bench.'' He or she finds their law practice basically \nstops on the date of that nomination. They cannot bring on new clients. \nTheir partners give him or her a big party and say, ``Please move out \nof your office,'' because they know it is going to take a year or 2 or \n3 to get through the confirmation process.\n  This is partisanship of an unprecedented nature. I have spoken twice \non this floor today on what happens when we forget the normal \ntraditions of the Senate. Traditionally--certainly not in my lifetime--\nno Democratic majority leader or Republican majority leader of the \nSenate would bring up a resolution for a vote directly attacking the \nPresident of the United States--directly or indirectly attacking the \nPresident of the United States--on a day when the President is heading \noff to a summit with other world leaders, especially with the leader of \nthe other nuclear superpower, Russia. Yet, that tradition, which, as I \nsaid, has existed my whole lifetime, was broken today.\n\n  The other thing is that no matter which party controls the Senate, no\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nmatter what party controls the Presidency, we have always worked \ntogether so that the President, having been elected, can, subject to \nnormal--normal--advise and consent, can appoint the judges he wants. \nAnd that tradition has been broken.\n  If we are going to go against these basic tenets of bipartisanship, \nthen the Senate will not be the conscience of the Nation that it should \nbe. The Senate will suffer. And if the Senate suffers, the country \nsuffers.\n  I withhold the balance of my time.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Madam President, if I might just for a moment, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Tom Perez of Senator Kennedy's staff be granted floor \nprivileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of \nletters I referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Oklahoma,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                             Oklahoma City, OK, February 19, 1996.\n     Senator Bob Dole,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Dole: I endorse Merrick Garland for confirmation to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. \n     Merrick will be a solid addition to this esteemed court.\n       A Harvard Law School graduate in 1977, a former Assistant \n     United States Attorney and a former partner in Washington's \n     Arnold and Porter Law Firm, Merrick will bring an array of \n     skills and experience to this judgeship. Merrick is further \n     developing his talents and enhancing his reputation as the \n     Principle Associate Deputy Attorney General.\n       Last April, in Oklahoma City, Merrick was at the helm of \n     the Justice Department's investigation following the bombing \n     of the Oklahoma City Federal Building, the bloodiest and most \n     tragic act of terrorism on American soil. During the \n     investigation, Merrick distinguished himself in a situation \n     where he had to lead a highly complicated investigation and \n     make quick decisions during critical times.\n       Merrick Garland is an intelligent, experienced and \n     evenhanded individual. I hope you give him full consideration \n     for confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the D.C. Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Frank Keating,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n                                 Des Moines, IA, October 10, 1995.\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chuck: I am writing to ask your support and assistance \n     in the confirmation process for a second cousin, Merrick \n     Garland, who has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n       Merrick Garland has had a distinguished legal career. He \n     was a partner for many years in the Washington law firm of \n     Arnold and Porter. During the Bush Administration, Merrick \n     was asked by Jay Stephens, the U.S. Attorney for the District \n     of Columbia, to take on a three year stint as an Assistant \n     U.S. Attorney. As I'm sure you know, Jay Stephens is the son \n     of Lyle Stephens, the Representative from Plymouth County \n     that we served with in the Iowa Legislature.\n       Recently, he has been overseeing the federal investigation \n     and prosecution efforts in the Oklahoma City bombing, having \n     been sent there the second day after the blast occurred. He \n     was serving in the position as principal Associate Deputy \n     Attorney General.\n       I am enclosing a number of news clippings about Merrick \n     Garland.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: As you know, President Clinton has nominated \n     Merrick B. Garland, Esquire, to fill the judicial vacancy on \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit caused by the retirement of Chief Judge \n     Mikva.\n       I write this letter to indicate my full support and \n     admiration of Mr. Garland and urge that you soon have a \n     hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and \n     thereafter support him to fill the vacancy.\n       Mr. Garland has a first-rate legal mind, took magna cum \n     laude and summa cum laude advantages of education at Harvard \n     College and Harvard Law School. In private practice, he \n     became and has the reputation of being an outstanding \n     courtroom lawyer. In addition, on several occasions, he \n     satisfied his urge to be a public servant by two law \n     clerkships, one for Mr. Justice William J. Brennan and the \n     other for the late Judge Henry J. Friendly. He has also \n     served in the Justice Department on several occasions. I have \n     known Merrick Garland as a lawyer and as a friend and greatly \n     admire his personal integrity, learning in the law and his \n     desire to be a great public servant. His legal, social and \n     political views are those most Americans admire and are well \n     within the fine hopes and principles of this country, which \n     you have often expressed in conversations with me as to the \n     type of person you would like to see on the federal \n     judiciary, particularly on the appellate courts.\n       I first got to know Mr. Garland when he was Special \n     Assistant to Deputy and then Attorney General Civiletti, as \n     my daughter, Lovida, Jr., was the other Special Assistant. I \n     still see him and his wife from time to time and they are the \n     type of Americans whom I greatly admire.\n       As is stated at the outset of this letter, I hope you will \n     see to it that Mr. Garland soon has his hearing and that you, \n     at and after the hearing, will actively support him for \n     confirmation. If you have any questions, please give me a \n     call and I will walk over to see you.\n       Take care.\n           Sincerely,\n     William T. Coleman, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Venable, Baetjer and Howard, llp,\n\n                                 Baltimore, MD, September 7, 1995.\n     Re Merrick B. Garland.\n\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: I just wanted to call your attention \n     to the fact that Merrick B. Garland has been nominated by \n     President Clinton for appointment to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n       Merrick is an outstanding lawyer with a very distinguished \n     career both in private practice at Arnold & Porter and in \n     government service, first as a special assistant to me when I \n     was Attorney General and then later as an Assistant United \n     States Attorney for the District and, most recently, as Chief \n     Associate Deputy Attorney General to Jamie Gorelick. \n     Additionally, his academic background was outstanding, \n     culminating in his clerkship to Supreme Court Justice \n     Brennan. In every way, he is a superb candidate for that \n     bench, and I just wanted you to know of my personal \n     admiration for him.\n       Kindest regards.\n           Sincerely,\n     Benjamin R. Civiletti.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                          McGuire Woods, Battle & Boothe, III,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 1995.\n     Re Nomination of Merrick B. Garland to the U.S. Court of \n         Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Orin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have been asked to express my views \n     to you on Merrick Garland's nomination to sit on the Federal \n     Court of appeals in the District of Columbia. First, I \n     believe Mr. Garland is an accomplished and learned lawyer and \n     is most certainly qualified for a seat on this important \n     bench. Second, my experience with Mr. Garland leads me to the \n     conclusion that he would decide cases on the law based on an \n     objective and fair analysis of the positions of the parties \n     in any dispute. Third, I perceive Mr. Garland as a man who \n     believes and follows certain principles, but not one whose \n     philosophical beliefs would overpower his objective analysis \n     of legal issues.\n       I know of no reason to suggest that the President's choice \n     for his vacancy on the Court of Appeals should not be \n     confirmed. As you, of course, have demonstrated during your \n     tenure as Chairman, the President's nominees are his choices \n     and are entitled to be confirmed where it is clear that th4e \n     nominee would be a capable and fair jurist. I believe Mr. \n     Garland meets that criteria and support favorable \n     consideration of his nomination.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     George J. Terwilliger, III.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue,\n\n     Washington, DC, October 10, 1995.\n     Re Merrick B. Garland.\n\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I first met Merrick Garland in the mid-\n     1970's, when we overlapped as students at the Harvard Law \n     School. While I have not known him well, I have been well \n     aware that his academic background is impeccable, and that he \n     is reputed to be a very bright, highly effective and \n     understated lawyer.\n       During January of 1994, while he was serving in the \n     Department of Justice, I had occasion to deal with him \n     directly on a matter of some public moment and sensitivity. I \n     was struck by the thoroughness of his preparation, the depth \n     of his understanding of the matters in issue, both factural \n     and legal, and his ability to express himself simply and \n     convincingly. I was still more impressed with his comments, \n     from obvious personal conviction, on the essential role of \n     honesty, integrity, and forthrightness in government.\n       Our discussions at that time were followed by further \n     conversations on several later occasions. I have also had an \n     opportunity to\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n     observe from a distance his performance in the Department and \n     to discuss that performance with people closer to the scene. \n     I am left with a distinct impression of him as a person of \n     great skill, diligence, and sound judgment, who is driven \n     more by a sense of public service than of personal \n     aggrandizement.\n       My own service in the Justice Department during the last \n     two Republican Administrations convinced me that government \n     suffers greatly from a shortage of people combining such \n     exceptional abilities with a primary drive to serve interests \n     beyond their own. Merrick Garland's nomination affords the \n     Senate chance to place one such person in a position where \n     such impulses can be harnessed to the maximum public good. I \n     hope that the Senate will seize that opportunity.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n     Donald B. Ayer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge,\n\n                                  Washington DC, November 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I write to express my support for \n     President Clinton's nomination of Merrick Garland to the \n     position of circuit Judge of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia. I've known Merrick \n     since 1978, when we served as law clerks to Supreme Court \n     Justices--he for Justice Brennan and I for Justice (now Chief \n     Justice) Rehnquist. Like our respective bosses, Merrick and I \n     disagreed on many legal issues. Still, I believe that Merrick \n     possesses the qualities of a fine judge.\n       You are no doubt well aware of the details of Merrick's \n     background as a practicing lawyer, a federal prosecutor, a \n     law teacher, and now a high-ranking official of the \n     Department of Justice. This varied background has given \n     Merrick a breadth and depth of legal experience that few \n     lawyers his age can rival, and he has distinguished himself \n     in all of his professional pursuits. He is a man of great \n     learning, not just in the law, but also in other disciplines. \n     Not only is Merrick enormously gifted intellectually, but he \n     is thoughtful as well, for he respects other points of view \n     and fairly and honestly assesses the merits of all sides of \n     an issue. And he has a stable, even-tempered, and courteous \n     manner. He would comport himself on the bench with dignity \n     and fairness. In short, I believe that Merrick Garland will \n     be among President Clinton's very best judicial appointments.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles J. Cooper.\n                                  ____\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G.

Over the Years I have had occasion to see his \n     work in several cases.\n       Based both on my own observations and on his reputation in \n     the legal community, I believe him to be exceptionally \n     qualified for a Circuit Court appointment. Throughout my \n     association with him I have always been impressed by his \n     judgment. Most importantly, Mr. Garland exemplifies the \n     qualifies of fairness, integrity and scholarship which are so \n     important for those who sit on the bench.\n       If I can be of any further assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert S.

Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \n         Oversight and the Courts, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch and Grassley: I am writing with respect \n     to the nomination of Merrick Garland to serve as a judge on \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit. I understand you have significant \n     reservations about filling the existing vacancy on the \n     District of Columbia Circuit at this time. In the event you \n     consider filling the vacancy at this time, I commend Merrick \n     Garland for your consideration.\n       I have known Mr. Garland for nearly ten years. We met \n     initially during my service as Deputy Counsel to the \n     President while Mr. Garland was assisting in an Independent \n     Counsel investigation. During the course of that contact, I \n     was impressed with Mr. Garland's professionalism and \n     judgment. After I was appointed United State Attorney for the \n     District of Columbia, Mr. Garland expressed to me an interest \n     in gaining additional prosecutorial experience, and applied \n     for a position as an Assistant United States Attorney. I \n     hired Mr. Garland for my staff, and initially assigned him to \n     a narcotics unit where he had an opportunity to assist in \n     investigating a number of significant cases and to gain \n     valuable trial experience. Mr. Garland quickly established \n     himself as a dedicated prosecutor who was willing to handle \n     the tough cases. He conducted thorough investigations, and \n     became a skilled trial attorney.\n       Subsequently, after gaining significant trial experience, \n     Mr. Garland was assigned to the Public Corruption section of \n     the U.S. Attorney's Office. There he had an opportunity to \n     investigate and try a number of complex, sensitive cases. In \n     the Public Corruption section, Mr. Garland demonstrated an \n     excellent capacity to investigate complex transactions, and \n     approached these important cases with maturity and balanced \n     judgment. He was thorough and thoughtful in exercising his \n     responsibility, and he always acted in accord with the \n     highest ethical and professional standards.\n       During his service as an Assistant United State Attorney, \n     Mr. Garland distinguished himself as one of the most capable \n     prosecutors in the Office. He brought to bear a number of \n     outstanding talents. He was bright. He had the intellectual \n     capacity to parse complex transactions. He built sound \n     working relationships with agents and staff based on mutual \n     respect. He was willing to work hard to get the job done. He \n     was dedicated to his job. He exercised sound judgment, and \n     approached his work with professionalism and thoughtfulness. \n     He exhibited excellent interpersonal skills, and was \n     delightful to work with. In sum, his service as an Assistant \n     United States Attorney was market by dedication, sound \n     judgment, excellent legal ability, a balanced temperament, \n     and the highest ethical and professional standards. These are \n     qualities which I believe he would bring to the bench as \n     well.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments for \n     your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jay B. Stephens.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Winston & Strawn,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, October 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: It is my understanding that Merrick \n     Garland's name has been submitted to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee to fill a vacancy on the D.C. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Merrick is a very talented lawyer, who has had an \n     outstanding career in both the private and public sectors.\n       In particular, he has exhibited exceptional legal abilities \n     during his recent term of office in the U.S. Department of \n     Justice. Throughout the United States, Merrick has been \n     recognized as a person within the Clinton Department of \n     Justice who is fair, thoughtful and reasonable. He clearly \n     possesses the ability to address legal issues and resolve \n     them in a fair and equitable manner.\n       Accordingly, in my opinion, Merrick will be an outstanding \n     addition to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and I strongly \n     recommend his confirmation by your committee. If you have any \n     further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Dan K.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for affording this Committee \n     an opportunity to express an opinion pertaining to the \n     nomination of Merrick Brian Garland for appointment as Judge \n     of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit.\n       Our Committee is of the unanimous opinion that Mr. Garland \n     is Well Qualified for this appointment.\n       A copy of this letter has been sent to Mr. Garland for his \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Carolyn B. Lamm,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you very much.\n  I am here today to speak on a subject that is most important to all \nof us in America, the Federal judiciary.\n  I had the honor for 12 years to serve as a U.S. attorney, and during \nthat time I practiced in Federal court before Federal judges. All of \nour cases that were appealed were appealed to Federal circuit courts of \nappeals. And that is where those final judgments of appeal were ruled \non. I think an efficient and effective and capable Federal judiciary is \na bulwark for freedom in America. It is a cornerstone of the rule of \nlaw, and it is something that we must protect at all costs. We need to \nbe professional and expeditious in dealing with those problems.\n  I must say, however, I do not agree that there has been a stall in \nthe handling of judges. As Senator Hatch has so ably pointed out, there \nwere 22 nominations last year, and 17 of those were confirmed. We are \nmoving rapidly\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\non the nominations that are now before the Judiciary Committee.\n  There is one today I want to talk about, Merrick Garland, because \nreally I do not believe that that judgeship should be filled based on \nthe caseload in that circuit, and for no other reason.\n  But I think it is important to say that there is not a stall, that I \nor other Senators could have delayed the vote on Merrick Garland for \nlonger periods of time had we chosen to do so. We want to have a vote \non it. We want to have a debate on it. We want this Senate to consider \nwhether or not this vacancy should be filled. And I think it should \nnot.\n  Senator Hatch brilliantly led, recently, an effort to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment on the floor of this Senate. For days and hours he \nstood here and battled for what would really be a global settlement of \nour financial crisis in this United States. We failed by one vote to \naccomplish that goal. But it was a noble goal.\n  That having slipped beyond us, I think it is incumbent upon those of \nus who have been sent here by the taxpayers of America to marshal our \ncourage and to look at every single expenditure this Nation expends and \nto decide whether or not it is justified. And if it is not justified, \nto say so. And if it is not justified, to not spend it.\n  In this country today a circuit court of appeals judge costs the \ntaxpayers of America $1 million a year. That includes their library, \ntheir office space, law clerks, secretaries, and all the other expenses \nthat go with operating a major judicial office in America. That is a \nsignificant and important expenditure that we are asking the citizens \nof the United States to bear. And I think we ought to ask ourselves, is \nit needed?\n  I want to point out a number of things at this time that make it \nclear to me that this judgeship, more than any other judgeship in \nAmerica, is not needed. Let me show this chart behind me which I think \nfundamentally tells the story. We have 11 circuit courts of appeal in \nAmerica. Every trial that is tried in a Federal court that is appealed \ngoes to one of these circuit courts of appeal. From there, the only \nother appeal is to the U.S. Supreme Court. Most cases are not decided \nby the Supreme Court. The vast majority of appeals are decided in one \nof these 11 circuit courts of appeal.\n  Senator Grassley, who chairs the Subcommittee on Court \nAdministration, earlier this year had hearings on the caseloads of the \ncircuit courts of appeals. He had at that hearing the just recently \nformer chief judge of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which has \nthe highest caseload per judge in America. Total appeals filed per \njudge for the year ending September 30, 1996, was 575 cases per judge. \nHe also had testifying before that committee Chief Judge Harvey \nWilkinson from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. They are the third \nmost busy circuit in America. They have 378 cases filed per judge in a \nyear's time. Both of those judges talked to us and talked to our \ncommittee about their concerns for the Federal judiciary and gave some \nobservations they had learned.\n  First of all, Judge Tjoflat, former chief judge of the eleventh \ncircuit, testified how when the courts of appeals get larger and those \nnumbers of judges go up from 8, 10, 12, to 15, the collegiality breaks \ndown. It is harder to have a unified court. It takes more time to get a \nruling on a case. It has more panels of judges meeting, and they are \nmore often in conflict with one another. It is difficult to have the \nkind of cohesiveness that he felt was desirable in a court. Judge \nWilkinson agreed with that.\n  I think what is most important with regard to our decision today, \nhowever, is what they said about their need for more judges. Judge \nTjoflat, of the eleventh circuit, said even though they have 575 \nfilings per judge in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, they do not \nneed another judge. Even Judge Harvey Wilkinson said even though they \nhave 378 filings per judge in the fourth circuit, they do not need \nanother judge. He also noted, and the records will bear it out, that \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has the fastest disposition rate, \nthe shortest time between filing and decision, of any circuit in \nAmerica, and they are the third busiest circuit in America. That is \ngood judging. That is good administration. That is fidelity to the \ntaxpayers' money, and they ought to be commended for that.\n  When you look at that and compare it to the situation we are talking \nabout today with 11 judges in the D.C. circuit, they now have only 124 \ncases per judge, less than one-fourth the number of cases per judge as \nthe eleventh circuit has. What that says to me, Madam President, is \nthat we are spending money on positions that are not necessary.\n  The former chief judge of the D.C. circuit, with just 123 cases per \njudge, back in 1995 said he did believe the 11th judgeship should be \nfilled but he did not believe the 12th should be filled. As recently as \nMarch of this year, just a few weeks ago, he wrote another letter \ndiscussing that situation. This is what he said in a letter addressed \nto Senator Hatch:\n\n       You asked me yesterday for my view as to whether the court \n     needs 11 active judges and whether I would be willing to \n     communicate that view to other Senators of your committee. As \n     I told you, my opinion on this matter has not changed since I \n     testified before Senator Grassley's committee in 1995. I said \n     then and still believe that we should have 11 active judges. \n     On the other hand, I then testified and still believe that we \n     do not need and should not have 12 judges. Indeed, given the \n     continued decline in our caseload since I last testified, I \n     believe the case for the 12th judge at any time in the \n     foreseeable future is almost frivolous, and, as you know, \n     since I testified, Judge Buckley has taken senior status and \n     sits part time, and I will be eligible to take senior status \n     in 3 years. That is why I continue to advocate the \n     elimination of the 12th judgeship.\n  So that is the former chief judge of the D.C. circuit saying that to \nfill the 12th judgeship would be frivolous, and he noted that there is \na continuing decline in the caseload in the circuit.\n  Madam President, let me point out something that I think is \nsignificant. Judge Buckley, who is a distinguished member of that court \nhas taken senior status. But that does not mean that he will not be \nworking. At a minimum, he would be required as a senior-status judge to \ncarry one-third of his normal caseload. Many senior judges take much \nmore than one-third of their caseload. They are relieved of \nadministrative obligations, and they can handle almost a full judicial \ncaseload. It does not indicate, because Judge Buckley announced he \nwould be taking senior status, that he would not be doing any work. He \nwould still be handling a significant portion of his former caseload. I \nthink that is another argument we ought to think about.\n  Finally, the numbers are very interesting with regard to the eleventh \ncircuit in terms of the declining caseload mentioned by Judge Silberman \nin his letter to Senator Hatch. We have examined the numbers of this \ncircuit and discovered that there has been a 15 percent decline in \nfilings in the D.C. circuit last year. That is the largest decline of \nany circuit in America. It apparently will continue to decline. At \nleast there is no indication that it will not. If that is so, that is \nan additional reason that this judgeship should not be filled.\n  I think Senator Leahy, the most able advocate for Mr. Garland, \nindicated in committee that it would be unwise to use these kinds of \nnumbers not to fill a judgeship, but it seems to me we have to \nrecognize that, if you fill a judgeship, that is an appointment for \nlife. If that judgeship position needs to be abolished, the first thing \nwe ought to do is not fill it. That is just good public policy. That is \ncommon sense. That is the way it has always been done in this country, \nI think. We ought to look at that.\n  So what we have is the lowest caseload per judge in America, \ndeclining by as much as 15 percent last year, and it may continue to \ndecline this year. The numbers are clear. The taxpayer should not be \nburdened with the responsibility of paying for a Federal judge sitting \nin a D.C. circuit without a full caseload of cases to manage.\n  Let me say this about Mr. Garland. I have had occasion to talk with \nhim on the phone. I told him I was not here to delay his appointment, \nhis hearing on his case. I think it is time for this Senate to consider \nit. I think it is time for us to vote on it. Based on what I see, that \njudgeship should not be filled. He has a high position with the \nDepartment of Justice and, by all accounts, does a good job there. \nThere will be a number of judgeship vacancies in the D.C. trial judges. \nHe has been a trial\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nlawyer. He would be a good person to fill one of those. I would feel \ncomfortable supporting him for another judgeship.\n  Based on my commitment to frugal management of the money of this \nNation, I feel this position should not be filled at this time. I \noppose it, and I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Madam President. First, let me associate myself \nwith the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Alabama who has \njust spoken. My position is quite the same as his with respect to this \nnominee. Certainly, I must begin by saying that I believe Mr. Garland \nis well qualified for the court of appeals. He earned degrees from \nHarvard College and Harvard Law School and clerked for Judge Friendly \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and for Justice \nBrennan on the Supreme Court and, since 1993, he has worked for the \nDepartment of Justice. So there is no question, he is qualified to \nserve on the court.\n\n  Like my colleague from Alabama, my colleague from Iowa, and others, I \nbelieve that the 12th seat on this circuit does not need to be filled \nand am quite skeptical that the 11th seat, the seat to which Mr. \nGarland has been nominated, needs to be filled either. The case against \nfilling the 12th seat is very compelling, and it also makes me question \nthe need to fill the 11th seat.\n  In the fall of 1995, the Courts Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on the caseloads of the D.C. circuit. Judge \nSilberman, who has served on the D.C. circuit for the past 11 years, \ntestified that most members of the D.C. circuit have come to think of \nthe D.C. circuit as a de facto court of 11. In other words, even though \nthere are 12 seats, theoretically, it is really being thought of as an \n11-member court by its members. In fact, in response to written \nquestions, Judge Silberman pointed out that the courtroom, normally \nused for en banc hearings, seats only 11 judges. In other words, that \nis what they can accommodate.\n  When Congress created the 12th judgeship in 1984, Congress may have \nthought that the D.C. circuit's caseload would continue to rise, as it \nhad for the previous decade. But, in fact, as my colleague from Alabama \nhas pointed out, exactly the opposite has occurred; the caseload has \ndropped. It is the only circuit in the Nation with fewer new cases \nfiled now than in 1985. During the entire period, the D.C. circuit has \nhad a full complement of 12 judges for only 1 year.\n  In a letter to Senator Grassley, Judge Silberman wrote that the D.C. \ncircuit can easily schedule its upcoming arguments with 11 judges and \nremain quite current. Further, Judge Silberman noted that while the \nD.C. circuit, unlike most others, has not had any senior judges \navailable to sit with it, the court has invited visiting judges only on \nthose occasions when it was down to 10 active judges.\n  Additionally, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts, it costs more than $800,000 a year to pay for a circuit judge \nand the elements associated with that judge's work. In light of recent \nefforts to curtail Federal spending, again, I agree with my colleague \nfrom Alabama that it is imprudent to spend such a sum of money unless \nthe need is very clear.\n  Senators Grassley and Sessions have made sound arguments that the \nD.C. circuit does not need to fill the 11th seat. Their arguments are \nreasonable and not based upon partisan considerations. Similarly, my \nconcerns with the Garland nomination are based strictly on the caseload \nrequirements of the circuit, not on partisanship or the qualifications \nof the nominee.\n  I would not want the opposition to the nomination, therefore, to be \nconsidered partisan in any way. Thus, although I do not believe that \nthe administration has met its burden of showing that the 11th seat \nneeds to be filled, in the spirit of cooperation, and to get the \nnominee to the floor of the Senate, I voted to favorably report the \nnomination of Merrick Garland from the Judiciary Committee when we \nvoted on that a couple of weeks ago. But, at the time, I reserved the \nright to oppose filling that 11th vacancy when the full Senate \nconsidered the nomination. That time has now come, and being fully \npersuaded by the arguments made by Senator Sessions and Senator \nGrassley, I reluctantly will vote against the confirmation of this \nnominee.\n  Based on the hearing of the Courts Subcommittee, caseload statistics, \nand other information, as I said, I have concluded that the D.C. \ncircuit does not need 12 judges and does not, at this point, need 11 \njudges. Therefore, I will vote against the nomination of Merrick \nGarland.\n  If Mr. Garland is confirmed and another vacancy occurs, thereby \nopening up the 11th seat again, I plan to vote against filling the \nseat--and, of course, the 12th seat--unless there is a significant \nincrease in the caseload or some other extraordinary circumstance.\n  Madam President, I want to thank Senator Grassley for his leadership \nin this area, as chairman of the subcommittee, and for allowing me to \nspeak prior to his comments, which I gather will be delivered next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to express my views of \nthe pending nomination. As chairman of the Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, I have closely studied the \nD.C. circuit for over a year now. And I can confidently conclude that \nthe D.C. circuit does not need 12 judges or even 11 judges. Filling \neither of these two seats would just be a waste of taxpayer money--to \nthe tune of about $1 million per year for each seat. The total price \ntag for funding an article III judge over the life of that judges is an \naverage of $18 million.\n  Madam President, $18 million is a whole lot of money that we would be \nwasting if we fill the vacancies on the D.C. circuit.\n  In 1995, I chaired a hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts on the D.C. circuit. At the \nhearing, Judge Lawrence Silberman--who sits on that court--testified \nthat 12 judges were just too many. According to Judge Silberman, when \nthe D.C. circuit has too many judges there just isn't enough work to go \naround.\n  In fact, as for the 12th seat, the main courtroom in the D.C. \ncourthouse does not even fit 12 judges. When there are 12 judges, \nspecial arrangements have to be made when the court sits in an en banc \ncapacity.\n  I would ask my colleagues to consider the steady decrease in new \ncases filed in the D.C. circuit. Since 1985, the number of new case \nfilings in the D.C. circuit has declined precipitously. And it \ncontinues to decline, even those who support filling the vacancies have \nto admit this. At most, the D.C. circuit is only entitled to a maximum \nof 10 judges under the judicial conference's formula for determining \nhow many judges should be allotted to each court.\n  Judge Silberman recently wrote to the entire Judiciary Committee to \nsay that filling the 12th seat would be--in his words--``frivolous.'' \nAccording to the latest statistics, complex cases in the D.C. circuit \ndeclined by another 23 percent, continuing the steady decline in cases \nin the D.C. circuit. With fewer and fewer cases per year, it doesn't \nmake sense to put more and more judges on the D.C. circuit. That would \nbe throwing taxpayer dollars down a rat hole.\n  So the case against filling the current vacancies is compelling. I \nbelieve that Congress has a unique opportunity here. I believe that we \nshould abolish the 12th seat and at least the 11th seat should not be \nfilled at this time. I believe that a majority of the Juidicary \nCommittee agrees the case has been made against filling the 12th seat \nand Chairman Hatch has agreed not to fill it. So, no matter what \nhappens today, at least we know that the totally unnecessary 12th seat \nwill not be filled. At least the taxpayers can rest a little easier on \nthat score.\n  Abolishing judicial seats is completely nonpartisan. If a judicial \nseat is abolished, no President-- Democrat or Republican--could fill \nit. As long as any judgeship exists, the temptation to nominate someone \nto fill the seat will be overwhelming--even with the outrageous cost to \nthe American taxpayer.\n\n  Again, according to the Federal judges themselves, the total cost to \nthe American taxpayer for a single article III judge is about $18 \nmillion. That's not chump change. That's something to look at. That's \nreal money we can save.\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\n  Here in Congress, we have downsized committees and eliminated \nimportant support agencies like the Office of Technology Assessment. \nThe same is true of the executive branch. Congress has considered the \nelimination of whole Cabinet posts. It is against this backdrop that we \nneed to consider abolishing judgeships where appropriate--like in the \nD.C. circuit or elsewhere.\n  While some may incorrectly question Congress' authority to look into \nthese matters, we are in fact on firm constitutional ground. Article \nIII of the Constitution gives Congress broad authority over the lower \nFederal courts. Also, the Constitution gives Congress the ``power of \nthe purse.'' Throughout my career, I have taken this responsibility \nvery seriously. I, too, am a taxpayer, and I want to make sure that \ntaxpayer funds aren't wasted.\n  Some may say that Congress should simply let judges decide how many \njudgeships should exist and how they should be allocated. I agree that \nwe should defer to the judicial conference to some degree. However, \nthere have been numerous occasions in the past where Congress has added \njudgeships without the approval of the Judicial Conference in 1990, the \nlast time we created judgeships, the Congress created judgeships in \nDelaware, the District of Columbia and Washington State without the \napproval of the Judicial Conference. In 1984, when the 12th judgeship \nat issue in this hearing was created--Congress created 10 judgeships \nwithout the prior approval of the Judicial Conference. It is clear that \nif Congress can create judgeships without judicial approval, then \nCongress can leave existing judgeships vacant or abolish judgeships \nwithout judicial approval. It would be illogical for the Constitution \nto give Congress broad authority over the lower Federal courts and yet \nconstrain Congress from acting unless the lower Federal courts first \ngave prior approval.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the current \nnomination and strike a blow for fiscal responsibility. Spending $18 \nmillion on an unnecessary judge is wrong. I have nothing against the \nnominee. Mr. Garland seems to be well qualified and would probably make \na good judge--in some other court. Now, I've been around here long \nenough to know where the votes are. I assume Mr. Garland will be \nconfirmed. But, I hope that by having this vote--and we've only had \nfour judicial votes in the last 4 years--a clear message will be sent \nthat these nominations will no longer be taken for granted.\n  Let's be honest--filling the current vacancies in the D.C. circuit is \nabout political patronage and not about improving the quality of \njudicial decision making. And who gets stuck with the tab for this? The \nAmerican taxpayer. I think it's time that we stand up for hardworking \nAmericans and say no to this nomination.\n  I would like to make a few comments about the Judicial nomination \nprocess in general. Just about every day or so we hear the political \nhue and cry about how slow the process has been. This is even though we \nconfirmed a record number of 202 judges in President Clinton's first \nterm--more than we did in either President Reagan's or President Bush's \nfirst term.\n  I have heard the other side try to make the argument that not filling \nvacancies is the same as delaying justice. Well, when you have Clinton \nnominees or judges who are lenient on murderers because their female \nvictim did not suffer enough, or you have a judge that tries to exclude \nbags of drug evidence against drug dealers, or a judge that says a bomb \nis not really a bomb because it did not go off and kill somebody--then \nI think that's when justice is denied.\n  The American people have caught on to this. And, I think the American \npeople would just as soon leave some of these seats unfilled rather \nthan filling them with judges who are soft on criminals or who want to \ncreate their own laws.\n  We have heard repeatedly from the other side that a number of \njudicial emergency vacancies exist. We are told that not filling these \nvacancies is causing terrible strife across the country. Now, to hear \nthe term ``judicial emergency'' sounds like we are in dire straits. \nBut, in fact, a judicial emergency not only means that the seat has \nbeen open for 18 months. It does not mean anything more than that, \ndespite the rhetoric we hear.\n  In fact, it is more than interesting to note that out of the 24 so-\ncalled judicial emergencies, the administration has not even bothered \nto make a nomination to half them. That is right, Mr. President. After \nall we have heard about Republicans not filling these so-called \njudicial emergencies which are not really emergencies, we find that the \nadministration has not even sent up nominees for half of them after \nhaving over a year and a half to do so.\n  But, we continue to hear about this so-called caseload crisis. My \noffice even got a timely fax from the judicial conference yesterday \nbemoaning the increase in caseload. Well, Mr. President, I sent out the \nfirst time ever national survey to article III judges last year. I \nlearned many things from the responses. Among them, I learned that \nwhile caseloads are rising in many jurisdictions, the majority of \njudges believed the caseloads were manageable with the current number \nof judges. A number of judges would even like to see a reduction in \ntheir ranks.\n  We know that much of the increased caseload is due to prisoner \npetitions, which are dealt with very quickly and easily, despite the \nhue and cry we hear. As a matter of fact the judicial conference even \nadmits some of the increase is due to prisoners filing in order to beat \nthe deadline for the new filing fees we imposed. So, there may be \nisolated problems, but there is no national crisis--period.\n  On February 5, I had the opportunity to chair a judiciary \nsubcommittee hearing on judicial resources, concentrating on the fourth \ncircuit. My efforts in regard to judgeship allocations are based upon \nneed and whether the taxpayers should be paying for judgeships that \njust are not needed. We heard from the chief judge that filling the \ncurrent two vacancies would actually make the court's work \nmore difficult for a number of reasons. He argued that justice can \nactually be delayed with more judges because of the added uncertainty \nin the law with the increased number of differing panel decisions. I am \nsorry that only three Senators were there to hear this very \nenlightening testimony.\n\n  We in the majority have been criticized for not moving fast enough on \nnominations. However, we know there was a higher vacancy rate in the \njudiciary at the end of the 103d Democrat Congress than there was at \nthe end of the 104th Republican Congress. Even though there were 65 \nvacancies at the end of last year, there were only 28 nominees that \nwere not confirmed. All of them had some kind of problem or concern \nattached to them. The big story here is how the administration sat on \nits rights and responsibilities and did not make nominations for more \nthan half of the vacancies. And some of the 28 nominations that were \nnot confirmed were only sent to us near the end of the Congress. Yet, \nthe administration has the gall to blame others for their failings.\n  I think it is also important to remember the great deal of deference \nwe on this side gave to the President in his first term. As I said, we \nhave confirmed over 200 nominees. All but four, including two Supreme \nCourt nominees, were approved by voice vote. That is a great deal of \ncooperation. Some would say too much cooperation.\n  But now, after 4 years of a checkered track record, it is clear to me \nthat we need to start paying a lot more attention to whom we're \nconfirming. Because like it or not, we are being held responsible for \nthem.\n  I cannot help but remember last year when some of us criticized a \nridiculous decision by a Federal judge in New York who tried to exclude \noverwhelming evidence in a drug case. What was one of the first things \nwe heard from the administration? After they also attacked the \ndecision, they turned around and attacked the Republican Members who \ncriticized the decision. They said, you Republicans voted for the \nnominee, so you share any of the blame.\n  Well, the vote on Judge Baer was a voice vote. But, I think many of \nus woke up to the fact that the American people are going to hold us \naccountable for some of these judges and their bad decisions. So, there \nis no question the scrutiny is going to increase, thanks to this \nadministration, and more time and\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\neffort is going to be put into these nominees. And, yes, we will \ncontinue to criticize bad decisions. If a judge that has life tenure \ncannot withstand criticism, then maybe he or she should not be on the \nbench.\n  Now, having said all of this, we have before us a nominee who we're \nready to vote on. I had been one of those holding up the nominee for \nthe D.C. circuit, the nomination before us. I believe I have made the \ncase that the 12th seat should not be filled because there is not \nenough work for 12 judges, or even 11 judges for that matter. My \nargument has always been with filling the seat--not the nominee. Now \nthat we have two open seats--even though the caseload continues to \ndecline--I'm willing to make a good faith effort in allowing the \nGarland nomination to move forward.\n  But, given the continued caseload decline, and the judicial \nconference's own formula giving the circuit only 9.5 judges, I cannot \nsupport filling even the 11th seat. So, I will vote ``no.'' I assume I \nwill be in the minority here and the nominee will be confirmed, but I \nthink the point has to be made. I very much appreciate Chairman Hatch's \nefforts in regard to my concerns, and his decision to not fill the \nunnecessary 12th seat.\n  So, there have been a lot of personal attacks lately. Motives are \nquestioned and misrepresented. This is really beneath the Senate. And I \nhope it will not continue.\n  Despite the attacks that have been launched against those of us who \nwant to be responsible, all we are saying is send us qualified nominees \nwho will interpret the law and not try to create it. Send us nominees \nwho will not favor defendants over victims, and who will be tough on \ncrime. Send us nominees who will uphold the Constitution and not try to \nchange it. As long as the judgeships are actually needed, if the \nadministration sends us these kinds of nominees, they will be \nconfirmed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Merrick B. Garland to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I commend Senators \nSessions, Kyl, and Grassley for taking this course.\n  Let me state from the outset that my opposition has nothing to do \nwith the nominee himself. I have no reservations about Mr. Garland's \nqualifications or character to serve in this capacity. He had an \nexcellent academic record at both Harvard College and Harvard Law \nSchool before serving as a law clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Also, he has served in \ndistinguished positions in private law practice and with the Department \nof Justice. Moreover, I have no doubt that Mr. Garland is a man of \ncharacter and integrity.\n  However, qualifications and character are not the only factors we \nmust consider in deciding whether to confirm someone for a Federal \njudgeship. A more fundamental question is whether we should fill the \nposition itself. Mr. Garland was nominated for the 11th seat on the \nD.C. circuit. I do not feel that this vacancy needs to be filled. Thus, \nI cannot vote in favor of this nomination.\n  The caseload of the D.C. circuit is considerably lower than any other \ncircuit court in the Nation. In 1996, the eleventh circuit had almost \nfive times the number of cases per judge as the D.C. circuit. The \nfourth circuit had over three times as many cases filed. Specifically, \nabout 378 appeals were filed per judge in the fourth circuit in 1996, \ncompared to only about 123 in the D.C. circuit.\n  Moreover, the caseload of the D.C. circuit is falling, not rising. \nStatistics from the Administrative Office show a decline in filings in \nthe D.C. circuit over the past year.\n  I am well aware of the argument that the cases in the D.C. circuit \nare more complex and take more time to handle, and therefore we should \nnot expect the D.C. circuit to have the same caseload per judge as \nother circuits. However, this fact cannot justify the great disparity \nin the caseload that exists today between the D.C. circuit and any \nother circuit. This is especially true since the D.C. circuit caseload \nis declining. In short, it is my view that the existing membership of \nthe D.C. circuit is capable of handling that court's caseload.\n  Mr. President, one of the core duties of a Member of this great Body \nis to determine how to spend, and whether to spend, the hard-earned \nmoney of the taxpayers of this Nation. We must exercise our duty \nprudently and conservatively because it is not our money or the \nGovernment's money we are spending; it is the taxpayers' money. Today, \nthe Republican Congress is working diligently to find spending cuts \nthat will permit us to finally achieve a balanced budget. In making \nthese hard choices, no area should be overlooked, including the \njudicial branch. Under the Constitution, the Congress has the power of \nthe purse, and it has broad authority over the lower Federal courts. \nThis body has the power to eliminate or decide not to fund vacant lower \nFederal judgeships, just as it had the power to create them in the \nfirst place.\n\n  The cost of funding a Federal judgeship has been estimated at about \n$1 million per year. This is a substantial sum of money, and a vastly \ngreater sum if we consider the lifetime service of a judge. We must \ntake a close look at vacant judgeships to determine whether they are \nneeded.\n  In this regard, Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Courts and Administrative Oversight, has been \nholding hearings regarding the proper allocation of Federal judgeships. \nI would like to take this opportunity to commend Senator Grassley for \nthe fine leadership he is providing in this important area. Through \nSenator Grassley's hard work, we have learned and continue to learn \nmuch about the needs of the Federal courts.\n  During one such subcommittee hearing this year, the Chief Judge of \nthe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, J. Harvie Wilkinson III, \nexplained that having more judges on the circuit court does not always \nmean fewer cases and a faster disposition of existing ones. He \nindicated it may mean just the opposite. More judges can mean less \ncollegial decisionmaking and more intracircuit conflicts. As a result \nof such differences, more en banc hearings are necessary to resolve the \ndisputes. More fundamentally, a large Federal judiciary is an \ninvitation for the Congress to expand Federal jurisdiction and further \ninterfere in areas that have been traditionally reserved for the \nStates.\n  In summary, I oppose this nomination only because I do not believe \nthat the caseload of the D.C. circuit warrants an additional judge. Mr. \nGarland is a fine man, but I believe that my first obligation must be \nto the taxpayers of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Utah and myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have 54 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned when I hear attempts to tie Mr. \nGarland's nomination to the number of judges in the D.C. circuit. Let \nus remember that Mr. Garland is there to fill the 11th seat on the D.C. \ncircuit, not the 12th seat. Even Judge Silberman, who has argued for \nabolishing the 12th seat for this court, has testified that ``it would \nbe a mistake, a serious mistake, for Congress to reduce down below 11 \njudges.'' That is a verbatim quote from Judge Silberman.\n  But we should also remember that when we just put numbers here, \nnumbers do not tell the whole story. The D.C. circuit's docket is by \nfar the most complex and difficult in the Nation. You can have a dozen \nroutine matters in another circuit and one highly complex issue \ninvolving the U.S. Government in the D.C. circuit, brought because it \nis the D.C. circuit, that one would go on and equal the dozen or more \nanywhere else.\n  We can debate later on the size of the D.C. circuit, whether it \nshould be 11 or 12. But we are talking about the 11th seat. And what \nSenators ought to be talking about is the fact that Merrick Garland is \na superb nominee. He has been seen as a superb nominee by Republicans \nand Democrats alike, by all writers in this field. At a time when some \nseem to want people who are not\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nqualified, here is a person with qualifications that are among the best \nI have ever seen.\n  So, let us not get too carried away with the debate on what size the \ncourt should be. We can have legislation on that. The fact is, we have \na judge who is needed, a judge who was nominated, and whose nomination \nwas accepted and voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995. It \nis now 1997. Let us stop the dillydallying. I suppose, as we are not \ndoing anything else--we do not have any votes on budgets or chemical \nweapons treaties or any of these other things we can do--I suppose we \ncan spend time on this. We ought to just vote this through, because at \nthe rate we are currently going we are falling further and further \nbehind, and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer \nand longer times, to the detriment of greater numbers of Americans and \nthe national cause of prompt justice.\n  Frankly, I fear these delays are going to persist. In fact, the \ndebate on what should be in the courts took an especially ugly turn \nover the last 2 weeks. Some Republicans have started calling for the \nimpeachment of Federal judges who decide a case in a way they do not \nlike. A Member of the House Republican leadership called for the \nimpeachment of a Federal judge in Texas because he disagreed with his \ndecision in the voting rights case, a decision that, whichever way he \nwent, was going to be appealed by the other side. If he ruled for the \nplaintiffs, the defendants were going to appeal; if he ruled for the \ndefendants, the plaintiffs would have appealed. But this Member of the \nother body decided, forget the appeals, he disagrees, so impeach the \njudge. He is quoted in the Associated Press as saying, ``I am \ninstituting the checks and balances. For too long we have let the \njudiciary branch act on its own, unimpeded and unchallenged, and \nCongress' duty is to challenge the judicial branch.''\n  The suggestion of using impeachment as a way to challenge the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary, an independence of the judiciary \nthat is admired throughout the world, the independence of a judiciary \nthat has been the hallmark of our Constitution and our democracy, the \nindependence of a Federal judiciary that has made it possible for this \ncountry to become the wealthiest, most powerful democracy known in \nhistory and still remain a democracy--to talk of using impeachment to \nchallenge that independence demeans our Constitution, and it certainly \ndemeans the Congress when Members of Congress speak that way. It is \nalso the height of arrogance. It ignores the basic principle of a free \nand independent judicial branch of Government. We would not have the \ndemocracy we have today without that independence.\n\n  I wonder if some have taken time to reread the Constitution. Maybe I \ngive them too much benefit of the doubt. I will ask them to read the \nConstitution. Article II, section 4, of the Constitution states:\n\n       The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the \n     United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\n  The Founders of this country did not consider disagreement with a \nMember of the House of Representatives as an impeachable offense. In \nfact, the Founders of this country would have laughed that one right \nout. Can you imagine? I suggested some read the Constitution and, I \nmust admit, in a moment of exasperation, I suggested perhaps some who \nwere making these claims had never read a book at all. But, of course, \nthey have. There is one by Lewis Carroll. It is called Alice in \nWonderland. The queen had a couple different points she made. One, of \ncourse, if all else failed was, ``Off with their heads.'' The other is, \n``The law is what I say the law is.''\n  We all lift our hands at the beginning of our term in office and \nswear allegiance to that Constitution, but all of a sudden there is \nsomething found in there that none of us knew about. Impeach a judge \nbecause you disagree with a judge's decision? I tried an awful lot of \ncases before I came here. I was fortunate in that, a chance to try \ncases at the trial level and the appellate level. Sometimes I won, \nsometimes I lost, but there was always an appeal. In fact, I found in \nthe cases I won as a prosecutor, the person on the way to jail would \ninvariably file an appeal. I just knew the appeal would be made. That \nis the way the courts go.\n  You do not suddenly say because I won the case, the judge was to be \nimpeached.\n  I think back to about 40 years ago and those who wanted to impeach \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. Why? Because they refused to uphold \nsegregation--let's impeach the Court. In fact, I made my first trip \nhere to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, when I was in my late \nteens. At that time, for the first time, I saw the billboards and \ndemonstrations against the Chief Justice after the landmark Brown \nversus Board of Education decision. I wondered what was going on.\n  In the 1950's, it was not uncommon to see billboards and bumper \nstickers saying, ``Impeach Earl Warren.'' These signs were so \nprevalent, Mr. President, that a young man from Georgia at that time \nonce remarked that his most vivid childhood memory of the Supreme Court \nwas the ``Impeach Earl Warren'' signs that lined Highway 17 near \nSavannah. He said: ``I didn't understand who this Earl Warren fellow \nwas, but I knew he was in some kind of trouble.''\n  That young man from Georgia is now a Supreme Court Justice himself, \nJustice Clarence Thomas.\n  In hindsight, it seems laughable, as in hindsight the current calls \nof impeachment of current judges will also be laughable. At that time, \nthe call to impeach was popular within a narrow and intolerant group \nwhich did not understand how our democracy works or what was its \nstrength. Apparently, it is fashionable in some quarters to sloganeer \nabout impeaching Federal judges again.\n  It was wrong in the 1950's to have somebody who wanted to protect the \nsin and stain of segregation to call for the impeachment of Earl \nWarren. It is wrong for some today to call for the impeachment of a \nFederal judge because of a disagreement with a single decision.\n  So I hope all of us--all of us--stop acting as though we can go to \nsomething way beyond our Constitution because a judge comes out with a \ndecision that we may disagree with. That is not a high crime or \nmisdemeanor; it is not an impeachable offense. Maybe it is an \nappealable question, but not an impeachable offense.\n\n  We in the Congress cannot act as some super court of appeals. Good \nLord, we even had a suggestion over the weekend that maybe even the \nCongress should have the power to vote to override any decision. In \nfact, it would be a super court of appeals. Good Lord, Mr. President, \nlook at the pace of this Congress. We have almost 100 vacancies on the \nFederal court and certainly by the end of business yesterday, we had \nnot filled a single one of them. We have not had a minute of debate on \nthe budget. We have done nothing about bringing up campaign finance \nreform.\n  Cooler heads are prevailing. I commend the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Lott, for his remarks on these impeachment threats. He \nis quoted as saying that impeachment should be based on improper \nconduct of a judge, not on his or her decisions or appeals. I think \nthat is the way it should be. I think perhaps we should step back \nbefore we go down this dark road.\n  I understand, Mr. President, that the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Maryland wishes 5 minutes; is that correct?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator can yield me 5 minutes, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from Vermont a couple \nof questions, if I can, about the charts he was referring to earlier. I \nwant to make sure I understand them fully.\n  This one, as I understand, shows the number of judges that have been \nconfirmed in the last three Congresses--we are now in the 105th \nCongress. There are currently 94 vacancies in the Federal court system?\n  Mr. LEAHY. There are. There will very soon be 100.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As yet, no judges have been confirmed in this Congress?\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. That's right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This is the first judge that has come before us?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Although I gather there are some 25 judges pending in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Between 23 and 25, enough to fill a quarter of the \nvacancies that are pending. Of course, on Mr. Garland, he came before \nthe committee in 1995 and was approved by the committee the first time \nin 1995. We are now in 1997. It is not moving with alacrity.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is not even moving with the speed of a glacier, one \nmight observe.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was going to say, there is a certain glacier connotation \nto the speed of confirming judges.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In the previous Congress, the 104th Congress, 75 judges \nwere confirmed?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That's right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The previous Congress, the 103d, 129, and the one \nbefore that, the 102d, 124; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is a significant falloff in the number of judges \nbeing confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In the 104th Congress, I tell my friend from Maryland, \nthere was an unprecedented slowdown in the confirmation of judges to \nthe extent that I think the only year that we could find, certainly in \nrecent memory, where no court of appeals judges were confirmed at all \nwas in the second session of the 104th Congress. The slowdown was so \ndramatic in the second session of the 104th Congress that it dropped \nthe number down to certainly an unprecedented low, considering the \nvacancies.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am quite concerned with these developments. The \nCongress has become much more political and partisan by any judgment. I \nthink that is regrettable, but it has happened, and we have to try to \ncontend with it here as best we can. But I think it is a dire mistake \nif this attitude carries over into our decisions regarding the \njudiciary, the third, independent branch of our Government and the one \nthat, in order to maintain public confidence in our justice system, \nought to have politics removed from it as much as is humanly possible.\n\n  Would the Senator from Vermont agree with that observation?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I absolutely agree. It has been my experience in the past \nthat Republicans and Democrats have worked closely together with both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents to keep the judiciary out of \npolitics, knowing that all Americans would go to court not asking \nwhether a judge is Republican or Democrat, but asking whether this is a \nplace they will get justice. If we politicize it, they may not be able \nto answer that question the way they have in the past.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Therefore, I am very interested in this chart you have \nprepared: The number of judges confirmed during the second Senate \nsession in the Presidential election years.\n  Now, what has happened? What happened in 1996 is dramatic. No appeals \ncourt judges were confirmed and only 17 district court judges.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If my friend from Maryland will yield on that, I will \npoint out the contrast. In 1992 we had a Republican President and a \nDemocratic Senate; we confirmed 11 appellate court judges and 55 \ndistrict court judges. Four years later you have a Democratic President \nand a Republican Senate and look at the vast difference: zero appellate \ncourt judges and only 17 district court judges, notwithstanding an \nenormous vacancy rate.\n  I think what it shows is that, if you want something to demonstrate \npartisanship, when the Democrats controlled the Senate with a \nRepublican President, they still cooperated to give that Republican \nPresident a significant number of judges in the second session, in a \nPresidential election year, the time it normally slows down, as \ncontrasted to the absolute opposite, the unprecedented opposite, of \nwhat happened when you have a Democratic President and a Republican \nSenate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me take the Senator's----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I ask a question in here at the proper time? I do \nnot want to interrupt the flow. I had a question of the manager?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Maryland has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for the inquiry.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. My question is this. As I understand it, there are 3 \nhours on this bill, so presumably that would take us up to around 6 \no'clock, as I understand.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Unless time is yielded back.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if there appeared to be much of a chance that \nsome time might be yielded back? It would be very helpful to me, but I \ndo not want to stop any pearls of wisdom.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have a member of the Leahy family to whom I have had the \nprivilege of being married nearly 35 years who hopes time will be \nyielded back. As her husband, I hope time will be yielded back. I am \nabout to just give the floor back to the Senator from Maryland. I do \nnot know how much more time is going to be taken in opposition to Mr. \nGarland. I know of very little time that is going to be taken further \nhere.\n  So the long way around, to answer my good friend from Rhode Island, I \nhope time will be yielded back fairly soon.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Put me down as a firm supporter of Mrs. Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sure she would be delighted to know that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield for one further question, \njust to take your analysis a step further, in 1992 and 1988, in each of \nthose years, you had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is in both these years, not just the contrast of the \nlast year of the Bush Presidency. But in the last year of the second \nReagan administration, we confirmed 7 appeals judges, then 11 for the \nlast year of the Bush administration, and last year the number was \nzero. For district court judges in those years it was 35, 55 and 17. \nThat is a dramatic difference. An element has intruded itself in this \nconfirmation process that was not heretofore present.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would yield a moment.\n  In 1984, there was a Republican Senate and Republican President, and \nyou see 10 and 33. In 1992, there is a Republican President and \nDemocratic Senate, and the Democratic Senate actually did better for \nthe Republican President than the Republican Senate for the Republican \nPresident.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Exactly.\n  Let me say I am very deeply concerned about this development. I want \nto commend the Senator from Vermont because he has been speaking out on \nthis very important matter for some time now.\n  Moving to the pending nomination, I want to speak first to Merrick \nGarland's merits, although let me say that I do not understand any of \nmy colleagues to be questioning his capabilities and qualifications to \nserve on the bench. In fact, Members on both sides have spoken very \nhighly of Merrick Garland and noted his outstanding character.\n  I was privileged, since he is a resident of my State, to have the \nhonor to introduce him at his confirmation hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. That was on November 30, 1995, almost 18 months \nago. I believed then and continue to believe now that he will make an \noutstanding addition to the D.C. circuit.\n  His career exemplifies his strong commitment to the law and to public \nservice.\n  He is a magna cum laude graduate from Harvard Law School. He clerked \nfor Judge Henry Friendly on the second circuit and for Justice William \nBrennan at the Supreme Court.\n  He has had a long association with the Justice Department, first as a \nspecial assistant to then Att. Gen. Benjamin Civiletti. He then became \na partner at Arnold & Porter when he left the Justice Department to go \ninto private practice.\n  Upon returning to public service, he has served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney for the District of Columbia, dealing with public corruption \nand Government fraud cases. He has also served as Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General in the Justice Department's Criminal Division and as \nPrincipal Associate Deputy Attorney General, both very high ranking \npositions within the Department.\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n\n  In all of these positions he has served our country with great \ndistinction.\n  He has published extensively in several areas of the law and has \nremained active in bar association activities.\n  In every respect, in his intellect, his character, and his \nexperience, he would make an outstanding addition to the bench.\n  Let me now just briefly talk about this new line of attack, so to \nspeak, that has arisen about whether vacancies on the D.C. circuit \nshould be filled.\n  First of all, I think any analysis of the courts' need to fill \nvacancies cannot be based simply on caseload statistics--this is a \nbenchmark that one needs to analyze carefully in order to determine \nwhat lies behind the cases. In fact, the D.C. circuit's situation in \nparticular makes clear that mere case filing numbers do not tell the \nwhole story with respect to the burdens that the court faces. The D.C. \ncircuit receives, in complexity and importance, cases that do not come \nas a general rule before the other circuits across the country. It has \nhad major, major cases that it has had to deal with as a routine \nmatter, cases of great weight and importance to the nation.\n  The D.C. circuit also handles numerous appeals from administrative \nagency decisions that are characterized by voluminous records and \ncomplex fact patterns. In fact, almost half of the D.C. circuit's cases \nare these kinds of administrative appeals--46 percent. The next highest \ncircuit in this respect is the ninth circuit with 9.6 percent of their \ncases being of this kind.\n  The D.C. circuit also handles fewer of the least complex and time-\nconsuming cases, criminal and diversity cases, than any of its sister \ncircuits. Only 11 percent of its cases are diversity cases. No other \ncircuit has less than 24 percent.\n  In testimony before the Judiciary Committee's Courts Subcommittee, \nD.C. Circuit Judge Harry Edwards--the Chief Judge of the circuit--gave \none example of the kind of complex administrative cases that are a \nroutine part of the D.C. circuit's caseload. He talked about a case to \nreview a FERC order, an order of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. This order produced, at the time of appeal, 287 separate \npetitions for review by 163 separate parties, and a briefing schedule \nthat provided for the filing of 27 briefs, totaling over 900 pages.\n  I am simply making the point that they get very complex matters to \ndeal with in the D.C. circuit, and that the case filing numbers relied \non by other side do not tell the whole story.\n  Recall also that the vacancy we are talking about filling here is the \n11th out of 12 slots on the D.C. circuit. Originally, Merrick Garland \nwas being opposed on the basis that the 12th spot on the circuit court \nought not to be filled. Now, with the taking of senior status by one of \nthe D.C. circuit's judges, we are talking about filling the 11th spot, \nnot the 12th spot, on that court and yet Members have come forward \nopposing the Garland nomination, a fact which I very much regret.\n  Now I want to address just very briefly the fact that the fourth \ncircuit was raised earlier by one of my colleagues in this debate. He \ncited the view of Fourth Circuit Chief Judge Wilkinson, presented at a \nFebruary 1997 Judiciary Subcommittee hearing, that the President and \nSenate do not need to fill the two vacancies that exist on that court.\n  It is interesting that at that same hearing, testimony that I do not \nthink has been cited, by Judge Sam Ervin, the very able and \ndistinguished circuit judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit, and the son of our former distinguished colleague, was \npresented before the panel in support of filling the vacancies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the very thoughtful \nstatement by Judge Ervin be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is very important to note that with respect to the \nfourth circuit, there is a nominee pending before the Judiciary \nCommittee, whose nomination was submitted in the last Congress--two \nnominations, as a matter of fact, were submitted to the Committee last \nyear--and one has been resubmitted by the administration right at the \nbeginning of this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has spoken for \nconsiderably more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator give me 2 minutes to close up?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is no way with a nominee having been sent to the \nSenate by the President, that an argument for not approving the nominee \nbased on not needing the judgeship can be made without it carrying with \nit an ad hominem argument against the nominee.\n  If people are really serious about reducing vacancies on the courts, \nthey need to scrub down the number of places before the nominees are \nsubmitted, by legislation. Once the nominees come here, you cannot \ndivorce the attack on the individual from the attack on the need for \nthe seat on the bench. We have the chief judge of the fourth circuit \ncoming in against filling spots when nominees are pending.\n  Now, how can that position be taken and considered separate from \nopposition to the nominee? They say, ``Well, I am not against this \nnominee, but I just do not think this spot ought to be filled.'' Of \ncourse, that is small comfort to the nominee whose nomination is \npending and has been put forward in order to fill the vacancy.\n  Now, Judge Ervin, in his testimony, sets forth, I think, a very \npersuasive case why the fourth circuit needs to have those vacancies \nfilled. I commend that statement to my colleagues. I will not go \nthrough it in detail here, given the fact that this debate is coming to \na close.\n  I do encourage my colleagues to consider carefully the political \ncloud with which we are now surrounding the judgeships.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, we did not behave this way \nat a time when the Senate Democrats were in control of the Senate and \nwe were dealing with the nominations of Republican Presidents. I will \nbe very frank. I think the judiciary deserves better than that from us. \nI hope that game will come to an end and we will be able to move ahead \nwith the confirmation of judges in an orderly fashion.\n  In closing, let me again state that I am very supportive of the \njudicial nominee who is before the Senate today. I think he is a person \nof outstanding merit who will make an outstanding judge, and I urge his \nconfirmation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Statement of the Honorable Sam J. Ervin III\n\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, my name is \n     Sam J. Ervin, III, of Morganton, North Carolina. I am an \n     active United States Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit, \n     having been appointed in May, 1980. I had the honor of \n     serving as the Chief Judge of that Circuit from February, \n     1989 until February, 1996. I appreciate the Subcommittee's \n     willingness to hear my views.\n       I support the actions of the Judicial Conference of the \n     United States in its efforts to address the important issue \n     of judgeship needs. I commend Chief Judge Julia Gibbons and \n     the other members of the Judicial Resources Committee for \n     establishing a principled method for evaluating these needs.\n       I am in agreement with my good friend and colleague, Chief \n     Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson, III, that the federal judiciary \n     should remain of limited size and jurisdiction. Should anyone \n     present doubt my commitment to those principles, I quote from \n     a resolution that I introduced on June 24, 1993: (which was \n     unanimously adopted by the Article III Judges of the Fourth \n     Circuit)\n       ``Chief Judge Ervin. If I may, I would like to submit for \n     consideration a resolution reading as follows:\n       `` `Resolved that the future role of the federal courts \n     should remain complementary to the role of the state courts \n     in our society. They should not usurp the role of state \n     courts.\n       `` `To achieve that goal, it is the consensus of the \n     Conference that the Congress might consider such issues as \n     the federal courts remaining an institution of limited size \n     and jurisdiction. The ability of the federal courts to \n     fulfill their historical limited and specialized role is \n     dependent on the willingness of Congress to maintain \n     jurisdictional balance and curtail the federalization of \n     traditional state crimes and causes of action.' ''\n       My appearance here today, however, is necessitated by Chief \n     Judge Wilkinson's proposal that we do not need to fill the \n     two  judicial vacancies that presently exist in our circuit. \n     It is my conviction that our failure to do so would be a \n     serious mistake.\n       First, a brief history leading up to the subject of whether \n     these two existing vacancies should or should not be filled;\n       On October 9, 1985, when the late Harrison Winter was our \n     Chief Judge, the circuit judges, with a single dissent, voted \n     to ask for\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\n     four additional active judges for the Fourth Circuit.\n       On October 4, 1989, we again indicated by another formal \n     action that while we did not desire a court of more than 15 \n     active judges, we unanimously reaffirmed our earlier request \n     for four additional judges.\n       Legislation was passed in 1990 authorizing a number of \n     additional judgeships, including four new circuit court \n     judges for the Fourth Circuit. Thereafter, three of these so-\n     called Omnibus Bill judges were nominated and subsequently \n     confirmed: Judge Hamilton (S.C.) in July, 1991; Judge Luttig \n     (V.A.) in August, 1991; and Judge Motz (M.D.) in June, 1994.\n       The fourth (and final) Omnibus Bill judgeship has remained \n     unfilled since it was created in December, 1990. As of this \n     date, there is no pending nomination for this vacancy, and I \n     believe that this is the only 1990 circuit judgeship that \n     remains unfilled.\n       The second Fourth Circuit vacancy was created when Judge J. \n     Dickson Phillips, Jr., of North Carolina, took senior status, \n     effective July 31, 1994. More than two and one-half years \n     later, the Honorable James M. Beaty, Jr., a District Court \n     Judge in the Middle District of North Carolina, was nominated \n     to succeed Judge Phillips, but no action has been taken on \n     that nomination by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       To my knowledge, the judges of the Fourth Circuit have \n     never taken any formal action to indicate an unwillingness to \n     stand by our requests that these two vacancies be filled.\n       In order to evaluate the Circuit's needs for these two \n     judgeships, I suggest that we must realistically assess our \n     present situation:\n       Present Active Judges: At this time, the Fourth Circuit has \n     13 active judges. Five of these judges are 70 years of age or \n     older. Their present ages are: 90, 78, 76, 73, and 70. Is it \n     realistic to expect that all of these judges will be able to \n     continue to serve indefinitely?\n       Present Senior Judges: The last printed report from the \n     Administrative Office is outdated in reflecting that we have \n     4 senior judges. One of the four retired on July 31, 1995, \n     and is no longer eligible to sit.\n       Another has indicated that he does not plan to sit any \n     more. The remaining two, whose current ages are 79 and 74, \n     have each been sitting 2 days per court week, thereby \n     constituting 4/5 of one judge.\n       Necessary Panels: For the past several years, we have been \n     averaging 5 panels of judges each court week. With our \n     present complement of active and senior judges, we lack a \n     sufficient number of judges to fill 5 panels without bringing \n     in district judges from our own circuit or senior judges from \n     other circuits.\n       Current Statistics: Rather than burden you with more \n     numbers, I will simply refer to the latest figures published \n     by the Administrative Office. I am confident that those \n     statistics fully justify the filling of the two existing \n     vacancies. In fact, as I understand it, if the numerical \n     portion of the existing formula were applied (the 500 filings \n     per panel with pro se appeals weighted as one-third of the \n     cases) the Fourth Circuit would be eligible to receive 20 \n     judgeships. We have never requested more than 15.\n       North Carolina: I note that Judge Gibbon's Judicial \n     Resource Committee has listed as a factor to be considered in \n     allocating judgeships, geographical considerations within a \n     circuit. At the risk of being thought provincial, I emphasize \n     the special impact that a failure to fill the two presently \n     unfilled seats on the Fourth Circuit will have on North \n     Carolina. The expectation has been that these seats would be \n     assigned to that state. I, of course, recognize that there is \n     no law which requires that this allocation be made--actually \n     this is a matter for the executive and legislative branches \n     to determine--but it seems to be the fair thing to do for the \n     following reasons:\n       a. North Carolina is the most populous state in the \n     circuit.\n       b. North Carolina has one of the highest numbers of filings \n     in the district courts in the circuit.\n       c. North Carolina, like West Virginia, has had only two \n     seats, while both Virginia and Maryland have three each, and \n     South Carolina has four. Filling the two existing vacancies \n     from North Carolina would do no more than to restore that \n     state to parity with our sister states. I point out that \n     should I decide to take senior status--as I am eligible to \n     do--North Carolina would have no active judge. That situation \n     would create some insurmountable problems for both the bar \n     and litigants of that state.\n       d. While it has been suggested to me that this imbalance \n     could be remedied by assigning seats now held by judges from \n     other states to North Carolina as they are opened by death or \n     retirement, that seems an unpredictable solution--especially \n     in the present political climate.\n       Above all else, I seek to be as sure as it is humanly \n     possible to be that our circuit has a sufficient number of \n     judges to enable us to render swift and certain justice in \n     all of the cases that come before us. Some recent legislation \n     and our adoption of new internal operating procedures may \n     well reduce our caseload to some degree but countervailing \n     circumstances, including the continuation of the \n     federalization of numerous state crimes, the creation of new \n     private rights of action, the rapid population growth of the \n     region, and the increased complexity of both the criminal and \n     civil cases now coming to the federal courts (to mention only \n     a few of the relevant factors) will, I fear, more than offset \n     any decreases in our workloads. I do believe that we would \n     have sufficient personnel to enable us to do the work that is \n     assigned to us in a fashion acceptable to all if these two \n     vacancies are filled--at least for the foreseeable future.\n       Mr. Chairman, in the Questionnaire which you sent to the \n     members of the judiciary some time ago, you raised the \n     legitimate question of whether we as judges were being \n     required by our respective workloads to delegate more of our \n     judicial functions than was ideal--or even healthy--to elbow \n     law clerks, staff law clerks or other non-judicial employees. \n     I was not privy to the answers my colleagues returned to \n     those questions, but I strongly suspect that many of us would \n     admit that the degree of delegation required in the courts of \n     appeals is greater than is ideal. Speaking only for myself, I \n     would like to be able to devote greater personal attention to \n     every matter that comes before me than I am now able to do.\n       I sincerely believe that our present ability to carry out \n     our duties in a manner pleasing to this Subcommittee, to the \n     public, and to ourselves would be enhanced by the filling of \n     these two long vacant positions.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 2 of the 12 seats on the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals are currently vacant. Some have argued that \nthe vacancy to which Merrick Garland has been nominated should not be \nfilled because the D.C. circuit is overstaffed. But the reasons \nCongress gave for approving 12 seats for the D.C. circuit remain \ncompelling today and justify filling this vacancy.\n  Further, to propose eliminating a circuit court judgeship within the \ncontext of a particular nomination, rather than through the \ndeliberative process we normally follow in addressing judgeship needs, \njeopardizes the impartiality and independence of the judiciary.\n  Merrick Garland's nomination was first delivered to the Senate on \nSeptember 6, 1995--more than 18 months ago. The Judiciary Committee \nheld a confirmation hearing on the nomination on November 30, 1995, and \nforwarded the nomination for consideration by the full Senate 2 weeks \nlater. The full Senate failed to act on Garland's nomination for 9\\1/2\\ \nmore months, however, returning it to the President at the close of the \n104th Congress.\n  In fact, the Senate refused to confirm a single circuit court judge \nduring the entire second session of the last Congress. This was the \nfirst time in more than 20 years that an entire session of Congress had \npassed without a single circuit court confirmation. Nonetheless, some \nargued that shutting down the confirmation process is par for the \ncourse in an election year. They are wrong. And let me set the record \nstraight.\n  George Bush made nearly one-third of his 253 judicial nominations in \n1992, a Presidential election year. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I held 15 nomination hearings that year, including 3 in \nJuly, 2 in August, and 1 in September. In 1992--the last Presidential \nelection year--the Senate continued to confirm judges through the \nwaning days of the 102d Congress. We even confirmed 7 judges on October \n8--the last day of the second session. As a result, the Senate \nconfirmed all 66 nominees the Judiciary Committee reported out that \nyear--55 for the district courts and 11 for the circuit courts. Let me \nrepeat: last session, only 17 district judges were confirmed and no \ncircuit judges were confirmed.\n  Now that the election is over and Merrick Garland has been \nrenominated, Republicans argue that we should not vote to confirm him \nbecause the District of Columbia circuit needs only 10 judges. They are \nwrong. And let me set the record straight.\n  Congress has previously recognized the need for 12 judges. Twelve \nyears ago, based on the recommendation of the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States, Congress concluded that the D.C. circuit's caseload \nwarranted 12 judgeships. The Senate report to the 1984 legislation \ncreating an additional judgeship states:\n\n       Located at the seat of the Federal government, the Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia inevitably receives a \n     significant amount of its caseload from federal \n     administrative agencies headquartered in that area. \n     Administrative appeals filed in this court numbered 504 in \n     1982 and represented 34.8 percent of the incoming caseload. \n     Due to the nature of the caseload which includes many unique \n     cases involving complex legal, economic and social issues of \n     national importance and a large backlog of pending appeals, \n     this court requires one additional judgeship.\n\n  The D.C. circuit needs 12 judges to handle its complex caseload. A \nlarge portion of the D.C. Circuit caseload consists of complex \nadministrative appeals which generally consume a larger\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\namount of judicial resources than other appellate cases. Therefore, \ncomparison of raw caseload data between the D.C. circuit, with its high \npercentage of complex administrative cases, and the other circuits is \nmisleading. According to the statistics provided by the Administrative \nOffice of U.S. Courts for the period from September 30, 1995 to \nSeptember 30, 1996, 1,347 cases were filed in the D.C. circuit, 474 of \nwhich--or 35.2 percent--were administrative appeals. In contrast, in \nthe remaining 11 circuits, of the 51,991 cases filed, only 2,827--or \n5.4 percent--were administrative appeals.\n  The D.C. circuit has a long time interval between filing a notice of \nappeal and final disposition. Because the D.C. circuit has this \nincredibly high percentage of administrative appeals relative to the \nother circuits and because these types of cases require tremendous \namounts of judicial resources, litigants in the D.C. circuit must wait \nan average of 12 months between the filing of the notice of appeal and \nfinal disposition. Only 3 of the 12 circuits have a longer average for \nthis time frame.\n  The fact that the D.C. circuit has a long time interval between \nfiling and disposition is indicative of the complex cases that the \ncircuit handles. Other circuits have more criminal appeals and garden-\nvariety diversity cases that often are amenable to summary disposition \nwithout oral argument.\n  The D.C. circuit has fewer pro se appeals than other circuits. In \naddition to having fewer criminal appeals and diversity cases, the D.C. \ncircuit has a lower percentage of pro se mandamus cases than all other \ncircuits. Chief Judge Edwards has noted that pro se appeals are often \nfrivolous, easily identified as lacking merit, or otherwise amenable to \ndisposition without significant expenditure of judicial resources.\n  The D.C. circuit has more cases of national importance than other \ncircuits. Not only are complex administrative appeals commonly heard in \nthe D.C. circuit, but as a result of its location at the seat of the \nFederal Government, the D.C. circuit also hears a disproportionate \nnumber of the high-profile cases of national importance that reach the \nU.S. Courts of Appeals. The D.C. circuit decided in 1996 alone National \nTreasury Employees Union versus United States of America, a challenge \nto the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act, as well as Perot \nversus Federal Election Commission, an appeal from a district court's \nrejection of Ross Perot's attempt to participate in last year's \nPresidential debates.\n  The same reasons that supported the creation of a 12 judgeship for \nthe D.C. circuit in 1984 justify its existence now. If reasoned \ndeliberation and study of this circuit leads to the conclusion that a \nfuture vacancy should not be filled, then we should address that issue, \nbut not within the context of this nomination. If ad hoc analysis \nbecomes our mode of operation, we will give the appearance of a \npoliticized judiciary.\n  I congratulate Merrick Garland for his distinguished career and \ncommend President Clinton for making this nomination. I hope that the \nSenate will act to confirm him as expeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe confirmation of Merrick Garland to the D.C. circuit.\n  Even though the nominee has the character and is highly qualified for \nthe position, there is a larger question that must be examined. Does \nthis seat really need to be filled? Especially since it has remained \nempty for 1\\1/2\\ years?\n  The answer is that the D.C. circuit does not need another seat, \nespecially when there are many other problems in the other district \ncircuits that have not been focused on yet. I base my opinion on the \nfact that the D.C. circuit had 4,359 cases as of October 1996. The \nninth circuit, the circuit in which Montana is housed, had 71,462 \ncases. That is almost 20 times the number of cases. The D.C. circuit \nranked last in the total number of cases as compared to each of the \nother district circuits in the Nation. If we examine these numbers, it \ndoes not seem as if the D.C. judges are handling any cases at all.\n  This is also a very expensive seat. It will cost the American \ntaxpayers an extra $1 million to fill this seat. This will not be money \nwell spent.\n  There are adequate numbers of judges on the circuit, why are we \nconfirming this seat? I urge my colleagues to examine the numbers and \nvote against the filling of this unneeded seat.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \ncircuit. Mr. Garland is a resident of my State of Maryland.\n  I am pleased that his nomination is finally on the Senate floor for a \nvote. It is critical that vacancies on the Federal bench are filled, \nespecially at the appellate level.\n  Mr. Garland has a distinguished legal record in the public and \nprivate sectors. He has specialized in criminal, civil, and appellate \nlitigation, as well as administrative and antitrust law. I believe his \nexperience will serve him well on the Federal bench once he is \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. Garland is a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School and a \nsumma cum laude graduate of Harvard College. While at Harvard Law \nSchool, he was the articles editor of the Harvard Law Review and a \nmember of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa, while he attended Harvard \nCollege.\n  When I decide whether to support a judicial nominee, I look at \nwhether the nominee is competent; whether the nominee possesses the \nappropriate judicial temperament; whether the nominee possesses the \nhighest personal and professional integrity, and whether the nominee \nwill protect our core constitutional values.\n  I believe that Mr. Garland possesses all of these qualifications. His \nlegal and academic record are exemplary. I am impressed that he has \ndevoted part of his career to public service. He served as the \nPrincipal Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Department of \nJustice. And he clerked after law school for one of the most \ndistinguished Supreme Court Justices, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.\n  He's also done extensive pro-bono legal work on behalf of \ndisadvantaged individuals. He has represented an African-American \nemployee in a claim of racial discrimination, a mother in a custody \ndispute, and court-requested representation of a prisoner.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Garland's nomination to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals D.C. Circuit. I hope that once Mr. Garland is \nconfirmed, we can move forward to a vote on the other pending Federal \njudicial nominees.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to vote ``no'' on the \nnomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  In so voting, I take no position on the personal qualifications of \nMr. Garland to be a Federal appeals court judge. What I do take a \nposition on is that the vacant 12th seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit does not need to be filled. \nSenator Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, has examined \nthis issue thoroughly, and has determined that the court's workload \ndoes not justify the existence of the 12th seat. Last Congress, Senator \nGrassley introduced legislation to abolish this unneeded seat. By \nproceeding to renominate Mr. Garland, President Clinton has flatly \nignored this uncontradicted factual record.\n  I commend Senator Grassley for his important work on this matter, as \nwell as Senator Jeff Sessions, who has also emphasized the importance \nof this matter. With the Federal deficit at an all time high, we should \nalways be vigilant in looking for all opportunities to cut wasteful \nGovernment spending; this is one such opportunity. After all, each \nunnecessary circuit judge and his or her staff cost the taxpayer at \nleast $1 million a year.\n  Lastly, our vote today is an important precedent, since it marks the \nbeginning of the Senate's new commitment to hold rollcall votes on all \njudicial nominees. This is a policy change which I had urged on my \nRepublican colleagues by letter of January 8, 1997, to the Republican \nConference. Voting on Federal judges, who serve for life and who exert \ndramatic--mostly unchecked--influence over society, should be one of \nthe most important aspects of serving as a U.S. Senator.\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\nRollcall votes will, I believe, impress upon the individual judge, the \nindividual Senator, and the public the importance of just what we are \nvoting on. I hope that my colleagues will regard this vote, and every \nvote they take on a Federal judge, as being among the most important \nvotes they will ever take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we should inform the Senate that our intent \nis to yield back the time if we can by 5:15 so people can vote at that \ntime. It could be just a wee bit longer than that. That is our \nintention. Those who want to come over and use the time need to come \nnow.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nwho is a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield.\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Victoria \nBassetti of Senator Durbin's staff be allowed the privilege of the \nfloor during this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, for yielding me time.\n  I have sought recognition to voice my very strong support for the \nnomination of Merrick Garland for the Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia. Mr. President, a great deal has been said today on this \nfloor which is of great importance but not really tremendously related \nto Merrick Garland's nomination. I hope we have a chance to analyze the \nentire process of confirmation of judges and the respective roles of \nthe President and the Senate, because the President has the nominating \nauthority and the Senate has the constitutional authority for \nconfirmation. There are a great many things that ought to be done on \nboth sides to expedite the nomination and confirmation of judges.\n  In my own State, Pennsylvania has quite a number of vacancies now, \nand I have been in discussions with the President's representatives at \nthe White House about trying to get these nominations filled. There is \nsomething to be said on many sides of this issue. The matter \nconfronting the Senate now is, what are we going to do with Merrick \nGarland? His record is extraordinary. I have been on the Judiciary \nCommittee going into my 17th year and I do not believe I have seen a \nnominee with the qualifications that this man has.\n  He graduated from Harvard College, summa cum laude, was Phi Beta \nKappa, and graduated from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude. He was \non the Harvard Law Review and was the Articles Editor there. He has an \nextraordinary record of publications, on the issue of Antitrust, in the \nYale Law Journal. And I might say, Mr. President, that this nominee \nexhibited perhaps his best judgment in associating himself with Yale \nLaw School on the article, then going on into FTC investigations, the \ncontroversial veto issue, professional responsibility and commercial \nspeech. It is really an extraordinary, extraordinary record. This man, \nat the age of 45, coming into the court of appeals, may well be a \ndistinguished prospect for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Beyond his record in school and his writings, he was law clerk to a \nvery distinguished circuit judge, Judge Harry Jay Friendly, and he \nserved as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, Jr., and \nwas a partner of distinguished law firms, and worked as a prosecuting \nattorney. He now serves as Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the \nUnited States in the U.S. Department of Justice, in the Criminal Law \nDivision, where I have had occasion to work with him on a professional \nbasis. He just is an extraordinary prospect for the court of appeals.\n  He has not been treated very gently in the confirmation process, \nhaving been nominated in September 1995. He passed through the \nJudiciary Committee in the 104th Congress and was kept off the agenda \nby a single hold. That is when a Senator voices an objection without \nstating a reason, or perhaps multiple holds, but I know a single hold \nstood in his way.\n  I compliment the majority leader, Senator Lott, for bringing his \nnomination to the floor at this time so that he may be acted upon, yes \nor no. He really is extraordinary, and I think he has a remarkable \ncareer ahead. I am delighted to offer my voice of strong support for \nhis confirmation.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Utah. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from \nPennsylvania because he was also the decisive Senator who came in and \nmade the quorum at the time we voted Mr. Garland out of committee. \nSometimes we forget those little procedural things we have to do just \nto get here on the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Vermont for making that \ncomment. I had presided over Merrick Garland's confirmation proceedings \nin the 104th Congress. It was hard to find a Senator when I came in \nthat afternoon. I found out Merrick Garland was there and five other \npeople. It was an interesting afternoon. We had a great many \nresponsibilities.\n  I went to law school not too long ago and I know what it is like to \nbe on the law review. They call it the Law Journal at Yale. It is \nremarkable to have the kind of record that Merrick Garland has. Those \nwritings are just extraordinary. It takes long hours and extraordinary \nstudy to turn one of those articles out, and there is a wide array of \nissues that he has written on. He could be making a lot of money. He is \ncurrently in public service and he is prepared to go to the court of \nappeals at the age of 45. We need judges in America with real \nintellectual abilities. We need judges like Holmes and Brandeis and \nCardozo on the courts of the United States. We need them on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. This is a real prospect. We ought to get \nhim up and out.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Merrick \nGarland for the vacancy on the D.C. circuit, and I am concerned that it \nhas taken more than 18 months for the nomination to reach the Senate \nfloor.\n  No one can question Mr. Garland's qualifications and fitness to serve \non the D.C. circuit. He is a respected lawyer, a former Supreme Court \nlaw clerk, a partner at a prestigious law firm, and since 1989, has \nserved with distinction in the Department of Justice under both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations.\n  Support for him is bipartisan. We have received letters of support \nfrom numerous Reagan and Bush Justice Department officials, including \nformer Deputy Attorneys General George Terwilliger and Donald Ayers, \nformer Office of Legal Counsel Chief Charles Cooper and former U.S. \nAttorneys Jay Stephens, Joe Whitley, and Dan Webb. Jay Stephens, who \nwas U.S. attorney when Garland served at that office in the District of \nColumbia, called Garland a person of ``dedication, sound judgment, \nexcellent legal ability, a balanced temperament, and the highest \nethical and professional standards.'' The National District Attorney's \nOffice supports his nomination, calling Garland an excellent lawyer, \nbrilliant scholar, and a man of high integrity.'' There can be no \nserious doubt about his ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge \non the D.C. circuit.\n  Why then, has it taken 18 months to bring this nomination before the \nU.S. Senate? And why is it that no other judicial nominees have been \nbrought before the Senate?\n  In fact, only 17 judges--all for district court appointments--were \nconfirmed during all of 1996. Obviously, that was a Presidential \nelection year. But the slow-down in acting on judicial nominations was \nunprecedented. In 1992, when President Bush was seeking reelection, the \nSenate, under control of the Democratic Party, still confirmed 66 \ndistrict court and appellate court judges.\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\n  Justice delayed is justice denied. Thousands of Americans with \nlegitimate grievances cannot get their day in court, because judicial \nvacancies are not being filled and current Federal judges don't have \nthe time to hear their cases. It's hard to crack down on crime when \nthere are not enough judges to enforce the laws that Congress passes.\n\n  Many of us are concerned about the harsh partisanship that is being \napplied to the judicial nomination process. Republicans in the Senate \nhave organized an ad hoc Republican task force to develop procedures \nfor screening judges. They have rejected a formal role for the American \nBar Association in assessing candidates. Republicans are seeking to \nforce the President to conduct the real debate with them behind closed \ndoors--nominee by nominee--to make sure each person the President names \nmeets an ideological litmus test. In fact, some have suggested a quota \nsystem, in which half of all judicial nominations come from Republicans \nin Congress and half from President Clinton.\n  If the Federal courts were a business, they would be in bankruptcy. \nThere are over 90 vacancies in judgeships today. In his 1996 annual \nreport, Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized Congress failure last year \nto create additional Federal judgeships and called it a shortcoming. \nThe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has requested an \nadditional 20 temporary positions on the courts of appeals and 21 \npermanent and 12 temporary positions in the district courts to address \nthe heavy backlogs that are piling up.\n  In the case of Merrick Garland, some Republicans argue that we do not \nneed to fill either of the two current vacancies in the D.C. circuit, \nbecause the caseload is too light. Many nonpartisan observers regard \nthe D.C. circuit as the second most important court in the United \nStates, after the Supreme Court. There currently is only one senior \njudge to assist the other 10 members of the Court.\n  In terms of both quantity and quality of its caseload, the D.C. \ncircuit ranks among the Nation's busiest. It handles a \ndisproportionately high proportion of cases of national significance \ninvolving intricate legal issues. Complex administrative appeals were \n38 percent of the caseload of the D.C. circuit during fiscal year 1995, \nas compared with only 5.5 percent in other circuits.\n  By contrast, pro se appeals, which are generally the easiest to \nresolve, constituted only 11.8 percent of the D.C. circuit's caseload \nin 1995, by far the lowest percentage of any circuit in the country.\n  Diversity cases, which less often raise complex and time-consuming \nissues, constituted only 13.6 percent of the D.C. circuit's caseload in \n1995, compared with 30 percent in the other circuits. So the charts and \ngraphs that some of our Republican colleagues are using do not tell the \nwhole story.\n  The court's backlog is also growing. In 1984, when the 12th seat was \nadded, the court had a backlog of 1,200 cases. Today, that backlog \nexceeds 2,000 cases, despite a bench that is highly respected for its \nintellect and dedication. As former Republican Senator Charles Mathias \nstated on behalf of the nonpartisan Council for Court Excellence, ``It \nis in the public interest for the D.C. Circuit to have its full \ncomplement of twelve active judges.''\n  It is time to end the excessive partisanship over judicial \nnominations. I hope very much that our action on Merrick Garland is a \nsign that the unacceptable log jam is breaking and that the Senate is \nnow returning to its proper role of advise and consent, not partisan \nobstruction, in the consideration of judicial nominations.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I join with those that are urging the \nSenate's favorable consideration of this extraordinary nominee. This is \nan individual who has been willing to be put forward now for over some \n18 months. He has appeared before the committee and, as has been \npointed out, his record is one of special recognition, a brilliant \nacademic record, a strong commitment to public service. He has served \nunder both Democrats and Republicans. He has been an extraordinary \nsuccess in the private sector, as well.\n  I don't think I have seen, in recent times, the range of different \nsupport that this nominee has for this position. It is breathtaking in \nits scope. And the background of this individual has urged us to move \nforward with this nomination. We are extremely fortunate in the \ndistrict circuit court to be able to have someone of this quality. As \nhas been pointed out, it is a special court, really second in special \nrecognition to the Supreme Court of the United States, in terms of the \ncomplexity of the cases that we require this court to resolve.\n  So, Mr. President, I join with all of those and urge a positive vote \nin favor of this extraordinary nominee. Merrick Garland will be an \noutstanding jurist, as everything in his life has reflected. He has \nbeen an outstanding individual. I remember very clearly the quote of \nSenator Mathias, who was a very prominent, significant member of the \nJudiciary Committee, who took great interest in the quality of justice \nin this country and the quality of individuals. He has joined in urging \nthat we move forward with this nominee and put him on the court, where \nhe will serve this country with great distinction. I join my other \ncolleagues in hoping that the vote for him will be overwhelming. It \ndeserves to be. I think we will all be well served with his continued \ndedication of public service on the court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nMerrick Garland to be judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is \ninteresting today in this debate that many people have spoken and no \none has questioned his integrity nor his ability. He was born in \nChicago, graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude, Harvard Law \nSchool and, as has been said by other speakers, had a distinguished \ncareer both as a lecturer at Harvard Law School and partner in a \nprestigious firm, and then prosecuting cases in the District of \nColumbia during the past few years, served as well in the Department of \nJustice.\n  Despite Mr. Garland's obvious and many qualifications for this job, \nwe must vote on whether he will serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Frankly, we should leap at the opportunity to have him on that \ncourt. But we are not here today to consider the significant \ncontribution Mr. Garland's appointment could have to the D.C. circuit. \nRather, we are focusing on whether the D.C. circuit needs 11 judges \nrather than 10 judges.\n  I submit that this debate is not just about numbers. It is about the \nadministration of justice; the fair, prompt, equitable, and thorough \nadministration of justice is at stake. In all fairness, I must confess \nthat I would rather err on the side of too many judges than too few. I \nwould rather have too many judges doing too thorough and too thoughtful \na job than too few judges rushed and careless in frantic efforts to \nhandle their caseload. No one but the most shortsighted argues that the \nD.C. circuit does not need this 11th judge. Indeed, last year when the \ndebate turned on whether a 12th judge was needed, the Reagan-appointed \nJudge Silberman was often cited in support of the effort to cut that \n12th seat. However, he recently wrote to the Judiciary Committee and \nsaid, ``I still believe we should have 11 active judges.'' So why are \nwe arguing about this 11th seat today?\n  Some argue that D.C. circuit judges handle fewer cases per judge than \nany other circuit. I won't make an analogy to the Supreme Court in the \nnumber of cases that they handle. We know they are cases of great \nmoment, and they should have the time to deliberate them in an \nappropriate manner. But the smaller number of cases per judge is an \ninaccurate way of measuring the work of the D.C. circuit judges. Let me \nsay, at the outset, that we cannot overlook the fact that this circuit, \nmore than most--probably more than any--has many administrative appeals \nto consider. As the Federal appeals court sitting in the Capital, the \nD.C. circuit handles the lion's share of administrative appeals.\n  This chart that was prepared gives an idea of the administrative \nagency appeals filed per judge in all the Federal circuits across the \nUnited States. If you will note, D.C. circuit has 56 appeals filed per \njudge. Most other circuits are in the teens--the eighth circuit, only \n8; the ninth circuit is 37. But it is a significantly different \ncaseload that faces the judges in these circuits.\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\n  For those who are not familiar with these administrative cases, I \nsuggest that you not dismiss them because of the word \n``administrative.'' Let me show you what I mean. This is a file for one \nadministrative law case that a judge must pore through to come to a \ngood conclusion.\n\n  Let me show you another thing. This is a pro se petition from a \nprisoner in jail. There are many of these that are filed across the \ncountry. But consider the gravity and the challenge of this \nadministrative appeal, as opposed to this rather smaller appeal in \nterms of volume. So these judges who serve in this circuit really bear \nan unusually large responsibility in extremely technical cases. Over \nthe last 3 years, for which data is available, 45.3 percent of the \ncases filed in the D.C. circuit were administrative appeals of the size \nand complexity that I have just noted, compared with an average of 5.9 \npercent outside the D.C. circuit.\n  Let me also add here that I could go into detail, but I will not \nbecause I know it is the intent of the Chair to move this matter to a \nvote very quickly. I also want to comment for a moment on the period of \ntime that this very able nominee has waited for confirmation. It is \nunfortunate. In fact, it is sad, and it borders on tragic, that men and \nwomen who are prepared to give their lives to public service, who have \ngone through a withering process of investigation, by the FBI, by the \nJudiciary Committee, by the White House, by the American Bar \nAssociation, and so many others, still must wait over a year, in many \ncases, for their nominations to be considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee and by this Chamber.\n  I will tell you, a few days ago it was my good fortune to speak to a \ngroup of judges at the Supreme Court Building. As I walked through that \nbuilding and saw the busts of great jurists who have served this \ncountry, I wondered how many of them could pass the test that we now \nimpose on nominees today, how many of them would be willing to endure \nthat test and to say that their family, friends, colleagues, and others \nthat their lives will be on hold waiting for some decision from Capitol \nHill. It does a great disservice to this country and to the judiciary \nfor us to create a process that is so demanding that ordinary people \nwould be discouraged from trying.\n  We have, in this case, an extraordinary individual, Merrick Garland, \nwho has waited patiently now for over a year to be considered by this \nJudiciary Committee and by this U.S. Senate.\n  I hope those on the other side will make an effort to overcome the \nproblems that we have seen over the past year. We really have to \naddress the fact that there are so many vacancies on Federal benches \nacross this country--not just in the District of Columbia but almost \n100 nationwide--vacancies that need to be filled so that people will be \ntreated fairly. If those vacancies are not filled with honest and \ncompetent individuals in a timely manner, it is a great disservice to \nthis country.\n  I think we should move and move quickly to approve this nomination of \nMerrick Garland. I hope that his patience will be rewarded today, as it \nshould be. I am certain, based on his background and all that I have \ncome to know of him and my personal meeting with him, that he will make \nan extraordinary contribution.\n  We need the 11th judge in the D.C. circuit to handle this mountain of \nadministrative appeals. How many people will come to us and complain, \n``Oh, the case is in court, and it is going to take forever. What is \ngoing on, Senator? What is going on, Congressman? Why aren't the courts \nmore responsive?'' Part of the problem is that the bench is vacant, the \njudges aren't appointed, and the caseload that has been imposed on \nthese judges is overwhelming.\n  We can take care of one circuit today by the appointment of this fine \nman to fill this seat.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article \nfrom the Legal Times of August 1995 regarding Mr. Garland be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Legal Times, Aug. 7, 1995]\n\n                       Garland: A Centrist Choice\n\n                         (By Eva M. Rodriquez)\n\n       He was schooled at Harvard in administrative law by \n     moderate professor-turned-Justice Stephen Breyer, and took \n     his antitrust training from conservative Philip Areeda.\n       He earned his prosecutorial stripes under Jay Stephens, the \n     hard-charging Republican U.S. attorney in the District and \n     former deputy counsel to President Ronald Reagan. And he cut \n     his teeth in the private sector as a partner at Arnold & \n     Porter, one of the city's wealthiest and most influential \n     firms.\n       At first blush, Merrick Garland may seem like a solid-\n     judicial pick for a Republican president. But according to \n     two administration sources, the 42-year-old top aide to \n     Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick is almost certain to \n     be President Bill Clinton's third nominee to be the \n     prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n       Although Garland has his share of liberal credentials--\n     including a coveted clerkship with retired Supreme Court \n     Justice William Brennan Jr.--he is almost sure to be a much \n     more middle-of-the-road jurist than the man he would replace, \n     former Chief Judge Abner Mikva, who retired from the D.C. \n     Circuit last fall to take the job of White House counsel.\n       News of Garland's near-lock on the nomination has left a \n     smattering of liberals privately grumbling that he is too \n     conservative. But his nonideological approach and his easy \n     rapport with both liberals and conservatives has earned \n     Garland high praise from people on both sides of the aisle.\n       ``I think he is a very talented lawyer,'' says Garland's \n     former boss Stephens, now a partner at the D.C. office of San \n     Francisco's Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro. ``He's bright, \n     energetic, and he has a very balanced demeanor.''\n       Garland's current boss also lauds him. ``He has enormous \n     personal and intellectual integrity, impeccable legal \n     credentials, a breadth of experience in both public and \n     private sectors, and the personality and demeanor that you'd \n     expect in a judge,'' says Gorelick, who acknowledges that she \n     is a strong backer of Garland's but declines to discuss \n     whether he is definitely the administration's nominee. ``He \n     is very thoughtful, is good at listening to all points of \n     view, and makes decisions on the merits.'' Attorney General \n     Janet Reno also thinks highly of Garland, Gorelick says.\n       The widespread praise Garland garnered for his thorough and \n     evenhanded leadership during the critical initial \n     investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing also hasn't hurt \n     his chances for a nomination to the federal bench.\n       A Republican staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     declines to discuss Garland's chances for confirmation, other \n     than to say that the committee has received no opposition in \n     anticipation of a Garland nomination.\n       Garland, a 1977 magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law \n     School who clerked for famed 2nd Circuit Judge Henry Friendly \n     in addition to Brennan, declines comment. Mikva was out of \n     town and could not be reached for comment.\n       Garland's reputation as a nonideological thinker may have \n     helped him win the nomination over Peter Edelman, who last \n     fall was reportedly the White House's top pick for the D.C. \n     Circuit vacancy. Edelman, who is currently counselor to \n     Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, was a \n     favorite of the more liberal ranks in the Democratic Party, \n     but he immediately drew opposition from conservatives--\n     including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, who believed Edelman to be too radical \n     and too activist in his approach to the law. Opposition to \n     Edelman only intensified after the GOP's sweeping victory in \n     last fall's midterm election.\n       Edelman, according to two lawyers involved in the judicial-\n     selections process, is likely to be nominated for one of the \n     two vacancies on the U.S. District Court here. But D.C. Del. \n     Eleanor Holmes Norton, whose judicial nominating commission \n     has forwarded names to Clinton for previous D.C. federal \n     court vacancies, may have candidates of her own. The \n     commission will accept applications for the two vacancies \n     until August 11.\n       The two sources say Clinton is likely to nominate Garland \n     before Congress breaks for the August recess. The two sources \n     also say that the president may decide to submit a package of \n     D.C. nominees, including one for the appeals court vacancy \n     and another for one of the two open seats on the District \n     Court. One trial court vacancy was created in June when Judge \n     Joyce Hens Green took senior status; the other came open when \n     Judge Harold Greene followed suit earlier this month.\n       Others mentioned as possible contenders for a District \n     Court seat include Brooksley Born, a partner at D.C.'s Arnold \n     & Porter who is said to have very strong support among \n     women's groups, and U.S. Attorney Eric Holder, Jr., who is a \n     former D.C. Superior Court judge and at one time was \n     mentioned as a possible appeals court nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. His dramatic showing of the difference between the pro se \nappeals that many courts handle and the complexity of the \nadministrative issues that the District of Columbia Circuit Court of \nAppeals handles is very instructive for us. Everybody talks about \ncaseloads. Some\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\ncases are handled in a matter of minutes. Others take months. They each \ncount for one case. He has demonstrated that in the District of \nColumbia circuit, because of its unique nature, many of them count for \na month.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my good friend from Illinois, the \ndistinguished Senator, has just spoken. I would just observe that more \ngovernment isn't necessarily better government, and, also, in the sense \nof justice more judges do not automatically guarantee better justice.\n  I can remember from my service, being appointed by the Chief Justice \nin 1989, I believe it was, to a 2-year study, the only study we have \never had, of the Federal judiciary that we were looking and projecting \nwhat number of cases were going to have to be filed over the next \ncouple of decades. The only conclusion you could come to, if those \nfigures were accurate--and, so far, they have been proven to be \naccurate--is that you could never appoint enough judges to take care of \nthe problems that we are having with the explosion of cases; that you \nhave to look at a lot of other ways. How do you dispense justice in the \nless-adversarial environment of a courtroom and in the less-costly \nenvironment of the courtroom? For instance, what can you do for \nalternate dispute resolutions? There are a lot of other ways that I as \na nonlawyer am not qualified to speak to. But I can tell you that more \njudges is never going to solve the problem of more cases.\n  Another area we have to do something about is tort reform, as an \nexample of something that we have to do about the number of cases \npiling up.\n  So I just ask my good friend from Illinois to think about those \nthings as well.\n  I want to respond to some of the comments raised by those who feel \nthat the caseload statistics indicate that filling the 11th seat is \nnecessary. In my view, this is not a fair reading of the caseload \nnumbers.\n  I point my colleagues' attention to a Washington Times editorial \nwhich appeared on October 30, 1995. That editorial considered the \nquestion of whether or not the administrative type of cases in the D.C. \ncircuit are really as complicated and so complicated that caseload \nstatistics can be misleading. I would like to quote from that \neditorial.\n\n       Per panel the District of Columbia circuit averages at best \n     half the dispositions of other circuits. To make a perfectly \n     reasonable comparison that takes account of the greater \n     complexity of the cases in the D.C. circuit, then we should \n     be asking, Is each case in the D.C. circuit on average twice \n     as complicated as the average case in the other circuits? \n     That seems unlikely in the extreme.\n\n  It seems to me that this point is exactly correct. Granted, the \ncaseload of the circuit is a little different. I grant that.\n  I agree with the point made in a hearing I held on the District of \nColumbia circuit in my subcommittee. The point is that other circuits--\nthe second circuit in particular--have a large percentage of \ncomplicated cases. In the second circuit, those cases are complex, \ncommercial litigations coming out of New York City. But you do not hear \npeople complaining that the total staffing level of the second circuit \nshould not be determined according to those statistics.\n  So I believe that complexity of cases in the D.C. circuit is \noverstated. It really is a nonargument when the number of agency cases \nhas declined by 23 percent in the last year. Moreover, now the District \nof Columbia circuit has a senior judge. That happens to be a former \nmember of this body, Judge Buckley. Since senior judges must carry at \nleast a one-third caseload, and they typically carry a one-half \ncaseload, it is fair to consider the District of Columbia circuit as \nhaving 10\\1/2\\ judges right now when the ratio says 9\\1/2\\ judges.\n\n  So let's see if what we have works because what we have right now \nwon't cost the taxpayers any more money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased to be able to comment on this judicial vacancy. I \ncertainly respect Senator Grassley and his comments. I agree with him \nvery, very much.\n  I think it is an important point to note that people say that \nadministrative cases are difficult to administer, and that they may \nhave a file that is fairly thick. Well, judges have law clerks. They go \nthrough the files. Even if the file is thick, the issue coming up on an \nadministrative appeal may be very simple and may involve nothing more \nthan a simple interpretation of law. Many of those can be disposed of \nvery easily.\n  Based on my 12 years of experience as a U.S. attorney practicing in \nFederal court in cases involving all kinds of Federal litigation, I \ndon't at all concede the point that every administrative law case is \nsubstantially more difficult than others. As a matter of fact, Judge \nSilberman testified in 1995 that it is true that the administrative law \ncases are generally more complicated, and other judges in other \ncircuits, like the second circuit, will tell you that some of their \ncommercial litigation coming out of the Federal district court is \nterribly complicated, too. I am not in a position to compare the two.\n  Let me just say this from personal experience. I talked earlier today \nabout the testimony of Chief Judge Tjoflat from the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. He said that they have 575 cases per judge, and that \nthey cannot handle any more cases. I was involved in a 7-week trial of \na criminal case that I personally prosecuted. In the course of that \ntrial 18,000 pages of transcript were generated, and when the case was \nheard on appeal, there were 20 or more issues involving 5 or more \ndefendants. Many of these criminal cases are extremely difficult.\n\n  I will also point out that the eleventh circuit includes the southern \ndistrict of Florida which probably has, outside of New York and \nCalifornia, the largest number of complex criminal cases, in particular \ninternational drug smuggling cases, of any circuit in America. Those \ncases are sent to the eleventh circuit and yet they can manage their \ncaseload in this fashion. I think it is a remarkable accomplishment.\n  The fourth circuit, with 378 cases per judge, has the fastest \nturnaround of any circuit in America.\n  We talk about the need to move cases rapidly, and it is argued that \nwe need more judges to move cases rapidly. How is it that the fourth \ncircuit, with 378 cases per judge, has the fastest disposition rate of \nany circuit in America? It is because they are managing their caseload \nwell and because they do not have more judges than are necessary. As \nJudge Tjoflat testified before our committee, too many judges actually \nslows down the process and makes good judging more difficult. I think \nthat is a matter that we should address.\n  I would like to note that we have not delayed this matter. We are \nprepared to have this matter come to a vote. More delays would have \nbeen possible if we had wanted simply to delay this process. I feel it \nis time to vote on this issue. I respect the legal ability of Mr. \nGarland. He was on the Harvard Law Review. It does not bother me if he \nwas editor in chief of the Harvard Law Review. It would not bother me \nif he had been editor in chief of the law review at the University of \nAlabama School of Law. The fact remains that the taxpayers should not \nbe required to pay for a judge we do not need. The taxpayers should not \nhave to pay $1 million per year for a judge that is not needed.\n  Mischief sometimes gets started. I recall the old saying my mother \nused to use: an idle mind is the devil's workshop. We need judges with \nfull caseloads, with plenty of work to do, important work to do.\n  This circuit is showing a serious decline in caseload. In fact, \ncaseload in this circuit declined 15 percent last year. That decline \ncontinues. I think it would be very unwise for us to fill a vacancy if \nthere is any possibility that the caseload will continue to decline. We \ndo not need to fill it now, and we certainly do not need to fill it in \nthe face of this declining caseload, because once it is filled, the \njudge holds that position for life and the taxpayers are\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\nobligated to pay that judge's salary for life. That is an unjust burden \non the taxpayers of America.\n  Fundamentally, this is a question of efficiency and productivity. \nThere are courts in this Nation that are overworked, particularly many \nof the trial courts. We may not have enough money to fill those \nvacancies. Let us take the money from this Washington, DC circuit court \nand use it to fund judges and prosecutors and public defenders in \ncircuits and district courts all over America that are overcrowded and \nare overworked.\n  Those are my comments. We have studied the numbers carefully. We are \nnot here to delay. We are not here in any way to impugn the integrity \nof Mr. Garland. By all accounts, he is a fine person and an able \nlawyer. He does have a very good job with the U.S. Department of \nJustice. We probably need some trial judges here in Washington, DC, and \nif the President nominated him to be one of those trial judges, I would \nbe pleased to support him for that.\n  That will conclude my remarks at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nJudge Silberman dated March 4, 1997, in which he said that the filling \nof the 12th seat would be frivolous and in which he noted the \ncontinuing decline in caseload.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the Director of Governmental Affairs for the Christian Coalition \nwritten in opposition to the filling of this vacancy, noting that it is \nnot warranted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                 District of Columbia Circuit,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: Your asked me yesterday for my view as \n     to whether this court needs 11 active judges and whether I \n     would be willing to communicate that view to other senators \n     of your committee. As I told you, my opinion on this matter \n     has not changed since I testified before Senator Grassley's \n     subcommittee in 1995. I said then, and I still believe, that \n     we should have 11 active judges.\n       On the other hand, I then testified and still believe we do \n     not need and should not have 12 judges. Indeed, given the \n     continued decline in our caseload since I testified, I \n     believe that the case for a 12th judge at any time in the \n     foreseeable future is almost frivolous. As you know, since I \n     testified, Judge Buckley has taken senior status and sits \n     part-time, and I will be eligible to take senior status in \n     only three years. That is why I continue to advocate the \n     elimination of the 12th judgeship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Laurence H. Silberman,\n     U.S. Circuit Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Christian Coalition,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to urge you to vote against \n     confirming judicial candidate Merrick Garland. The workload \n     for the D.C. Circuit does not warrant filling either the 11th \n     or 12th seats on the D.C. Circuit. When one considers that \n     approximately 1 million dollars worth of taxpayer dollars is \n     involved for each judgeship, it is important for the Senate \n     to eliminate unnecessary seats whenever possible. Please vote \n     against confirming Merrick Garland. Thank you for your \n     consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brian Lopina,\n                            Director, Governmental Affairs Office.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to hear that nobody wants to \ndelay Merrick Garland. I would only point out that his nomination first \ncame before us in 1995, and he was voted out of committee, I believe \nunanimously, by Republicans and Democrats alike, in 1995. We are going \nto vote, I hope, very soon to confirm him. But if that is not delay, I \nwould hate like heck to see what delay would be around here. He was \nnominated in 1995, got through the committee in 1995 and will finally \nget confirmed in 1997.\n  I understand other members say they would be perfectly willing to \nhelp out on the district court; we need help. We have Judge Colleen \nKillar-Kotelly who is still waiting, nominated very early in 1996, has \nyet to come through, even though in 1996 alone the criminal case \nbacklog increased by 37 percent. We talk about getting tough on \ncriminals. We certainly will not send the judges that might do it.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief statement to \nexplain my vote that I will cast later on today. I know we are having \ninteresting discussion, and this is one that has been a long time \ncoming, getting this judgeship to the floor of the Senate for a vote.\n  Obviously, there has been support for this nominee by Senator Hatch \nand by Senator Specter and others. Senator Leahy has been pushing to \nget these judges voted on. This is the first one of the year. I presume \nthis is a celebratory event.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is showing, if my friend from Mississippi will yield, \nremarkable speed. As I said, he was nominated in 1995, first got \nthrough the committee unanimously, Republicans and Democrats, in 1995. \nWe are now just before our second vacation of the year in 1997. I am \nglad, whenever it is, to get him through.\n  Mr. LOTT. But now maybe I can comment just briefly on why it has \ntaken so long. There were a lot of factors involved. I will vote not to \nconfirm Merrick Garland to be a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge. I \nhave no opposition to Mr. Garland himself. I think he is qualified. I \nthink he has experience that would be helpful. And I think his \ndisposition is acceptable, too.\n  In fact, based on all the reports that I have heard about him, I \nthink he more than likely would be a much more acceptable nominee to \nthis court as compared to many of the other nominees we have considered \nor may be considering in the future.\n  It is my belief that this court of appeals is more than adequately \nstaffed based on the number of cases pending on the court's docket, the \nfilings per judge at this court as it is currently staffed for the year \nending September, 1996, with the trend of such filings over the last \nseveral years, and in comparison to other workloads of circuit courts \nof appeal around the country. It is very small. I think as compared to \nothers certainly they have more judges than they need.\n  I am looking at this chart over here. The District of Columbia Court \nof Appeals is at the bottom end of the caseload, and yet you have other \ncircuit courts across the country--my own circuit, the fifth, is about \nin the middle. The eleventh circuit obviously has a high caseload as \ncompared to this particular court.\n  So I really do not think this confirmation is needed. Even if it does \nget through, I want to say right now that regardless of the next \nnominee, unless this caseload is dramatically turned around, I hope it \nwould never even be considered regardless of how qualified the nominee \nmay be, he or she, in a Democratic administration.\n  I recognize that some circuits do have tremendous caseloads, but this \nis certainly not the case in this circuit, and therefore I will vote \nagainst the nomination based on that. In fact, I just do not think an \nadditional judge is needed in this district court of appeals.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of the filings \nper judge in 1996 and the total appeals docket in 1995 per judge that \nshows as compared to other circuits this judge is not needed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Appeals filed per judge in 1996:\n\n     D.C. Cir., 123\n     10th Cir., 216\n     1st Cir., 227\n     3rd Cir., 280\n     7th Cir., 295\n     8th Cir., 307\n     6th Cir., 341\n     9th Cir., 360\n     2nd Cir., 372\n     4th Cir., 378\n     5th Cir., 443\n     11th Cir., 575\n\n       Total appeals on docket for year ending 1995/per judge:\n\n     1st Cir., 1339 (4 judges=335)\n     2nd Cir., 3987 (12 judges=332)\n     3rd Cir., 3485 (13 judges=268)\n     4th Cir., 3542 (12 judges=295)\n     5th Cir., 5696 (15 judges=380)\n     6th Cir., 3343 (13 judges=257)\n     7th Cir., 2200 (8 judges=275)\n     8th Cir., 3176 (10 judges=318)\n     9th Cir., ?\n     10th Cir., 2104 (8 judges=263)\n     11th Cir., 6057 (10 judges=606)\n     D.C. Cir., 2065 (10 judges=206)\n\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself such time from the opposition time as is \nnecessary for me to make a statement.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak, not in opposition to Merrick \nGarland for filling the seat on the U.S. court of appeals, but in \nopposition to filling the seat at all. The U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit is a judicial circuit which has the \nlowest caseload of any of the judicial circuits in the country, and I \nthink this is a time when we ought to ask ourselves some serious \nquestions about whether or not we intend to staff circuits in spite of \nthe fact that there are adequate judges in the circuits to handle the \ncaseload which is currently required of the circuit.\n  First, the amount of judicial work in the circuit raises questions \nabout the necessity of confirming another appellate judge for the D.C. \ncircuit. It appears that filling this vacancy would be an inefficient \nuse of judicial resources. Before filling any vacancy for an appellate \njudgeship, the U.S. Senate should look at the filings per judgeship \ncompared with other jurisdictions. Of the 12 courts of appeals, the \nD.C. circuit has the lowest filings per judge of any of the 12 courts \nof appeals. While the D.C. circuit has had only 123 cases filed per \njudge, the eighth circuit, the circuit in which I live, handled nearly \nthree times the D.C. circuit's total of appeal filings, with 307 \nappeals filed per judge. The eleventh circuit court of appeals, in \ncomparison, had 575 appeals filed per judge.\n  The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals now has two open seats. But Judge \nJames Buckley, who took senior status last year, which means he is \nstill obligated to handle a caseload equivalent to that of an average \njudge in active service who would handle a 3-month caseload, is still \nthere. So you have a senior status judge who is handling the equivalent \nof a quarter of the load that a normal judge in the circuit would \nhandle. So you do not have the loss completely of the second judge in \nthose two vacancies; you have the loss of one judge, and then you have \none-quarter judge in the senior status making up for any slack.\n  Still, the D.C. circuit is the least populated with work. And it is \nthe circuit that does not merit additional judges to conduct the work \nwhich simply is not there. If we were to use the formula expressed by \nthe Judicial Conference, between 1986 and 1994 the D.C. circuit court \nwould rate just in the order of nine judges to handle its current \ncaseload. So, in terms of the Judicial Conference's own assessment of \nhow many judges would be needed, the caseload of the D.C. circuit would \nrate nine judges. It has 10 judges now, and if you start to add the \nadditional caseload that can be handled by senior judges, it seems to \nme that adds an additional capacity of that court to handle work for \nwhich it is already overstaffed.\n  While appeals filings for all of the Nation's U.S. courts of appeals \nincreased to an all-time high of 4 percent, the number of filings filed \nin the D.C. circuit actually dropped last year; it dropped 15 percent. \nSo you have an increase of appeals in the system generally of 4 \npercent, you have a decline in the D.C. circuit of 15 percent, of the \n12 additional circuits, the District of Colombia had the largest \ndecline in appeals last year.\n  Mr. President, ending the era of big Government includes all three \nbranches of government. But if we cannot end big government where we \nhave had declining demand for services, and where we are already \noverstaffed, where can we end big government? To believe that the \njudicial branch should be excluded from the exercise of responsibility \nor should be overstaffed or should ignore the trends in terms of case \nfilings and should be overpopulated with individuals because there are \nslots available, in spite of the fact that the work or the caseload is \nnot there to justify those slots, would be for us to deny a responsible \nposition in this matter.\n\n  Let me just indicate that there are two vacancies and virtually \neveryone will confess that at least one of them should not be filled. \nThis is not a matter of saying some people think all the vacancies \nought to be filled; others think that neither of the two should be \nfilled. There is a general consensus that filling the second of the two \nwould certainly be a waste and surplus. I think if you look carefully \nand you measure the caseload by what the Judicial Conference had \npreviously stated was an appropriate caseload, and you look at the \npotential for work by the senior active judges who have taken senior \nstatus, you can come but to one conclusion, that it is not an \nappropriate deployment of the tax dollars of the citizens of this great \nNation to add a judge to a court where the workload does not justify \nit.\n  Good government is not to fill a vacancy simply because it exists. To \nfill this vacancy without taking into account the lack of caseload is \nfiscally irresponsible.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to address the argument that \nthe D.C. court of appeals might be considered to be a different court, \nunique, one of a kind, because it has a lot of cases that are \nadministrative in nature and they have a certain level of complexity. I \nthink in this regard it is important to cite Judge Silberman, who sits \non the D.C. court of appeals. On this point, in 1995, he testified as \nfollows:\n\n       It is true that the administrative law cases are generally \n     more complicated. But other judges in other circuits, like \n     the second circuit, will tell you that some of their \n     commercial litigation coming out of the Federal District \n     Court is terribly complicated, too. The truth of the matter \n     is, some of the administrative law cases in the D.C. circuit \n     are complicated. But if you look at the second circuit, the \n     caseload of which is more than twice as much as the D.C. \n     circuit, in the second circuit their caseload is complicated \n     as well.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, it is time for the U.S. Senate, which \ncalled the circuit courts into creation, which called district courts \ninto creation, to begin to exercise a responsible approach toward \nstaffing those courts and not to staff them when the workload does not \njustify it. Even if the nature of the cases coming before the D.C. \ncircuit is unique, those cases are not so difficult, or different from \nthe other cases which have their own uniqueness and have their own \ndifficulty, whether they be commercial instead of administrative, so as \nto mean that we should populate the court with staffing which is not \nrequired by the caseload.\n  Mr. President, I plan to vote against Mr. Garland, not for any reason \nto impair his standing or his credentials. I do not think this is a \nquestion about the qualifications of the judge. But it is a question \nabout the deployment of the public's resource and about the staffing \nlevel for courts which do not have caseload to justify it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion, just \nnow again, quoting Judge Silberman. What is needed--I would note, he \nwrote to the distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, and said that we \nshould have 11 active judges. We talk about this as though the nominee \nwas going to be the 12th judge. In fact, the nominee is the 11th judge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 4, 1997, by Judge \nSilberman, in which he said, ``. . . I still believe that we should \nhave 11 active judges,'' be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                 District of Columbia Circuit,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: You asked me yesterday for my view as \n     to whether this court needs 11 active judges and whether I \n     would be willing to communicate that view to other senators \n     of your committee. As I told you, my opinion on this matter \n     has not changed since I testified before Senator Grassley's \n     subcommittee in 1995. I said then, and I still believe, that \n     we should have 11 active judges.\n       On the other hand, I then testified and still believe we do \n     not need and should not have 12 judges. Indeed, given the \n     continued decline in our caseload since I testified, I \n     believe that the case for a 12th judge at any time in the \n     foreseeable future is almost frivolous. As you know, since I \n     testified, Judge Buckley has taken senior status and sits \n     part-time, and I will be eligible to take senior status in \n     only three years. That is why I\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\n     continue to advocate the elimination of the 12th judgeship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Laurence H. Silberman,\n                                               U.S. Circuit Judge.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been sitting here listening to this. \nIn all honesty, I would like to see one person come to this floor and \nsay one reason why Merrick Garland does not deserve this position. It \nhas been almost a year. In the last Congress, I must have gone on this \nissue, trying to get him up, for most of that time.\n  First, there was the 12th seat, he was going to get that. Then, when \nBuckley retired, everybody that I know of, who knows anything about it, \nother than some of our outside groups who do not seem to want any \njudges, said that we need the 11th seat.\n  As I suspected, nobody in this body is willing to challenge the merit \nof Merrick Garland's nomination. I have not heard one challenge to him \nyet. In fact, they openly concede that Mr. Garland is highly qualified \nto be an appellate judge. Rather, they use arguments that the D.C. \ncircuit does not need 12 judges in order to oppose the confirmation of \nMr. Garland for the 11th seat on this court.\n  There is not a harder-nosed conservative or more decent conservative \nthat I know than Larry Silberman. I talked to him personally. If he \nsaid to me they did not need the 10th seat, I could understand this \nargument, and I could understand this minirebellion that is occurring. \nBut he said they needed the 11th seat. If he had said, ``All we need \nare 10 seats, we don't need the 11th or 12th,'' I would have been on \nhis side, and it would not be because of partisan politics, it would be \nbecause I trust him and I believe in his integrity. But I called him \npersonally and he said, ``Yes, we do need the 11th seat.''\n  My colleague from Alabama circulated a letter saying confirming \nMerrick Garland would be a ``ripoff'' of the taxpayers. Having just led \nthe fight for the balanced budget amendment, I do not think that is \nquite fair. I am never going to rip off the taxpayers. But I will tell \nyou one thing, playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am sick of \nit, and, frankly, we are going to see what happens around here. A \n``ripoff?'' Let's be serious about this, folks. This is a serious \nmatter.\n  My colleague referred to the testimony of Chief Judge Wilkinson of \nthe fourth circuit. That is a different matter. I have challenged the \ndistinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts to look into that, \nand I am going to be heavily guided by what Senator Grassley comes up \nwith.\n  The statements of Judge Tjoflat from the eleventh circuit has also \nbeen mentioned. But what do the judges on the D.C. circuit court say? \nIt is one thing for Wilkinson to get up and make a comment, it is \nanother thing for Tjoflat, who has problems in that circuit, but what \ndo the judges on the D.C. circuit say? Both Chief Judge Edwards and \nJudge Silberman, a respected conservative, agree that, in Judge \nSilberman's words ``it would be a mistake, a serious mistake for \nCongress to reduce the D.C. circuit down below 11 judges.''\n  If I did not believe that, I would not have brought this judgeship \nnomination to the floor. I have to tell you, if anybody doubts my \nintegrity, I want to see them afterwards.\n  As for the statistics that have been cited, with all due respect, \nthey are not a fair or accurate characterization of the D.C. circuit's \ncaseload relative to the other circuits' caseloads. I made that case \nearlier.\n  I am prepared to yield back the time if the other side is prepared to \nyield back their time. Is there anybody going to want to speak on the \nother side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has no time to yield \nback at this point. The Senator from Iowa has approximately 17 minutes \nremaining on the opposition side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is nobody in this body who has \nfought harder for a balanced budget amendment and for controlling \nFederal spending than the distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator \nHatch. His leadership has been terrific on that. I respect that. I \nguess we just have a disagreement.\n  I think it is really unusual that a judge would cite a 12th seat as \nfrivolous and note in his own letter that it was frivolous because of a \ndeclining caseload. Even though Judge Silberman himself said he felt \nthey ought to go ahead and fill the 11th seat, we, after full study of \nit and in the course of careful deliberations, had the opportunity to \nhear from two other chief judges from two other circuits that \nindicated, even though they have much higher caseloads, 575 to 378 \ncases per judge, that they did not need a new circuit judgeship.\n\n  So, therefore, I concluded that a circuit with 124 cases per \njudgeship did not need to be filled, and that the $1 million per year, \nif it is not justified, would be a ripoff of the taxpayers. I feel that \nwe can spend that money more efficiently on trial judges in circuits \nand districts that are already overwhelmed with heavy caseloads and not \non the D.C. circuit that is overstaffed already. I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We yield back the time on our side, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Merrick B. Garland, of Maryland, to be \nU.S. circuit judge for the District of Columbia circuit? On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this is the first judge confirmed in this \nCongress. I hope it will be the first of many, many.\n  I remind my colleagues we have close to 100 vacancies in the Federal \ncourt. We have begun with one of the most outstanding nominations any \nPresident has sent.\n  That is the nomination of Merrick Garland--now Judge Garland. I \ncompliment him on that. He was nominated in 1995; it first passed \nthrough the Judiciary Committee unanimously in 1995, and it is now \n1997. We need to move----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Senate is not in order.\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator is \nentitled to be heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Chair. I wish also to \ncompliment my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah for \nhis help in doing this. I also wish to compliment Senators who paid \nattention to his very, very strong statement at the end of this debate \non behalf of Judge Garland. I think that the Senator from Utah and I \nare committed to trying to move, in a bipartisan fashion, to get these \njudges here. I hope all Senators will join us in doing that. The \nFederal judiciary should not be held hostage to partisan, petty, or \nideological constraints that really reflect only a minority of views.\n  The Federal judiciary is really a blessing in our democracy in the \nfact that it is so independent. Our Federal judiciary is the envy of \nall the rest of the world. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I \nare committed to keeping it that way. We will work together to keep it \nthat way. I thank him for his help on this nomination.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to reiterate what Pat Leahy \nhas said about how glad we are that Merrick Garland has finally been \nconsidered by the Senate for appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit. We wholeheartedly believe that \nMr. Garland is highly qualified for this position and deserves the \nstrong vote we just gave him.\n  Mr. Garland has been awaiting this day since being nominated by the \nPresident on September 5, 1995--1\\1/2\\ years ago. His qualifications \nare clear. The ABA's standing committee on the Federal judiciary found \nhim well qualified to serve on the Federal bench, and he has received \nthe support of a bipartisan and ideologically diverse group of \nindividuals.\n  His credentials cannot be challenged. He has worked at the Department \nof Justice as the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, in \nprivate practice and served as a law clerk to Justice Brennan on the \nSupreme Court and a law clerk to Judge Friendly on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit.\n  I am happy that today, after his long wait, Merrick Garland finally \nknows that he will serve as a Federal judge.\n  It is unfortunate, however, that we have not yet voted on any other \njudges during this session of Congress--at a time when we have almost \n100 vacancies on the Federal bench. That is a vacancy rate of over 10 \npercent.\n  I hope that voting on Merrick Garland's confirmation today signals \nthat we are going to address this serious problem and begin to fill \nthose long empty seats on the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has confirmed \nthe nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. Let us ensure that our Federal bench has \na full complement of such qualified judges so that the business of \njustice can go forward.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues who voted \nfor Judge Merrick Garland. I believe they did what was right.\n  With regard to Federal judgeships, we ought to do what is right. I \ntake this job as seriously as anything I have ever done in the Senate. \nI want to thank my colleagues who voted with us for supporting the \nnominee.\n  Having said that, there have been a serious number of nominees whom \nwe have confirmed in the past who have proven to be activist judges \nonce they got on the bench and who told us when they were before the \ncommittee they would not be activist and they would not undermine the \nrole of the judiciary by legislating from the bench. Then they get to \nthe bench and they start legislating from the bench.\n  I want them to know, and I want to send a warning to the judiciary \nright now, if they are going to continue to disregard the law, if they \nare going to continue, in many respects, to bypass the democratic \nprocesses of this country, if they are going to start substituting \ntheir own policy preferences for what the law really says, then it is \ngoing to be a tough time around here. This vote proves it.\n  I don't feel good about all those who voted against this nomination, \nbut the fact of the matter is that there is some reason for their doing \nso. Republicans are fed up with these judges who disregard the role of \njudging once they get to the courts, after having told us and promised \nthat they will abide by the role of judging. Now, I am upset--there is \nno question about that--because I think the finest nominee that I have \nseen from this administration is Merrick Garland, and I think he \ndeserved better. But I also understand my colleagues.\n  I am sending a warning out right now that these judges who are \nsitting on the bench better start thinking about the role of judging \nand quit trying to do our jobs. We have to stand for reelection. That \nis why the buck should stop here--not with some Federal judge who is \ndoing what he or she thinks is better for humanity and mankind.\n  We have judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals who could care \nless about what the Congress says, or what the President says, or what \nthe legislative and executive branches say. That is why they are \nreversed so routinely by the Supreme Court. It is pathetic. I don't \nmean to single them out, but it is the most glaring example of activist \njudges in this country.\n  Let me just say this. I am sending a message right now that I intend \nto move forward with judges, and, if this administration will send \ndecent people up here who will abide by the rule of judging and the \nrule of law and quit substituting their own policy preferences and \nfinding excuses for every criminal that comes before them, they are \ngoing to have support from me. I hope they will have more support from \nthe Judiciary Committee in the future. But if they are going to send up \nmore activists, there is going to be war.\n  I don't think the judiciary has ever had a better friend than Orrin \nHatch; I know they haven't. I will fight for them. I think they ought \nto be getting more pay. I think we ought to support them in every way \nwe possibly can. They are tough jobs, they are cloistered jobs. They \nare difficult jobs. They take great intellectual acumen and ability.\n  Madam President, I am telling you, we have far too many judges on \nboth the left and the right who disregard what the rule of judging is \nand who legislate from the bench as superlegislators in black robes who \ndisregard the democratic processes in this country and who do whatever \nthey feel like doing. They are undermining the judiciary, and they are \nputting the judiciary in this country in jeopardy. I am darn sick of \nit. My colleagues on our side are sick of it. I don't care whether it \nis activism from the right or from the left; it is wrong. We ought to \nstop it, and the judiciary is the only place where it can be stopped.\n\n  I once had one of the most eminent legal thinkers in the country say \nthat he has never seen anybody on the Supreme Court move to the right; \nthey have always moved to the left as they have grown. I would like to \nnot worry about whether they are moving right or left, but whether they \nare doing the job that judges should do.\n  I am serving notice to the Senate, too. I am chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and I take this responsibility seriously. I want \neverybody in this body to know I take it seriously. It means a lot to \nme. I have tried a lot of cases in Federal courts. I have tried a lot \nof cases in State courts. I have a lot of respect for the judiciary. So \nI take this seriously, and I don't want politics ever to be played with \nit. I get a little tired of the other side bleating about politics, \nafter the years and years of their mistreatment of Reagan and Bush \njudges and the glaring, inexcusable examples where they treated \nRepublican nominees in a shamefully unfair way. Nobody could ever \nforget the Rehnquist nomination, the Bork nomination, and even the \nSouter nomination, where he wasn't treated quite as well as he should \nhave been--and above all, the Clarence Thomas nomination; it was \nabysmal. Those were low points in Senate history. So I don't think \neither side has a right to start bleating about who is righteous on \njudges.\n  I intend to do the best I can here. I want my colleagues to know \nthat. I certainly want to place my colleagues on my side, and I \ncertainly want to do\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\nthe right thing for all concerned. This is an important nomination. I \nbelieve Merrick Garland will go on to distinction. Nobody will be more \ndisappointed than I if he turns out to be an activist judge in the end. \nIf he does, I think he will be one of the principal underminers in the \nFederal judiciary in the history of this country. But he told me he \nwill not do that, and I trust that he will not. That doesn't mean we \nhave to agree on every case that comes before any of these courts; we \nare going to have disagreements. And just because you disagree with one \njudge doesn't mean that judge should be impeached either. To throw \naround the issue of impeachment because you disagree with a judge here \nand there is wrong.\n  There are some lame-brained decisions out there, we all know that. \nSome of them are occurring primarily in California. Frankly, we have to \nget rid of the politics with regard to judges and start doing what's \nright. With every fiber of my body, I am going to try to do right with \nrespect to judges because I respect that branch so much. To me, our \nfreedoms would not have been preserved without that branch. But the way \nsome of these judges are acting, our freedoms are being eroded by some \nin that branch. It is time for them to wake up and realize that that \nhas to end.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2515-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2538-S2541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I have not spoken on judges this year, \nbut having worked on it for so many years with my friend from Utah, \nhaving either been the ranking member or chairman of that committee. \nBut let me make one point.\n  It is one thing to say that we are going to disagree on judges. We \ndid that when we were in control. We did that. And we said that all the \njudges that have been nominated here by two successive Republican \nPresidents--we picked seven out of a total of over 500--we said we \ndisagree with these judges. The most celebrated case was Judge Bork, \nand less celebrated cases were people who have gone beyond being \njudges. Some are Senators. But the bottom line was that we understand \nthat.\n  But what I do not understand is this notion and all of the talk about \nactivist judges without any identification of who the activist judges \nare. It is one thing for the Republicans to say that we are not going \nto vote for or allow activist judges. We understand that. We are big \nfolks. We understand baseball, hardball. We got that part. No problem.\n  But what I do not understand is saying we are not going to allow \nactivist judges and then not identifying who those activist judges are. \nThis is kind of what is going on here, and no one wants to say it. But \nsince I have the reputation of saying what no one wants to say, I am \ngoing to say it.\n  Part of what is going on here is, and in the Republican caucus there \nare some who say, No. We want to change the rules. We want to make \nsure, of all the people nominated for the Federal bench, that the \nRepublican Senators should be able to nominate half of them, or 40 \npercent of them, or 30 percent of them. That is malarkey. That is flat-\nout malarkey. That is blackmail. That has nothing to do with activist \njudges.\n  I do not doubt the sincerity of my friend from Utah. We have worked \ntogether for 22 years. But here is my challenge. Any judge nominated by \nthe President of the United States, if you have a problem with his or \nher activism, name it. Tell us what it is. Define it like we did. You \ndisagreed. You disagreed with the definition. But we said straight up, \n``Bang. I do not want Bork for the following reasons.'' People \nunderstand that. But do not try to change 200 years of precedent and \ntell us that we are not letting judges up because we want the \nRepublican Senator to be able to name the judge. Don't do that, or else \ndo it and do it in the open. Let's have a little bit of legislating in \nthe sunshine here. Do it flat in the open.\n  I see my colleagues nodding and smiling. I am sort of breaching the \nunspoken rule here not to talk about what is really happening. But that \nis what is really happening. I will not name certain Senators. But I \nhave had Senators come up to me and say, Joe, here is the deal. We will \nlet the following judges through in my State if you agree to get the \nPresident to say that I get to name three of them. Now folks, that is a \nchange of a deal. That is changing precedent. That isn't how it works. \nThe President nominates. We dispose one way or another of that \nnomination. And the historical practice has been--and while I was \nchairman we never once did that--that never once that I am aware of did \nwe ever say, ``By the way, we are not letting Judge A through unless \nyou give me Judges B and C.''\n  Now, let me set the record totally straight here. There are States \nwhere precedents were set years ago. The Republican and Democratic \nSenator, when it was a split delegation, have made a deal up front in \nthe open. In New York, Senator Javits and Senator Moynihan said: Look. \nIn the State of New York, the way we are going to do this is that \nwhomever is the Senator representing the party of the President--I \nbelieve they broke it down to 60--for every two people that Senator \ngets to name, the Senator in the party other than the President gets to \nname one. OK, fine. Jacob Javits did not go to Pat Moynihan and demand \nthat he was going to do that. Moynihan made the offer, as I understand \nit, to Jacob Javits. That is not a bad way to proceed.\n  But now to come along and say, ``By the way, in the name of activist \njudges, we are not going to move judges'' is not what this is about.\n  I might point out that all the talk last election that started off--\nit all fizzled because it did not go anywhere--about how there is going \nto be an issue about activism on the courts, we pointed out that of all \nthe judges that came up in Clinton's first term, almost all of them \nwere voted unanimously out of this body by Democrats and Republicans, \nincluding the former majority leader. He only voted against three of \nall the nominees, then he argued, by the way, that Clinton nominated \ntoo many activist judges. And then it kind of fizzled when I held a \nlittle press conference, and said, ``By the way. You voted for all of \nthem.'' It kind of made it hard to make this case that they were so \nactivist.\n  So look. Let me say that I will not take any more time, but I will \ncome back to the floor with all of the numbers and the details. But \nhere is the deal.\n  If the Republican majority in the Senate says, ``Look, the following \n2, 5, 10, 12, 20 judges are activist for the following reasons, and we \nare against them,'' we understand that. We will fight it. If we \ndisagree, we will fight it. But if they come along and say, ``We are \njust not letting these judges come up because really what is happening \nis they are coming to guys like me and saying, `Hey, I will make you a \ndeal. You give me 50 percent of judges, and I will let these other \njudges go through.' '' Then that isn't part of the deal.\n  Look, I have a message to the Court. I know the Court never reads the \nCongressional Record, and Justice Scalia said that we should not \nconsider the Record for legislative history because everybody knows \nthat all the Congressional Record is is what Senators' staff say and \nnot what Senators know. He is wrong. But that is what he said. Maybe \nthey don't read it. But I want to send a message.\n  Madam President, when I was chairman of the committee and there was a \nRepublican President named Reagan and a Republican President named \nBush, the Judicial Conference on a monthly basis would write to me and \nsay, ``Why aren't you passing more judges?'' They have been strangely \nsilent about the vacancies that exist. Now, I agree that the \nadministration has been slow in pulling the trigger here. They have not \nsent enough nominees up in a timely fashion. And I have been critical \nof them for the last 2 years, Madam President. But that is not the case \nnow. All I am saying to you is, as they say in parts of my State, ``I \nsmell a rat here.'' What I think is happening--and I hope I am wrong--\nis that this is not about activism.\n  This is about trying to keep the President of the United States of \nAmerica from being able to appoint judges, particularly as it relates \nto the courts of appeals.\n  Now, what is happening is what happened today. Merrick Garland was\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\naround for years. Now, what is going to happen is they are going to say \nwe reported out a circuit court of appeals judge. Aren't we doing \nsomething. The truth of the matter is the proof will be in the pudding \nseveral months from now when we find out whether or not we are really \ngoing to move on these judges.\n  Let me point out one other thing. And I see my friend from Maryland \nin the Chamber, and I will yield particularly since I had not intended \nspeaking at this moment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to ask the Senator a couple questions when he \nfinishes his statement.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The point I wish to make is this. When I was chairman of \nthe committee and a Republican was President, we held, on average, a \nhearing for judges once every 2 weeks and had usually five judges, \ncircuit court and district court, who we heard.\n  Last year we essentially had one hearing every other month and we had \nto fight to get three to four on the agenda to be heard.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This is a chart that Senator Leahy, now the ranking \nmember on the Judiciary Committee, used today in the course of the \nMerrick Garland debate which I think is enormously instructive. It is \nthe number of judges confirmed during second Senate sessions in \nPresidential election years.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I got it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now, in 1996, with a Democratic President, President \nClinton, and a Republican Senate, the Senate confirmed no judges for \nthe court of appeals, none whatsoever, and 17 judges for the district \ncourt. Now, in 1992, the previous election year--that was when Mr. Bush \nwas President----\n  Mr. BIDEN. And I was chairman.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And if I am not mistaken, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware was the very able chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I did not say ``able.'' I was chairman.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am suggesting the Senator is able. I am prepared to \nmake that statement. We confirmed 11 court of appeals judges and 55--I \nrepeat, 55--district judges in an election year. Now, that gives you \nsome sense of how the Democratic majority in the Senate, led at the \ntime by the able Judiciary Committee chairman, was dealing with this \nmatter, essentially in a nonpolitical way.\n  In 1988, when I think, again, the Senator from Delaware was still the \nchairman of the Committee----\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. With President Reagan, a Republican President--again, \nin an election year--we confirmed 7 court of appeals judges and 35 \ndistrict court judges. Actually, the 35 that we confirmed in that \nelection year was better than the Republican Senate did for President \nReagan in 1984 when they only confirmed 33 judges. In any event, \nclearly this performance in these years is in marked contrast to what \nhappened in 1996 and what apparently is continuing now in 1997. Merrick \nGarland was the first judge approved this year.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I may respond to the Senator, obviously the facts are \ncorrect, but I think it worth elaborating a little bit more on the \nfacts. I saw my very able colleague, the present chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, on television the other day, and he was talking \nabout the number of judges that were ``left hanging,'' who were not \nconfirmed and sent back to the administration at the end of 1992, the \nBush administration. And he cited an accurate number. But as my very \ndistinguished friend, who is, as well, a scholar, knows, there is an \nold expression attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, who said there are \nthree kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics.\n  What my able friend from Utah did not mention is that just like \nPresident Carter--Carter's judges is a separate charge we can go back \nto, but just like President Clinton, President Bush did not get his \nnominees up here until the end of the process.\n  In other words, they were late getting here. Notwithstanding the fact \nthat he was late in getting his nominees up, the Senator may remember \nin the caucus over the objection of some Democrats who said the \nRepublicans would never do this, I insisted we confirm judges up to the \nday we adjourned the Senate. During the last week the Senate was in \nthat year, we confirmed seven judges. I could have easily just sneezed \nand they would not have been confirmed. And the fact is the reason why \nwe did not confirm more is because we did not have time to hold the \nhearings and we were holding hearings on 20 or more a month.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I can recall the Senator was \nholding hearings right up into the fall of the election year and judges \nwere being brought to the floor of the Senate and being confirmed. And \nhe is absolutely correct; there were some----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Republican judges.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, Republican judges. And there were some Members on \nthe Democratic side who said, why are you doing this? We are about to \nhave an election and the result may give us control of the White House. \nAnd the Senator from Delaware said, look, we ought not to have politics \nplay a heavy hand in the judicial confirmation process.\n  One of the worst things that is happening in the Senate is what \namounts to a heavy politicizing of the judicial confirmation process \nthat is taking place in this body, and that was reflected in the \nperformance in 1996 as compared with the performance in 1992 when the \nSenator from Delaware did his very best to keep politics out of the \nprocess, to fill judicial posts and to let the judiciary function as an \nindependent branch of our Government. What is happening here is \nextremely serious. And of course, the Senator, with his candor, came to \nthe floor and sort of stripped away the veneer and laid out what is \ngoing on behind the scenes, which is a complete departure from past \npractices. When there were Republican Presidents, I did not play a role \nin whom the Presidents sent up to the Senate to be nominated and \nconfirmed in the job----\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I was chairman or ranking \nmember of that committee for 14 years. My distinguished colleague from \nDelaware is Senator Roth, who is my close friend. Every single Federal \njudge in the last 24 years who has been appointed in the district of \nDelaware or the third circuit has been appointed by Senator Roth. I did \nnot expect, did not ask, and not once was ever consulted about who he \nwould appoint, and I supported every one that he sent up. Not one \nsingle time was I made aware of anything other than after the fact, \nwhich is OK. I am not complaining about that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That was the system.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That was the system. Not one single time. And I was \nchairman of the committee.\n  Now, I would point out one other thing to my friend. I want to have \ncomplete candor. If one considers taking judges based on their ideology \nand call that political, yes, we Democrats were political, as well. I \nam not complaining about that. I am not complaining about anybody who \nstands up and says I do not want Judge Smith, the President's nominee, \nbecause I think he will be bad on the court for the following reasons \nand comes to the floor and makes the case. I do not quarrel with that \nbecause I think that is the prerogative of the Senate and any Senator. \nWhat I am quarreling with is a different kind of politicizing, and that \nis drawing the conclusion that because I now control the Senate, I am \nnot going to let the President of the United States have nominees \nwhether or not I have an ideological problem with them.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield. It is worse than that. It is \nnot whether you let the President have his nominees confirmed. You will \nnot even let them be considered by the Senate for an up-or-down vote. \nThat is the problem today. In other words, the other side will not let \nthe process work so these nominees can come before the Senate for \njudgment. Some may come before the Senate for judgment and be rejected \nby the Senate. That is OK.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Fair enough.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But at least let the process work so the nominees have \nan opportunity and the judiciary has an opportunity to have these \nvacant positions filled so the court system does not begin to break \ndown because of the failure to confirm new judges.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, let me give an example of what \nyou just said. I know you know, but it is important for the Record.\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n  I meet every year--I will not now because I am not the top Democrat \non the committee. But every year for, I don't know, 14 or 15 years, I \nmeet with what is called the Judicial Conference --a legislatively \norganized body where the Congress says the court can have such a \nfunction, where we look for recommendations.\n  I might add, by the way, you may remember when there was a Republican \nPresident named Reagan, the Senator from Delaware introduced a bill to \nincrease the number of Federal judgeships by 84. Why did I do that? I \ndid that because the Federal court came to us, the Judicial Conference, \nand said, ``Here is our problem. We don't have enough judges to \nadminister justice in a timely fashion in this country. And there is a \nbacklog on all these criminal cases.''\n  I must admit to the Senator, when they came to me with that request, \nI knew the problem I was going to have. I was going to go into a \nDemocratic caucus and say, by the way, a Republican President, who is a \nfine man but the most ideological guy we had in a long time, who \nannounced he was going to appoint only very conservative judges, I was \nnow going to give him 84 more than he had.\n  I realized that was not a politically wise thing for me to do. But, \nlistening to the court, I did just that. My recollection is the Senator \nfrom Maryland stood with me and said, ``I don't like it. I admit, I am \nnot crazy about 84 more judges being appointed by Ronald Reagan. But \nthe court needs to be filled.''\n  Now we have the strange happening, the courts come back to us and \nsay--and they do this in a very scientific way--we not only need the \nvacancies filled, we need more judges than we have. They cite, as the \nSenator is very familiar with, they cite the backlog, they give the \nrationale that cases are being backed up. Guess what? The idea that we \nwill even get a chance to discuss a judgeship bill, I predict to my \nfriend from Maryland, on this floor is zero--zero. Not only that, to \nfurther make the point, this is the first time in the 24 years that I \nhave been a Senator, in 24 years, the first time I have ever heard \nanybody come to the floor and say: You know, we should basically \ndecommission judgeships.\n  The ninth circuit is the busiest circuit in America, out in \nCalifornia. One of our colleagues, a very wonderful guy, a nice guy, \nsays, ``I am not going to let any other judge be in the ninth \ncircuit''--notwithstanding they have five vacancies, if I am not \nmistaken, and they are up to their ears in work. This started last year \nwhen I was in charge of the Democratic side. He said, ``I am not going \nto let anybody go through until the ninth circuit splits into two \ncircuits.''\n  I said, ``Why do you want it to split?''\n  He said, ``The reason I want it to split is I don't like the fact \nthat California judges are making decisions that affect my State.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Idaho is shaking his head. He agrees. \nHe is in that circuit. It is painful to point this out, but the reason \nwhy there is a Federal court is so there is not Illinois, Indiana, \nIdaho, California justice. There is one uniform interpretation of the \nConstitution. That is the reason we have a Federal circuit court of \nappeals.\n  Now, this is quite unusual. We have--and I was not referring to the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, who is on the floor, when I said, \n``there was a Senator.'' That is not to whom I am referring. But \nanother one of our colleagues said he is not going to let anybody go \nthrough until there is a split, because he does not like the idea that \ndecisions relating to his State are being made by judges who are not \nfrom his State or are not from States of similar size. That is, \ninterestingly, an effectively rewrite of the Constitution of the United \nStates of America. I do not think the Senator thought it in those \nterms, but that is literally what it is.\n\n  Now I am being told, OK, unless we, in fact, split the circuit--and \nby the way, I am not opposed to splitting the circuit. We split the \nfifth circuit because when we got to the point where Florida grew so \nbig--Florida and Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana, they are all in \nthe same circuit--but they got so big, because of population growth, we \nsaid--the court recommended, we agreed--that it should be split into \ntwo circuits. We understand that. I am not opposed to that. I am not \narguing about that. But the idea that someone says, ``Until you do it \nmy way, until you can assure me I am not going to be associated with \nthat State of California, I am not going to let any vacancies be \nfilled''----\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, in effect what is happening \nis the court system is being held hostage, so it is not able to \nfunction properly as a court system should. I submit that is an \nirresponsible tactic to use. As Members of the Congress, the first \nbranch of Government, we have a responsibility to see that the court \nsystem can function in a proper fashion.\n  The Senator from Delaware, when he was chairman of the committee, \nalways measured up to that responsibility, I think often taking a lot \nof political heat for doing it. But he was out to make sure the system \ncould function. He had Republican Presidents nominating judges. He \nprocessed their nominations. He brought them to the floor of the \nSenate. He gave the Senate a chance to vote on them up or down for \nthose people to get confirmed. That process is breaking down.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I voted for all of them but seven, I might add. There were \nonly seven times that I voted against any of those nominees.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That process, I repeat, is now breaking down.\n  The other thing that is happening, as he says, instead of disagreeing \nwith the qualifications of a nominee, the other side says, ``We don't \nreally need the position.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And that is what we heard on Merrick Garland. In fact, \nwhen he first came up here, he was nominated for the 12th position on \nthe D.C. circuit. They said, ``We don't need that position. We have \nnothing against Merrick. He is a wonderful fellow, of course. We just \ndon't think we need that 12th position.'' Of course, that does a lot \nfor Merrick Garland. He's sitting, waiting to join the court. Then \nsomeone already on the court took senior status, and then they had two \nvacant positions, the 11th and 12th. Merrick Garland is nominated. He's \nnow up for the 11th position; not the 12th position, the 11th position. \nThe majority is right back here on the floor and it says, ``We don't \nneed this position.'' This is the 11th position. They never made that \nargument last year when he was going for the 12th position. Then they \nsaid we need the 11th, we don't need the 12th. Now they are back, some, \ntoday--fortunately, they did not prevail--saying we do not need either \nthe 11th or the 12th position.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield on that point, it is probably \ngoing to get him in trouble, but I want to compliment the chairman of \nthe committee. The chairman of the committee did not buy into that \nargument. The chairman of the committee took the position on this that \nwe should act, and he had been pushing this for some time.\n  Again, I see my distinguished friend, who now I work with in another \ncapacity, as the minority--the euphemism we use is ranking member--of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. We have much less disagreement than we \nhave on some issues relating to judges. But, with him here, I can \nremember that during the last days when the Senator from Delaware was \ntrying to push through judges--on October 8, 1992, the last day of the \nsession, with President Bush as President of the United States, the \nSenator from Delaware pushed through seven Republican judges--the last \nday.\n\n  I will bet you that has not happened very often in this place with \nDemocrats or Republicans: The last day, seven.\n  The reason I mention that is one of my distinguished colleagues--we \nhave very different views, but I like him a lot--walked up to me and he \nwas from a State where there were two Republican Senators, and two of \nthose judges were his. He walked up and shook my hand. This will not go \nin the Record--it will go in the Record, but his name won't, but my \ncolleagues will know who he is. He shook my hand and said, ``Joe, \nyou're a nice guy. I really appreciated it.'' He says, ``Of course, you \nknow I would never do this for you.''\n  I like him because he is straightforward and honest. He meant it, and \nthat's why we get along so well. I am\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\nnot referring to the Senator from North Carolina. He said, ``I'd never \ndo this for you.'' The point being, not that Biden is a good guy or \nBiden is a stupid guy, the point being that the court is in desperate \ntrouble in a number of jurisdictions. In southern California and south \nFlorida, and in a number of places where there are drug cases that are \nbacked up, a number of places where there are significant civil case \nbacklogs, a number of places where population growth is straining the \ncourt, they need these vacancies filled.\n  I respectfully suggest that it is a rare--it is a rare--district \ncourt nominee by a Republican President or a Democratic President who, \nif you first believe they are honest and have integrity, have any \nreason to vote against them. I voted for Judge Bork, for example, on \nthe circuit court, because Judge Bork I believed to be an honest and \ndecent man, a brilliant constitutional scholar with whom I disagreed, \nbut who stood there and had to, as a circuit court judge, swear to \nuphold the law of the land, which also meant follow Supreme Court \ndecisions. A circuit court cannot overrule the Supreme Court.\n  So any member who is nominated for the district or circuit court who, \nin fact, any Senator believes will be a person of their word and follow \nstare decisis, it does not matter to me what their ideology is, as long \nas they are in a position where they are in the general mainstream of \nAmerican political life and they have not committed crimes of moral \nturpitude, and have not, in fact, acted in a way that would shed a \nnegative light on the court.\n  So what I want to say, and I will yield because I see my friend from \nSouth Carolina--North Carolina, I beg your pardon. I am used to dealing \nwith our close friend in the Judiciary Committee who is from South \nCarolina. I seem to have the luck of getting Carolinians to deal with, \nand I enjoy them. I will yield the floor by saying, I will come back to \nthe floor at an appropriate time in the near term, immediately when we \nget back from the recess, and I will, as they say, Madam President, \nfill in the blanks in terms of what the absolute detail and each of the \nnumbers are, because I have tried to recall some of them off the top of \nmy head, not having intended to speak to this issue when I walked \nacross the floor earlier.\n  Let it suffice to say at the moment, at least for me, that it is \ntotally appropriate for any U.S. Senator to voice his or her opposition \nto any nominee for the Court, and they have a full right to do that. In \nmy study of and teaching of constitutional law and separation of powers \nissues, there is nothing in the Constitution that sets the standard any \nSenator has to apply, whether they vote for or against a judge.\n  But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is nominated is \nentitled to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have a shot to be \nheard on the floor and have a vote on the floor.\n  We had a tie vote in the committee, Madam President, on one of the \nSupreme Court nominees. I was urged by those who opposed him--and I \nopposed this particular nominee--to not report it to the floor. My \nreading of the Constitution, though, is the Judiciary Committee is not \nmentioned in the Constitution. The Judiciary Committee is not \nmentioned. The Senate is. We only in the Judiciary Committee have the \nright to give advice to the Senate, but it is the Senate that gives its \nadvice and consent on judicial nominations.\n  I sincerely hope, and I have urged the administration to confer with \nRepublican Senators before they nominate anyone from that Senator's \nState. I think that is totally appropriate. I think it is appropriate, \nas well, that Republican Senators, with a Democratic President, have \nsome input, which Democrats never had with the last two Republican \nPresidents. I think that is appropriate.\n  But I do not think it is appropriate, if this is the case--and I do \nnot know for certain, it just appears to be--if the real hangup here is \nwanting to reach an informal agreement that for every one person the \nPresident of the United States gets to nominate, the Republican Party \nwill get to nominate someone, the Republican Party in the Senate. Or \nfor every two persons that the President nominates, the Republicans get \nto nominate one.\n  It is totally appropriate for Republicans to reject every single \nnominee if they want to. That is within their right. But it is not, I \nwill respectfully request, Madam President, appropriate not to have \nhearings on them, not to bring them to the floor and not to allow a \nvote, and it is not appropriate to insist that we, the Senators--we, \nthe Senators--get to tell the President who he must nominate if it is \nnot in line with the last 200 years of tradition.\n\n  Again, I did not intend speaking at all on this, other than the fact \nI walked through and it was brought up, and since I was in that other \ncapacity for so long, I felt obliged to speak up.\n  I see my friend from North Carolina is here. I do not know if he \nwishes to speak on judges or foreign policy matters, but whichever he \nwishes to speak on, I am sure it will be informative. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from North \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me say that I always enjoy my friend, \nSenator Biden--all of it. You have to wait awhile sometimes, but the \nenjoyment is nonetheless sincere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2538-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2541-S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the remarks I am about to make will \nprobably be the best kept secret in Washington, DC, tomorrow morning in \nthe Washington Post or whatever. Instead, I am sure there will be ample \ncoverage given to the various statements made by several Senators \nearlier in the day about how they are having trouble getting a treaty \nthrough the U.S. Senate. And certain comments were made that just had \nno basis in fact whatsoever.\n  So this is a speech that I am going to make to set the record \nstraight so that it will be in the Congressional Record tomorrow \nmorning in the hopes that some soul somewhere may decide to look to see \nwhat the facts really are.\n  In any case, I listened with great interest to the--what do we call \nit--the colloquy this morning regarding the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, and I think it is important to remind the Senate of some \nfacts about the debate surrounding this controversy and, I believe, \nthis dangerous treaty, which is perilously flawed.\n  First of all, I am puzzled at the insistence of some of my Democratic \ncolleagues on a date certain for a vote on this treaty. It appears that \nthe supporters of the treaty want only a date certain when it suits \ntheir needs, their desires. I remember last year, they wanted a date \ncertain for hearings on this very same subject, the Chemical Weapons \nConvention Treaty. They wanted a date certain for committee action on \nthe treaty; they insisted on it.\n  The committee took action on the treaty. Then they wanted a date \ncertain for floor debate and consideration of the treaty --this was \nlast year--and we obliged them in every instance. But hours before the \nvote on the Chemical Weapons Convention, on their date certain, that \nwas supposed to happen, it was announced by the majority leader the \nnight before, but what happened? The White House called up and said, \n``Please withdraw the treaty.''\n  Now, it was not this Senator from North Carolina or any other Senator \nwho asked it be withdrawn. It was not Trent Lott, the majority leader. \nIt was the Clinton administration who asked the Senate not to vote on \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. Do you know why? Because they didn't \nhave enough votes to ratify the treaty. And why did they not have the \nvotes to ratify the treaty? Because in their zeal to force this treaty \ndown the throats of Senators, they refused flat out to address any of \nthe serious concerns that I had and a growing number of other Senators \nhad about this treaty.\n  I remember thinking last year, and I am thinking now, about what Sam \nErvin said so many times. He said, ``The United States had never lost a \nwar or won a treaty.'' And you think about the treaties that we have \ngotten into, and Sam Ervin--I think he got that from Will Rogers--but \nwherever it came from, it is true, and particularly in a document such \nas the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  So the suggestion, whether stated or implied, that we are somehow \nholding this treaty hostage is not only fraudulent, it is simply \nuntrue. You will not\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\nread about that in the Washington Post in the morning and CBS will not \nhave it. They might say something about Jesse Helms holding up \nconsideration of this treaty. But the fact is that I met for 4 hours \nyesterday evening with the distinguished Senator, Joe Biden, and we \nwent down a list of many issues in that proposed treaty. And we \nresolved most of them.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the suggestion that the committee, the \nForeign Relations Committee, of which I am chairman, is failing to \nfulfill its responsibilities to address the Clinton administration \npriorities. That simply is not so.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee was the first to convene a \nconfirmation hearing for a Cabinet-rank official this year. In fact, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee expeditiously considered and reported \nboth of the President's Cabinet-rank nominations by the end of January. \nIndeed, we have cleared the calendar of nearly all of the \nadministration's appointees, including one Assistant Secretary of State \nand several Ambassadors.\n  Let us set the record straight with respect to negotiations \nconcerning the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I personally met with the National Security Adviser in my office on \nFebruary 5 of this year. In that meeting, I told him that my staff was \nprepared to begin discussions with his staff immediately. Well, day \nafter day after day passed, and I received not one syllable of reply \nwhatsoever to that offer.\n  In an effort to get around the impasse, I wrote a seven-page letter \nto Mr. Berger, dated February 13, reiterating my request to begin \nstaff-level negotiations and proposing concrete solutions for \naddressing the concerns that I and other Senators have about this \ntreaty.\n  Another 2 weeks elapsed before I finally received a response from Mr. \nBerger--four paragraphs long--in which he did not respond to one single \nproposal contained in my letter. Indeed, he reiterated his refusal to \nsend any of his staff to meet directly with the staff of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  Then, on February 27, the chief of staff of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Adm. Bud Nance--who, by the way, is recovering nicely from a \nnear-fatal automobile accident that occurred last December, just before \nChristmas--came from his home in McLean to the Senate for the sole \npurpose of attempting to bridge this impasse. On that day, Admiral \nNance met with the heads of legislative affairs of both the State \nDepartment and the NSC.\n  Well, then, we move forward to March 5. Mr. Berger finally allowed \nthe NSC staff to begin discussion with the staffs of interested \nSenators. So those Senators who are counting every day from now until \nApril 29 should ask Mr. Berger why he dillied and dallied away the \nmonth of February and refused to work with the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee or the committee staff.\n  Notwithstanding all of that, since March 5, the staff of the Foreign \nRelations Committee has participated in more than 50 hours of \nnegotiations with the administration and other proponents of this \ntreaty. And I must add that the distinguished majority leader, to his \ncredit, has already devoted an extraordinary amount of time and energy \nto this issue.\n  Last night, the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and I, as I said earlier, spent 4 hours in my office \nnegotiating specific provisions with some success. So, in light of all \nthose efforts, I am perplexed as to how anyone could conclude that we \nare not working in good faith to resolve this matter.\n  Having said that, I think the time has come for the administration to \naddress several key concerns. Thus far, I regret to report we have not \nhad as much success as I would have hoped. Indeed, it is becoming clear \nthat the administration is treating these negotiations as an empty \nexercise, a perfunctory hurdle over which they must jump so that they \ncan argue that they ``tried to negotiate'' with me and with the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n\n  As a result of this unfortunate attitude on the part of the White \nHouse, very little progress is being made to bridge the wide gap \nbetween us on a number of important provisions of the chemical weapons \ntreaty.\n  Our staffs have been able to reach definitive agreement with the \nadministration on only 8 of 30 provisions. Of those, three are simple \nreporting requirements and one is a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate \ndeclaration. Not one of the issues that can be regarded as critical has \nyet been resolved.\n  But, Mr. President, having said all that, I am still determined to \nwork with the administration and others to see if we can resolve our \ndifferences on a chemical weapons treaty. But if we are going to do \nthat, the administration needs to return to the bargaining table and \nnegotiate with my staff and with me in good faith. The way they have \nbeen acting, they said, ``Well, we'll work it out.'' ``I'll do what I \nthink is right,'' they say. ``And you do what we think is right.'' So \nthat does not make it a 50-50 proposition, which I am not going to \naccept.\n  The administration needs to realize, in no uncertain terms, that \nunless and until they satisfy the number of concerns that various \nSenators, including this Senator, have relating to the treaty's \nuniversality, verifiability, constitutionality, and crushing impact on \nbusiness, I am not going, personally, to move on the CWC, period.\n  The chemical weapons treaty, as it now stands, is not global, as it \nis claimed to be. It is not verifiable. And it imposes costly and \npotentially unconstitutional regulatory burdens on American business.\n  This treaty will do nothing--will do nothing--to reduce the dangers \nof poison gas.\n  Almost none of the rogue nations that pose a chemical weapons threat \nto us--such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea--are signatories to the \ntreaty. They are free to pursue their chemical weapons programs \nunimpeded by this treaty. And the intelligence community has made \nclear--I do know whether it has been reported in the news or not--but \nthe intelligence community says it is not possible to monitor the \ncompliance of signatory nations with a high level of confidence. This \nis a matter of record. This is a matter of testimony before the Senate.\n  By the way, Russia is already violating its existing bilateral \nchemical weapons treaty with the United States. And the Russian \nmilitary is reportedly working to circumvent the CWC with a new \ngeneration of chemical agents that are specifically crafted to evade \nthe treaty's verification regime.\n  So if the chemical weapons treaty will not do anything to reduce the \ndangers of chemical weapons, what will it do? Good question.\n\n  Well, for one thing, it will, in fact, increase access to dangerous \nchemical agents to those terrorist states that do sign the treaty. Now, \nDouglas Feith, a chemical arms control negotiator in the Reagan \nadministration, pointed out last week in the New Republic that the CWC \nwill give the terrorist regimes in Iran and Cuba the right to demand \naccess to the chemical markets of the United States and all other \nsignatory nations and will create a treaty obligation for signatory \nnations to sell or give them chemical defensive gear, which is \nessential for any offensive program.\n  Well, the treaty will also endanger American troops by its forbidding \ncommanders in the field from using tear gas and other ground control \nagents.\n  Worst of all, on top of all of these other deficiencies, it will \nimpose dozens of new regulations and unprecedented and unconstitutional \ninspections on between 3,000 to 8,000 American businesses. Under the \nchemical weapons treaty, foreign inspectors will be authorized to swoop \ndown on American businesses--without a criminal search warrant or even \nprobable cause--and they can rifle through the records of these \nbusinesses, interrogate the employees, and even remove chemical \nsamples. That is not only an infringement on the constitutional rights \nof Americans, it is an invitation to industrial espionage. Any treaty \nthat gives foreign inspectors greater powers of search and seizure than \nthose granted American law enforcement officials under the U.S. \nConstitution is a treaty in need of serious modifications.\n  Last, this treaty has already begun to lull the United States and our \nallies into a false sense of security by creating the false impression \nthat something is being done about the problem of chemical weapons \nwhen, in fact,\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\nnothing, nothing is being done by the treaty. I could come up with no \nother explanation for why the then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Admiral Owens, would try to strip more than $800 million in \nchemical defensive funding from the fiscal years defense plan, or why \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvilli, \nwould recommend that $1.5 billion be taken out of our defense spending.\n  Do not take my word for it. Listen to constitutional scholars such as \nRobert Bork, Ed Meese. Listen to foreign policy experts such as Jeanne \nKirkpatrick, and Alexander Haig, and former Secretaries of Defense Dick \nCheney, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Rumsfeld, and James Schlesinger, or \nask Henry Kissinger about it. Defense Secretaries of every Republican \nadministration since Nixon have come out against this treaty, along \nwith literally dozens of generals, admirals and senior officials from \nthe Reagan, Bush, Nixon, Ford, and even the Carter administrations. If \nthe Clinton administration chooses not to address the concerns that \nthese distinguished experts and a number of Senators have enumerated, \nthat is their decision, but they will not get the CWC unless they sit \ndown and talk about the problems that some of us have.\n  Now, we have already sat down. We have begged to sit down before. We \nhave scheduled. We have written letters, all to no avail.\n  One other myth about the treaty, the myth of this April 29 deadline. \nWe hear over and over again, ``If we miss this deadline, it will be \nterrible.'' Now, let me say, Mr. President, there has to be an end to \nthe administration's Chicken Little pretense that the sky is going to \nfall if an agreement is not reached by April 29. This artificial \ndeadline is a fraud created by the administration when they gave the \nHungarian Government the green light to drop its instrument of \nratification. The Hungarians had sought U.S. guidance on how to \nproceed, and the administration expressly told the Hungarians to go \nright ahead.\n  The administration has one purpose, and that was to manufacture, to \ncontrive, to pretend, to have a drop-dead date to blackmail the Senate \ninto rubberstamping this dangerously defective treaty. Now, I for one \nam not going to be blackmailed into permitting a flawed treaty to be \napproved by such tactics. Further, the administration is disingenuous \nin arguing that the United States will be ``shut out'' of the Executive \nCouncil that implements this chemical weapons treaty, and that the U.S. \npersonnel will be barred from the inspection regime if the United \nStates does not ratify by April 29. Horse feathers.\n\n  As former Defense Secretaries James Schlesinger, Caspar Weinberger, \nand Donald Rumsfeld noted recently in an Op-ed in the Washington Post, \n``In the event that the United States does decide to become a party to \nthe CWC at a later date--perhaps after improvements are made to enhance \nthe treaty's effectiveness--it is hard to believe its preferences \nregarding implementing arrangements would not be given considerable \nweight. This is particularly true,'' this is what they wrote in the op-\ned piece, ``This is particularly true since the United States would \nthen be asked to bear 25 percent of the total cost of the implementing \norganization's budget.''\n  Now, Mr. President, it will be a concession of diplomatic \nincompetence to try to argue that the U.S. Government is incapable of \nnegotiating a seat on the Executive Council and the U.S. participation \nin the inspection regime of a treaty for which the American taxpayers \nare footing 25 percent of the bill. In fact, U.S. inspectors will be \nhired if and when the Congress agrees to fork over millions upon \nmillions of American taxpayers' dollars to finance this new \norganization.\n  As for the effects on industry, Secretaries Schlesinger, Weinberger, \nand Rumsfeld made very clear there will be very few, if any. ``The \npreponderance of trade in chemicals would be unaffected by the CWC's \nlimitations, making the impact of staying out of the treaty regime, if \nany, fairly modest on American manufacturers.''\n  It turns out that the Chemical Manufacturers Association has \nacknowledged that it will not lose, as it had previously claimed, $600 \nmillion in export sales. The Chemical Manufacturers Association now \nadmits that less than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. chemical exports \nwill be affected by this treaty, and even that number, even that number \nis highly suspect.\n  Mr. President, it is time that the contrived myth of cataclysmic \nconsequences of April 29 be put to rest once and for all. More \nimportant than any artificial deadline is the need to resolve the \nsubstantive issues that divide us. Without significant changes \ngoverning U.S. participation, agreed to in a resolution of \nratification, there is no point in ratifying the CWC. In that case, \nwhat happens, if anything, after April 29, is academic.\n  On the other hand, if the administration does come to agreement with \nus on these and other matters after April 29, or even before, I am \nconfident that the distinguished Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \ncan and will ensure the United States' interests are \nprotected. Madeleine Albright is a tough lady and a capable negotiator.\n\n  Mr. President, if the administration really wants this treaty by the \nartificial deadline that they deliberately created, they will have to \nreturn to the negotiating table and begin working in good faith with \nthe staff of the Foreign Relations Committee and with me. Let me \nreiterate that I spent 4 hours last evening with the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware, [Mr. Biden]. He operated in good faith and so \ndid I. That is what it is going to take. But there is going to have to \nbe a lot of action going a long way in our direction on a number of \nsubstantive issues.\n  For the information of anybody who may be interested, I remain of the \nopinion, as I indicated in my January 29 letter of this year to the \nmajority leader, that once we have succeeded in having comprehensive \nreform of U.S. foreign affairs agencies, reform of the United Nations, \nand once the modification of the ABM and CFE treaties are submitted to \nthe Senate for advice and consent, I will be more than willing to turn \nmy attention to the matter of the CWC. I might be persuaded to turn to \nit earlier than that. Even so, any resolution of ratification for the \nCWC must provide key protections relating to the treaty's verification, \nlack of applicability to rogue states, constitutionality, and its \nimpact on business.\n  Now, I am very sincere when I say that I hope we can work out our \ndifferences. I am certainly willing to try. I hope I demonstrated that \nlast evening and on occasions earlier than that. But, in the end, \nwhether or not we reach agreement is a decision that only the Clinton \nadministration can make. I think they ought to get about it and let us \nsee what we can work out together on a fair and just basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, again, I did not anticipate that I would be \nspeaking to this issue. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I am on the \nfloor, and I understand why the Senator from North Carolina came over \nto speak in light of things that were said earlier today when he was \nnot here and I was not here. I would like to respond, at least in part, \nto what my distinguished colleague has said.\n  Let me begin by parcelling this out into three pieces. First, is the \nissue of whether or not the administration has acted in good faith; \nsecond, is not whether or not the substantive issues raised by the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina are accurate, but whether or \nnot there is a response to them; I think his concerns are not accurate; \nand third, whether or not the ultimate condition being laid down by the \nSenator from North Carolina, as I understand it--and I could be wrong--\nis appropriate.\n  Let me begin, first, by talking about the administration. It is true \nthat the distinguished Senator from North Carolina and I spent almost \n4\\1/2\\ hours last night addressing, in very specific detail--apparently \nwithout sufficient success--the concerns the Senator from North \nCarolina has about this treaty. I note--and I will come back to this--\nthat the universe of concerns expressed by the Senator from North \nCarolina were submitted to me in writing some time ago. Although they \nhave expanded slightly, they total 30, possibly 31, concerns.\n  When I became the ranking member of this committee, I approached the \ndistinguished chairman and said I would very much like to work with\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\nhim, I would very much like to cooperate, and I would very much like to \nwork out a forum in which we could settle our differences relating to \nwhat is sound foreign policy.\n  The agreement made by the Senator from North Carolina with regard to \nthe Senator from Delaware was this: I said I am willing to meet with \nyour staff--you need not be there, Mr. Chairman--and discuss in detail \nevery single concern you have. I am even willing to go out to Admiral \nNance's home, because he was seriously injured. I am willing to go to \nhis home and conduct these discussions. And to the credit of the \nchairman, he dispatched his staff to do that with me, my staff \nincluded, and I do not know, I will submit for the Record, the total \nnumber of hours we did this. But I know that I, personally, in addition \nto meeting with the Senator from North Carolina, have met with the \nstaff for hours and hours. And our staffs have met for a considerably \nlonger period of time--not in a generic discussion of this treaty, but \non specific word-by-word analyses, negotiations, and agreement on the \ndetail of proposals made by the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina about how he feels the treaty has to be remedied.\n\n  So what has the administration been doing? I think, to use an \nexpression my grandmom used to use, ``Sometimes there is something \nmissed between the cup and the lip.'' The administration--as I tried to \nexplain to my friend from North Carolina last night, and his staff on \nother occasions--was giving conflicting marching orders. The \nadministration, after direct discussions with Majority Leader Lott \nprior to January 29, agreed to meet and discuss this in detail with a \ntask force that Senator Lott named. Senator Lott named a task force of \ninterested Republicans.\n  They included the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee; the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens; Senator Smith of New Hampshire; Senator Kyl of Arizona; \nSenator Warner of Virginia, and others, who were to sit down and \ndiscuss with the administration their concerns about this treaty and \nhow they felt the treaty had to be changed. The first meeting of that \ntask force, of which Senator Helms was a part, appointed by Senator \nLott, occurred on January 29.\n  Now, my friend from North Carolina--I can understand why there may be \nconfusion here. He said that Sandy Berger, the National Security \nAdviser, dallied away the month of February. He was dallying with \nSenator Lott; he was dallying with Senator Warner; he was dallying with \nSenator Shelby; he was dallying with Senator Bob Smith; he was dallying \nwith Senator Kyl; he was dallying with a task force appointed by the \nRepublican leader.\n  I can understand why the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, might not feel that is \nan appropriate forum. I can understand that. Those of us who have been \nchairmen do not like the fact that a majority leader will sometimes \ncome along and say, ``By the way, even though this is within your \njurisdiction, we are going to appoint a task force beyond your \njurisdiction.''\n  But the truth of the matter is, picture the quandary of the President \nof the United States after a discussion with the majority leader of the \nU.S. Senate, and the majority leader said, ``Here are the folks you are \nsupposed to deal with.'' I challenge anyone on Senator Lott's staff who \nare the main players in this to suggest that the administration didn't \ndeal in good faith with them. There were hours and hours and hours of \ndetailed negotiations with this group.\n  I say to my friend from North Carolina, put the shoe on the other \nfoot. He is the President of the United States. Here is a Democratic \nmajority leader. He wants a treaty passed. The Democratic majority \nleader goes to him and says, ``I have appointed a committee of \nDemocrats interested in this subject. I would like you to negotiate \nwith them, not with Biden, the chairman of the committee. He is part of \nthis group.''\n  So, beginning on January 29, Sandy Berger, Bob Bell, his chief \nnegotiator, and the administration met for scores of hours. I don't \nmean 2. I don't mean 10. I don't mean 20. I mean 30 or 40 hours worth \nof negotiations with the principals, with the Republican Senators, as \nwell as without them. Guess what. They reached an agreement. There is a \nuniverse of 30-some amendments. I hold it up now. This is what was \npresented to the administration by this coalition of Republican \nSenators concerned about the treaty. It, in fact, lists every known \nobjection, every objection raised by any Republican that we are aware \nof or that the administration is aware of about the treaty. The number \nis 30.\n  This document I have here listing those 30 concerns--not only \nconcerns, 30 specific conditions--which the Republican task force, \nstaffed by Senator Lott's staff and all other members' staff, listed. \nAnd they are listed. The specific proposals are listed that were made \nby the Republican task force.\n  No. 1, enhancement to robust chemical and biological defenses. And \nthey propose then two pages of language, three pages that relate to the \nconditions they would like attached to the treaty. That was repeated 30 \ntimes as is appropriate. The administration spent 30 or more hours \nsitting with these members and/or their staff and coming to an \nagreement on 17 of them, disagreeing on 13.\n  So, simultaneously, later Senator Helms and I began a process that \nwas tracking the same process. I was not part of the Republican group, \nobviously, and I did not represent the administration in this group. \nBut the administration sat down and in detail responded to every single \nconcern raised by the Republican task force named by the majority \nleader, and instructed by the majority leader to deal with that group. \nSimultaneously, I sat for hours and hours with Senator Helms' staff, \nand then last night, at the end of the process, with Senator Helms \nhimself for 4 hours. I will estimate that I sat with the staff and my \nstaff sat with Helms' staff 20 hours or more.\n  Again, Senator Helms was very straightforward with us. He gave us a \ndocument listing his 30 concerns, some of which were the same and some \nof which were different. This is the document presented to me. Over a \nperiod of hours and hours and hours of negotiation, I agreed on 21 of \nthe 30 issues raised by Senator Helms, disagreed on 9, 3 of which I \nindicated I would not take opposition to but I didn't support.\n  So with all due respect to my distinguished chairman, he may not have \nbeen aware and his staff may not have informed him of the hours and \nhours and hours and hours of detailed negotiation between the Lott task \nforce, including his staff and the administration. But had he been \ninformed, he would know that those negotiations began at the \ninstruction of Senator Lott on the 29th of January.\n  So I am sure when the Senator reads this in the Record or is informed \nby his staff, he will realize that the fact he didn't meet with Sandy \nBerger until February 15 should not be a surprise. Sandy Berger thought \nhe was meeting with Senator Helms when he met with Senator Lott's task \nforce.\n  Let me tell you what was the agreed objective of the task force and \nof my negotiations. It was this, that we would put all of the universe \nof objections--and I hope those who follow this in the press, watching \nthis now or reading it later, will understand precisely what I am about \nto say. The objective was--I think the Presiding Officer, who has been \ninvolved in and interested in this issue, may be aware of this as well. \nIt was agreed that the Republican objections--legitimate--would be put \nin writing, which they did. All of them would be laid down, which they \nwere. They said they totaled 30. They would be talked about, fought \nover, negotiated, to see if there could be a compromise reached, and, \nat the end of the day, there would be two lists. Every one of those 30 \namendments would fall in either column A, where there was agreement \nbetween the Lott task force and the administration, and hopefully Biden \nand Helms. Those things which could not be agreed to in column B. They \ngot this picture.\n  Thirty written conditions seeking to alter the interpretation of the \ntreaty, or defend the intent of the treaty, put on paper, negotiated \nbetween the administration and the Lott group, and at the end of the \nday, they would be, to use the jargon of the Senate, ``fenced.'' That \nwould be the universe of concerns, because, obviously, you can't \naddress a concern unless you know what it is. They are the universe of \nconcerns\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\nraised about the treaty. And there would be either conditions 1 through \n30 placed in column A, where there is agreement to alter the treaty, or \nto add a condition to the treaty, I should say to be precise, or column \nB, where there is no agreement.\n  Then what was envisioned was at the end of that process, within time, \nsufficient time to consider this in this Chamber, there would be the \nfollowing process. The treaty would be brought up from the desk, \nstripped of any conditions that were reported out of the Foreign \nRelations Committee last time--this was the hope--and we would have the \nfollowing procedure. Senator Helms and Senator Biden, as envisioned by \nthe Lott group, would offer on behalf of the Lott group, Democrats and \nRepublicans and the administration, a package in column A.\n  That package with the administration would number 17, and if I were \nwilling to add to that package with Senator Helms over the objection of \nthe administration, that could be brought up to 21 out of the 30 \nconcerns that everyone agreed on or 17 of the 21 the administration \nagreed on and Biden would support Helms on 4 additional ones whether \nthe administration liked it or not, leaving maximum 13, minimum 9, \nconditions that could not be agreed upon.\n  That was done. They are the numbers that we were left with. Then it \nwas envisioned that after passing the agreed-to conditions, we would \nthen move to the conditions upon which we did not agree, and the \nRepublicans under the leadership of Senator Helms would offer those \nconditions as we do on other treaties. I would be given the right to \noffer an alternative or to amend them, and we would vote ad seriatim. \nThen at the end of the day, after having disposed of all 30 of the \nconcerns, we would then vote up or down on the treaty.\n  Now, I call that a negotiation. I have been here for 24 years. I have \nbeen involved in a lot of serious negotiations. I have never been \ninvolved in negotiations where more people who were appointed to \nparticipate have acted in good faith. Think about this now. Name me a \ncircumstance where a treaty has been presented by a Democrat or \nRepublican President where there have been 19 conditions agreed to on \nthat treaty, or 21 conditions in my case, 17 in the case of the \nadministration, and then we vote on another either 13 or 9 additional \nchanges.\n  What I think my friend is saying--maybe he does not mean to say it--\nwhat I read him to say is, unless you agree with us on the other nine, \nwe are not going to let you vote.\n  Now, look, I doubt whether my friend from North Carolina would find \nit appropriate if the American textile workers sat down with Burlington \nMills or any other textile owner and said, we are going to negotiate a \nnew collective bargaining agreement and we are going to go on strike \nunless you agree on every one of our conditions.\n  How is that a negotiation? That is an ultimatum. That is not a \nnegotiation. So I hope he does not mean it.\n  I cannot believe, I do not believe Senator Helms means that if the \nadministration does not come up now and separately negotiate with him \nafter having settled the negotiation with the group called the Lott \ngroup, unless the administration agrees to Senator Helms' version of \nuniversality, Senator Helms' version of verifiability, and Senator \nHelms' version of constitutional requirements, et cetera, he will not \nlet the treaty be voted on, because when you cut through everything, \nthat is what it sounded like.\n  I said at the outset I divided this into three pieces. One, whether \nor not there was negotiation by the administration in good faith. I \nwill just let the record stand. And I repeat again, Senator Lott--and I \ndo not know the exact circumstances under which it came about, but I \nassume it was after discussion with the President of the United States \nof America, President Clinton--set up a task force that included \nSenator Stevens, Senator Helms, Senator Kyl, Senator Warner, Senator \nShelby, Senator Nickles, Senator Bob Smith, and Senator McCain. The \nPresident of the United States was told by the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Lott, these are the people I want you to sit down with \nand try to work out their concerns.\n  That first meeting took place on January 29. I began my meetings with \nSenator Helms on February 11. Again Senator Helms and his staff were \npart of the Lott task force.\n  So although I understand that Senator Helms might not have liked that \narrangement, I ask him to consider the dilemma that the administration \nwas placed in when being told by the majority leader: negotiate with \nthis group. I assure you, I promise you, I commit to you, to every \nMember of the Senate in my discussions with the President, with the \nSecretary of State and with the National Security Adviser, they all \nbelieved they were negotiating with the appropriate parties in the \nSenate because that is what the majority leader told them to do.\n\n  The second point. They conducted a negotiation which culminated in an \nagreement that ended last Thursday when Bob Bell, representing the \nadministration, sat down with the principals as well as all the \nstaffers of those eight Senators, including Senator Lott's staff, and \nproduced the document I have in my hand listing all 30 conditions \nraised by the Republican task force, including Chairman Helms, and \nplacing every condition either in column A or column B--column A \nmeaning those conditions where they have been worked out and agreed to, \nwhere the Lott task force, representing the Republicans in the Senate, \nand the administration reached an agreement on a condition they could \nboth accept; and column B, where they could not accept, they could not \nreach an agreement.\n  That was the product of hours and hours and hours and hours of \ndetailed negotiation. I say to the Presiding Officer and anyone who is \nlistening to this, I am not talking about general agreement. I am \ntalking word-by-word specific agreement on every comma, whether it \nshould say ``shall'' or ``should,'' every single word of their \nconditions, the majority of which were agreed to, compromise was \nreached on; the minority of which there was no compromise.\n  I then was informed by the administration in the person of Bob Bell \nand Sandy Berger that to their surprise either Senator Helms' staff or \nsomeone purporting to represent Senator Helms at last Thursday's \nmeeting, which was supposed to tie this in a knot, define the universe \nof conditions, place them all in one of two categories, and get about \nthe business of proceeding on the treaty, at the last minute--literally \nthe last minute--as I understand it. I mean, the meeting was over--the \nadministration walked in the meeting, as I understand the Lott group \nthought they were walking in the meeting, to tie this knot, everything \nin column A or column B. Someone suggested that the chairman of the \nfull committee did not find that appropriate. So I met with the \nDemocratic leader and the administration. I went in the leader's \noffice. I said I believe Senator Helms is still operating in good \nfaith, as I believe he still is. I don't want to confuse this \nnegotiation, but why don't you authorize me, Democratic leader, to \nspeak for the Democrats? Why don't you let me go sit down with Senator \nHelms and try to get to the bottom of what appears to be a \nmisunderstanding here? Because the understanding by the Lott group and \nthe administration was that this was supposed to be all tied up with a \nunanimous-consent agreement last Thursday.\n\n  So I sought a meeting with Senator Helms and he graciously agreed. \nAnd I kept him very late. He had a very busy day. I sat with him in his \noffice last night until 8:30. The meeting began around 4 o'clock in the \nafternoon, without any break, without any interruption. I took out a \ndocument that his staff had prepared. It is dated March 13, ``To the \nHonorable Trent Lott, majority leader, from Jesse Helms, Chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, subject: Status of negotiation over \nkey concerns relating to the CWC.''\n  And then Senator Helms, in that memo to Senator Lott, listed--and \nthey are numbered--listed 30, ``concerns relating to CWC.'' Each of \nthose concerns had, and it was very helpful the way it was organized, \nlisted, No. 1 through 30, and then at the top of each of the numbers it \nsaid, ``status,'' status relative to the administration: No agreement \nwith the administration or agreement with the administration.\n  So I sat down with Senator Helms, because I am very jealous of the \nprerogatives of the Senate versus any administration, and feel very \nstrongly\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\nabout the role of the Senate in treaties. I sat down with Senator Helms \nwith the understanding and knowledge on the part of the administration, \nwho knew I might not agree with them on everything, and my Democratic \nleader, and for 4\\1/2\\ hours went through all 30 issues, point by \npoint. I reached agreement with Senator Helms, not on eight or 13 or \n17, depending on whose number you take as to whether the Lott group and \nthe administration agreed. The administration thinks they agreed on 17. \nSenator Helms said they only agreed on eight. I don't want to get into \nthat fight. But I can tell you what I did. I agreed on 21 of the 30. I \ndisagreed with the administration on several points Senator Helms \nraised because I think he was right. They relate to the prerogatives of \nthe Senate.\n  Let me give an example. Under the Constitution, the U.S. Senate has a \nright to reserve on any treaty. We wanted to restate that right. The \nadministration didn't want that right restated in the treaty as a \ncondition. I agreed with Senator Helms, it should be restated; \nnotwithstanding the fact we are not reserving on this treaty, we had a \nright to reserve if we wanted to. That is called preserving the \nprerogatives of the Senate delegated to the Senate in the Constitution \nof the United States of America. That is an example of one of the areas \nwhere the administration was unwilling to agree with Senator Helms and \nI was willing to agree.\n  So at the end of the day we agreed to 21 items, and I was willing to \nmake the case to my Democratic leadership, to put into column A. So \nthat we would have one vote on 21 conditions to the treaty when it was \nbrought up, leaving only 9 areas where we disagree. Of those nine, we \nwere perilously close to agreement on several. I call that, in the \nuniverse of negotiations, good-faith negotiations.\n  But, if by negotiating one means that the President or those who \nsupport the treaty, like Senator Lugar, a Republican, or Senator Biden \na Democrat, have to agree to a condition that would kill the treaty, \nthen that is not a negotiation. That is an ultimatum. Now, I am \nconfident the Senator from North Carolina cannot mean that, and I am \nhopeful that we will continue to talk about the nine that remain \nunresolved. But at the end of the day, with all due respect, the Senate \nhas a right to work its will.\n  I am a professor of constitutional law at Widener University law \nschool. I have taught, now, for a half a dozen semesters, a seminar to \nadvanced students in constitutional law on separation of powers. One of \nthe things I expressly teach is the treaty power in the Constitution. \nThat is, for lack of a better shorthand, those powers separated between \nthe executive, the legislative, and judiciary. And among those things, \nin terms of that horizontal separation, there are areas that have been \nin dispute for the last 200 years. One of them is appointment powers, \nsecond is treaty powers, and the other is war powers.\n\n  Then there is the so-called vertical question of the separation of \npowers: State government versus Federal Government; individuals versus \nState or Federal Government. On the issue of the treaty power, I would \nobserve what I observed earlier about the appointment power. Nowhere in \nthe Constitution does it say that the Judiciary Committee shall decide \nwho should or should not be a judge. It says, the Senate. Nowhere in \nthe Constitution does it mention the Foreign Relations Committee. It \nmentions the Senate. So, I do think it is inappropriate, from a \nconstitutional perspective, to deny the Senate, if that were anyone's \nintention, and I am not convinced it is yet, the right to vote ``yea'' \nor ``nay'' on ratifying a treaty or any conditions thereto.\n  So now let me leave the item I mentioned I would speak to first, \nwhether or not there were good-faith negotiations on the part of the \nadministration. I hope I have amply demonstrated that there were. They \nthought they were supposed to deal with the task force the majority \nleader of the Senate said deal with, and they did it in good faith. I \nwould be very surprised if any member of that group--I have not spoken \nto any of them because I am not part of that group, from Senator Warner \nto Senator Stevens to Senator McCain to Senator Kyl--would come to the \nfloor and say the administration did not negotiate in good faith to us, \ntirelessly, hour after hour after hour.\n  (Mr. SESSIONS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me move to the next point that relates \nto the merits of this treaty. That is a legitimate area of \ndisagreement. I will be brief because I am keeping the staff and the \npages, who have to go to school tomorrow morning, very late.\n\n\n                              universality\n\n  Critics charge that the CWC will be ineffective because rogue states \nsuch as Syria, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya--all of whom are suspected \nof or confirmed to have chemical weapons--have not joined the \nconvention.\n  Therefore, the argument goes, the United States should withhold its \nratification until these states join.\n  I could not disagree more.\n  Just think of it. The logic of this argument would lead us to a world \nwhere rogue actors--not good international citizens--determine the \nrules of international conduct.\n  Such a policy would amount, effectively, to a surrender of U.S. \nnational sovereignty to the actions of a few.\n  Instead of the United States actively leading international \ncoalitions and setting tough standards on nonproliferation matters, the \nconvention opponents would have us do nothing until every two-bit rogue \nregime would decide for us when we should act.\n  This reasoning is contrary to the record of the past 40 years, during \nwhich the United States has led the way in nonproliferation \ninitiatives.\n  From the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, to the missile technology \ncontrol regime, to the comprehensive test ban treaty, and to the \nchemical weapons convention itself, we have fought for establishing \naccepted norms of behavior.\n  I happen to believe that international norms count.\n  In a recent article that I coauthored with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Richard Lugar, we noted that such norms provide \nstandards of acceptable behavior against which the actions of states \ncan be judged. They also provide a basis for action--harsh action--when \nrogue states violate the norm.\n  Suggesting that we should now take a back seat to the likes of North \nKorea and Libya does a grave injustice to our record of international \nleadership and leaves such nations free to act as free operators \nwithout fear of penalty or retaliation by the nations whose armies and \ncitizens they threaten.\n  The fact that there is now no international legal prohibition against \nthe development of chemical weapons should not be lost here.\n  The suspected programs that treaty opponents are so concerned about \nare right now entirely legitimate according to international law, and \nwe have already had a telling example of what can result from this \nperverse situation.\n  The Japanese police were aware, before a cult attacked the Tokyo \nsubway with sarin nerve gas in 1995, that the cult was manufacturing \nthe gas--but they had no basis in Japanese law to do anything about it.\n  That will change, both internationally and domestically, once the CWC \nenters into force.\n  The convention will establish an international norm against the \ndevelopment of chemical weapons. It will provide the legal, political, \nand moral basis for firm action against those that choose to violate \nthe rules. If the goal of treaty opponents truly is to target the \nchemical weapons programs of suspect states, then joining the \nconvention is the best way to achieve this objective--and refusing to \njoin is the surest way to protect the world's bad actions.\n\n\n                             verifiability\n\n  A great benefit of the chemical weapons convention is that it \nincreases our ability to detect production of poison gas.\n  Regardless of whether we ratify this convention, regardless of \nwhether another country has ratified this convention, our intelligence \nagencies will be monitoring the capabilities of other countries to \nproduce and deploy chemical weapons. The CWC will not change that \nresponsibility.\n  What this convention does, however, is give our intelligence agencies \nsome additional tools to carry out this task. In short, it will make \ntheir job easier.\n  In addition to onsite inspections, the CWC provides a mechanism to \ntrack the movement of sensitive chemicals\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\naround the world, increasing the likelihood of detection. This \nmechanism consists of data declarations that require chemical companies \nto report production of those precursor chemicals needed to produce \nchemical weapons. This information will make it easier for the \nintelligence community to monitor these chemicals and to learn when a \ncountry has chemical weapons capability.\n  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994, \nR. James Woolsey, then Director of Central Intelligence, stated: ``In \nsum, what the chemical weapons convention provides the intelligence \ncommunity is a new tool to add to our collection tool kit.''\n  Recently, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, \nreemphasized this point before the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Mr. Tenet stated: ``There are tools in this treaty that \nas intelligence professionals we believe we need to monitor the \nproliferation of chemical weapons around the world. * * * I think as \nintelligence professionals we can only gain.''\n  No one has ever asserted that this convention is 100 percent \nverifiable. It simply is not possible with this or any other treaty to \ndetect every case of cheating. But I would respectfully submit that \nthis is not the standard by which we should judge the convention. \nInstead, we should recognize that the CWC will enhance our ability to \ndetect clandestine chemical weapons programs. The intelligence \ncommunity has said that we are better off with the CWC than without \nit--that is the standard by which to judge the CWC.\n\n\n                           constitutionality\n\n  One of the issues that should not be contentious, and I hope will not \ncontinue to be a focus of attention, is whether the convention, and \nparticularly its inspection regime, is constitutional.\n  Every scholar that has published on the subject, and virtually every \nscholar that has considered the issue, has concluded that nothing in \nthe convention conflicts in any way with the fourth amendment or any \nother provision of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Indeed, to accommodate our special constitutional concerns, the \nUnited States insisted that when parties to the convention provide \naccess to international inspection teams, the government may ``[take] \ninto account any constitutional obligations it may have with regard to \nproprietary rights or searches and seizures.''\n  In plain English, this means that inspectors enforcing the Chemical \nWeapons Convention must comply with our constitution when conducting \ninspections on U.S. soil.\n  It also means that the United States will not be in violation of its \ntreaty obligations if it refuses to provide inspectors access to a \nparticular site for legitimate constitutional reasons.\n  In light of this specific text, inserted at the insistence of U.S. \nnegotiators, I am hard pressed to understand how anyone can seriously \ncontend that the convention conflicts with the Constitution.\n  There is nothing in the convention that would require the United \nStates to permit a warrantless search or to issue a warrant without \nprobable cause. Nor does the convention give any international body the \npower to compel the United States to permit an inspection or issue a \nwarrant.\n  This is the overwhelming consensus among international law scholars \nthat have studied the convention, two of whom have written to me \nexpressing their opinion that the convention is constitutional. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letters of Harvard law professor, Abram \nChayes, and Columbia law professor, Louis Henkin, be included in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. So let me make this point absolutely clear, despite what \nopponents of the convention have said, there will be no involuntary \nwarrantless searches of U.S. facilities by foreign inspectors under \nthis convention.\n  In light of this, I hope that the constitutionality of this \nconvention will not become an issue in this debate.\n  Let me conclude that portion by suggesting to my distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama, who is presiding, that I believe, on the \nmerits, this is a good treaty. It is not merely me. The Senator from \nNorth Carolina listed people who do not think it is a good treaty. I \nwill submit for the Record everyone, from General Schwarzkopf to the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff to Senator Lugar, people who believe very, very \nfervently, as I do, this is clearly in the overwhelming national \ninterest of the United States of America. I ask unanimous consent that \na list of supporters of the CWC be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Now let me move to the third issue. The notion of, as my \nfriend from North Carolina stated, that there is an artificial date of \nApril 29 made up by the administration to put undue pressure on the \nSenate to act. Let me point out for the Senate that there is nothing \nartificial about that date. It is real.\n  What does that mean? It means that our failure to ratify before the \n29th will have consequences. First, the chemical weapons treaty \nmandates trade restrictions that could have a deleterious impact upon \nthe American chemical industry. If the United States has not ratified, \nas long as they have not ratified, American companies will have to \nsupply end user certificates to purchase certain classes of chemicals \nfrom the CWC signatories. After 3 years, they will be subject to trade \nsanctions that will harm American exports and jobs.\n  I know that my friend says a lot of chemical companies do not like \nthis. I come from a State that has a little bit of an interest in \nchemicals, the single most significant State in America that deals with \nchemicals. A little company called Du Pont; a little company called \nHercules; a little company called ICI Americas; a little company called \nDu Pont Merck--little pharmaceutical outfits who are among the giants \nin the world. They are not what you call liberal Democratic \nestablishments. They are ardently--I can testify--they are ardently in \nfavor of this treaty. They believe it is desperately in the interest of \nthe United States of America and their interest. This is not a bunch of \nlib labs out there who are arms controllers running around saying, \n``Disarm, ban the bomb.'' These are Fortune, not 500, not 100, 10, \nFortune 10 companies that are saying, ``We want this treaty.'' And \nfurther, ``We will be harmed if we do not enter this treaty.''\n  This overall governing body, known as the Conference of State \nPartners, is going to meet soon after April 29 to draw up the rules \ngoverning the implementation of this treaty. If we, to use the \nvernacular, ``ain't'' in by the 29th, if we are not on by the 29th, we \ndo not get to draw up those rules.\n  There used to be a distinguished Senator from Louisiana I served with \nfor a long time. My friend, the Presiding Officer, knew him from his \ndays up here. His name was Russell Long. He used to say kiddingly, ``I \nain't for no deal I ain't in on.'' But the chemical industry, which is \nour largest exporter--hear what I just said--the biggest fish in the \npond are saying, ``We want to be in on the deal.''\n  That is why the 29th is important. If we are not a party to the CWC, \nwe will not be a member of that conference. And this body, with no \nAmerican input, could make rules that have a serious impact upon the \nUnited States.\n  Third, there will be a body called the executive council with 41 \nmembers on which we are assured of a permanent seat from the start \nbecause of the size of our chemical industry, that is, if we have \nratified by the 29th. If we ratify after the council is already \nconstituted, then a decision on whether to order a required surprise \ninspection on an American facility may be taken without an American \nrepresentative evaluating the validity of the request and looking out \nfor a facility's interest because we will not be on the standing \nexecutive council that makes that decision.\n\n  Fourth, there will be a technical secretariat with about 150 \ninspectors, many of whom would be Americans because of the size and \nsophistication of our chemical industry. If we fail to ratify the \nconvention by the 29th, there will be no American inspectors.\n  And finally, and most importantly, in the long term, by failing to \nratify, we would align ourselves with those\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\nrogue actors, those rogue states who have chosen to defy the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. There would be irreparable harm to our global \nleadership on critical arms control and nonproliferation issues.\n  I will not take the time now to address other concerns that have been \nraised, because I said I would limit myself to these three points.\n  Concluding, Mr. President, first, there has been good-faith, long and \nserious negotiations resulting in significant movement by the \nadministration on conditions to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Second, this treaty is in the overwhelming national interest of the \nUnited States of America, a topic I am ready, willing, and anxious to \ndebate with my distinguished colleague from North Carolina and others \nwho think it is not. But at a minimum, Mr. President, the Senate should \nget a chance to hear that debate and vote on whether or not the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina is correct or the Senator \nfrom Delaware is correct.\n\n  Third, Mr. President, April 29 is not an artificial date. Because the \ntriggering mechanism was when we got to 65 signatories, and that 6 \nmonths after that date the treaty would enter into force.\n  Well, 65 have signed on. And 6 months after they got to the No. 65, \nhappens to be April 29. This is not artificial. We did not make up the \ndate. That is what the treaty says.\n  So, Mr. President, I sincerely hope that my friend from North \nCarolina, having reflected on the quandary the administration was \nplaced in, which was to negotiate with the Lott group--they thought \nthey were negotiating with Senator Helms; they thought they were \nnegotiating with every Republican who had an objection, under the \nauspices of Senator Lott--if they had known that Senator Helms did not \nview that as the appropriate forum for this negotiation, they would \nhave simultaneously met with him.\n  But now at the end of the process, when we are about to go out on \nrecess, to say that we are not ready to bring this treaty up when we \nget back unless there is a new negotiation, I find unusual, \nparticularly since I have agreed with the Senator from North Carolina \nthat I will sign on to additional conditions with him.\n  Let us vote on the only nine outstanding issues that I am aware of \nthat have been raised. None other has been raised that I am aware of, \nthat the administration is aware of, anyone in the Lott group is aware \nof, to the best of my knowledge.\n  So, Mr. President, let me conclude by saying, the Senator from North \nCarolina has dealt with me in good faith. We have negotiated in great \ndetail. He has listed his 30 objections. We have agreed on 21 of the \n30. We disagree on nine. We agree on a method to vote on those nine.\n  I sincerely hope--I sincerely hope--for the interest of the United \nStates of America, after having already decided in the Bush \nadministration that we would do away with the use of chemical weapons \nregardless of what anybody else did, that we would not now lose our \nplace of leadership in the world and our ability to engage in the moral \nsuasion that relates to nonproliferation and the diminution of weapons \nof mass destruction, that we would not now forgo that position merely \nbecause 1, 2 or 5 or 10 Senators said we should not even bring it on \nthe floor to debate.\n  I do not believe that will happen. But then again, my wife thinks I \nam a cockeyed optimist. But I do not think I am being unduly optimistic \nor a cockeyed optimist. I think having been here this long, that the \nSenate will get a chance to work its will. That is all I am asking. All \nI am asking is the Senate get a chance between now and the 29th of \nApril to decide whether it likes this treaty or not. I believe every \nMember of this Senate has the national interests of the United States \nof America in mind when they act and when they vote.\n  Let each of them vote their conscience on this treaty. If it turns \nout that 66 do not agree with me, then we have spoken, as we did in the \nLeague of Nations. The consequences of that vote I think were \ndisastrous. I think the consequence of failure to ratify this treaty \nwould be disastrous. But I think the consequence of not even letting \nthe Senate vote will be catastrophic.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                 Cambridge, MA, September 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden, You have asked me to comment on the \n     suggestion that the Chemical Weapons Convention (the \n     Convention), now before the Senate for its advice and \n     consent, conflicts with the provisions of the Fourth \n     Amendment of the Constitution prohibiting unreasonable \n     searches and seizures. In my view, the suggestion is \n     completely without merit.\n       The Convention expressly provides that: ``In meeting the \n     requirement to provide access * * * the inspected State Party \n     shall be under the obligation to allow the greatest degree of \n     access taking into account any constitutional obligations it \n     may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches and \n     seizures,'' (Verification Annex, Part X, par. 41)(emphasis \n     supplied).\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The Verification Annex is, of course, an integral part of \n     the Convention.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As you know, this provision of the Convention was inserted \n     at the insistence of the United States after earlier drafts, \n     which provided insufficient protection in regard to \n     unreasonable searches and seizures, had been criticized by a \n     number of U.S. scholars. The plain meaning of these words, \n     which seems too clear for argument, is that the United States \n     would have no obligation under the Convention to permit \n     access to facilities subject to its jurisdiction in violation \n     of the provisions of the Fourth Amendment. It was the clear \n     understanding of the negotiators that the purpose of the \n     provision was to obviate any possibility of conflict between \n     the obligations of the United States under the Convention and \n     the mandate of the Fourth Amendment. The Convention in its \n     final form is thus fully consistent with U.S. constitutional \n     requirements.\n       Inspections required by the Convention will be conducted \n     pursuant to implementing legislation to be adopted by \n     Congress that will define the terms, conditions and scope of \n     the inspections to be conducted in the United States by the \n     Technical Staff of the Organization for the Prohibition of \n     Chemical Weapons (OPCW) established by the Convention. I \n     understand that draft implementing legislation entitled the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act, now before \n     the Congress, specifies the procedures that will be followed \n     in the case of both routine and challenge inspections carried \n     out pursuant to the Convention. The Act requires, at a \n     minimum, an administrative search warrant before an \n     inspection can be conducted, and has elaborate provisions for \n     notice and other protections to the owner of the premises to \n     be searched. These provisions of the Act are modeled on \n     similar administrative inspection regimes already authorized \n     by Acts of Congress such as the Toxic Substances Control Act \n     and upheld by the courts. However, if Congress is concerned \n     that these provisions are constitutionally insufficient, it \n     is free under the Convention to revise the Act to include \n     more stringent requirements that conform to constitutional \n     limitations. Finally, a person subject to inspection may \n     challenge the inspection in a U.S. court, which in turn will \n     be bound to invalidate any inspection that fails to comply \n     with constitutional requirements. In view of the provisions \n     of the Verification Annex quoted above, the United States \n     would not be in violation of any international obligation in \n     such an eventuality.\n       For these reasons I conclude that there is no \n     constitutional objection to the Convention, and that the \n     rights of individuals under the Fourth Amendment will be \n     fully protected under the Convention and implementing \n     legislation of the character presently contemplated.\n       In addition, I have been involved in the field of arms \n     control as a scholar and practitioner for many years, going \n     back to the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, in connection \n     with which I appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee as Legal Adviser of the State Department. I have \n     also closely followed the negotiations for the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention. The United States has been a prime mover \n     in the development of the Convention under both Republican \n     and Democratic administrations. I am convinced that the \n     prompt ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is \n     overwhelmingly in the security interest of the United States \n     and should not be derailed by constitutional objections that \n     are so plainly without substance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Abram Chayes,\n     Felix Frankfurter, Professor of Law Emeritus.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Columbia University in the\n\n\n                                             City of New York,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 11, 1996.\n     Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: As requested, I have considered \n     whether, if the United States adhered to the Convention on \n     Chemical Weapons, the inspection provisions of the Convention \n     would raise serious issues under the United States \n     Constitution. I have concluded that those provisions would \n     not present important obstacles to U.S. adherence to the \n     Convention.\n       Like domestic laws, treaties of the United States are \n     subject to constitutional restraints. The Fourth Amendment to \n     the\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\n      United States constitution provides: ``The right of the \n     people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \n     effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall \n     not be violated * * *'' Constitutional jurisprudence has \n     established that the right to be secure applies also to \n     industrial and commercial facilities and to business records, \n     papers and effects.\n       The Constitution, however, protects the rights of private \n     persons; it does not protect governmental bodies, public \n     officials, public facilities or public papers. As to private \n     persons, the Fourth Amendment protects only against searches \n     and seizures that are ``unreasonable.'' Inspection \n     arrangements, negotiated and approved by the President and \n     consented to by the Senate, designed to give effect to a \n     treaty of major importance to the United States, carry a \n     strong presumption that they are not unreasonable.\n       The Chemical Convention itself anticipated the \n     constitutional needs of the United States. Part X of the \n     Convention, ``Challenge Inspection pursuant to Article IX,'' \n     provides: ``41. In meeting the requirement to provide access \n     as specified in paragraph 38, the inspected State party shall \n     be under the obligation to allow the greatest degree of \n     access taking into account any constitutional obligation it \n     may have with regard to proprietary rights of searches and \n     seizures.''\n       As applied to the United States, that provision is properly \n     interpreted to mean that the United States must provide \n     access as required by the Convention, but if the Constitution \n     precludes some access in some circumstances, the United \n     States must provide access to the extent the Constitution \n     permits.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I was able to hear part of the brief address by my \nfriend from Delaware. What he apparently does not know is that I was a \npart of the Lott group to which he referred. I attended the meetings. I \nparticipated. That group did accomplish a few things of minor \nsignificance, but they could not do anything of importance, not in the \nreally serious issues.\n  So then they fell back, and there have been no more meetings of the \nLott group. My suggestion has been followed about trying to do it on \nthe staff level. But if the Senator from Delaware, or anyone else, \nthinks they can drive a stake between the majority leader and me, they \nwill have to think again.\n  I am not going to try to answer the many erroneous statements he has \nmade. And I know he was ad-libbing and he was not hearing his staff \nwhisper to him, and so forth. So he was operating under difficult \ncircumstances.\n  But I say, again, I want this treaty to be made into an instrument \nthat will be beneficial to the American people and to this country. It \nis my intent to continue to insist upon that. It is my intent, along \nwith the approval of the distinguished majority leader, inasmuch as we \nhave so many new Senators who were not here last year, the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair being one of them, and did not have \nthe benefit of the testimony of witnesses, pro and con, who are highly \nrespected in the foreign relations community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2541-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2550-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. DONALD EDWARDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Maj. Gen. \nDonald Edwards, who has served for the last 16 years as the Adjutant \nGeneral of the Vermont National Guard. Ever since Ethan Allen and his \nfamous Green Mountain Boys took the British fort at Ticonderoga, \nVermonters have had a propensity to serve their nation as citizen-\nsoldiers. That tradition is alive and well today, and thanks to Don \nEdwards, the Vermont National Guard is stronger today than ever before. \nDon was instrumental in starting the Army National Guard Mountain and \nWinter Warfare School, which trains soldiers from around the Nation in \nthe rigors of winter warfare. He also excelled at being an advocate of \nVermont's interests within the Pentagon.\n  I remember the case of the 1-86th artillery battalion, which in 1992 \nwas abruptly threatened with elimination, even though it had one of the \nhighest readiness and retention rates in the entire U.S. Army. It was \nthe kind of short-sighted bureaucratic decision that Don Edwards could \nnot tolerate, and he made a strong case to me. I helped save that \nbattalion, although I had to hold up a defense bill to do it. Don never \nwavered in his devotion to do what was right for the men and women of \nthe Vermont National Guard.\n  Recently, the Vermont Air Guard received four first-place awards at \nthe Air Force's premier air combat competition, known as William Tell. \nDon always stressed to the soldiers and airmen under his command the \nimportance of training hard and as realistically as possible.\n  During Desert Storm, his philosophy paid off, as several Vermont \nGuard units deployed to Southwest Asia and performed flawlessly during \nthat conflict. Those were anxious times, and Vermonters saw a side of \nDon Edwards that they had never seen before. He was a tireless advocate \nfor our deployed soldiers, and he acted with great compassion to do \nwhatever he could to help the families of those who were deployed \noverseas.\n  I am sure that some of that attitude was shaped by his own \nexperiences in Vietnam. I know that his tireless devotion to Vermont \nveterans of all wars has helped Vermonters appreciate the extraordinary \nsacrifices that were made by ordinary citizens. It seemed like whenever \ntwo or three veterans gathered together, Don Edwards was there to lend \nweight to their cause.\n  As Don Edwards hangs up his uniform for the last time, I want to give \nhim my personal thanks for all he has done for Vermont, and to wish him \ngood luck and Godspeed in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2550-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending March 14, the U.S. imported 7,849,000 barrels \nof oil each day, 704,000 barrels more than the 7,145,000 imported \nduring the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 55 percent of their needs last \nweek, and\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nthere are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the \nPersian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent \nof its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo \nin the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America s \noil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the U.S.--now 7,849,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2550-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CPSC LAUNCHES ``RECALL ROUND-UP DAY''\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, unintentional injuries are the leading \ncause of death to persons under 35, and the fifth leading cause of \ndeath in the Nation overall. Unintentional injuries kill more children \nover age one than any disease.\n  It is astounding that there are an average 21,400 deaths and 29.4 \nmillion injuries each year related to consumer products under the \njurisdiction of a small, but effective, Federal agency--the U.S. \nConsumer Product Safety Commission [CPSC]. The CPSC finds that deaths, \ninjuries, and property damage associated with consumer products cost \nthe Nation $200 billion annually.\n  In 1996, the CPSC negotiated 375 recalls involving over 85 million \nproducts that presented a significant risk of injury to the public. \nHowever, despite recall notices and public warnings, many old hazardous \nproducts such as bean bag chairs, wooden bunk beds, mini-hammocks and \ncribs--with the potential to seriously injure or kill a child--remain \nin homes, flea markets, garage sales or in second hand stores.\n  To rid consumers' homes of hazardous products, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission under the leadership of Chairman Ann Brown, on April \n16 of this year, will launch ``Recall Round-Up Day'' by broadcasting a \nvideo to television stations across the country. The video will have \nexamples of hazardous products that might be in consumers homes, such \nas the following:\n  Bean bag chairs that can present a choking or suffocation hazard to \nchildren. Some bean bag chairs can be unzipped and children can then \ninhale the small pellets of foam filling. The CPSC is aware of at least \nfive deaths and at least 23 other incidents in which children inhaled \nor ingested bean bag filling. In the past 2 years, CPSC obtained the \nrecall of more than 10 million bean bag chairs.\n  Wooden bunk beds that can strangle young children. Since 1990, CPSC \nhas received reports of 32 children who died after becoming caught in \nbunk beds with improper openings in the top bunk structure. Since 1995, \nCPSC has obtained the recall of approximately half a million hazardous \nbunk beds.\n  Mini-hammocks that can strangle children. CPSC has received reports \nof 12 children, ages 5 to 17 years, who became entangled and died when \nusing mini-hammocks without spreader bars. Last year, CPSC obtained the \nrecall of over three million minihammocks.\n  Old cribs that can choke or suffocate a small child. Cribs having \nmore than 2\\3/8\\ inches between crib slats, corner posts, or cut outs \non the headboard or footboard present suffocation and strangulation \nhazard to babies. Each year, 50 babies die when they become trapped \nbetween broken crib parts or in cribs with older, unsafe designs.\n\n  CPSC is enlisting the help of State and local officials, as well as \nnational and State health and safety organizations, in connection with \nState and local governments throughout the Nation, to publicize a \nsafety campaign, distribute information about these and other hazardous \nproducts in the home. In some States, recalled products will be rounded \nup and brought to a central location for disposal.\n  I commend Chairman Ann Brown and the CPSC for taking this bold \naction. My State Office in Las Vegas is working with the State chapter \nof the National SafeKids Campaign, Sunrise Children's Hospital, and the \nClark County Health Dept. to organize local events throughout the State \nfor Recall Roundup. We will publicize the campaign through the media to \nreach the general public. Special efforts will be directed to reach \nchild care providers and especially new parents. The sellers of used \narticles that could include recalled products will also be alerted to \nthe hazards that used cribs, bunk beds, minihammocks and bean bag \nchairs could present to prevent the resale of these items.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join with me in this effort and to \nencourage organizations in your State to take an active role in this \nlifesaving effort on April 16. For this reason, I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record a ``Suggested List of Local Activities'' \nrecommended by the CPSC for this important Recall Round-Up Day on April \n16.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Recall Roundup Suggested State and Local Activities\n\n       1. Organize a news conference. Contact medical \n     professionals in pediatrics, children's hospitals, injury and \n     disease prevention, medical examiners offices, etc., for \n     participation in news conference.\n       2. Issue state and local news release in conjunction with \n     CPSC video news release.\n       3. Distribute printed news release information through \n     established networks.\n       4. Have State Governor, Secretary of Health, or other \n     prominent figures issue a Proclamation to kick off the event.\n       5. Offer to participate in TV/radio interviews.\n       6. Prepare media outlets in advance for release and use of \n     the CPSC video news release.\n       7. Organize local Recall Roundups using list of recalled \n     products.\n       8. Monitor flea markets and secondhand stores for recalled \n     products and provide recall information.\n       9. Provide recall lists to community and homeowner \n     associations that sponsor yard sales or that issue local news \n     letters.\n       10.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on \nthe outstanding job performed by the West Virginia National Guard in \nresponse to the recent catastrophic floods that devastated sixteen West \nVirginia counties.\n  Aviation, engineer, and troop command personnel have worked \ndiligently and wholeheartedly to deliver potable water, fuel, cleaning \nsupplies, and medicines to their fellow citizens who have been trapped \nby the flood waters. They have also provided transportation, cleanup \nassistance, and debris removal in all sixteen counties in the emergency \nzone.\n  The approximately five-hundred men and women mobilized in these Guard \nunits carry the double burden of civilian jobs in addition to their \nmilitary roles. Despite these burdens, they are capable of responding \nto an emergency at a moment's notice. Thanks to the National Guard's \nefforts, families in many of the affected counties have been able to \nreturn to their homes and begin the repair and rebuilding process. West \nVirginians in Wayne and Cabell counties are still faced with removing \nlarge amounts of debris, but again, thanks to the National Guard's \nefforts, the cleanup is on the right track.\n  I would also like to thank all of the employers throughout West \nVirginia who have supported the National Guard. Their willingness to \ncontinue to accommodate the National Guard through all of the flood \nemergencies suffered by West Virginia communities in recent years is \nremarkable and is appreciated by every West Virginian who has \nbenefitted from Guard efforts.\n  I offer my sincere thanks to all of the National Guard personnel \ninvolved in helping in West Virginia's recovery from this and every \nnatural disaster. May their efforts to aid West Virginia's flood \nvictims continue, and may they receive the recognition and praise that \nare so merited. They are, indeed, famous men and women to their fellow \ncitizens.\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n REPORT OF A PROPOSED RESCISSION OF BUDGETARY RESOURCES--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 23\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January 30, 1975, as \nmodified by the order of April 11, 1986, to the Committee on \nAppropriations, to the Committee on the Budget, and to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct of 1974, I herewith report one proposed rescission of budgetary \nresources, totaling $10 million.\n  The proposed rescission affects the Department of Energy.\n                                                  William J.

In order to do that, we \nmust offer more opportunity and demand more responsibility from all our \ncitizens. We must help young people get the education and training they \nneed, make our streets safer from crime, help Americans succeed at home \nand at work, protect our environment for generations to come, and \nensure that America remains the strongest force for peace and freedom \nin the world. Most of all, we must come together as one community to \nmeet our challenges.\n  Our Nation's leaders understood this a quarter-century ago when they \nlaunched the modern era of environmental protection with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. NEPA's authors understood that environmental \nprotection, economic opportunity, and social responsibility are \ninterrelated. NEPA determined that the Federal Government should work \nin concert with State and local governments and citizens ``to create \nand maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in \nproductive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other \nrequirements of present and future generations of Americans.''\n  We've made great progress in 25 years as we've sought to live up to \nthat challenge. As we look forward to the next 25 years of \nenvironmental progress, we do so with a renewed determination. \nMaintaining and enhancing our environment, passing on a clean world to \nfuture generations, is a sacred obligation of citizenship. We all have \nan interest in clean air, pure water, safe food, and protected national \ntreasures. Our environment is, literally, our common ground.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I would like to address the body today \non legislation that I am introducing, along with Senator Lieberman, \nSenator DeWine, and Senator Kohl, an act called the Television \nImprovement Act of 1997. It is my sincere hope that this bill will help \nsolve one of our nation's most troubling problems.\n  I am fresh off the campaign trail, as the Senator from Georgia is \nfresh off the campaign trail. Throughout the 1996 campaign, I traveled \nacross the State of Kansas and talked with thousands of people. I came \naway from that experience convinced that the most important task that \nwe as a Nation face today is renewing the American culture.\n  I can recall countless meetings where individuals, particularly \nparents, would come up to me worried about the future of the American \nculture, particularly as it affects their children, and they constantly \nfelt they were having to fight the culture to raise their kids. They \nhearken back to a time when they didn't feel like they were so opposed \nby the nature of the American culture. They recall a time when the \nculture was supportive of what they were doing and helped them in \nraising a good and solid family. They were just pleading for help. \n``Help us be able to come to a point where we can effectively raise our \nchildren. Don't make us have to constantly fight our culture.''\n  Hollywood is the center of gravity for the American culture and, \nincreasingly, the world's culture. Hollywood has changed the culture in \nthis country, and, unfortunately, it has led to a decline in our \nculture. Over the past 15 years, television has made our children think \nthat violence is OK, that sexuality out of wedlock is expected and \nencouraged, and that criminal activity is OK. Well, these things are \nnot OK, and it's time the industry changed television to make it easier \nfor parents to raise children.\n  The Television Improvement Act of 1997 is intended to encourage the \nbroadcasting industry to make raising children easier. What it intends \nto do is to allow the broadcast industry--the television, cable, and \nmotion picture industries to enter into, again, a code of conduct \ncomparable to the one they used until 1983. They would once again be \nable to say that there is a standard below which they will not go, and \nthey can collaborate to establish that standard without running afoul \nof Federal antitrust laws.\n  Previously, the NAB had a self-imposed code of conduct that governed \ntelevision content. The code recognized the impact of television on our \nchildren as well as the responsibility that broadcasters shared in \nproviding programming that used television's influence carefully. \nHowever, in 1983, a Federal district court determined that some of the \nadvertising provisions of the code violated Federal antitrust laws.\n  Although the court did not rule that any of the code's programming \nstandards violated antitrust laws, the NAB decided to stop using the \nentire code. The past 15 years have demonstrated that the code of \nconduct is sorely missed. Television has declined over the past 15 \nyears, in no small part due to the absence of the code. I don't think \nanybody in this body could argue--or in this country who would \ndisagree--that the nature of American television has declined over the \npast 15 years.\n  Let me read for the body a statement that is from the old code of \nconduct that the National Association of Broadcasters used until 1983. \nIt sounds almost quaint today. But listen to the content of what the \nindustry itself had before. It says:\n\n       Above and beyond the requirements of the law, broadcasters \n     must consider the family atmosphere in which many of their \n     programs are viewed. There shall be no graphic portrayal of \n     sexual acts by sight or sound. The portrayal of implied \n     sexual acts must be essential to the plot and presented in a \n     responsible and tasteful manner.\n\n  I do not think there would be many people today who would say that \nthis reflects the nature of television today. But I think many \nAmericans today would say, ``That is what I want television to be today \nso I don't have to always fight the TV to raise my kids.''\n  It is not enough for everybody to say, ``Just turn it off.'' My wife \nand I are raising three children. It is a little tougher than just \nsaying, ``Turn it off.'' It is about being there all the time. We are \ntrying. One of us is there all the time. It is also not enough to say, \n``Well, we have a rating code so you know what is on television.''\n  We are pleading with the industry, saying, ``Let's go back to that \ntime when you used a code because television was better then and it so \ndirectly impacts the culture and the soul of America.'' The average \nAmerican spends 5 hours a day watching TV. Most would liken it to a \nstovepipe of black soot going into the mind and into the soul. Why \ndon't we change that back to the way it used to be, and have it as a \nwell of fresh spring water going into the mind and into the soul?\n  The industry is fully capable of doing this. Witness some of the \ncurrent shows, especially ``Touched by an Angel,'' which is a leading \nshow by CBS today. It is a good, positive, and uplifting show. But, \nsadly, there are far more that are far more degrading that would lead \none more to the stovepipe analogy rather than the fresh spring well \nwater.\n  We are pleading with the industry with this bill. This bill provides \nno additional authority to the Federal Government; not an ounce of \nadditional authority to the FCC. It is a plea to the industry to help \nus. We are having trouble. The American family has been under attack. \nIn many places it has disintegrated. In our inner cities we have 70 \npercent of our children born to single moms. In many places we no \nlonger have families, one of the basic tenets of culture.\n  We are asking by this very simple act and pleading with the industry. \n``Let's go back to the time when television did not hurt our lives.'' \nAnd we are not suggesting censorship. If we have a better product \ncoming out of this industry, we will have a better American culture. We \nwill have a better world culture because Hollywood is the center of \ngravity for not only this culture but increasingly the world's culture. \nIt is coming up time and time again.\n  So we are introducing this bill today, a bipartisan bill, requesting \nthat the industry negotiate and work together on a code of conduct the \nlike of which it had before.\n  We will be holding hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee. We \nhave been joined by the chairman and the ranking member of the \nappropriate Judiciary subcommittee who are cosponsoring this bill. We \nanticipate that they will have hearings on it as well. It is a follow-\non to Senator Simon's work in this area in 1990. We hope that it will \nbe much more successful. If it is not, there will be further action \ncoming to try to address this corrosive effect that, unfortunately, \ntelevision has on our society and, indeed, on the world.\n  So, Mr. President, we are introducing this bill today asking the \nindustry for help to lead our culture back to a brighter and a better \ntime. They can do it. They are capable of doing it.\n  Mr. President, again, let me say that I am pleased to introduce today \nwith Senators Lieberman, DeWine, and Kohl, the Television Improvement \nAct of 1997, a bill that I believe will help solve one of our Nation's \nmost troubling problems. Throughout the 1996 campaign, I traveled \nacross the State of Kansas and talked with thousands of\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\npeople. I came away from that experience with the conclusion that the \nmost important task that we as a nation face today is renewing the \nAmerican culture.\n  People are desperately worried about the decline of our culture and \nabout the decline of the American family. Many of the parents that I \nspoke with during the summer and fall believe that they increasingly \nhave to fight their culture to raise their children. These parents feel \nthat American culture in the 1990's actually makes it more difficult to \nraise children.\n  Hollywood is the center of gravity for the American culture and \nincreasingly the world's culture. Hollywood has changed the culture in \nthis country, and, unfortunately, it has led to a decline in our \nculture. Over the past 15 years, television has made our children think \nthat violence is OK, that sexuality out of wedlock is expected and \nencouraged, and that criminal activity is OK. Well, these things are \nnot OK, and it's time the industry changed television to make it easier \nfor parents to raise children.\n  Previously, the National Association of Broadcasters had a self-\nimposed code of conduct that governed television content. The code \nrecognized the impact of television on our children as well as the \nresponsibility that broadcasters shared in providing programming that \nused television's influence carefully. However, in 1983, a Federal \ndistrict court determined that some of the advertising provisions \nincluded in the code violated Federal antitrust laws.\n  Although the court did not rule that any of the code's programming \nstandards violated antitrust laws, the NAB decided to stop using the \nentire code. The past 15 years have demonstrated that the code of \nconduct is sorely missed. Television has declined over the past 15 \nyears, in no small part due to the absence of the code.\n  For this reason, Senators Lieberman, DeWine, Kohl, and I are \nintroducing this bill to make perfectly clear that the broadcast \nindustry is not violating Federal antitrust laws if its members \ncollaborate on a code of conduct that includes voluntary guidelines \nintended to alleviate the negative impact that television content has \nhad on our children and to promote educational and otherwise beneficial \nprogramming.\n  In drafting this legislation, we have built upon Senator Simon's \nTelevision Program Improvement Act of 1990. Unlike that law, however, \nthe Television Improvement Act of 1997 would not include a sunset \nprovision, and we have expanded the scope of the antitrust exemption to \nenable the industry to tackle such issues as the proliferation of \nprogramming that contains sexual content and condones criminal \nbehavior.\n  Senator Lieberman and I plan to hold hearings in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee's Government Management and Restructuring \nSubcommittee, which I chair and on which Senator Lieberman serves as \nthe ranking Democrat. The hearings will explore the impact that the \nFederal Government has had on the ability of the television industry to \nbroadcast more inspirational and less harmful programming. We will \nexamine whether the application of Federal antitrust laws to a \ncollaboration by the broadcasters to promote better programming hinders \nthe industry's ability to police itself and has resulted in a decline \nin television broadcasting. The Federal Government should not be \nimpeding any voluntary effort by the industry to improve the quality of \nprogramming; the Government should be encouraging such an effort.\n  Let me just reiterate that we are not calling for a government \nmandate to be imposed upon the industry, nor are we providing the FCC \nwith an ounce of additional authority with respect to broadcasting. \nWhat we are doing is trying to encourage the industry to do what it did \nprior to 1983--broadcast less programming that harms our kids and more \nprogramming that helps us raise our kids. We want Hollywood to start \nproducing, and we want the broadcasters to start airing, better \nprogramming.\n  I ask that the bill be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud today to join with my \ncolleagues Senator Brownback, DeWine, and Kohl in introducing the \nTelevision Program Improvement Act of 1997, a bill we believe will help \ndirectly address the public's concerns about the declining standards of \ntelevision and that will hopefully lead the television industry to \nexercise more responsibility for the programming it puts on the air.\n  The industry has tried in part to respond to the concerns of parents \nabout the negative influence television is having on children by \ncreating a rating system for sex, violence, and vulgar content. This \nsystem is a good start, but there is a general consensus it does not go \nfar enough in providing parents with the information they need to make \nwise choices for their children.\n  When I recently testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on \nthis issue, I tried to get this point across by comparing the \nindustry's system to putting up a sign in front of shark-infested \nwaters that said ``Be careful when swimming.'' That is to say that, \nwhile these ratings provide a warning to the viewer, they don't tell us \nwhy we need to be warned.\n  But I also used this metaphor to make a larger point, which is \nregardless of how informative the ratings are, what parents really want \nis to get the sharks out of the water, to improve the quality of \nprogramming on the air, and make it safe for their kids to go swimming \nagain.\n  The intent of the legislation we are introducing today, the \nTelevision Program Improvement Act of 1997, is to reiterate that \nmessage and to urge the industry to focus on what's at the heart of \nthis debate over the TV rating system--a very real, broadly-felt \nconcern that television has become a destructive force in our society \nand it is doing substantial damage to the hearts, minds, and souls of \nour children.\n  This bill really amounts to a plea on our part to the industry for \ntheir help. Moreover, it is an attempt to move this debate beyond the \nquestion of rights, which we all accept, acknowledge and support, and \nbegin talking more about responsibilities.\n  Specifically, the kind of responsibility that broadcasters once \nembraced through a comprehensive code of conduct, in which they \nacknowledged the enormous power they commanded and the need to wield it \ncarefully, and in which they recognized that they had an obligation \nunder the law to serve the public interest. I would urge my colleagues \nto take a look at some of the standards the Nation's broadcasters set \nfor themselves in the old NAB TV Code, which we've excerpted in the \nfindings of our legislation, and you'll see that they are quite \nremarkable statements of responsibility.\n\n  After reading these principles, I would urge my colleagues to compare \nthem to some of the comments made recently by industry leaders, such as \nthe network official who proclaimed ``it is not the responsibility of \nnetwork television to program for the children of America,'' or the MTV \nexecutive who said his network ``is not safe for kids'' but markets it \ndirectly to them anyway.\n  Watch what these programmers are bringing into our homes today, and \nit is clear that the face of television has changed dramatically since \nthe industry abandoned the old NAB Code in 1983 and abandoned the ethic \nundergirding it. It is also clear that while the networks have profited \nfrom the resulting competition downward, it is the American family who \nis paying the price--in the form of the awful daytime talk shows that \nparade the most perverse forms of behavior into our living rooms and \nteach our children the worst ways to settle conflicts, and the excesses \nof prime-time comedies that amount to little more than what we used to \ncall dirty jokes.\n  The rise of these programs leave little doubt that this debate is \nabout much more than the threat of violence--which was the reason for \nthe original Television Program Improvement Act sponsored by Senator \nSimon in 1990--although this threat remains a serious problem. What is \ndriving so much of the public's concern is the deluge of casual sex and \nvulgarities that characterizes so much of television today. The \ncollective force of these messages leaves parents feeling as if they \nare in a losing struggle to raise their own children, to give them \nstrong values, to teach them right from wrong and guide them to \nacceptable forms of behavior.\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\n  With the bill we're introducing today, we are asking the television \nindustry to do no more than what it did as recently as the early \n1980's, and that is to draw some lines that they will not go below, to \ndeclare, as author and noted commentator Alan Ehrenhalt has said, \n``that some things are too lurid, too violent, or too profane for a \nmass audience to see.''\n  If the industry is not willing to refill that responsible role, there \nwill be increasing pressure on the Government to do it for them. One of \nthe most telling polls I've seen recently appeared in the Wall Street \nJournal, which showed that 46 percent of Americans favor more \nGovernment controls on television to protect children. It's not a \ncoincidence that there are bills being prepared in Congress that would \nin fact censor what is on the air.\n  Our legislation is designed to help us avoid reaching that point. It \nwill ideally remind the industry of its obligations to the public we \nboth serve, and that changing the subject, as some in the industry \nprefer to do, won't change the minds of the millions of American \nfamilies who want programming that reflects rather than rejects their \nvalues. Again, to return to my metaphor, we are simply making a plea to \nthe industry to take the sharks out of the water, and make it safe for \nour kids to go swimming, or perhaps more aptly, to go channel-surfing \nagain.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof my remarks be included in the appropriate place in the Record to \naccompany this legislation. I also ask unanimous consent that a summary \nof the Television Program Improvement Act of 1997 be printed in the \nRecord. And to provide my colleagues with some additional background on \nthe old NAB Television Code and what has happened to television since \nit was abandoned, I ask unanimous consent that a factsheet my staff has \nprepared be included in the Record. This factsheet helps summarize the \nbill's findings and put them into some historical context.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    Summary of the Television Program Improvement Act of 1997--TPIA\n\n\n                          WHAT IS THE PURPOSE\n\n       The TPIA is an attempt to persuade the television industry \n     to directly address the public's growing concerns about the \n     negative influence television is having on our children and \n     our country today. Rather than calling for any form of \n     censorship or government restrictions on content, this \n     legislation would encourage industry leaders to act more \n     responsibly in choosing what kinds of programming they \n     produce and when it is aired. The nation's broadcasters once \n     embraced this kind of responsibility in the form of a \n     comprehensive code of conduct, which featured a widely-\n     followed set of baseline programming standards and which \n     showed a special sensitivity to the impact television has on \n     children. This code was abandoned in 1983, and the TPIA would \n     ideally open the door to the reintroduction of a similar set \n     of standards, one that is geared toward making television \n     more family-friendly for 1997 America.\n\n\n                         WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\n\n       This proposal builds on the original Television Program \n     Improvement Act of 1990, which created an antitrust exemption \n     for the broadcast and cable industries that allowed them to \n     collaborate on a set of ``voluntary guidelines'' aimed at \n     reducing the threat of violence on television. The TPIA of \n     1997 would permanently reinstate that antitrust exemption \n     (which expired at the end of 1993) and then broaden it. The \n     new exemption would permit the television industry to \n     collaborate on an expanded set of guidelines designed to \n     address the public's concerns about the broad range of \n     programming--not only violence but also sexual content, \n     vulgar language, and the lack of quality educational programs \n     for children.\n\n\n                       WHAT THE BILL WOULD NOT DO\n\n       This proposal would not give the government any authority \n     to censor or control in any way what is seen on television. \n     Any guidelines or programming standards the industry chose to \n     adopt would be purely voluntary and could not be enforced by \n     the government in any way or result in any form of economic \n     boycott. Nor would the TPIA result in the ``whitewashing'' of \n     television or prevent networks from showcasing sophisticated, \n     mature-themed works such as ``Schindler's List'' and ``NYPD \n     Blue.'' Last, the television industry could not use the \n     antitrust exemption to fix advertising prices or engage in \n     any form of anticompetitive behavior.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Television Code of Conduct Background Sheet\n\n\n                        THE NAB TELEVISION CODE\n\n       The first broadcaster TV code was implemented in 1952, to \n     provide broadcasters with guidelines for meeting their \n     statutory obligation to serve the public interest.\n       The NAB required all members to follow the code, which was \n     enforced by a committee called the NAB Code Authority. \n     Stations that adhered to the code were permitted to display a \n     seal of approval on screen known as the ``NAB Television Seal \n     of Good Practice.'' Those members that were found to have \n     violated the code could be suspended and denied the ability \n     to display the seal.\n       The NAB Code was abandoned in 1983 following an antitrust \n     challenge brought by the Reagan Justice Department.\n       In that case, Justice filed a motion for summary judgement \n     in the D.C. Federal District Court in 1982 challenging three \n     provisions restricting the sale of advertising. These \n     provisions limited: 1) the number of minutes per hour a \n     network or station may allocate to commercials; 2) the number \n     of commercials which could be broadcast in an hour; and 3) \n     the number of products that could be advertised in a \n     commercial. The court ruled that one of the provisions--the \n     multiple product standard--constituted a per se violation of \n     the antitrust laws, and granted Justice's motion for summary \n     judgement on those grounds.\n       In November 1982, the NAB entered into a consent decree \n     with Justice and agreed to throw out the advertising \n     guidelines being challenged. Then, claiming that the TV Code \n     in general left it vulnerable to antitrust lawsuits, the NAB \n     threw out the entire code in January of 1983.\n       The programming standards contained in the code were never \n     found to violate any antitrust laws during the code's 31-year \n     existence.\n\n\n                          THE FAMILY HOUR CASE\n\n       In 1975, after being prodded by FCC Chairman Dick Wiley, \n     the NAB added a family viewing policy to its TV code. This \n     policy said that entertainment programming inappropriate for \n     a general family audience should not be aired between the \n     hours of 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. EST.\n       In October of 1975, the Writers Guild of America (led by \n     Norman Lear) filed a lawsuit challenging the family viewing \n     policy on First Amendment grounds, alleging that the NAB had \n     been coerced by the government into adopting the policy.\n       The District Court struck down the family viewing provision \n     in the code in 1976, concluding that FCC Chairman Wiley had \n     engaged in a ``successful attempt . . . to pressure the \n     networks and the NAB into adopting a programming policy they \n     did not wish to adopt.''\n       However, the court decision did not rule that a voluntary \n     family viewing policy would be unconstitutional, and said \n     that networks were free to implement a family hour policy on \n     their own.\n       In the end, the District Court's decision was vacated and \n     remanded on appeal in 1979, on the grounds that the District \n     Court was not the proper forum for the initial resolution of \n     a case relating to broadcast regulation. The case was \n     returned to the FCC for judgement, and in 1983 the FCC \n     concluded that the family viewing policy did not violate the \n     First Amendment, ruling that Chairman Wiley's actions \n     amounted to permissible jawboning and not coercion.\n       No court has ever ruled that a voluntary family hour \n     violates the First Amendment rights of broadcasters or of \n     producers.\n\n\n          THE ORIGINAL ``TELEVISION PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT ACT''\n\n       Senator Paul Simon (D-IL) sponsored legislation in 1989 to \n     create a temporary antitrust exemption that would allow the \n     television industry to collaborate on a set of guidelines \n     designed to ``alleviate the negative impact'' of television \n     violence. The exemption had a life of three years.\n       This legislation was passed by Congress in the waning days \n     of the 1990 session as part of the Judicial Improvements Act \n     (a federal judgeships bill).\n       When the Simon bill first moved through the Senate in 1989, \n     the Judiciary Committee approved an amendment that would \n     broaden the bill's scope to cover guidelines relating to the \n     glamorization of drug use.\n       The version passed by the Senate also was broadened to \n     cover sexual content. Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) succeeded in \n     passing an amendment relating to sexually explicit material \n     by a vote of 91-0.\n       The language relating to sexual content and the depiction \n     of drug use was stripped from the bill that came out of \n     conference after House Democrats objected to broadening the \n     scope of the exemption beyond violence.\n\n\n                THE INDUSTRY RESPONSE TO THE SIMON BILL\n\n       A few months prior to the passage of the Simon bill, the \n     NAB issued new ``voluntary programming principles'' in four \n     areas: children's television, indecency and obscenity, drugs, \n     and violence. These principles were general statements \n     resembling several provisions in the old NAB Code, but they \n     were strictly voluntary and unenforceable.\n       After the Simon bill passed, the broadcast and cable \n     industries held a few meetings in 1991, but with no \n     discernible results.\n       As concern about television violence mounted, the networks \n     felt increasing pressure to produce some results. In December \n     of 1992, the major broadcast networks agreed to adopt a new \n     set of joint standards on the depiction of violence.\n       Although billed as being ``new,'' the networks made clear \n     that these guidelines tracked closely with their own \n     individual\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n     programming standards. The joint guidelines were broadly-\n     worded and did not make any specific statements regarding the \n     time shows with graphic violence should be aired, noting only \n     that the composition of the audience should be taken into \n     consideration.\n       In June of 1993, the networks took the additional step of \n     agreeing on a set of ``parental advisories'' that would be \n     applied to programs with violent content.\n       With criticism from the public and Congress continuing to \n     grow, the four major networks and the cable industry \n     announced in February of 1994 that they would conduct \n     separate monitoring studies to measure the level of violence \n     in their programming. The first of these studies was done in \n     1995.\n\n\n                      THE SIMON LEGACY ON VIOLENCE\n\n       The results of the Simon legislation could accurately be \n     described as mixed.\n       On the one hand, the 1996 UCLA violence study suggested \n     that the amount of violence on broadcast television had \n     declined somewhat since it peaked a few years earlier, and \n     industry observers generally acknowledge that \n     primetime series television has become less violent. The \n     UCLA study also found that the networks had taken some \n     steps to reduce the violence in on-air promotions. ``The \n     overall message is one of progress and improvement,'' the \n     UCLA study concluded. ``The overall picture is not one of \n     excessive violence.''\n       On the other hand, the UCLA study still found that there is \n     still a serious problem with violence on broadcast \n     television. It singled out the high number of violent \n     theatrical movies, five primetime series that ``raised \n     frequent concerns,'' and the disturbing rise of ``reality'' \n     shows (such as Fox's ``When Animals Attack\") that often \n     feature graphic violence.\n       In addition, the National Television Violence Study, the \n     comprehensive review sponsored by the cable industry, is \n     scheduled to release its 1996 report later this month, and it \n     is generally expected to show that the kinds of violence \n     depicted on both broadcast and cable television still \n     presents a real threat to viewers.\n\n\n                         THE CURRENT SITUATION\n\n       When asked about reviving a code of conduct, some \n     television industry leaders have expressed concern about \n     potential antitrust lawsuits that might arise.\n       The Justice Department, however, has issued rulings since \n     the Simon exemption expired that strongly suggest that a \n     voluntary code of conduct would not run afoul of any \n     antitrust laws.\n       In a ``business review'' letter released in November 1993, \n     the Justice Department told Simon that additional steps the \n     industry took to reduce the threat of violence ``may be \n     likened to traditional standard setting efforts that do not \n     necessarily restrain competition and may have significant \n     procompetitive benefits.''\n       Justice repeated this finding in another business review \n     letter sent to Senator Lieberman in January 1994 regarding \n     the video game industry's efforts to develop a rating system \n     for violent and sexual content.\n       Some in the television industry also contend that a code of \n     conduct is unnecessary because the major broadcast networks \n     and most local stations and cable networks all have \n     individual programming standards to which they adhere.\n       The reality, however, is that few people know that these \n     standards even exist. That's largely because they are often \n     hidden from public view. Of the big four networks, only CBS \n     will release its programming standards to the public. ABC, \n     NBC, and Fox have refused to do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Mack, Mr. Allard, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Reid, Mr. Breaux and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 472. A bill to provide for referenda in which the residents of \nPuerto Rico may express democratically their preferences regarding the \npolitical status of the territory, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             THE PUERTO RICO SELF-DETERMINATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague from \nFlorida today in the introduction of the Puerto Rico Self-Determination \nAct.\n  In the 104th Congress, I joined as a cosponsor of S. 2019, with a \nbipartisan effort in the Senate to deal with this issue. I know that \nsome of my colleagues will question the need for Congress to take up \nthis issue. The most common reaction is that we should let Puerto \nRicans decide the issue for themselves. The problem with that approach \nis that there are two parties in that relationship: Congress, due to \nits constitutional plenary power expressly vested in it by the \nterritorial clause of article IV, section 3, clause 2, on the one hand \nand the people of Puerto Rico who have U.S. citizenship but are not yet \nfully self-governing on the other.\n  When Congress failed to approve legislation to provide a status \nresolution process in 1991, the Puerto Ricans conducted a status vote, \nand the commonwealth option was defined on the ballot in the terms most \nfavorable to its approval, to the point that it promised a lot more \nthan Congress could ever approve. Even with the ballot definition that \nwould significantly enhance the current status, the existing \ncommonwealth relationship received less than a majority of the vote. So \nthere is a serious issue of the legitimacy of the current less-than-\nequal or less-than-full self-governing status, especially given the \nU.S. assertion to the United Nations in 1953 that Puerto Rico was on a \npath toward decolonization.\n  That is why the legislature of Puerto Rico passed Concurrent \nResolution 2, on January 23, 1997, requesting Congress to sponsor a \nvote based on definitions it would be willing to consider, if approved \nby voters. With timely approval of this legislation, 1997 will be the \nyear Congress provides the framework for the resolution of the Puerto \nRican status question, through a three-phase decisionmaking process \nthat will culminate during the second decade of the next century. It \nwill be a process with respect to the right of residents of Puerto Rico \nto become fully self-governing, based on local self-determination, and, \nat the same time, recognizes that the United States also has a right of \nself-determination in its relationship to Puerto Rico.\n  Consequently, resolution of the status of Puerto Rico should take \nplace in accordance with the terms of a transition plan that is \ndetermined by Congress to be in the national interest. Acceptance of \nsuch a congressionally approved transition plan by the qualified voters \nof Puerto Rico in a free and informed act of self-determination will be \nrequired before the process leading to change of the present status \nwill commence.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, joined in by nine other \ncolleagues, and my colleague from Florida, creates an evenhanded \nprocess that can lead to either separate sovereignty or statehood, \ndepending on whether Congress and the residents of Puerto Rico approve \nthe terms of the implementation of either of the two options of full \nself-government. Preservation of the current status also will be an \noption on the plebiscite ballot. However, the existing unincorporated \nterritory status, including the commonwealth structure of local \ngovernment, is not a constitutionally guaranteed form of self-\ngovernment. Thus, until full self-government is achieved for Puerto \nRico, there will be a need for periodic self-determination procedures \nas provided in this legislation.\n  Whichever new status proves acceptable to Congress and the people of \nPuerto Rico, final implementation of the new status could be subject to \napproval by Congress and the people of Puerto Rico, at such time in the \nfirst or second decade of the next century as a transition process is \ncompleted.\n  This explanation of the bill should dispel any concern in this body \nor the House that empowerment of the people of Puerto Rico to exercise \nthe right of self-determination will impair the ability of Congress to \nwork its will regarding the status of Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. President, in 1956, 4 years after Congress and the people of \nPuerto Rico approved the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico, the U.S. Supreme Court considered the constitutional nature and \nstatus of unincorporated territories such as Puerto Rico. In its \nopinion in the case of Reid v. Covert (354 U.S. 1), the Supreme Court \nconfirmed that the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution--article \nIV, section 3, clause 2--confers on Congress the power, in the court's \nwords, ``. . . to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily \nterritories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions . . .''\n  While the Reid case was not a territorial status decision, it is \nsignificant that the Supreme Court's opinion in this case recognizes \nthe temporary nature of the unincorporated territory status defined by \nthe high court in an earlier line of status decisions known as the \nInsular Cases. For even though Puerto Ricans have had statutory U.S. \ncitizenship since 1917, and local constitutional self-government \nsimilar to that of the States since 1952, it has become quite clear \nthat U.S. citizens residing in an unincorporated territory cannot \nbecome fully self-governing in the Federal constitutional system on the \nbasis of equality with their fellow\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\ncitizens residing in the States of the Union.\n  Specifically, unincorporated territorial status with the commonwealth \nstructure for local self-government cannot be converted into a \npermanent form of union with constitutionally guaranteed U.S. \ncitizenship, or equal legal and political rights with citizens in the \nStates including voting rights in national elections and representation \nin Congress. At the same time, Congress cannot abdicate, divest or \ndispose of its constitutional authority and responsibility under the \nterritorial clause or be bound by a statutory conferral of special \nrights intended to make the citizens of a territory whole for the lack \nof equal rights under the Federal constitution.\n  The concept of an unalterable bilateral pact between Congress and the \nterritories is politically implausible and constitutionally \nimpermissible. A mutual consent based relationship would amount to a \nlocal veto power over acts of Congress and would give the territories \nrights and powers superior to those of the States. Indeed, I am not \ncertain what the results would be if the States were given the option \nof trading in representation in Congress and the vote in Presidential \nelections for the power to veto Federal law, but it is a prospect \ninconsistent with American federalism.\n  Thus, altering our constitutional system to attempt to accommodate \nthe unincorporated territories in this way would be a disproportionate, \ninequitable, and politically perverse remedy for the problems the \nterritories are experiencing due to the lack of voting in Federal \nelections or representation in Congress.\n  Moreover, the concept of enhancing a less-than-equal status so that \nthe disenfranchisement of U.S. citizens in the Federal political proces \nbecomes permanent would arrest the process of self-determination and \ndecolonization that began when the local constitution was established \nby Congress and the voters in the territory in 1952.\n  It would reverse the progress that has been made toward full self-\ngovernment to attempt to transform a temporary territorial status into \na permanent one, although that is precisely what has been attempted by \nsome in Puerto Rico for the last 40 years. Some in Congress have \nfacilitated and promoted the fatally flawed notion that Puerto Rico \ncould become a nation within a nation--if only at the level of partisan \npolitics while being careful never to formally accept or commit that it \ncould be constitutionally sustained.\n  In reality, Puerto Rico is capable of becoming a State or a separate \nnation, or of remaining under the territorial clause if that is what \nthe people and Congress prefer. But a decision to retain territorial \nstatus must be based on acceptance that this is a temporary status \nunder the territorial clause, which can lead to full self-\ngovernment outside the territorial clause only when Congress and the \nvoters determine to pursue a recognized form of separate nationhood or \nfull incorporation into the Federal political process leading to \nstatehood.\n\n  Thus, the question becomes one of how long can a less-than-equal and \nnon-self-governing status continue now that Puerto Rico has \nconstitutional self-government at the local level and has established \ninstitutions and traditions which are based upon, modeled after, and \nhighly compatible with those of the United States? How long is \ntemporary when we consider that Puerto Rico has been within U.S. \nsovereignty and the U.S. customs territory for a century?\n  The proposals in the past that the self-determination process be \nself-executing may have had the appearance of empowering the people to \ndetermine their destiny. However, any attempt to bind Congress and the \npeople to a choice the full effect and implications of which cannot be \nknown at the time the initial choice is made is actually a form of \ndisempowerment. For self-determination to be legitimate it must be \ninformed, and a one-stage binding and self-executing process prevent \nboth parties to the process--Congress and the people--from knowing what \nit is they are approving.\n  Any process which does not enable Congress and the voters to define \nthe options and approve the terms for implementation through a \ndemocratic process which involves a response by each party to the \nfreely expressed wishes of the other as part of an orderly self-\ndetermination procedure is a formula for stagnation under the status \nquo.\n  That is why the legislation defining a self-determination process for \nPuerto Rico must be based on the successful process Congress prescribed \nin 1950 through which the current constitution was approved by Congress \nand the voters in 1952. That process empowered the people and Congress \nto approve the process itself, then approve the new relationship \ndefined through the process.\n  As explained below, this is the most democratic procedure possible \ngiven the complicated dilemma faced by the United States and Puerto \nRico. For only when the people express their preference between status \noptions defined in a manner acceptable to Congress can the United \nStates inform the people of the terms under which the preferred option \ncould be accepted by Congress. This would empower the people to then \nengage in an informed act of self-determination, and it would empower \nCongress to define the national interest throughout the process.\n  In the 104th Congress, S. 2019, was a response to Concurrent \nResolution 62, adopted by the Legislature of Puerto Rico on December \n14, 1994, and directed to the U.S. Congress, requesting a response to \nthe results of a 1993 plebiscite conducted in Puerto Rico under local \nlaw. See, Congressional Record S9555-S9559, August 2, 1996. Like a \nsimilar locally managed vote in 1967, the 1993 vote did not resolve the \nquestion of Puerto Rico's future status, in large part because of \npervasive confusion and misinformation about the legal nature of Puerto \nRico's current status.\n  The problem of chronic nonproductive debate in Puerto Rico and in \nCongress with respect to definition of the current status of Puerto \nRico, as well as the options for change, is examined carefully in House \nReport 104-713, part 1, July 26, 1996, pp. 8-23, 29-36. In addition to \nresponding to Resolution 62 by introducing legislation addressing the \nsubject matter of that request by the elected representatives of the \nresidents of Puerto Rico, S. 2019 was intended to complement and \nsupport the efforts of a bipartisan group of knowledgeable Members in \nthe House to address the troubling issues raised in House Report 104-\n713, part 1.\n  S. 2019 was a companion measure to H.R. 3024, the United States-\nPuerto Rico Political Status Act, which was the subject of House Report \n104-713, part 1. Although H.R. 3024 was scheduled for a vote by the \nHouse in the last days of the 104th Congress, and overwhelming approval \nwas expected, a vote was delayed due to ancillary issues. However, \nimportant amendments to H.R. 3024 were agreed upon by participants in \nthe House deliberations, and some of these should be incorporated in \nany measure to be considered in the 105th Congress.\n\n  For example, because the debate in the 104th Congress and in the 1996 \nelections in Puerto Rico clarified certain fundamental issues regarding \ndefinition of status options, it may now be appropriate to include a \nthree-way array of ballot options in any future status referendum. \nThus, commonwealth, independence, and statehood should appear side-by-\nside on the ballot the next time there is a status vote in Puerto Rico.\n  In the 104th Congress I concurred in the bipartisan position that \ndeveloped in the House deliberations in support of a two-part ballot, \nseparating the question of preserving the current unincorporated \nterritory status from the two options for change to a permanent form of \nfull self-government--separate sovereignty or statehood. However, the \nagreed upon House bill amendments and this new Senate bill make it \nclear that separate nationality or statehood remain the two paths to \nfull self-government, and that commonwealth is a territorial clause \nstatus. I believe this approach will result in a free and informed act \nof self-determination by the residents based on accurate definitions.\n  This will simplify the structure of the ballot, and make it all the \nmore imperative that the definitions of status options also remain as \nsimple and straightforward as possible. All the options presented on \nthe ballot in a future status referendum must be based on the objective \nelements of each status option under applicable provisions\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\nof the U.S. Constitution and international law as recognized by the \nUnited States.\n  In this connection, it must be noted that in the last four decades \nevery attempt by Congress and territorial leaders to define the status \noptions and establish a procedure to resolve the status question has \nfailed. The last process which produced a tangible result and advanced \nPuerto Rico's progress toward self-government was that which Congress \nestablished in 1950 to allow the residents of Puerto Rico to organize \nlocal constitutional government.\n  Thus, instead of trying to revisit battles of the past over any of \nthe bills considered by Congress in 1990 and 1991, a better model for \ntaking the next step in the self-determination process for Puerto Rico \nis the one employed by Congress to authorize and establish the current \ncommonwealth structure for local self-government based on consent of \nthe voters. The process established under Federal law in 1950 was based \non a three-stage process through which the proposed new form of self-\ngovernment was defined, approved and implemented with consent of both \nthe United States and the residents of the territory at each stage.\n  In the successful 1950 process, Congress set forth in U.S. Public Law \n600 an essentially three-phase procedure as follows:\n  Congress acted first, defining a framework under Federal law for \ninstituting constitutional self-government over local affairs. An \ninitial referendum was conducted in which the voters approved the terms \nfor instituting constitutional self-government as defined by Congress.\n  A second referendum was conducted on the proposed constitution and \nthe President of the United States was required under Public Law 600 to \ntransmit the draft constitution approved in that second referendum to \nCongress with his findings as to its conformity with the criteria \ndefined by Congress.\n  Congress approved final implementation of the new local constitution \nwith amendments which were accepted by the locally elected \nconstitutional convention and implemented on that basis by proclamation \nof the Governor.\n  We should adopt a similar procedure for taking the next step to \ncomplete the process leading to full self-government which began with \nenactment of Public Law 600 in 1950. Such a three-stage process would \nbe one through which:\n\n  First, Congress defines the procedures and options it will accept as \na basis for resolving the status question. In an initial referendum the \nvoters then approve a status option they prefer.\n  Second, the President transmits a proposal with recommended terms for \nimplementing the choice of the voters consistent with the criteria \ndefined by Congress, and upon approval by Congress a second referendum \nis held to determine if the voters accept the terms upon which Congress \nwould be willing to implement the new status.\n  Third, both Congress and the voters must act affirmatively to approve \nfinal implementation once the terms of the transition plan have been \nfulfilled.\n  This would track the successful model of Public Law 600, except that \nit improves upon it by requiring Congress and the voters to approve \nfinal implementation. This is more democratic than the procedure \nfollowed in 1952, in which Congress amended the Constitution and the \nrevisions were accepted by the constitutional convention and put into \neffect by proclamation of the Governor.\n  To ensure that there is no ambiguity about the new relationship as \nthere was after the current local constitution was implemented in 1952, \nthe Congress and the voters themselves, again, should have the last \nword on implementation. This prevents the local political parties from \nattempting to exploit ambiguity and convert it into a political \nplatform, as has been the case with the current commonwealth structure \nfor local self-government.\n  In this regard, I note that there are those who continue to suggest \nthat definitions of status options for a political status referendum \nshould be based upon the formulations adopted by the political parties \nin Puerto Rico. This approach is urged in the name of consensus \nbuilding. However, the history of attempts to address this problem--\nincluding the approval of H.R. 4765 by the House in 1990--makes it \nclear that the illusion of consensus has been achieved on status \ndefinitions in the past only by sacrificing the constitutional, legal, \nand political integrity of the process.\n  Recognizing the principle of consent by the qualified voters through \nan act of self-determination to retain the current status or seek \nchange under definitions acceptable to Congress is very different from \nthe idea that legislation to make self-determination possible cannot be \nenacted unless there is consent by local political parties to both the \nform and content of what is proposed. The qualified voters of Puerto \nRico, not the local political parties, are Puerto Rico for purposes of \nthe self-determination process.\n  No sleight-of-hand gimmicks or disclaimers disguised as good-faith \ncommitments will substitute for intellectually honest status \ndefinitions. We must approve legislation that makes it clear that \nCongress will propose a transition plan on terms it deems to be in the \nbest interests of the United States, and when it does the people \nqualified to vote in Puerto Rico will have to decide if the terms \nprescribed by Congress are acceptable.\n  If the terms for a change of status defined by Congress are not \nacceptable to the voters, then the right of self-determination can be \nexercised thereafter in an informed manner based on that outcome. There \nshould be no stated or implied commitment to a moral obligation to \nconsider any status definition--no matter who might propose it--which \nis deemed unconstitutional or unacceptable to Congress. That would be \nmisleading and dishonest, and no clever caveat could redeem such a \nbreach of the institutional integrity and constitutional duty of the \nCongress.\n  In 1997, Congress must take responsibility for informing the people \nof Puerto Rico of what the real options are based on congressional \ndefinition of the status formulations which Congress determines to be \nconsistent with the national interest and the right of self-\ndetermination of both the United States and the people of Puerto Rico. \nThis represents an opportunity and challenge as we seek to define our \nNation in the next century, and there is an obligation for all \nconcerned to ensure that the voters in Puerto Rico are given an \nopportunity for a free and informed act of self-determination.\n  If we accomplish that, then whatever the outcome may be will \nvindicate 100 years of democratization and development for Puerto Rico \nthrough its evolving relationship with the United States and the self-\ndetermination of its people.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Puerto Rico \nSelf Determination Act of 1997. I am proud to cosponsor this important \nlegislation with Senator Larry Craig and a bipartisan coalition of \neight other distinguished colleagues.\n  Mr. President, on December 10, 1898, through the Treaty of Paris that \nended the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico became part of the United \nStates. Next year marks the 100th anniversary of this union.\n  Mr. President, there is no better way for us to commemorate this \nspecial occasion than to give the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico the same \nright that their counterparts in all 50 States and the District of \nColumbia enjoy--the right to choose their political destiny.\n  In 1917, the Jones Act gave the people of Puerto Rico U.S. \ncitizenship, but it was less than complete. Though they are citizens, \nPuerto Ricans can only vote in Presidential elections if they are \nregistered in a State or the District of Columbia. They have a delegate \nin Congress--a position currently held by Congressman Carlos Romero-\nBarcelo--who does not have voting privileges.\n  But this lack of political rights is not due to a lack of \ncommunication. Throughout their history as part of the United States, \nPuerto Ricans have expressed their desire to achieve full political \nrights. They have on various occasions let Congress know of their \ndesire to be full participants in our democracy. And their actions \nspeak even louder than their words.\n  Puerto Ricans have contributed in all aspects of American life,--in \nthe arts, in sciences, in sports, and especially in service to the \nNation. Their record of service to this country speaks for itself. In \nWorld War II alone, more than\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\n65,000 Puerto Rican men and women served in the Armed Forces. In \nVietnam, over 60,000 served. The first United States soldier killed in \nSomalia was Puerto Rican. One of the airmen shot down over Libya in \n1986 was Puerto Rican. And it was a soldier from Puerto Rico who \nsounded the alarm--and saved lives--in the 1983 bombing of the Marine \nbarracks in Beirut.\n  I recently received a letter from retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Dennis \nFreytes, a Puerto Rican who resides in Orlando. He states in his \nletter:\n\n       As an American Puerto Rican, who has proudly served our \n     country, I think that Puerto Rico's political status should \n     be promptly resolved, so we don't have second class citizens \n     in our democratic form of government.\n\n  Puerto Ricans voluntarily joined our Armed Forces and have given \ntheir lives in defense of our country and democratic way of life. I \nemphasize ``our'' because U.S. citizens must have the same rights no \nmatter where they were born or where they choose to live.\n  In 1996 and 1997, the Legislature of Puerto Rico, the democratically \nelected representatives of 3.7 million U.S. citizens, overwhelmingly \napproved resolutions requesting that the Congress and the President of \nthe United States respond to their legitimate democratic aspirations. \nThey requested that a plebiscite be held not later than December 31, \n1998, almost exactly 100 years after Puerto Rico gained territorial \nstatus. There have been similar referendums in the past, but those were \nlocally mandated--Congress gave no direction as to how, if at all, the \nresults might affect Puerto Rico's political status.\n  It is time for the people of Puerto Rico to have a referendum process \nwhich defines the choices in a manner which are constitutionally valid, \nand that Congress is willing to uphold.\n  Mr. President, I want to particularly stress this latter point. \nCongress needs to understand that if it passes this bill--and I share \nthe hope of my friend and colleague, Senator Craig that we will and \nthat we will do so expeditiously--it is assuming an important \npolitical, and moral obligation to the American citizens of Puerto \nRico.\n  This is not a bill without significant consequences. If Puerto Ricans \nask to remain a Commonwealth, we need to respect their wishes. If they \nwant to become a State, we must begin the process of incorporation. And \nif they desire independence, we must take steps to meet that request. \nTo do otherwise would be to seriously undermine our credibility with \nthe 3.7 million citizens of Puerto Rico and the nearly 300 million \nresidents of Latin America.\n  Mr. President, for the last 100 years, the United States had given \nPuerto Ricans status as citizens but withheld some of the rights, \nprivileges, and responsibilities that come with that privilege. It is \ntime for that to end. Puerto Ricans do not deserve second-class \npolitical status. For all that they have done to enrich our culture and \ndefend our Nation from external threats, they have earned the right to \ndecide their own political destiny.\n  Mr. President, since the early 1900's, self-determination has been a \ncornerstone principle of our Nation's foreign policy.\n  As we approach the century mark of the union between Puerto Rico and \nthe United States, this bill will serve as a model of American \ndemocracy at its best--providing citizens with their right to decide \ntheir own futures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Nickles):\n  S. 473.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Internet Gambling \nProhibition Act of 1997. It will outlaw gambling on the Internet. I \nbelieve it will protect children from logging on to the Internet and \nbeing exposed to activities that are normally prohibited to them. And \nfor those people with a gambling problem, my bill will make it harder \nto gamble away the family paycheck.\n  Gambling erodes values of hard work, sacrifice, and personal \nresponsibility. Although the social costs of gambling are difficult to \nquantify, research indicates they are potentially staggering. Gambling \nis a growing industry in the United States, with revenues approaching \n$550 billion last year--three times the revenues of General Motors \nCorp. In 1993, more Americans visited casinos than attended a major \nleague baseball game.\n  The problem can only grow worse with online casinos. Now it is no \nlonger necessary to go to a casino or store where lottery tickets are \nsold. Anyone with a computer and a modem will have access to a casino: \nInternet users can access hundreds of sites for blackjack, craps, \nroulette, and sports betting. Gambling addiction is already on the \nrise. Online gambling will only increase the problem.\n  Why is this bill necessary? It dispels any ambiguity by making clear \nthat all betting, including sports betting, is illegal. Currently, \nnonsports betting is interpreted as legal. The bill also clarifies the \ndefinition of bets and wagers. This ensures that those who are gambling \ncannot circumvent the law. For example, virtual gaming businesses have \nbeen known to offer prizes instead of money, in an attempt to evade the \nlaw.\n  Additionally, my bill clarifies that Internet access providers are \ncovered by the law. As the National Association of Attorneys General \n[NAAG] task force on Internet Gambling reported, ``this is currently \nthe most important section to State and local law enforcement agencies, \nbecause it provides a civil enforcement mechanism.'' FCC-regulated \ncarriers notified by any State or local law enforcement agency of the \nillegal nature of a site are required to discontinue services to the \nmalfeasor. NAAG believes that this can be a very effective deterrent. \nThe bill includes interactive computer-service providers among those \nentities required to discontinue such service upon notice. Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement entities are explicitly authorized to \nseek prospective injunctive relief against continued use of a \ncommunications facility for purposes of gambling.\n  The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act makes explicit the intent of \nCongress to create extraterritorial jurisdiction regarding Internet \ngambling activities. Too often, illicit operators of virtual casinos \nset up shop in friendly jurisdictions beyond the direct application of \nU.S. law. It will also require the DOJ to report on the difficulties \nassociated with enforcing the statute. Finally, it places some burden \non the bettor.\n  The Internet has great potential to promote both educational \nopportunities and business expansion in this country. At the same time, \nthe Internet is fast becoming a place where inappropriate activities \nsuch as gambling, pornography, and consumer fraud thrive. Recently, \nmany businesses have welcomed law enforcement's involvement in cracking \ndown on consumer fraud. We must find a constitutional way to deal with \nthe other problems raised by this revolution in communications. I \nbelieve that it is possible to impose some conditions, as we have in \nother areas, without violating free speech rights.\n  There is growing support for changes to current law. As I mentioned, \nthe NAAG has a task force on Internet gambling, and the report of the \ntask\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nforce--authored by Attorneys General Dan Lungren and Hubert Humphrey--\ncalled for a legislative remedy to stem the tide of gambling \nelectronically. NAAG has endorsed my bill.\n  Mr. President, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1997 ensures \nthat the law will keep pace with technology and keep gambling off the \nInternet. I urge my colleagues to pass the bill.\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, in cosponsoring the Internet Gambling Prohibition \nAct introduced today, which is intended to address a growing problem in \nthe United States as our technology continues to modernize our modes of \ncommunication.\n  This legislation is an attempt to take a step forward in meeting the \nneeds of State law enforcement organizations and officials.\n  With the development of the Internet World Wide Web, the ability of \nAmericans to access information for their personal and professional use \nhas taken a quantum leap. It is safe to say that the Internet is one of \nthe more important technological advances of the late 20th century with \nrespect to the influence that the technology can have on the lives of \nso many Americans.\n  The number of American Internet users has grown from 1 million in \n1992 to over 50 million today. This number is expected to grow to \nseveral hundred million users by the year 2000. As we bring Internet \ntechnology into our schools, we will see greater use of the Internet \nparticularly among our youth, many who are already adept at using their \nhome computers and surfing the Internet for educational and \nrecreational purposes.\n  With this convenience and easy access to a variety of information \nsources, many of which are of great educational, cultural and \nprofessional value, come certain expected problems. The one that I want \nto speak to briefly is that of the increasing use of the Internet for \nthe purposes of gambling.\n  The National Association of Attorney Generals has recently studied \nthe problem of Internet gambling. In a 1996 report, ``Gambling on the \nInternet,'' the Association cited the following:\n\n       The availability of gambling on the Internet * * * \n     threatens to disrupt each State's careful balancing of its \n     own public welfare and fiscal concerns, by making gambling \n     available across State and national boundaries, with little \n     or no regulatory control.\n       There are literally hundreds of gambling-related sites on \n     the Internet. Dozens more are being added monthly.\n\n  Let me make several key distinctions that must be understood with \nrespect to this legislation.\n  First, it is important to note that the number of actual online \ngambling operations are few at this time due to electronic commerce and \ntechnical limitations. Advancements in technology, however, make such \nshortcomings temporary. Only 6 months ago, there were only 17 active \nInternet gambling sites on the World Wide Web. Today, there are over \n200. And, today, there are hundreds of advertisements for gambling as \nwell as informational how-to sites on the Internet. In short, the \nInternet's ability to serve as an information conduit for the gambling \nindustry has been recognized.\n  Second, States have historically been the primary regulator of \ngambling activities. However, the widespread use of the Internet and \nits potential to serve as a conduit of gambling activities across \nnational and State borders, serves to undermine States' regulatory \ncontrol. Our legislation is not intended to disrupt this prerogative, \nbut rather to assist States' ability to enforce its own gambling laws.\n  Finally, the legislation would not hold Internet access providers--\nsuch as America Online--liable for gambling activities that occur on \nthe Internet. However, the Internet access providers are required, once \nnotified by a State or law enforcement agency of the illegal activity, \nto discontinue Internet services to the malfeasor.\n  Mr. President, there is growing awareness of the importance of this \nissue in my State of Florida. The attorney general of the State of \nFlorida wrote me on February 17, 1997, urging strong support of this \nlegislation. I am committed to providing strong support in the Congress \nfor Florida law enforcement concerns.\n  It is timely and necessary for the Congress to assist States on this \ngrowing problem which undermines States' jurisdiction and control. We \nshould support the efforts of our State and local law enforcement \nofficials so that they can prevent the growth of activities which are \nillegal in that State.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for his work in drafting this \nimportant legislation. I look forward to working with him this year in \nsupport of passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join us in \nsupporting this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. \n        Moynihan):\n  S. 475. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe excise tax treatment of draft cider; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             TAX TREATMENT OF HARD APPLE CIDER LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing tax legislation \ndesigned to increase opportunities for the apple industry in the United \nStates. I am pleased that Senators Leahy, D'Amato, and Moynihan are \njoining me as original cosponsors of the bill.\n  Our bill clarifies the excise tax treatment of fermented apple cider. \nCurrent Federal tax law unfairly taxes fermented apple cider at a much \nhigher rate than beer despite the two beverages similar alcohol levels. \nCurrently, fermented apple cider, commonly known as draft cider, is \nsubject to a tax of $1.07 per wine gallon, despite its alcohol level. \nThis bill lowers the excise tax on draft cider containing not more than \n7 percent alcohol to equal the beer tax rate of 22.6 cents per gallon.\n  I believe this small tax change would allow draft cider producers to \ncompete more fairly in the market with comparable beverages. As draft \ncider becomes more competitive the market will likely grow. This will \ngreatly benefit the apple growers throughout this Nation, by expanding \nthe use and need for their product.\n  The production of draft hard cider comes from apples that are culls, \nprocessing apples or apples that are not usable in the fresh market. \nThe conversion of culled apples into high value processed products such \nas draft cider is important to growers as well as to processors.\n  Cider and other apple byproducts are important to Vermont's economy, \nproviding a market for otherwise unmarketable fruit. Of Vermont's \naverage annual crop of 1.1 million bushels, approximately 20 percent, \nor 220,000 bushels, are graded out as culls, or processing apples. \nApple production has a long history in Vermont, and is an integral part \nof agriculture in our State as it is in many States.\n  Many States have recognized the potential benefits to their apple \nfarmers by lowering the tax on draft cider to equal the beer tax rate. \nState Departments of Agriculture, farm bureaus, and representatives \nfrom the apple industry across this Nation have voiced their support \nfor lowering the cider tax rate.\n  This bill that I introduce today is similar to legislation that I \nintroduced along with my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, and my \ncolleagues from New York in the last Congress. The same bill was \nsuccessful in the Senate last Congress as part of the Small Business \nJob Protection Act of 1996, H.R. 3448. Unfortunately, the language was \nnot included in the conference report of H.R. 3448.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this legislation will again pass in \nthe Senate and be signed by the President. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, in introducing tax legislation designed to \nstimulate the apple industry in the United States. I am pleased that \nSenators D'Amato and Moynihan are joining me as original cosponsors of \nthe bill.\n  Our bill revises the Federal excise tax on fermented apple cider, \nmore commonly known as draft cider, to beer tax rates. As one of the \nsenior members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I believe this \nsmall tax change will be of great benefit to cider makers and apple \ngrowers across the country.\n  Draft cider is one of the oldest categories of alcoholic beverages in \nNorth America. Back in colonial times, nearly every innkeeper served \ndraft cider to\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nhis or her patrons during the long winter. In fact, through the 19th \nCentury, beer and draft cider sold equally in the United States.\n  Recently, draft cider has made a comeback in the United States and \naround the world. Our tax law, however, unfairly taxes draft cider at a \nmuch higher rate than beer despite the two beverages sharing the same \nalcohol level and consumer market. This tax treatment, I believe, \ncreates an artificial barrier to the growth of draft cider. Our \nlegislation will correct this inequity.\n  Present law taxes fermented cider, regardless of its alcohol level, \nas a wine at a rate of $1.07 per gallon. Our bill would clarify that \ndraft cider containing not more than 7 percent alcohol and marketed in \nvarious size containers would be taxed at the beer rate of 22.6 cents \nper gallon. I believe this tax change would allow draft cider producers \nto compete fairly with comparable beverage makers. As draft cider grows \nin popularity, apple growers around the nation should prosper because \ndraft cider is made from culled apples, the least marketable apples.\n  The growth of draft cider should convert these least marketable \napples, which account for about 20 percent of the entire U.S. apple \nproduction, into a high value product, helping our struggling apple \ngrowers. Indeed, I have received letters from officials at state \nagriculture departments from across the nation--Arizona, Connecticut, \nGeorgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, \nVermont and Virginia--supporting the taxing of draft cider at the beer \nrate because this change would allow apple farmers in their States to \nreap the benefits of an expanded culled apple market.\n  I have also heard from the Northeast McIntosh Apple Growers \nAssociation, the New York Apple Association, the New England Apple \nCouncil and many apple farmers, processors and cider producers that \nsupport revising the excise tax on draft cider.\n  This bill is identical to legislation I introduced with Senators \nJeffords, D'Amato and Moynihan in the last Congress. That bill passed \nthe Senate as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, H. \nR. 3448, but was not included in the conference report on H.R. 3448. I \nam hopeful that with the leadership of Senators Jeffords, D'Amato and \nMoynihan, we can enact into law this small tax change that will have a \nlarge positive impact on the Nation's apple industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Gregg and \n        Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 476. A bill to provide for the establishment of not less than \n2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs of America facilities by the year 2000; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF AMERICA LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure to \nfurther the commitment of the Republican Congress to support the \nexpansion of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, one of the best \nexamples of proven youth crime prevention. I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this bill by a bipartisan group of Senators, including \nSenator Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Youth Violence Subcommittee, \nSenator Stevens, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Gregg, the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Kohl, who serves on the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Our legislation addresses our continuing initiative to ensure that, \nwith Federal seed money, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America are able \nto expand to serve an additional 1 million young people through at \nleast 2,500 clubs by the year 2000. The dedication of all of these \nMembers demonstrates our commitment to both authorize and fund this \neffort.\n  Last year, in a bipartisan effort, the Republican Congress enacted \nlegislation I authored to authorize $100 million in Federal seed money \nover 5 years to establish and expand Boys and Girls Clubs in public \nhousing and distressed areas throughout our country. With the help of \nthe Appropriations Committee, we have fully funded this initiative.\n  The bill we are introducing today streamlines the application process \nfor these funds, and permits a small amount of the funds to be used to \nestablish a role model speakers' program to encourage and motivate \nyoung people nationwide.\n  It is important to note that what we are providing is seed money for \nthe construction and expansion of clubs to serve our young people. This \nis bricks and mortar money to open clubs, and after they are opened \nthey will operate without any significant Federal funds. In my view, \nthis is a model for the proper role of the Federal Government in crime \nprevention. The days are over when we can afford vast never-ending \nfederally run programs. According to a GAO report last year, over the \npast 30 years, Congress has created 131 separate Federal programs, \nadministered by 16 different agencies, to serve delinquent and at-risk \nyouth. These programs cost $4 billion in fiscal year 1995. Yet we have \nnot made significant progress in keeping our young people away from \ncrime and drugs.\n\n  What we can and must afford is short-term, solid support for proven \nprivate sector programs like the Boys and Girls Clubs that really do \nmake a difference. Boys and Girls Clubs are among the most effective \nnationwide programs to assist youth to grow into honest, caring, \ninvolved, and law-abiding adults.\n  We know that Boys and Girls Clubs work. Researchers at Columbia \nUniversity found that public housing developments in which there was an \nactive Boys and Girls Club had a 25 percent reduction in the presence \nof crack cocaine, a 22 percent reduction in overall drug activity, and \na 13 percent reduction in juvenile crime. Members of Boys and Girls \nClubs also do better in school, are less attracted to gangs, and feel \nbetter about themselves.\n  Distinguished alumni of Boys and Girls Clubs include role models such \nas actor Denzel Washington, basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and \nSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young.\n  More important, however, are the uncelebrated success stories--the \nmiracles performed by Boys and Girls Clubs every day. At a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing today, we have some of these miracles with us. Amador \nGuzman, from my State of Utah, told us how he believes the club in his \nneighborhood saved his life, by keeping him from gangs, drugs, and \nviolence.\n  The reason Boys and Girls Clubs work, and the Republican Congress \nwants to do more for them is because they are locally run, and depend \nmostly on community involvement for their success.\n  Never have our youth had a greater need for the positive influence of \nBoys and Girls Clubs, and never has the work of the clubs been more \ncritical. Our young people are being assaulted from all sides with \ndestructive messages. For instance, drug use is on the rise. Recent \nstatistics reconfirm that drugs are ensnaring young people as never \nbefore. Overall drug use by youth ages 12 to 17 rose 105 percent \nbetween 1992 and 1995, and 33 percent between 1994 and 1995; 10.9 \npercent of our young people now use drugs on a monthly basis, and \nmonthly use of marijuana is up 37 percent, monthly use of LSD is up 54 \npercent, and monthly cocaine use by youth is up 166 percent between \n1994 and 1995.\n  Our young people are also being assaulted by gangs. By some \nestimates, there are more than 3,875 youth gangs, with 200,000 members, \nin the Nation's 79 largest cities, and the numbers are going up. Even \nmy State of Utah has not been immune from this scourge. In Salt Lake \nCity, since 1992, the number of identified gangs has increased 55 \npercent, from 185 to 288. The number of gang members has increased 146 \npercent, from 1,438 to 3545; and the number of gang-related crimes has \nincreased a staggering 279 percent, from 1741 in 1992 to 6611 in 1996. \nShockingly, 208 of these involved drive-by shootings.\n  Every day, our young people are being bombarded with cultural \nmessages in music, movies, and television that undermine the \ndevelopment of core values of citizenship. Popular culture and the \nmedia glorify drug use, meaningless violence, and sex without \ncommitment.\n  The importance of Boys and Girls Clubs in fighting drug abuse, gang \nrecruitment, and moral poverty cannot\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nbe overstated. The clubs across the country are a bulwark for our young \npeople and deserve all the support we can give.\n  Indeed, Federal efforts are already paying off. Using over $15 \nmillion in seed money appropriated for fiscal year 1996, the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America opened 208 new clubs in 1996. These clubs are \nproviding positive places of hope, safety, learning, and encouragement \nfor about 180,000 more kids today than in 1995. In my state of Utah, \nthese funds have helped keep an additional 6,573 kids away from gangs, \ndrugs, and crime.\n  The $20 million appropriated for fiscal year 1997 is expected to \nresult in another 200 clubs and 200,000 more kids involved in clubs. We \nneed now to redouble our efforts. The legislation we introduce today \ndemonstrates our commitment to do that. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 477. A bill to amend the Antiquities Act to require an Act of \nCongress and the consultation with the Governor and State legislature \nprior to the establishment by the President of national monuments in \nexcess of 5,000 acres; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2553-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2563-S2569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE NATIONAL MONUMENT FAIRNESS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator Bennett, I \nam pleased to introduce the National Monument Fairness Act of 1997. \nThis act will promote procedural fairness in the creation of national \nmonuments on Federal and State lands under the Antiquities Act of 1906 \nand further congressional efforts in the area of environmental \nprotection. Identical legislation is being introduced today in the \nHouse of Representatives by Congressman Jim Hansen with the support of \nCongressmen Merrill Cook and Christopher Cannon.\n  As my colleagues know, on September 18, 1996, President Clinton \ninvoked the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create the Grand Staircase/\nEscalante Canyons National Monument. The 1.7 million acre monument, \nlarger in size than the States of Rhode Island and Delaware combined, \nlocks up more than 200,000 acres of State lands, along with vast energy \nreserves located beneath the surface.\n  Like the attack on Pearl Harbor, this massive proclamation came \ncompletely without notice to the public. Although State officials and \nmembers of the Utah congressional delegation were told that the \nAdministration would consult us prior to making any change in the \nstatus of these lands, the President's announcement came as a complete \nsurprise. The biggest Presidential land set-aside in almost 20 years \nwas a sneak attack.\n  Without any notification, let alone consultation or negotiation, with \nour Governor or State officials in Utah, the President set aside this \nacreage as a national monument by the stroke of his pen. Let me \nemphasize this point. There was no consultation, no hearings, no town \nmeetings, no TV or radio discussion shows, no nothing. No input from \nFederal managers who work in Utah and manage our public lands. As I \nStated last September, in all my 20 years in the U.S. Senate, I have \nnever seen a clearer example of the arrogance of Federal power than the \nproclamation creating this monument. It continues to be the mother of \nall land grabs.\n  We in Utah continue to work with the hand President Clinton has dealt \nus. That is, we are attempting to recognize and understand the \nconstraints placed upon the future use of the land and resources \ncontained within the monument's boundaries. We are trying to identify \nthe various adverse effects this action will have on the surrounding \ncommunities.\n  Personally, while I would have preferred a monument designation \nconsiderably smaller in scope, I could have enthusiastically supported \na monument designation for the area covered by the proclamation had I \nbeen consulted prior to last September and invited to work with the \nPresident on a designation that was tailored to address the many \nconcerns we have heard over the years on this acreage. Two of these \nconcerns involve the 200,000 acres of school trust lands captured \nwithin the monument boundary and the locking up of 16 billion tons of \nrecoverable, low-sulfur, clean-burning coal.\n\n  Remember, our wilderness bill considered last year proposed \ndesignation of approximately one-quarter of this land as wilderness. I \nwanted to protect most of it; the people of Utah wanted to protect most \nof it. But, we were not consulted; we were not asked; our opinion was \nnot sought. Rather, in an effort to score political points with a \npowerful interest group 48 days before a national election, President \nClinton unilaterally acted.\n  In taking this action in this way, the President did it all \nbackwards. Instead of knowing how the decision would be carried out--\nand knowing the all ramifications of this implementation and the best \nways to accommodate them--the President has designated the monument and \nnow expects over the next 3 years to make the designation work. The \nformal designation ought to come after the discussion period. It is how \nwe do things in this country. Unfortunately, however, the decision is \nnow fait accompli, and we will deal with it as best we can. I hope the \nPresident will be there to help our people in rural Utah and our school \nsystem as the implementation of the designation order takes place.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, the National Monument \nFairness Act, is designed to correct the problems highlighted by the \nClinton Antiquities Act proclamation in Utah. It will do this in two \nsignificant ways.\n  First, the act makes a distinction between national monument \nproclamations greater in size than 5,000 acres, and those 5,000 acres \nand less. The President retains his almost unfettered authority under \nthe Antiquities Act over monument designations 5,000 acres and less. \nSpecifically, the Antiquities Act delegates to the President discretion \nto declare as a national monument that part of Federal land that \ncontains historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and \nother objects of historic or scientific interest--but only as long as \nthe declared area is confined to the ``smallest area compatible with \nproper care and management of the objects to be protected.'' The 5,000 \nacre limitation will give effect to this ``smallest area compatible'' \nclause, which both the courts and past Presidents have often ignored.\n  For areas larger than 5,000 acres, the President must consult, \nthrough the Secretary of Interior, with the Governor of the State or \nStates affected by the proposed proclamation. This consultation will \nprevent executive agencies from rolling over local concerns--local \nconcerns that, under the dictates of modern land policy laws such as \nthe Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 [FLPMA] and the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, certainly deserve to be aired.\n  The National Monument Fairness Act also provides time constraints on \nthe consultation requirement. From the date the Secretary of Interior \nsubmits the President's proposal to the appropriate State Governor, the \nGovernor will have 90 days to respond with written comments. Ninety \ndays after receiving the Governor's comments, the Secretary will then \nsubmit appropriate documentation, along with the Governor's written \ncomments, to the Congress. If the Governor fails to comment on the \nproposal, the Secretary will submit it to the Congress after 180 days \nfrom the date of the President's proposal. These time constraints \nassure that the process will be fair. It will prevent State officials \nfrom unnecessarily delaying proposed proclamations, but will allow \nappropriate time for State and localities to voice their concerns \nthrough the Governor's comments on the President's actions.\n\n  Consequently, the consultation requirement ensures that large \nmonument designations will be made fairly, and in a manner that allows \nthe participation, through their Governor, of the people most directly \naffected by the proclamation.\n  Second, the National Monument Fairness Act allows all citizens of the \nUnited States to voice their concerns on large designations through \nCongress. The act provides that after the Secretary has presented the \nproposal, Congress must pass it into law and send it to the President \nfor his signature before the proposal becomes final and effective. \nThus, the Nation, through its elected representatives, will make the \ndecision whether certain\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\nlands will become national monuments. This is the way our democracy \nought to operate. Indeed, it furthers the intent of the Framers in the \nConstitution who anticipated that laws and actions affecting one or \nmore individual States would be placed before the legislature and \ndebated, with a State's representatives and senators able to defend the \ninterests of their State.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of our legislation is to ensure that a \nfair and thorough process is followed on any future large-scale \nmonument designations under the authority granted in the Antiquities \nAct. Since Utah is home to many other areas of significant beauty and \ngrandeur, I am concerned that this President or those within his \nadministration, or a future President or administration, might consider \nusing this authority in the same manner as last September. In other \nwords, it will be ``deja vu all over again.'' We cannot afford to have \nthe entire land area of our state subject to the whims of any \nPresident. Many have proposed plans, including myself, for these areas, \nthat have been the subject of considerable public scrutiny and comment. \nThe consensus building process must be allowed to continue without the \nthreat that a Presidential pen will intervene to destroy any progress \nand goodwill that has been established or that may be underway among \nthe citizens of our State.\n  I am aware that Interior Secretary Babbitt stated publicly last month \nthat ``there are no plans for any additional executive withdrawals'' \nduring the remaining years of the Clinton administration. That is fine. \nHowever, as my colleagues know perfectly well, Secretary Babbitt told \nme and other members of our congressional delegation last December that \nthere was no final decision to designate the Grand Staircase/Canyons of \nthe Escalante Monument and that we, the congressional delegation, would \nbe consulted prior to any designation. Since then, we have learned from \npress reports that many decisions leading to the monument announcement \nhad already been made, if not finalized, prior to our meeting with the \nSecretary.\n  But, regardless of whether the Clinton administration plans to \ndesignate any more monuments, I do not think it is unreasonable to look \nat the authorities contained in the Antiquities Act--particularly the \nauthority that permits such sweeping and long-lasting changes for \nindividual States and towns without State input and congressional \napproval. That is the issue.\n\n  That is why we are introducing this legislation today. This matter of \ndue process for State and local officials--as well as for small \nbusiness people, ranchers, school systems, and many others affected by \nlocking up lands--is an issue about which I believe all Senators and \nCongressmen need to be concerned. While Senators representing the so-\ncalled public lands States may need to pay particular attention, if the \nlong arm of the Federal Government can do this to Utah without so much \nas a day's notice, it can do it to your State as well.\n  It is time we incorporate some common sense protections for all \nStates into the Antiquities Act. I continue to believe that last \nSeptember's act was a Federal land grab, and I unwilling to stand by \nand let it happen again in my State or any other State without a fair \nand proper airing in the court of public opinion.\n  Some may ask why this legislation focuses only on proposed areas over \n5,000 acres. First, it is not our desire to completely withdraw the \nauthority granted the President in the 1906 act. But, the original act \nis clear when it States that this authority should be limited to ``the \nsmallest area'' possible. In my mind, this authority should be \navailable for those areas that are small in nature that may require \nquick or emergency protection for which a monument designation is \nwarranted. That is how I envision this authority being used.\n  Second, there is already precedence in Federal law for 5,000 acres as \nthe threshold amount for determining certain pending or future Federal \naction or consequence. For example, the Wilderness Act of 1964 defines \nwilderness as having ``at least 5,000 acres of land.'' Also, FLPMA \nauthorizes the Secretary to withdraw 5,000 acres or more for up to 20 \nyears ``on his own motion or upon request by a department or agency \nhead.'' And, there is reference to ``roadless areas of 5,000 acres or \nmore'' in that section of FLPMA that authorizes the 15-year Bureau of \nLand Management wilderness study process.\n  I am sure that any detractors of this bill will State that had our \nbill been enacted in the past, some of the Nation's most gorgeous and \nlong lasting monuments would never have been designated as a national \nmonument. I would say two things to this point.\n  First, our bill will not prevent the establishment of any monument \nconsisting of 5,000 acres or more. The bill simply modifies the process \nby which proposed monuments of acreage above this amount can be \ndesignated. Second, and most importantly, I understand that there are \n72 national monuments in the United States. Of that number, only one-\nthird, or 24, have a total acreage figure greater than 5,000 acres. \nEnactment of our bill will not bring a halt to the ability of \nCongress--or even the President--to designate national monuments.\n  In addition, I realize that some of our existing national parks, such \nas Arches and Canyonlands National Parks in Utah, were originally \nestablished as national monuments, only to be designated a park \nafterward. It is not fair to say that had our bill been in law prior to \nthe designation of these monuments that parks like Arches and \nCanyonlands or the Grand Canyon National Park would never have been \ndesignated. Certainly, any monument proposal consisting of more than \n5,000 acres that is proposed by the President where a consensus exists \nwithin Congress that such a designation is warranted would be favorably \nreceived and acted upon by Congress. And, at least home State senators \nand representatives have a voice. In many cases, it is likely that they \nwould pursue a designation of these areas prior to the President \nexercising his authority under the Antiquities Act.\n\n  But, let's not lose focus of the purposes of this bill. We simply \nwant to ensure that a public process is undertaken prior to any large \nmonument designation under the Antiquities Act. As I stated earlier, we \nconduct such a process whenever a similar proposal is introduced in \nCongress; why can't Congress insist that it be done when the President \ndesires to achieve the same purpose?\n  I mentioned that we are in the process of recognizing and \nunderstanding the constraints this proclamation will place on the \neconomic and social aspects of the surrounding communities. When an \narea the size of the Grand Staircase-Escalante Canyons National \nMonument is withdrawn from public use and given a special designation, \nthere are many ramifications that need to be addressed, the burden of \nwhich falls primarily on the shoulders of the local community. These \ninclude the following items:\n  First, county land-use plans will have to be studied and amended to \naddress necessary changes relating to the new monument.\n  Second, consideration of the transportation improvements required to \nimprove the existing inadequate transportation system to access the new \nmonument for visitors to the area.\n  Third, increased visitation to the area will place greater burden on \nservices provided by local government, such as law enforcement, fire, \nemergency, search-and-rescue, and solid waste collection.\n  Fourth, increased visitation to the area will place greater burden on \nthe proper disposition of limited natural resources, such as water, \nboth for culinary and irrigation purposes.\n  These are just a few items that are currently being discussed and \nreviewed by local leaders in the area of the new national monument. \nThese are not trivial matters; they are critical to continuing the \nlivelihood of the cities and towns in the area. So, no one should think \nthat creating a new monument of this size, as endearing a concept as \nthat is, does not create significant matters that must be addressed.\n  Of course, the other consequence the creation of this monument has \ncreated which continues to be of utmost concern to me is the final \ndisposition of the State school trust lands captured within the \nmonument's boundaries. The inability to access the natural resources \ncontained on these lands will\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\nhave a devastating impact on providing crucial funds to Utah's public \nschool educational system. The Utah Congress of Parents and Teachers \nhas indicated that ``the income from the mineral resources within the \nMonument could have made a significant difference in the funding of \nUtah schools now and for many generations to come.'' It remains to be \nseen the manner in which the President will fulfill the promises he \nmade to the children of Utah last September when he created the new \nmonument. Specifically, he said ``creating this national monument \nshould not and will not come at the expense of Utah's children.'' He \nalso added that it is his desire to ``both protect the natural heritage \nof Utah's children and ensure them a quality educational heritage.'' I \nam eager to work with him to fulfill these promises.\n\n  I mention these items to simply paint a picture for my colleagues \nthat there are many pieces to the monument puzzle that remain to be \nresolved. The President can come to town--or 75 miles to the south in \nanother State--and designate a monument, but Utahns are left to pick up \nthe pieces of his action to make sure that it works--and that it works \nproperly. That is what I want, and I am sure that is what the President \nwants.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I must point out that the adoption of this \nact will likely result in more stringent environmental protection of \nFederal lands. The most ironic fact of the administration's monument \ndesignation in Utah is that national monuments permit a greater level \nof activity than does a wilderness designation. Last year, the Utah \ndelegation proposed that 2.1 million acres of land on and around the \nGrand Staircase/Escalante Canyons area be declared wilderness, under \nthe language of the Wilderness Act of 1964. The wilderness designation \nis far more stringent than the administration's monument designation \nand prevents the construction of the roads and visitors centers \nenvisioned under the monument designation. The Utah proposal of the \n104th Congress included more area than BLM had officially recommended \nto Congress following its 13-year inventory of the lands in Southern \nUtah. This is yet another compelling reason why it is vital for local \nand State officials to be consulted prior to national monument \ndeclarations.\n  Mr. President, the Antiquities Act is antiquated. It needs to be \nupdated. It can be amended in a manner consistent with today's pressing \nland policy concerns without destroying the original intent behind the \nact. That is what we have proposed in this legislation and why I urge \npassage of the National Monument Fairness Act of 1997. This bill will \npreserve the President's ability to act to protect lands of historic \nand scientific significance that are threatened with development. \nHowever, the act will promote greater environmental stewardship by \nforcing the executive branch to consider the views of local and State \nofficials prior to making large-scale changes in land designation and \nmanagement.\n  Finally, the requirement that massive monument proposals be passed \nthrough the Congress, under the strictures of article I of the \nConstitution, will ensure that all Americans have a say in land policy \ndecisions that fundamentally change the Nation. And, this, Mr. \nPresident, may be the most compelling reason of all to enact this \nmeasure.\n  I invite Senators to join me in support of this legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 477\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``National Monument Fairness \n     Act of 1997.''\n\n     SEC. 2. CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNOR AND STATE LEGISLATURE.\n\n       Section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906, commonly referred to \n     as the ``Antiquities Act'' (34 Stat. 225; 16 U.S.C. 432) is \n     amended by adding the following at the end thereof: ``A \n     proclamation under this section issued by the President to \n     declare any area in excess of 5,000 acres to be a national \n     monument shall not be final and effective unless and until \n     the Secretary of the Interior submits the Presidential \n     proclamation to Congress as a proposal and the proposal is \n     passed as a law pursuant to the procedures set forth in \n     Article 1 of the United States Constitution. Prior to the \n     submission of the proposed proclamation to Congress, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall consult with and obtain the \n     written comments of the Governor of the State in which the \n     area is located. The Governor shall have 90 days to respond \n     to the consultation concerning the area's proposed monument \n     status. The proposed proclamation shall be submitted to \n     Congress 90 days after receipt of the Governor's written \n     comments or 180 days from the date of the consultation if no \n     comments were received.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Torricelli, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Lott, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Nickles and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 479. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nestate tax relief, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           THE ESTATE TAX RELIEF FOR THE AMERICAN FAMILY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan \neffort to relieve the estate tax burden on the American family. I want \nto thank the other original cosponsors and particularly the Majority \nLeader. Estate tax relief is on the respective top ten legislative \nobjective lists of both parties. It is my honor to lead the effort for \nmy party. I think that estate tax reform will happen in this Congress. \nTherefore, I encourage my colleagues to associate themselves with our \nbipartisan legislation. It doubtlessly will become the focus of the \nestate tax reform efforts in the Senate efforts. The list of original \ncosponsors already includes Senators Baucus, Lott, Breaux, Nickles, \nMurkowski, Kerrey, Hagel, Torricelli, Landreiu, and Mr. Hutchinson.\n  I will go about this introductory statement in two steps. First, I am \ngoing to discuss the importance of this legislation to my state of \nIowa. Then, I will make some remarks about the specific provisions of \nthe bill.\n  In nearly every area of my state and the nation, we saw in the past \ndecade estate tax ultimately confiscate many family farms. For example, \nin 1981, the children of two family farmers in Hancock County, Iowa, \ninherited tracks of land that were debt free. In both of these cases a \nfather was passing the farm to one of his children. The estate was \nforced to borrow the amount to pay for both the state inheritance tax \nand the federal estate tax. At the time, the profitability of farming \nwas low, and the value of farm land plummeted. In both cases the estate \ntax unfortunately brought about the foreclosure of these farms which \nhad been in each family for four generations.\n  That was sixteen years ago, and the estate tax has hardly improved \nsince then. The general estate tax exemption has risen to $600,000, but \nthat number is over $200,000 behind the rate of inflation. The \nimportant thing to keep in mind about estate tax reform is that estates \ndo not pay taxes, surviving families pay taxes. This bill is simply \nabout fairness and equity for families. Furthermore, it is about \ncorrecting latent defects in the estate tax rules that make tax lawyers \nrich, but also make families crazy.\n  Reform in this legislation comes in three major parts. First, we \nincrease the broad based estate tax exemption from $600,000 to \n$1,000,000 over a period of six years. Second, we grant family owned \nbusinesses relief similar to what was introduced by former Senators \nDole and Pryor. For businesses passed down among the family, this bill \nprovides a complete exemption for the first $1,500,000 of family \nbusiness assets. It also provides an additional 50 percent exemption on \nthe next $8,500,000. Thus, there is a $10,000,000 cap on our family-\nowned business relief. This provision is therefore a smaller provision \nthan the original Dole/Pryor legislation.\n\n  Finally there is a section that I call repair and maintenance. Here \nwe improve some popular existing provisions. For example, housekeeping \nand improvement is done to special use valuation. The Government \nfinanced estate tax deferral provision is improved. A generation \nskipping tax equity problem is fixed that has already been passed twice \nbut vetoed for unrelated reasons. Finally, an IRS gift tax audit \nstatute of limitations problem for families is fixed.\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\n  Because it is especially complicated, I want to discuss the \ngeneration skipping transfer tax problem that is addressed in the \nrepair and maintenance section of this bill. For reference purposes, \nthis legislation was known as bill number S. 1170 in the 104th \nCongress. It too was passed on the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which \nwas subsequently vetoed.\n  The GST tax is an extra tax that families pay when a grandparent \nmakes a gift to a grandchild. The provision in our bill has the support \nof over 200 charities in the Nation including the public universities \nin my State of Iowa. It has passed twice in the last 10 years, but was \nnot enacted because the greater legislation was vetoed for unrelated \nreasons.\n  Our provision expands the current law predeceased parent exception. \nThis is an exception to the GST tax where a grandparent gifts to a \ngrandchild but the grandchild's parent has already died. The grandchild \nsteps up into the place of the parent. In our bill, this exception is \nbroadened to include gifts not only to grandchildren with predeceased \nparents but also grandnieces and grandnephews. The expansion to include \nthese gifts that are affected by trusts is necessary to promote \ncharitable giving and also protect families. The White House supported \nthis provision during the debate of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, \ngiven the prospective effective date as in our bill.\n  Humility requires me to admit that each of these provisions passed as \npart of the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. In some places we have \nmade technical improvements suggested by the tax experts, but by and \nlarge there is little original thought here. If you have good \nlegislation you don't need to improve upon it.\n  Some will ask about how this estate tax bill fits into the debate \nover a balanced budget. The answer is that the balanced budget is still \na No. 1 priority and this bill will need to fit in a balanced budget. \nSince the White House has supported provisions in the President's \nbudget similar to these provisions, we should expect the White House to \noffer assistance to us in resolving the estate tax problem. If the era \nof big government is over, then the White House should step up to the \nplate and aid us in eliminating estate tax theft upon surviving \nfamilies.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator \nGrassley and my other colleagues in introducing the Estate Tax Relief \nfor the American Family Act of 1997 today. This bill is designed to \nprovide farmers, ranchers, and others who own family businesses and \nmuch needed relief from the estate tax.\n  Montana is a small-town, rural State, Mr. President. People run \nfarms, ranches, and work in small businesses. One of the wonderful \nthings about life in rural Montana is the way these operations stay in \nthe family. It holds communities together, and creates a lasting bond \nbetween generations.\n  As I listen to farmers, ranchers and small business owners, one topic \ncomes up every time, and that is the estate and gift tax. I hear about \nthe burden it puts on agricultural producers and small businesses, and \nabout how difficult this tax makes it to hand down an operation to your \nsons and daughters.\n  To avoid this tax, an operation today has to be under $600,000 in \nvalue. That amount hasn't budged since 1987. Our State, one the other \nhand, has changed a lot in that time. In 1988, the average Montana farm \nwas worth $579,735. In 1995, that amount was up to $867,769. If we had \nfigures for today, I am confident this amount would be even higher.\n  So if you're an average fellow, you often have three choices when \nyour farm goes on to the next generation. You can subdivide the land \nand thus decrease production. You can sell off part of the farm to pay \nthe taxes. Or, you can sell the whole thing and get out of farming \naltogether. None of these options are good for the family, nor are they \nnecessarily good for the community. Unbridled development brings with \nit its share of problems, and changes the nature of Montana life--not \nalways for the better. Our farms, ranches and other small businesses \nare a part of our heritage and valuable contributors to our economy and \nthe Montana way of life. It is simply not right to destroy them with \nonerous estate taxes.\n  The Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997 is the \nfirst step toward bringing the estate tax up to date and making it more \nfair. Our bill raises the unified credit to cover estates up to $1 \nmillion, which is roughly where the cap would be if the credit had kept \npace with inflation all these years. We give folks a bit longer to pay \noff the bill when they do have a tax due, by lengthening the deferral \nfrom 10 years to 20. We provide additional exemptions for family-owned \nsmall businesses, by allowing them to exclude completely the first $1.5 \nmillion in value of their estates, and one-half of the next $8.5 \nmillion. We also make a few other common-sense changes to make it \neasier to keep these business operations in the family.\n  That's good news for farmers, ranchers and small business owners. \nIt's good for the communities they live in. And more than anything \nelse, it's the right thing to do. So I'm very proud to be a part of \nthis effort today, and I look forward to working with my other \ncolleagues, and with the administration, to get this relief enacted \ninto law this year.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am delighted to take part in introducing \nthe first bipartisan family tax relief bill of the 105th Congress--the \nEstate Tax Relief for the American Family Act.\n  Today, the Government can confiscate up to 55 percent of an estate in \ntax when a person dies. This tax is a grotesque relic of an earlier era \nwhen some people believed it was the Government's job to determine who \nshould be allowed to keep what they earn. They believed it was the \nFederal Government's job to confiscate the hard-earned dollars of \nworking Americans when they died.\n  The estate tax is a monster that must be exterminated. If it were up \nto me, we would simply repeal the estate tax in its entirety. \nUnfortunately, our budget process does not allow us to completely \nrepeal this tax all at once. We must do it in stages.\n  Therefore, the bill we are introducing today will increase the amount \nof every estate that will be exempt from estate tax. When fully phased \nin, up to $1 million will be automatically excluded from every estate \nbefore imposition of the estate tax.\n  The bill also creates a new category of excludable assets for family-\nowned businesses that are passed on to succeeding generations. No \nlonger will small business owners be forced to sell part or all of \ntheir business assets merely to feed the voracious tax appetite of the \nFederal Government. Our bill allows an exclusion of $1.5 million of the \nassets of a family-owned business from the estate tax, and 50 percent \nof the next $8.5 million. For many small businesses this will make the \ndifference between staying viable and closing their doors. It will \npreserve jobs, give many communities around the country stability and \ncertainty, and encourage entrepreneurship. It is the right thing to do \nfor our farmers, for our ranchers, for every American who owns a small \nbusiness that he or she wishes to keep in the family.\n  These businesses are, after all, the engines of prosperity in \ncommunities across America, and we must help them to remain so.\n  This bill is the first step. The tax on death should be zero, and \nthat is what we will continue to work for.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley for his leadership on this bill, and \nSenator Baucus and Senator Breaux as well for joining in this \nbipartisan effort to reduce the crushing tax load on all Americans.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I join with several of my colleagues \nto introduce the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997.\n  Tax policy should meet two criteria. It should provide an effective \nand efficient way to collect taxes for the operation of our Government \nand it should encourage positive economic and social policies. This tax \ndoes neither. After looking at the current system, I have concluded \nthat Federal estate and gift taxes are not worth the cost to our \neconomy, to businesses and to American families.\n  In 1995, the estate tax generated $14.8 billion in revenue, only 1.09 \npercent of total Federal revenues. Conversely, the cost of collecting \nand enforcing the estate tax to the Government and taxpayers was 65 \ncents of every dollar collected.\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\n  The effects of the estate tax are felt most by family-owned \nbusinesses. More than 70 percent of family-owned businesses do not \nsurvive the second generation and 87 percent do not survive the third \ngeneration. Many families are forced to liquefy their businesses in \norder to pay the estate tax.\n  There is a definite need to remedy these problem and this bill takes \nsteps in the right direction. The legislation would increase the estate \ntax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million, and allow estate tax-free \ntransfers of certain qualified small business assets.\n  I hope that any tax bill we put forth this year will include estate \ntax relief based on the principles we have put forth in this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have always believed that economic \nfreedom is a critical part of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code does not always \npromote or encourage economic freedom, and one area where this is \nstrikingly clear is the confiscatory, anti-family, anti-growth estate \ntax.\n  Most Americans work diligently throughout their lives to provide for \ntheir families and give their children and grandchildren a better \nfuture. This work often results in the accumulation of assets like \nhomes, businesses, and farms; all acquired with hard work and bought \nwith after-tax dollars. Unfortunately, those without high-paid lawyers \nand accountants realize too late that up to 55 percent of those assets \ncould be confiscated by the Federal Government upon their death.\n  Some people mistakenly believe estate taxes only affect the rich, but \nthere are thousands of small businesses and farms throughout the \ncountry owned and operated by middle-income Americans that are affected \nby existing estate tax laws. These small businesses may appear to be \neconomically significant on paper, but often they have little liquid \nassets to cover estate tax liabilities. Historically, these businesses \nhave created most of the new jobs in this country and fueled the growth \nof the economy.\n  The unfortunate result of high estate taxes is that families are \nfrequently forced to sell off part of the family business to pay the \ntaxes incurred by the deceased family member's estate. This liquidation \nof productive assets to finance tax liabilities is anti-family and \nanti-business. At the very least, families and businesses are forced to \nemploy an army of expensive experts to avoid the worst estate taxes, a \nmake-work exercise that exacerbates the inefficiency of the system.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is patently unfair for the Federal \nGovernment to assume that it has the right to take an individual's \nhard-earned assets and redistribute them to others. If our goal as a \nsociety and a government is to encourage long-term, private savings and \ninvestment we cannot continue the policy of confiscating estates. With \nan average savings rate in the United States of 2.9 percent, which is \nlower than that of any other industrialized country, we should be \nencouraging individuals, families, and businesses to save and invest.\n  Since 1987, a unified tax credit for gifts and estate transfers has \neffectively exempted $600,000 worth of assets from estate taxes. This \nbasic exemption has increased modestly over the years, from $60,000 in \nthe 1940's, 1950's and 1960's to $225,000 in 1982. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent estate exemption of $600,000 has been greatly eroded by \ninflation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with the Senate majority \nleader, Senator Grassley, Senator Breaux, Senator Baucus, and others \naddresses the problems associated with the estate tax in a thoughtful, \nbipartisan manner. It is not the perfect solution to these problems, \nMr. President, but it is a good first step. I believe that ultimately \nwe must radically restructure the estate tax by reducing marginal \nrates, which now exceed 55 percent for estates larger than $3 million, \nand I believe we must strive to treat all types of family businesses \nequally. However, I recognize the budget constraints Congress is \nworking under, and I believe it is important to move forward in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  The legislation we are introducing today increases the estate tax \nexemption from $600,000 to $1,000,000, thus allowing more homeowners, \nfarmers, and small businesses to keep their hard-earned wealth. \nFurther, our bill would provide special relief for closely-held family \nbusinesses. We would allow estate-tax free transfers of up to $1.5 \nmillion in small business assets to qualified family members, and a 50 \npercent exclusion for up to $8.5 million in assets above that \nthreshold, as long as the heirs continue to operate the business.\n  The legislation we are introducing today makes simple pro-family, \npro-business, and pro-economy changes to our tax code. It will allow \nmore homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to keep their hard-\nearned wealth. I encourage my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am proud to include my name as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act \nof 1997, which was introduced today. This is a critical tax reform bill \nthat will modernize our antiquated estate tax policy, provide \nsignificantly improved economic security for family businesses, promote \nefficient and pro-growth economic policy and ensure sound financial \npractices for millions of American working families.\n  This legislation gradually increases over 6 years the estate and gift \ntax exemption from the current limit of $600,000 to $1 million. The \ngraduated time schedule would increase the exemption by $100,000 in \neach of the first 2 years following enactment and $50,000 in each of \nthe next 4 years.\n  For families with their own small business, the bill would provide a \nnew small business exemption of $1.5 million of business-related assets \nabove the first $1 million in an estate as well as 50 percent of the \nnext $8.5 million of such assets. This proposal would provide new \nsafeguards for family business solvency that is not currently provided \nunder current law.\n  These changes are desperately needed as our current estate tax policy \nhas not been upgraded in a decade. Even worst, the current policy has \nproven to be a economic failure. Estate and gift taxes are one of the \nsmallest sources of revenue, collecting only $10 to $15 billion per \nyear, mostly because Americans have found legal means of avoiding the \ntax. Indeed, Prof. Douglas Bernheim of Stanford University has \ntheorized that more income tax revenue may be lost through clever \nestate planning than is actually collected through the estate tax.\n  Even worse, the current policy encourages Americans to spend capital \non consumption items rather than save because saving their money would \nincrease the value of their estate and, ultimately, their estate tax \nliability. Indeed, it has been estimated that the tax cost of a dollar \nsaved increases by an amount somewhere between 7.4 cents and 55 cents \nbecause of current estate tax law.\n  And for small business, the current policy is devastating. The \nfamily-owned pizza parlor, dry cleaning store, grocery and family farm \nare failing to provide the kind of generational economic continuity \nthat national policy should be encouraging. Indeed, more than 70 \npercent of family businesses don't survive the second generation and \nalmost 90 percent don't survive to a third generation. Most of these \nfailures occur because current estate tax policy drains a family's \nfinancial ability to keep a business afloat as it passes from one \ngeneration to the next.\n  The existing estate tax policy creates economic inefficiencies and \nplaces its heaviest burdens on the middle class. The rates of estate \ntaxes are excessive, unfair, punitive, and contrary to the interests of \nboth business owners and their employees. Indeed, these taxes destroy \nthe work of a lifetime and the dreams of a generation of Americans. The \ntime to make genuine and sensible changes is now.\n  Enactment of the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of \n1997 is an essential part of any plan to balance the budget by 2002. It \nwould likely provide a net increase in revenues while at the same time \nrestore tax fairness for millions of Americans. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation and will be a tireless advocate \nfor its enactment into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 480. A bill to repeal the restrictions on welfare and public \nbenefits for aliens; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\n                     THE FAIRNESS TO IMMIGRANTS ACT\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on April 1, the Nation will \nbegin to see the disastrous effects of the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Act of 1996, passed and signed into law in the 104th Congress. \nWhen Congress debated the bill, strong arguments were made for getting \npeople off welfare and back to work. I supported those intents. \nHowever, I believed then as I do now that the bill we were debating \nwent beyond what is humanly justifiable in terms of repealing basic \nassistance to people who are in need. This bill was not about able \nbodied people working. It was about good people suffering. Under the \nguise of able bodied people working, we are forcing disabled and \nelderly people into hunger, into homelessness.\n  Beginning around April 1, roughly 500,000 legal immigrants will lose \ntheir SSI benefits and about 1 million will lose food stamps. By the \nyear 2002, approximately, 260,000 elderly immigrants and 140,000 \nchildren will lose Medicaid coverage.\n  The bill I am introducing today restores those benefits to elderly \nand disabled immigrants by repealing provisions of the Personal \nResponsibility Act of 1996.\n  When the American people supported welfare reform, they supported \nthat able bodied people would work. I want that. You want that. \nHowever, I do not think that the American people intended the ensuing \nconsequences.\n  These consequences are people like Yanira, who, with her husband came \nto the United States legally 20 years ago from her native El Salvador. \nFor 20 years they raised three children. For 20 years, they paid income \ntaxes. For 20 years, they paid sales taxes. For 20 years they paid \nState taxes. For 20 years, they paid their car registration. For 20 \nyears, they abided by the laws and rules here.\n  Then Yanira's husband divorced her. So, Yanira got a job. For about 8 \nyears she cleaned toilets, washed floors and laundered towels in a \nhotel near her home. Eventually, the work became too demanding \nphysically and she quit. At 64, Yanira has received SSI for a few \nyears. Soon, she will not.\n  Since her husband is no longer married to her, she is not entitled to \ncount her husband's work history toward the required 40 quarters--10 \nyears. In spite of the fact that we willingly took her taxes and other \nfiscal contributions, we are denying her the basics for human survival, \nhuman dignity. How will Yanira survive? She doesn't know. Neither do I.\n  Yanira's situation is not isolated. There are Yaniras living in \nMinnesota, in Ohio, in New York and Mississippi. They are here legally \nbut will not receive SSI until they become U.S. citizens. Many of them \nare elderly and cannot work and considering their age, learn all that \nis necessary to become citizens. They will be denied benefits for the \nrest of their lives.\n  Gladys has lived in the United States for 40 years, working as a \nnanny--caring for children in our Nation. Though she paid taxes and \nfollowed all the rules of the United States, she will lose her SSI \nbenefits in July. She does have the option of struggling through forms \nand tests to become a citizen. Sounds like a good option until you \nrealize: Gladys is 105 years old, blind and housebound. Gladys spent a \ngood share of her times caring for and nurturing our children. She now \nneeds the same.\n  Lucrecia has lived here for 17 years. For 8 of them, she labored in a \nfactory, assembling artificial Christmas trees. At 75, facing the loss \nof her sole means of support, Lucrecia is desperate.\n  Rose, a 92-year-old, came from Lebanon 76 years ago. She has lived in \na nursing home for the past 30 years. She has dementia. In December, \nshe received a letter from the Government. The letter said, in essence, \nRose had been shirking her responsibilities and she will no longer \nreceive her benefits that support her stay in a nursing home. She can't \nspeak for herself. I think we should speak for her. We should send the \nmessage that this is unacceptable. We must not let this happen to Rose.\n  During my many visits with communities in Minnesota and while talking \nwith folks here, I have never seen more fear in the faces of so many \npeople, so many good people, people who came to this country and \nfollowed the rules. I hear stories every day of people so full of fear \nthat they take their own lives.\n  The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity and Reconciliation \nAct has abjured the contributions the legal immigrants like Yanira have \nmade to our economic livelihood. I ask, How will their contributions be \nrewarded? Taxation without benefits is morally wrong.\n  Last year, we discussed and debated the merits and failings of the \nwelfare reform law. As you know, I voted against it. I did not vote \nagainst it because I am against people working, people contributing to \nour country. I did not vote against it because I am against paychecks \nreplacing welfare checks. I voted against it because I am against \npushing the unemployable into poverty. I am talking about benefits for \nthe disabled and elderly immigrants in our country. On April 1, we will \nsee the first trickle in the torrent of suffering that this bill will \ninflict on our Nation's most vulnerable.\n  Around this time last year, we heard testimony from Robert Rector of \nthe Heritage Foundation that ``welfare is becoming a way of life for \nelderly immigrants.'' A picture was painted depicting newly arrived \nimmigrants being picked up by a sponsor at the airport and driven in a \nCadillac directly to the welfare office to sign up for benefits such as \nSSI and food stamps. While I will not argue with you that there has \nbeen some abuse, I think this assertion is absurd.\n  Last year, Robert Rector also testified that ``the presence of large \nnumbers of elderly immigrants on welfare is a violation of the spirit, \narguably, the letter, of U.S. immigration law.'' I beg to differ. This \ncountry was based on the dignity of the human spirit, fairness and \nequity. The spirit of this country is to give voice to the voiceless, \nto care for the elderly and to nurture the children.\n  When we talk about reform, we should focus on change for the better, \nimprovements to the system, revisions on our mistakes. When we talk of \nreform, we should not be discussing more people in hunger, more people \nwho are homeless, more people in poverty. That is what this ``reform'' \nhas led to.\n  People who supported the welfare reform bill said they ``responded to \nthe wishes of the American people and put an end to the widespread use \nand abuse of our welfare system.'' I am asking you now to respond to \nthe voice of the American people. A recent nationwide L.A. Times poll \nfound that 56 percent of the American people favor restoring cuts to \nlegal immigrants. Not too long ago, several Republican Governors were \nhere. They are already anticipating the effects of this legislation. \nThe American people do not want people like Gladys and Lucrecia left \nhungry and homeless. They want responsible, ethical government.\n  Responsible, ethical government costs money. I know that. I propose \nthat instead of taking food from our Nation's elderly and children, we \ntax oil companies, we tax tobacco companies, we tax pharmaceutical \ncompanies. Why should wealthy corporations flourish and benefit from \nour policies while hardworking, law abiding people go hungry? This is \nnot reform. This is a sham. Furthermore, it is shameful.\n  People like Gladys and Lucrecia don't have high-paid lobbyists. \nPrivileged industries avoid paying their fair share of taxes because of \nthe efforts of lobbyists. I propose that we take away the privileges of \nthe wealthy and provide necessities for the poor.\n  Today, I am imploring you to look beyond politics and look beyond \npolls and see the faces and hear the stories that this reform will \nportend. This is no longer a political issue. This is an issue \nconcerning humanity. To disregard this population, to turn our backs on \nthose who are so vulnerable is disgraceful and dishonorable. Tonight, \nyou know where you are sleeping. Tonight, you know what you will eat. \nSoon, Gladys and Lucrecia will not be able to say the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 480\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title IV of the Personal Responsibility \n     and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-193;\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\n     110 Stat. 2260-2277), as amended by title V of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-208; 110 Stat. 3009-1772-3009-1803), is \n     repealed.\n       (b) Notice and Redetermination.--Not later than 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, any Federal or State \n     official responsible for the administration of a Federally \n

COMMANDMENTS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Shelby) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 13\n\n       Whereas Judge Roy S. Moore, a lifelong resident of Etowah \n     County, Alabama, graduate of the United States Military \n     Academy with distinguished service to his country in Vietnam, \n     and graduate of the University of Alabama School of Law, has \n     served his country and his community with uncommon \n     distinction;\n       Whereas another circuit judge in Alabama, has ordered Judge \n     Moore to remove a copy of the Ten Commandments posted in his \n     courtroom and the Alabama Supreme Court has granted a stay to \n     review the matter;\n       Whereas the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact \n     on the development of the fundamental legal principles of \n     Western Civilization; and\n       Whereas the Ten Commandments set forth a code of moral \n     conduct, observance of which is universally acknowledged to \n     promote respect for our system of laws and the good of \n     society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Ten Commandments are a declaration of fundamental \n     principles that are the cornerstones of a fair and just \n     society; and\n       (2) the public display, including display in government \n     offices and courthouses, of the Ten Commandments should be \n     permitted.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to send a resolution to the desk \non behalf of myself and my home state colleague Senator Shelby.\n  Mr. President, this concurrent resolution we are introducing today \nexpresses the sense of the Congress that the display of the Ten \nCommandments in government offices and courthouses should be permitted. \nThis resolution is identical to House Concurrent Resolution 31, \nsponsored by my good friend, Representative Aderholt, which passed the \nHouse of Representatives on March 5, 295 to 125.\n  The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. This resolution does \nnot endorse any one religion but, rather, states that a religious \nsymbol which has deep-rooted significance for our Nation and its \nhistory should not be excluded from public display.\n  Mr. President, the Founders wisely realized that in a free society, \nit is imperative that individuals practice forbearance, respect, and \ntemperance. These are the very values taught by all the world's major \nreligions. The Founders devised a Constitution that depended on \nreligion serving as a civilizing force in societal life. John Adams, \nour second President, and one of the intellectual forces behind the \nformation of our Nation, said that ``our Constitution was designed for \na moral and religious people only. It is wholly inadequate to any \nother.''\n  But strangely today, there are those who seem determined to drive all \ntrace of religion from the public sphere. They ignore the religious \ntraditions on which this great Nation was founded and work to drive \nreligion and religious people out of public life.\n  Many of my colleagues are aware Judge Roy Moore, circuit court judge \nin Gadsden, AL, has been ordered to take down a two-plaque replica of \nthe Ten Commandments displayed in his courtroom.\n  The irrationality of the action is highlighted by the fact that the \njudge's display is consistent with other displays involving religious \nsymbols and art in our public property. In fact, a door to the U.S. \nSupreme Court bears two tablets numbered one to ten, which we interpret \nto represent the Ten Commandments. And yet a judge in a small Alabama \ntown cannot hang a simple display of the Ten Commandments on the wall \nwithout being sued?\n  Mr. President, this resolution is not just about Judge Moore and it \nis not just about the display of the Ten Commandments in Gadsden, AL. \nThis resolution provides a good opportunity to discuss this curious \ngovernmental hostility towards the display of these plaques that are \nimportant to our law, our Nation, and our culture.\n  The Ten Commandments represent a key part of the foundation of \nwestern civilization of our legal system in America. To exclude a \ndisplay of the Ten Commandments because it suggests an establishment of \nreligion is not consistent with our national history, let alone common \nsense itself. This Nation was founded on religious traditions that are \nan integral part of the fabric of American cultural, political, and \nsocietal life.\n  Mr. President, it is time for common sense. No member of this body, \non either side of the aisle, should oppose the simple display of \ndocuments that are important to our law, to our Nation, and to our \nculture.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express support for Judge \nRoy S. Moore. Judge Moore is a judge on the circuit court of the State \nof Alabama. Judge Moore is a lifelong resident of Etowah County, a \ngraduate of the United States Military Academy, a distinguished veteran \nof the Vietnam War, and a graduate of the University of Alabama School \nof Law. Judge Moore has always and continues to serve his community, \nAlabama, and this country with distinction and principle.\n  It is because of his principles that Judge Moore has become an issue. \nTwo years ago, Judge Moore was sued by the Alabama chapter of the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union because he opened his court with a \nprayer and because he displayed the Ten Commandments over his bench. A \nlower court judge enjoined Judge Moore from praying before court \nsessions and later barred his display of the Ten Commandments. The \nSupreme Court of Alabama has since issued a stay of the order barring \ndisplay of the Ten Commandments.\n  Judge Moore has refused to acknowledge the orders which stop him from \npraying and displaying the Ten Commandments. I support Judge Moore in \nhis actions. I do not believe that his convocation prayer or the \npresence of the Ten Commandments in the courtroom violates the \nConstitution.\n  As the Members of this body well know, a prayer, said from the floor \nof this Chamber, begins every day in which the Senate is in session. \nThis practice is also followed in the House of Representatives. \nFurthermore, the Marshal of the Supreme Court, in calling each session \nto order, implores ``God {to} save the United States and this honorable \ncourt.'' It has also become a tradition for Presidents to conclude \ntheir State of the Union Addresses with the simple prayer, ``God Bless \nAmerica.'' I believe these are just a few of the many instances where \nthe Lord is invoked during civil ceremonies and occasions. I believe \nthat these examples are entirely appropriate and in line with the \nprovisions of the Constitution. I feel that our history teaches that \nthe Founding Fathers were against government making efforts to promote \nspecific religions at the expense of others. I do not think it was ever \nthe view of the Founders that the government should adopt a position of \nGodless neutrality. It is constitutional, it is traditionally \nappropriate and it is just simply right for our leaders to request the \nassistance of God in their daily deliberations.\n  I believe that Judge Moore is also correct in refusing to remove the \nTen Commandments from his courtroom. The Judge's display is consistent \nwith other displays involving religious symbols and art in or on public \nproperty. In fact, a door to the Supreme Court of the United States \nbears two tablets numbered one to ten, which I interpret to represent \nthe Ten Commandments.

Con. Res. 12) expressing the sense of \nthe Congress with respect to the collection on data on ancestry in the \ndecennial census; as follows:\n\n       In the preamble, in the fifth clause, insert ``, but is not \n     intended to be used for racial preference programs'' before \n     the colon.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as a co-\nsponsor to S. Con. Res 12. This resolution expresses the sense of the \nCongress that the decennial census should collect data on the ancestral \nbackgrounds of all Americans. Ours is a nation of immigrants, of people \nwith many different ethnic origins and backgrounds. People came here \nfrom around the world to become a part of a nation of opportunity and \nfreedom. They did not come here to forget who they are and where they \ncame from.\n  The Census Bureau has collected information on ancestry and ethnic \ncomposition in the past two decennial censuses. Thus, it collects the \nonly complete information on the ethnic makeup of the United States and \nprovides very useful data pertaining to numbers, household income, and \neducational status of Americans from numerous backgrounds. This data, \nin turn, is used by a wide variety of people and organizations in both \nthe public and the private sector--including researchers, businesses, \ncommunity organizations, ethnic institutions, and policymakers.\n  It is important to note that the ancestry data does not relate in any \nway to questions of race as defined by civil rights statutes, and \ntherefore is not utilized for preference programs. To make this point \ncrystal clear, I have offered an amendment to S. Con. Res. 12 stating \nthat this data is not intended to be used for racial preference \nprograms.\n  When the Census Bureau approaches Congress for approval of its \nrecommendations for the 2000 Census, I and my colleagues who co-\nsponsored this resolution hope that the ancestry question will be \nincluded in the recommendations and contained on the long form the \nCensus Bureau asks Americans to fill out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2570-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on commerce, science, and transportation\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 75, the Family \nHeritage Preservation Act, I urge my colleagues to support the \nimmediate passage of this measure before more family businesses and \nfarms are lost.\n  They say the only things that are certain in life are death and \ntaxes. The Government has done a perverse job of combining the two in \nthe Federal estate and gift taxes and the tax on generation-skipping \ntransfers, known as the death taxes. These are the taxes assessed on \nassets passed from one generation to another, such as family \nbusinesses, ranches, and farms. The tax rate starts at 37 percent and \nquickly rises to a whopping 55 percent, often forcing the liquidation \nof assets just to pay the tax.\n  S. 75, introduced by Senator Kyl, will repeal the death taxes. It is \nclear that these taxes do more harm than good, raising only 1 percent \nof Federal revenues but consuming 8 percent of annual savings. What's \nmore, enforcement and compliance with these taxes takes up 65 cents for \neach dollar collected. The effects of the taxes on the economy are \nequally stark: Over an 8-year period without the taxes, the gross \ndomestic product would have been $80 billion higher and 228,000 more \njobs would have been created.\n  These death taxes punish hard work and wealth accumulation and drive \nmany family businesses into the ground by forcing them to sell assets \nto pay the tax. Family farms are hit especially hard--over 90 percent \nof farms and ranches are sole proprietorships or family partnerships, \nsubjecting most to the taxes when ownership is transferred.\n  I want to note that S. 75 is endorsed by a broad range of small \nbusiness groups as well as the American Farm Bureau Federation. I thank \nSenator Kyl for his leadership on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2571-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\n\n\n                         JUDGE FRED J. BORCHARD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one \nof the iron men of our judicial system, Judge Fred J. Borchard, who has \nserved the State of Michigan for over 50 years. Judge Borchard's tenure \nmarks the longest term of service of any Michigan judge in history.\n  Judge Borchard put himself through the University of Michigan and its \nlaw school by working various full time jobs. His law practice was \npostponed while he served his country as a forward gun observer in the \nPacific theater during World War II. In 1947, he was elected municipal \njudge and in 1954, he was elected Probate Judge.\n  In 1958, Gov. G. Mennen Williams appointed Judge Borchard to the \nSaginaw circuit bench, where he served until his retirement in 1989. \nSince then, he has continued to serve Michigan by filling in for judges \naway on vacations and conferences.\n  Judge Borchard's love of law has kept him fully engaged during his \nlong service on the bench. His court was known for its courteous and \nefficient atmosphere where citizens could settle their disputes. He \nwholeheartedly believes in the ability of our legal system to make a \npositive difference in our lives. It is these traits that have made \nJudge Borchard a favorite among his colleagues, constituents and \ncontemporaries. Judge Borchard has been a leader in his community as \nwell. He has served in the University of Michigan Club, Germania of \nSaginaw, and the Kiwanis Club of Saginaw. He has served on the Board of \nDirectors of both St. Luke's Hospital and the Saginaw County Chamber of \nCommerce. He has also shown his commitment to serving others through \nthe work he has done with his church.\n  Judge Borchard was married to the late Helen Fay Honeywell for almost \n50 years, and they had four children Fred, Barb, Jim, and Sara. They \nhave carried on Judge Borchard's ideals of service to the public in \ntheir own lives. Judge Borchard has been married to Dorothy Denton for \nthe past 5 years.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in honoring Judge Fred J. \nBorchard for his 50 historic years of service to the State of \nMichigan's judicial system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2572-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, March 25, 1997, marks a special day \nfor the Greek people and for all the friends of Greece around the \nworld. It is the 176th anniversary of the day in 1821 when the people \nof Greece declared their independence from centuries of political, \nreligious and cultural repression under the Ottoman Empire. Greek \nindependence was recognized 8 years later only after a long, hard-\nfought struggle during which the people of Greece made countless \nsacrifices for their freedom.\n  Contemporary American leaders, such as James Monroe and Daniel \nWebster, recognized that the ideals of the American Revolution--\nindividual liberty, representative democracy, and personal dignity--\nwere also the foundation for Greece's declaration of independence. \nAmericans in the 1820's quickly identified with the struggle of the \nGreek patriots because they knew in their hearts that it was a \ncontinuation of their own struggle for political and religious freedom. \nThe same spirit of democracy that was born and flourished in Greece a \nthousand years ago, and which fanned the flames of the American \nrevolution, inspired the Greek patriots to persevere in their struggle \nagainst their Turkish oppressors.\n  The United States and Greece are now old friends and trusted allies. \nOur two nations and people are bound by unbreakable bonds which link us \nthrough common interests, values, and political heritage. It is clear \nthat our cherished ideals of democracy and freedom are as strong as \never and continue to inspire other countries to follow our example. One \nneed look no further than to the fledgling democracies of Eastern \nEurope and the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union to see \nthe huge impact these ideals are still having on our world as we enter \nthe 21st century.\n  Independence, of course, must be guarded vigilantly, and in the past \n176 years Greece's independence has been challenged by forces both \nexternal and internal. Therefore, even as we recognize and celebrate \nGreece's long independence today, we must also be mindful of the \nthreats which Greece faces in today's world. The ongoing dispute with \nTurkey over the islet of Imia and the Albanian Government's recent \nmilitary action near the Greek border serve as troubling reminders of \nGreece's vulnerability and the instability of the Balkan region.\n  On this, the 176th anniversary of Greek independence, let us extend \nour warmest congratulations to the people of Greece. And let us also \nrededicate America's commitment to Greece and to strengthening the \nsolidarity that exists between our two great nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2572-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ARTURO HALE\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the \nHome-Based Business Fairness Act of 1997, introduced yesterday by \nSenate Small Business Committee Chairman Bond, I rise in strong support \nof this measure and urge the Senate to approve it as soon as possible.\n  This legislation is composed of three vitally important provisions, \nand together they make this measure one of the most important the \nSenate will consider during this Congress. First, this legislation will \nincrease the health insurance deduction for self-employed individuals \nto 100 percent from the current 40 percent. Second, it will restore the \nhome-office tax deduction where a taxpayer performs essential business \nfunctions in a home office used exclusively for business purposes. \nFinally, it will clarify when a worker is an employee versus an \nindependent contractor, removing the uncertainty of the IRS's current \ntest which can hit small businesses retroactively with liability for \nback taxes, interest, and penalties. These measures are especially \nimportant in Montana, where 98 percent of our businesses are small \nbusinesses, accounting for 72.7 percent of all employment in our State. \nThis 72 percent is considerably higher than the 53 percent for the \nUnited States as a whole. And we're growing: Montana leads the Nation \nin new business incorporations. So when we talk about small business \nissues such as the home-office tax deduction, the health insurance \ndeduction for the self-employed, the independent contractor \nclassification, and other issues, these are the issues affecting \nMontana businesses.\n  Many of today's workers spend part of their time working at home, \noften performing administrative duties such as billing. These workers \neither have no permanent office or perform their main duties in an \nunconventional environment, such as an operating room. For them, the \nwork performed in a home office is an essential part of their job, even \nthough it may not be the main part of their job. Back in 1993, the \nSupreme Court in Commissioner versus Soliman created a restrictive test \nfor determining eligible home-based functions. Functions such as \nbilling, though essential, do not meet the Soliman test. The Court went \nwell beyond congressional intent and even beyond the IRS's own \ninterpretation of the law.\n  Shortly after the Soliman decision, I introduced the Home Office Tax \nDeduction Bill, and I've been pushing for it\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\never since. We must allow a tax deduction for essential activities, \nsuch as billing, performed in the home when that is the only available \nplace for such activities. As the law now stands, workers like Dr. \nSoliman who spend 15 hours per week doing billing in an exclusive home \noffice are denied the deduction. That's not right. Home offices that \nare used regularly and solely for business purposes--whether it's by \nphysicians, salespeople, or mothers working at home--should be an \nallowable deduction. I am proud to be a cosponsor of Sen. Hatch's bill \nwhich, like this bill, will restore the deduction for essential \nfunctions.\n  I was very pleased that last Congress we enacted an increase in the \nhealth insurance tax deduction for the self-employed to 80 percent by \n2006. This is a positive first step, but why should not small \nbusinesses receive a 100 percent deduction just like big businesses? \nHealth care costs are one of the main barriers to successful self-run \nbusinesses, and this modest proposal will go a long way toward helping \nthese businesses survive and thrive.\n  Finally, the top priority of small businesses is clarification of the \nindependent contractor definition. The current 20-part test used by the \nIRS to determine who is an employee, for which, of course, employers \nmust pay Federal taxes, is confusing and imprecise. The law is tough to \nfollow when it is unpredictable from case to case. This bill simply \nclarifies who is an independent contractor by applying a clear three-\npart test. Businesspeople need a simple rule to follow, and this will \nprovide it. No business should be subject to the whim of the IRS.\n  I thank Chairman Bond for his leadership on this bill and I look \nforward to working with him to get it to the President's desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2572-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING NORTHWEST NAZARENE COLLEGE'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise with great pride today \nto pay tribute to an outstanding group of young women who have reached \nthe pinnacle of their sport. Northwest Nazarene College's women's \nbasketball team last night won its first-ever national title. The Lady \nCrusaders beat Black Hills State 64-46 to claim the National \nAssociation of Intercollegiate Athletics Division 2 tournament \nchampionship. It was the school's first national championship in any \nsport.\n  NNC, located in Nampa, ID, is one of America's finest colleges. It \nconsistently ranks among the top schools in academic national rankings. \nNow it proudly sits at the top in athletic rankings as well.\n  Coach Roger Schmidt's Lady Crusaders entered the 1996-97 season \nranked 11th in the country. The team finished the season with the most \nwins in school history at 27-7, and also won the Cascade Collegiate \nConference title.\n  In the national championship game, NNC broke open a tight contest and \npulled away to claim the trophy. It was just 25-24 at halftime, but a \npressing and aggressive Crusader defense did the trick and helped \nclinch the game.\n  Staci Wilson paced the NNC attack, with 22 points. She also was the \nleading rebounder with 13. Erica Walton scored 12 points, and was named \nthe tournament's most valuable player. Kari Smith added 11 points for \nthe Lady Crusaders.\n  Mr. President, I'm pleased to say that seven of the 12 players on the \nNorthwest Nazarene College roster are Idahoans. Here is the roster of \nthis outstanding team: Christy Farrar of Hillsboro, OR; Jessica \nKnowlton of Craigmont, ID; Jennifer Myers of Parma, ID; Kimberly Riggs \nof Boise, ID; Brooke Warren of Pomeroy, Washington; Kari Smith of \nMeridian, ID; Ellen Duncan of McCall, ID; Chelsey Hall of Grangeville, \nID; Staci Wilson of Molalla, OR; Staci Kirk of Boise, ID; Sunshine \nCecrle of Hillsboro, OR; and Erica Walton of Ontario, OR.\n  I also congratulate the head coach, Roger Schmidt, and his assistant \ncoaches, Becky Nichols and Duane Slemmer. And my congratulations also \ngo to NNC President Dr. Richard Hagood and Athletic Director Eric \nForseth.\n  I am sure all Idahoans join me in proudly recognizing the \naccomplishments of these young women and the support of the students, \nfaculty, staff, alumni, and community at Northwest Nazarene College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2573-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OLDER AMERICANS FREEDOM TO WORK ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to commend the majority \nleader for reintroducing the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act, S. \n202, which I recently have cosponsored. This bill will repeal the \nSocial Security earnings limitation, which punishes seniors between the \nages of 65 and 69 for working. That's right--for working.\n  The earnings limit, like so many other Government policies, is \noutdated. Back in the 1930's, it may have made sense to encourage older \nworkers to leave the work force by reducing their Social Security \nbenefits if they worked beyond age 65. But today, the opposite is true: \nWith the baby boomers getting ready to retire, and with a higher life \nexpectancy, we should be encouraging folks to work longer. Most \nimportant, workers should have the freedom to work longer if they want \nto.\n  Last year, after a long-fought effort by Majority Leader Lott and \nmany others, we enacted a gradual increase in the earnings limit from \n$13,500 today to $30,000 per year in 2002. That is, for seniors between \nthe ages of 65 and 69, each $3 earned over $30,000 per year reduces the \nworker's Social Security benefits by $1. While this increase is \ncertainly helpful, there is no sound reason for retaining any earnings \nlimitation on seniors who continue to work. That's why this bill is so \nimportant. Let's not discourage seniors from working--let's guarantee \ntheir freedom to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/19/senate-section/article/S2573-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 APPOINTMENTS BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
